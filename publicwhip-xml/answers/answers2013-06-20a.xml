The profiling of monthly cash drawdown requirements from annual capital allocations is essentially an administrative exercise.</p><p>  It is important to note that capital spending has general characteristics which influence the allocation drawdown pattern. Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year. Obviously, this affects the phasing and profiling of capital expenditure.  In addition, public financial rules require that payments are only made on foot of matured liabilities, so payments are made on foot of work that has already been satisfactorily completed.</p><p>  An overall variance from the capital expenditure profile of between 10% and 12% is not unusual and within that variance there can be variations in spending patterns between Departments with some ahead of target.  Departments have indicated that they do not expect any significant savings by year end and so expenditure is expected to return to profile at that stage.</p><p>All Departments are required to report to my Department on a monthly basis in relation to their actual expenditure (both capital and current) compared with their published profiles and to explain variances where they arise. My officials liaise with Departments to ensure that any issues are addressed promptly in order that there are no expenditure overruns and, in relation to capital expenditure, that projects and programmes are progressed in a timely manner. I am happy that the arrangements for monitoring capital expenditure which are in place are effective and robust.</p></reply>

Co. that they carried out emergency works including the construction of a berm at Vesey Park to prevent the river bursting its banks onto the Adamstown Road. Two engineering reports in 2001 commissioned by them on the 2000 flood event recommended the upgrading of the river channel and bridges on the Griffeen River to provide conveyance capacity for the 100-year flood event. These works were completed in 2004 at a cost of &euro;5m.  </p><p>  The Council, in association with Chartridge Ltd, the developers of the Adamstown SDZ lands, also completed a scheme in August 2009 to alleviate flooding in the Tubber Lane area. This consisted of works in the Tubbermaclugg Stream, the provision of an attenuation pond and upgrading of culverts and pipework.   The scheme which is designed to protect against the 100 year flood event cost &euro;7.7m and the costs were shared by the Council and Chartridge Ltd.   </p><p>  The significant works that have been carried out have been successful in that no house has been flooded by river water in Lucan since 2000.</p><p>  The area from Lucan through to Chapelizod is an Area for Further Assessment (AFA) in the Eastern Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study which is being carried out by RPS Consultants. The rivers Liffey and Griffeen are High Priority Watercourses through the AFA. Draft flood mapping for the Eastern CFRAM Study will be made available in late 2013, with the Flood Risk Management Plan being available in late 2015. </p><p>  The River Camac is a High Priority Watercourse in the Eastern CFRAM Study through Clondalkin.  Following the October 2011 flood event, the OPW, following discussions with South Dublin County Council and Dublin City Council, requested RPS consultants to prioritise the assessment under the CFRAM of the Camac and Poddle catchments.  This work has been progressed to the point where draft flood mapping and any identified viable options are being made available for public consultation in the week beginning on 24 June 2013.  Advertisements have been placed in local papers, and I would strongly urge members of the public to attend these events and give their views.</p><p>In relation to flooding events in the past 10 years, I would suggest that the information is publicly available on the OPW website .  The Lucan and Clondalkin areas were affected by flooding arising from the intense rainfall event that occurred in the Dublin and Eastern region on 24 October 2011. This was a pluvial rather than a river based event and it affected primarily industrial property and roads in the areas.  Apart from the Oct 2011 event, the only other flood event recorded on the<i> floodmaps.ie</i>   website was one in October 2004 affecting Luttrellstown Golf Club.</p><p>  I am aware of the problems some homeowners in Lucan and Clondalkin have been experiencing in relation to flood insurance cover.  This is occurring in other areas of the country also.   I have made it clear on many occasions that where the State, through the OPW or the local authorities, has completed flood defence works in an area, then those works should be taken into account by the insurance companies when assessing properties in those areas for flood insurance cover.   For this reason I initiated discussions with the insurance industry with a view to establishing a system for providing information to the insurance companies on all completed OPW flood defence schemes.   A Working Group comprising of  officials of the OPW, Insure Ireland (formerly the Irish Insurance Federation) and representatives of the main household insurance companies has been engaged in discussions over the last six months to reach agreement on a basis for providing this information. The Working Group is very near completion of its work.   I expect that an agreement with the insurance industry in this regard will be a clear positive step to address the problems which some householders are experiencing.  The focus of the Working Group initially has been on completed OPW flood defence schemes but it will be addressing completed local authority works in the near future.   It is important to bear in mind that while the insurance companies may agree to take the information on completed flood defence schemes into account, ultimately, it is a commercial decision on the part of the companies as to whether they offer flood cover and at what price.</p><p>  I would point out also that the CFRAM process will produce a significant amount of information in relation to flood risk which will be available to the insurance industry also and will enable the industry to take decisions on the provision of cover based on the fullest possible assessment of that risk.</p><p>  Those having difficulty with flood insurance cover can direct queries and complaints in this regard through Insurance Ireland's free Insurance Information Service. </p></reply>

    <ques id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-20a.13.q" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013062000062#WRA00900"><p><i>14.</i> To ask the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform the number of jobs that have been created from the July 2012 stimulus plan to date in 2013; the number of jobs that will be created from the plan by the end of 2013 and 2014. <b>[29658/13]</b></p></ques>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-20a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013062000062#WRA01000"><p>On the 17th of July 2012, the Government announced its plans for an additional &euro;2.25 billion investment in public infrastructure projects in Ireland. The most important contribution capital investment can now make is in providing the capacity for the economy to grow, which will in turn create employment. </p><p>  As the Deputy will recall, the stimulus package included &euro;1.4 billion to fund the proposed new Public Private Partnerships (PPP) programme and the delivery of this was the initial focus for my Department.  This &euro;1.4 billion investment is additional to the direct investment by the exchequer in infrastructure which will be some &euro;3.4 billion in 2013. </p><p>  Job creation is a critical priority for Government. Investment in the projects included in the Stimulus package is expected to generate significant numbers of jobs spread out across the country. Analysis of each sector indicates that the investment in the PPP Pipeline should generate around 13,000 direct jobs and many more indirect jobs. It will also create much needed social and economic infrastructure and aid economic recovery.   In recent weeks, as a follow on to last year's package, I announced an additional Exchequer investment of &euro;150m to fund school building projects, local and regional road maintenance and retrofitting of Local Authority housing. These projects involve mostly smaller scale capital works which are known to be labour intensive. It is envisaged that this additional Exchequer investment can support in the region of 3,000 jobs over the period of the roll-out. </p><p>  NDFA issued tenders for the schools bundles in May. The tender for the Primary Care Centres Bundle is expected to be issued in August followed by the Grangegorman tender in September.   The NRA published the contract notice for the N25 New Ross Bypass in March.  The return date for pre-qualification submissions was 19th June and the NRA has reported that five submissions were received.  The NRA will now proceed with the evaluation of the pre-qualification submissions received.  It is planned to announce the shortlisted consortia to proceed to the tender stage in July/August. The next road tender will issue in the coming months.   </p><p>  As part of the on-going monitoring of employment on current PPPs, the latest figures from the Schools Bundle 3 indicate 600 full time equivalent jobs engaged for the period to end May.   We will also be monitoring the level of employment being created during the construction of the N11/Newlands Cross PPP which commenced in the past few weeks.    </p><p>  The preparatory work for the PPP projects is well underway in the various Departments and Agencies. At this early stage in the process, most of the employment impact has been in the technical and advisory areas. </p><p>  The NDFA estimated that approximately 155 jobs have been created to date by technical, legal, and insurance advisors and design teams spread across all projects. Some projects such as the new DIT Grangegorman project have already seen significant employment impact where a team of 40 architects, engineers, quantity surveyors and other specialists are already in place. Similarly in relation to the schools and primary care centres, a number of technical advisors and design teams are in place. </p><p>  Further appointments are pending and employment benefits will be evident as the projects progress through the tendering phase and construction gets underway. The indicative timetable for the projects suggests construction is expected to commence on the first roads project by the end of 2013 and on the accommodation projects by Q4 2014.  </p><p>  My Department together with the NDFA and the Sponsoring Authorities are also looking at how to maximise job creation as part of each tender competition that is in line with procurement regulations. With the NDFA, we are also examining ways to encourage SME participation by facilitating access to the programme and the NDFA is working with Enterprise Ireland to organise awareness raising events for SMEs, one of which was held last week.</p><p>The projects identified for delivery through the additional &euro;150m Exchequer funding will begin to be rolled out over the summer. While this additional funding was only recently announced, I expect that it will have an immediate impact as most of the preparation work for the relevant projects is already well advanced.   <i></i></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-20a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013062000062#WRA01200"><p>As the Deputy is aware this Government is committed to developing a leaner, more efficient Public Service. To this end, we agreed on 2 October 2012 to accelerate the reduction in Public Service numbers in order to achieve the previous end 2015 target of 282,500 by end 2014 instead. Greater efficiencies in the way the Public Service is going about its business means that some posts have been identified by Departments as surplus.  Where surplus staff cannot be redeployed, Voluntary Redundancy can be used. There is not a general voluntary redundancy scheme in the Public Service; it is progressing on a targeted basis where it makes sense and can be shown to offer value for money in the long run.</p><p>  Initially Voluntary Redundancy is being rolled out in three areas - the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and specific parts of the Health and Education Sectors.  These Departments estimated at the time the matter was being considered that there would be scope to effect about 2,000 exits from these areas over time, mainly from back office and support areas and management and administrative grades.  </p><p>  Last month the Department of Health issued a circular to the HSE authorising the introduction of a Targeted Voluntary Redundancy Scheme funded by the HSE from within existing resources.   </p><p>  With regard to the Education Sector, some very limited targeted voluntary redundancies have taken place and further areas are under consideration.</p><p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is facilitating the redeployment of staff to other Departments and agencies where there is a current demand for additional resources and once this programme of redeployments is completed it will finalise the business case for its voluntary redundancy scheme, which will specify posts and locations to be targeted.</p><p>  Voluntary Redundancy may be used as a lever for facilitating organisational change in those areas of the Public Service where surplus staff cannot be reassigned within their Department/Sector.  Each Department must submit a detailed business case to my Department prior to sanction being considered.</p><p>  Voluntary redundancy will contribute to the overall reduction in public service numbers which are collated on a quarterly basis by my Department.</p><p>  The intention is that voluntary redundancy is only to be used where there is no other realistic option, such as redeploying or retraining existing staff. It was always intended to be relatively small scale and targeted. It is a response to business needs rather than an open general scheme. One would expect that there will be increased take up as we move along and sectoral managers progress reform and restructuring initiatives.</p><p>  What sectors/areas/Departments/agencies will be targeted for redundancies?</p><p>  It is open for any Department / Sector of the Public Service to put forward proposals, backed by a sound business case, to introduce VR in their particular areas.  In order to proceed Departments have to submit a detailed business case to my Department - including the purpose, the reform and workforce planning context, the cost and savings - before sanction  to proceed is given. In considering the business case, the cost to the Exchequer is assessed and factored into affordability decisions on a case-by-case basis.  </p><p>  How much will the redundancies cost and where will the funds come from?</p><p>  Analysis by my Department estimates that for every 1,000 employees who opt to participate in a voluntary redundancy programme there will be a gross cost of approximately &euro;109 million.   The gross payroll savings for 1,000 employees will amount to &euro;57 million every year.  Therefore the initial cost of 1,000 employees leaving would be recouped in two years. Further savings will be realised in the future when these employees reach retirement age, because of their reduced pension entitlements. </p><p>  Final decisions on numbers reductions to be achieved in each sector will take account of the surpluses identified by Ministers in respect of their portfolios and of expected rates of retirements in those sectors, Departments and Offices over the next few years.  In addition the grades and service profiles of staff will need to be ascertained.  This will determine the eventual costs.   It is proposed that redundancy costs of this scheme will be borne, in the first instance, by the relevant Departments within existing resources.  </p><p>  What are the terms of the Redundancy scheme?</p><p>  The terms of VR will be in accordance with the Collective Agreement with the Public Service Committee of ICTU on Redundancy Payments to Public Servants.  The redundancy payment consists of an ex gratia payment of 3 weeks' pay per year of service plus statutory redundancy under the Redundancy Payments Acts, subject to an overall limit of:</p><p>(i)  2 years' pay; or, if less</p><p>(ii) one-half of the salary payable to preserved pension age</p><p>  Voluntary redundancy is allowed for under the terms of the Public Service Agreement (Croke Park). </p><p>  What is the target number of redundancies under the scheme announced in October 2012?</p><p>  It is estimated that the currently proposed schemes (Health, Agriculture and Education sectors) will result in some 2,000 exits from these areas. There is no pre-defined target. Each case will be assessed on merit as to whether it is affordable and meets VFM criteria.</p><p>  When did the scheme commence and when will the first staff depart?</p><p>  Voluntary Redundancy was agreed by Government as a means of managing those situations where staff cannot be redeployed. Rather than being a general scheme of voluntary redundancy across the Public Service, VR is being introduced on a rolling basis where Departments and Agencies identify surplus staff, put forward a business case and receive sanction from my Department to use VR as a tool in implementing restructuring and reform.  </p><p>  Will staff be forced to take this Redundancy Scheme? Is this not compulsory redundancy?</p><p>  This scheme is a voluntary redundancy scheme. The Department/employer may invite individuals who are surplus and work in targeted areas / positions to apply for voluntary redundancy.  It is entirely a voluntary decision for the individual as to whether or not to apply or accept such an offer. </p><p>  Will frontline services be protected/how will managers ensure the ongoing business needs of Departments/agencies are met?</p><p>  There will be no automatic right to redundancy and all applications will be subject to ongoing business needs. Skills needs and the priorities of Departments will be central considerations when assessing applications. All areas of the Public Service will be required to implement the redeployment arrangements set out in the Public Service Agreement thereby ensuring frontline and critical services are maintained to the highest standards.</p><p>  Will any of the posts vacated by redundancy be filled by new staff coming in?</p><p>In line with the Government's policy of creating a leaner more efficient Public Service and to facilitate structural reform, staff departing under the voluntary scheme will not be replaced. Service levels will be maintained via reorganisation and implementation of the redeployment arrangements set out in the Public Service Agreement.  However in order to take account of the ongoing reform programme in the public service, it will always be necessary to have an ongoing level of recruitment into different parts of the public service.  <i></i></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-20a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013062000062#WRA01400"><p>Under EU law, public contracts above a certain value must be advertised EU-wide and awarded to the most competitive tender in an open and objective process.  The aim is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime that delivers value for money.  It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour, or discriminate against, particular candidates on grounds of location or nationality and there are legal remedies that may be used against any public body infringing these rules.</p><p>  Reform of public procurement is one of the major projects of key strategic importance in the Government&rsquo;s Public Service Reform Plan, which was published in November 2011.  Procurement of supplies and services accounts for around &euro;9 billion of current spending by the State per annum.  This represents a very significant portion of overall spending and it is, therefore, essential that the Public Service achieves maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement.</p><p>  The National Procurement Service (NPS) has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service&rsquo;s buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service.  In establishing these arrangements the NPS is particularly mindful of the provisions of Dept of Finance Circular 10/10 that seeks to remove any potential barriers to the participation of SMEs in the public service procurement process.  These provisions include the need for proportionality, reduced administration (paperwork), the open advertising of all contracts over the value of &euro;25,000 etc.  In the case of printing the National Procurement Service has also established a panel of printers from which public bodies can easily access printing services. It is also the policy of the NPS to only aggregate contracts where it is apparent that such a strategy could yield optimum results.  In a situation where it is deemed more appropriate to bring smaller contracts individually to the market, without recourse to European competition, then this is the strategy pursued. This later approach can offer better opportunities for local suppliers to compete. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that all current NPS contracts for printing services are with Irish-based printers.</p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.

Within my remit at the Office of Public Works, I am responsible for National Monuments in State care and I will confine my remarks to this portfolio in particular.</p><p>  The National Monuments Service of the Office of Public Works in responsible for approx. 780 National Monument sites in State care.   The majority of these sites is State owned and therefore fall completely under the protections of the National Monuments Acts.  However a number are privately owned and the OPW has Guardianship arrangements in place  in respect of these sites so that they can be afforded a similar level of protection.</p><p>  On the ground, these properties are safeguarded by a network of 6 National Monuments Depots located around the country in Meath, Kilkenny, Cork, Kerry, Galway and Leitrim, and staff at these locations, together with a number of others in various sub-depots, provide the immediate response in terms of affording protection to National Monument sites.   This cohort is responsible therefore for protecting National Monuments, performing various maintenance tasks and mounting larger conservation projects when appropriate.   A key role is also occupied by the Department of Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht, which has responsibility for overarching matters of policy relating to Heritage and provides a key professional Archaeological input into the protection regime at sites.  The Department is often therefore joined with the OPW in the first line of defence for Heritage sites under threat.   Additionally, the Minister for AHG and his Department is responsible for providing consent to allow works to be carried out at or in the vicinity of National Monuments, either by the OPW themselves or by others and this is a key function in providing clarity about who may work legally at a National Monument.</p><p>  The number of sites in State care is, clearly, quite significant and the challenge of ensuring that all sites are protected from adverse activity is a considerable one, particularly given that most are unattended by staff for a majority of the time.   Physically, the list is comprised of a huge range of types of structures including historic houses, ancient castles, Abbeys, Churches, megalithic burial and settlement sites, protected landscapes, battle sites, high crosses and other carved stones and a wide range of field monuments dotted around the country.   Geographically, the various sites and monuments are located in widely dispersed areas which are, in some cases easy to access and in others, physically remote.   OPW National Monuments staff regularly inspect sites to make sure they are not under threat and assess the need for small works from time to time.   In fact, the Deputy may recall the recent case where a Church font went missing from a National Monument site at Rathmore in Co. Meath.   The taking of this object was first noted in fact as a result of a routine OPW staff inspection.   Happily, that incident concluded satisfactorily and the item was sucessfully recovered, but it is noteworthy I think that the initial prompt action of OPW staff resulted in a very fast response by the Department of AHG and other relevant agencies,  in cooperation with An Garda Sioch&aacute;na.   It is also interesting to note that the site in question is under Guardianship rather than ownership and that this did not affect the rigour of the protection or the speed of the response.</p><p>  Although the Rathmore incident ended happily, it does, I think, serve to illustrate the risks to our important heritage sites from unauthorised activity.   There is clearly a dilemma involved in publicising the wonderful heritage that we have and at the same time allowing access to individuals who, through either ill intent or a lack of knowledge, may cause damage.   Given the number and geographic spread of sites, the dangers involved cannot all be monitored all of the time and the OPW National Monuments Service depend on local people in all parts of the country to help keep a watch on sites and bring to the OPW's or the Department's attention any problem issues.   Where unauthorised activity occurs, the measures contained in the various National Monuments Acts will apply.   The sanctions set out in the Acts are significant and, with the input of the Department of AHG, provide a serious deterrent and a strong level of legal protection to sites under risk.   Notwithstanding this, my colleague the Minister for Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht has a new National Monuments Amendment Act in preparation which he will bring to the House in due course to further update legislation in this area.</p><p>  Having regard to the importance of our National Heritage to both our cultural identity and as a part of the rich fabric of our nation, it is clear that its protection must be of continuing importance.   There are, clearly, challenges in terms of the size of the portfolio and the amount of resources available to the Office of Public Works;  however, I am generally happy that the OPW, in concert with colleagues in the Department of AHG and with the input and cooperation of interested local people and groups in all parts of the country, can continue to provide an effective response to this issue.</p></reply>

Departments will initially meet costs associated with these projects from within their existing budgets on the basis that they will be reimbursed for moneys spent in 2013 once proceeds from State asset sales and from the National Lottery Licence are realised towards the end of the year. While it is difficult to predict the exact quantum of funding which will be spent in 2013, it is expected to be in the region of &euro;70m with the remainder being spent in 2014 and a small element in 2015. </p><p>  The funding has already been allocated to specific projects and these were identified in the announcement made earlier this month. More details regarding specific projects are available from the relevant Departments. All of the projects to be funded through this package are capital projects.</p><p>The additional Exchequer funding has been targeted towards smaller scale capital works mainly aimed at maintaining or improving existing assets. As well as maintaining our assets, the works proposed are known to be labour intensive, will help create jobs and will be spread throughout local communities. Minor works tend to be more labour intensive than major new build projects with figures rising in some instances to 17-19 jobs created per &euro;1m expenditure. It is expected that this additional Exchequer funding can support in the region of 3,000 jobs over the period of the roll-out. This is on top of the estimated 13,000 jobs which will be supported through the new PPP Programme which I announced last July.  <i></i></p></reply>

The 2004 Act established the Commission for Public Service Appointments (CPSA) and the Public Appointments Service (PAS). The CPSA is the regulator of public service recruitment in Ireland and the PAS provides a centralised recruitment, assessment and selection body for the Civil Service.  </p><p>  The CPSA has developed codes of practice to apply to open recruitment and internal promotion competitions. The codes cover the areas of probity, selection on the basis of merit, equity and fairness, protection of the public interest, implementation of best practice and good governance. </p><p>  Departments and Offices may also apply to the CPSA for a recruitment licence under which they may conduct open recruitment competitions in compliance with the Codes. </p><p>  Not all positions in the Civil Service are filled by open recruitment. Posts in the Civil Service are filled in a variety of ways including open recruitment, promotion, transfer or redeployment. </p><p>  Recruitment and selection competitions in the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission are covered by the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004 except where they are specifically excluded. The same procedures applying to recruitment processes in Departments and Offices also apply in the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission for the positions covered by the 2004 Act.  Such competitions are conducted in accordance with the Commission for Public Service Appointments (CPSA) Guidelines on Recruitment, and are subject to audit by the CPSA. </p><p>  Section 7(i) (d) of the 2004 Act excludes appointment to the position of an officer in the House of the Oireachtas from the provisions of the Act. Under the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act 1959 there are six officers of the House positions - Clerk and Clerk-Assistant of each House, Superintendent and Captain of the Guard.  However, the termination of that exclusion is under active consideration at present.</p><p>I am assuming that where the Deputy asks about direct appointments by Government he is referring to posts filled subsequent to a competition run by the Top Level Appointments Committee (TLAC). The posts in question are civil service posts at Secretary General, Deputy Secretary and Assistant Secretary and equivalent levels.  Since early 2007 the policy has been that open recruitment competitions are held for Assistant Secretary, Deputy Secretary and equivalent posts and more recently this policy has been extended to all Secretary General posts.  <i></i></p></reply>

Gross Gaming Revenues are defined as the level of sales <i>less</i> the amount deducted for prizes. The current licence does not have a specific formula in place for Good Causes - the level of contribution is the amount which remains when prizes and costs are deducted from the value of total sales.  </p><p>  An Post National Lottery Company recently published its Annual Report and Accounts for 2012.  Total sales recorded by the Company in 2012 amounted to approximately 735m euro while the funds allocated to prizes amounted to 406m euro.   Gross Gaming Revenues would therefore be equal to approximately 329m euro and 65% of that figure is around 214m euro. The actual contribution to Good Causes in 2012 was 225m euro.  </p><p>  However, I must stress that using this type of comparison as a guide to anticipating future revenues for Good Causes would be somewhat misleading. For example, under existing arrangements National Lottery sales have fallen and there is less money available for Good Causes.  Under the next licence, a competition for which is currently taking place, the National Lottery operator will be better placed to reverse this trend and boost the level of sales of National Lottery tickets.  This increase will be facilitated by the terms of both the next licence and the National Lottery Act 2013 which will offer the holder of the next licence greater flexibility for the growth and development of lottery games and distribution channels, including interactive channels. However, it is important to emphasise that this will be achieved in a responsible manner which protects the interests of National Lottery players and ensures that the long term sustainability of the National Lottery is safeguarded.  </p><p>  I am very confident that under the new arrangements, the level of annual returns for good causes, which include sport, culture, health of the community and the natural environment, will grow significantly from the 2012 amount of 225 million euro. More worthwhile projects being funded in more places across the country will be the outcome.  </p><p>  I should also point out that the successful bidder for the next licence will make an upfront payment to the State in return for a 20 year licence to operate the National Lottery.  Part of this upfront payment will be used to fund the construction of the new National Children's Hospital.  In addition, some moneys which will accrue from the payment in respect of the National Lottery licence are being allocated to help fund Exchequer capital projects in 2013 and 2014.  </p></reply>

These guidelines set out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote the involvement of smaller enterprises in a manner that is consistent with the principles and rules of the existing public procurement regulatory regime. The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts. The key provisions of the guidance include:</p><p>- supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 or more to be advertised on the <i><font color="#0000FF">www.etenders.gov.ie</font></i>   website;</p><p>- less use of &#8220;restrictive&#8221; tendering procedures and greater use of &#8220;open&#8221; tendering; </p><p>- ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract;</p><p>- sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical.</p><p>  In relation to the duration of a tender process and its impact on SME participation, due to a wide and varied nature of supplies and services secured throughout the public service there is no maximum timeframe for tender processes. This is because the duration set by the Contracting Authority would be proportionate to the needs and complexity of the contract it relates to. However, I would dispute the Deputy's assertion that a longer procurement process is a barrier for SMEs. The longer timeframe is likely to give SMEs better access to public procurement opportunities by affording them the necessary time to form alliances and networks to ensure they can tender on a competitive basis for this work.</p><p>  The National Procurement Service (NPS), which will be transferring into the new Office of Government Procurement (OGP), is focused on developing centralised arrangements for the procurement of goods and services used commonly across the public service nationwide. The benefits arising from these central arrangements include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency; and enhanced service levels. Public bodies have always been allowed to tender for similar goods or services that are available through NPS contracts if they felt they could achieve better value.</p><p>The NPS has now put over fifty frameworks in place and these are available to hundreds of public bodies. By availing of such centralised contracts substantial administrative savings for the exchequer can be achieved.</p></reply>

These guidelines set out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote the involvement of smaller enterprises in a manner that is consistent with the principles and rules of the existing public procurement regulatory regime. The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts. The key provisions of the guidance include:</p><p>- supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 or more to be advertised on the <i><font color="#0000FF">www.etenders.gov.ie</font></i>   website;</p><p>- less use of &#8220;restrictive&#8221; tendering procedures and greater use of &#8220;open&#8221; tendering;</p><p>- ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract;</p><p>- sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical.</p><p>  In order to promote and improve such practices the National Procurement Service (NPS), which will be transferring into the new Office of Government Procurement (OGP), established its 'Working Group to assist Small and Medium Enterprises' in February 2012 to facilitate open discussion on the issue of public service  procurement. The Working Group consists of representatives from the NPS, the Health Service Executive, the Irish Business and Employers Federation, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, Chambers Ireland, and the Small Firms Association. The Group has met on a number of occasions and has raised many issues relating to procurement and particularly how these issues impact on SMEs.  Resulting from these discussions the NPS has issued two circulars to all buyers in, and suppliers to, the public service with the aim of improving practice in the procurement arena.  </p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide. Parallel with these events the NPS also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.</p><p>Circular 10/10 has been in place for just over two years. It is clear that there is a need to ensure greater consistency in relation to the implementation of this circular. In this regard, I am arranging for my Department to remind public bodies about this aspect of the public procurement guidance and the importance of contracting authorities ensuring they implement it appropriately.   <i></i></p></reply>

However those providing finance to the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) seek security which may include performance bonds as well as other financial securities.</p><p>  Previous PPP contracts which used the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) standard template Project Agreement included the provision of an &#8220;Authority Bond&#8221;.  This bond is called upon in the event that the project is terminated during construction as a result of a default by the SPV and is intended to cover the costs to the Authority of re-tendering the project.  The bond is required to be kept in place until a proportion of the works (usually about 25% of the value) is completed.  The bond is purchased by the SPV and appears as a cost to the Authority in the tender price.</p><p>  The requirement for the Authority Bond has been removed from the recently advertised Schools PPP Programme after a value-for-money assessment by the NDFA.  The NDFA is satisfied that sufficient remedy remains available under the contract to protect the State's interests in the event that the contract is terminated owing to a SPV default.  Removal of the requirement for the bond is expected to reduce tender prices.</p><p>  There are no other bonding requirements from the State within the PPP contract.  Instead, the SPV is at risk of financial deductions from the stage payments due under the PPP contract for any poor performance during the service period.  There is no proposal to alter these terms in the contract as they form an essential part of the risk-transfer mechanism.</p><p>Performance bonds are financial securities taken out by construction clients (public or private sector) to insure the contract performance against a default or breach by the contractor.  They are provided by specialist insurance companies (sureties).  In the case of a default or a breach of contract, the surety undertakes to cover <i>any additional costs</i>   up to the value of the bond incurred by the construction client in completing the project.  The premiums for the bonds are paid for by the client whereas security may be required by the surety from the contractor in addition to any premium paid.  The current cost of the premium can vary from 1.5% - 3.5% of the contract sum.</p><p>  On foot of concerns expressed by many in the industry over the difficulty in obtaining performance bonds on public works contracts, officials from my Department met with representatives of the construction industry, sureties and representatives of public sector contracting authorities in January of this year.</p><p>  During that engagement it became apparent that sureties were unwilling to continue to provide bonds at the levels traditionally sought by contracting authorities because of the increased level of insolvencies in the construction sector.  This was contributing to substantial delays and uncertainty in awarding contracts because the sureties were unable to meet the requirements set out in the tender documents which were based upon guidance set out in the Capital Works Management Framework published by my Department.</p><p>  In response to this uncertainty and having considered the options available, Circular 07/13 was issued on 1 May 2013 reducing the level of performance bonds sought on public works contracts to 12.5% for contract sums up to &euro;10 million and 10% thereafter.  Previously levels of 25% on projects up to &euro;2.5 million were sought dropping down to 12.5% and 10% on projects with a value in excess of &euro;12.7 million.</p><p>  Whilst it is expected that there will be a reduction in the cost of premiums to the State it is acknowledged that this may expose the State to greater losses in the event of insolvency due to the reduced level of bond provided.  To address this concern the Government Contracts Committee for Construction will shortly publish enhanced guidelines for the financial appraisal of works contractors to ensure that those who are awarded public works contracts have sufficient financial capacity to see a project through to completion.  Guidance will also follow later in the year on the appointment of replacement contractors to provide greater certainty to contracting authorities when insolvency occurs on a public works contract.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of the legislation is to implement the proposed pay reduction for public servants earning annual salaries of &euro;65,000 or more, and the parallel reduction in public service pensions over &euro;32,500. The legislation or the public service as an employer does not distinguish between those employees who are members or not members of unions and changes in terms and conditions are applied on a grade basis.</p><p>  Contingency measures that may be deployed to secure the necessary reductions in the public service pay and pensions bill are also included, including provision for a universal freeze on pay increments. The Act also affirms that the person, which may be a line Minister or other public service body, that has the power to determine terms and conditions of employment may exercise that power to reduce non-core rates of pay or to increase hours worked. However, under the legislation, a facility is provided for unions and representative associations to conclude collective agreements with their public service employers. Where a union has signed up to a collective agreement, now called the Haddington Road Agreement, that will avoid the need for those contingency measures to be used. </p><p>  It is a matter for public servants and their representative unions and associations to decide if they wish to conclude a collective agreement with their employers. This issue is currently subject to consideration or ballot by those unions and associations. I as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, do not intend to comment during that process.  </p><p>  With regard to those grades represented by a union who do not conclude a collective agreement under the Act, as well as the increment freeze that will apply directly under the terms of the Act, the relevant decision maker will have to take the necessary measures to meet their targeted paybill savings in 2013 and following years.</p><p>Under the Haddington Road Agreement proposals, it is proposed that for those public servants on annual salaries (inclusive of allowances in the nature of pay) above &euro;65,000 to the max of the Principal Higher Grade in the civil service or similar across the public service, the reduction in pay will be restored within a maximum of 18 months of the end of the agreement (July 2016) in two equal phases of 9 months. There are no provisions within the proposals regarding increases in pension rates on a similar basis. However, I have stated that it is my intention as a matter of priority to move towards reducing the burden of the public service pension reduction, with the initial focus on the people in receipt of low pensions, at the earliest date economic progress permits.  <i></i></p></reply>

We are bringing public expenditure back onto a sustainable path and driving forward the public service reform agenda to ensure that efficiencies and reformed work practices play a full part in contributing to the overall budgetary consolidation effort which is essential to achieving our annual deficit targets.

Those Departments that are proactive in driving reform, innovation and structural planning will naturally be best-placed to avail of this facility into the future.  Departments who exceed their current expenditure ceiling in any given year will, as a consequence, bear an offsetting adjustment in their envelope for the following year, and they will be required to devise appropriate policy measures to live within the reduced allocation.

The Board of BGE, together with their advisers, are handling the disposal process, in conjunction with NewERA and the Inter-Departmental Steering Group established to oversee the process on behalf of the Government. The transaction is expected to be concluded before the end of 2013.</p><p>  ESB commenced the sale of some of its non-strategic power generation assets, as announced last October, on 28th May.  The sale of the two overseas assets that it announced would be sold &ndash; at Marchwood in the UK and Amorbieta in Spain &ndash; are both expected to be completed in 2013.</p><p>  Work is also continuing on planning for the further components of ESB&rsquo;s disposal package, as announced by the company last October. Details of these further components will be made public by ESB, subject to commercial considerations, in due course.</p><p>  With regard to Aer Lingus, the European Commission&rsquo;s recently completed investigation of Ryanair&rsquo;s bid for the company, and the ongoing investigation by the UK&rsquo;s Competition Commission, which has now issued provisional findings that Ryanair&rsquo;s shareholding gives it the ability to influence the commercial policy and strategy of Aer Lingus on routes between Britain and Ireland, have been complicating factors in the disposal of the State&rsquo;s stake.  These matters will continue to be taken into account in the Government&rsquo;s plans for how to proceed with the disposal of its stake in the company.</p><p>  At the present moment, however, it is the Government&rsquo;s view that optimal conditions do not exist for a sale of the Government&rsquo;s remaining shareholding just now. Nevertheless, the Government remains open to considering opportunities to dispose of its shareholding and will, in the meantime, continue to manage the holding in a responsible manner in order to protect the State's interests and with the aim of maximising its value.</p><p>  With regard to Coillte, a number of detailed financial, technical and other specialist reports were prepared for Coillte in late 2012 by external specialist consultancy bodies, in full consultation with the Board of Coillte and its executive management.  These covered all of the issues that have been raised by various interest groups, including, amongst others, the issue of public access to the forests, replanting obligations to ensure the continued existence of our forests, harvesting policy, the supply of timber to sawmills, as well as the implications for a post-transaction Coillte.</p><p>  The Inter-Departmental Steering Group established to oversee the Coillte transaction process, which consists of representatives of NewERA, my department and the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, has considered these reports and appraised myself and the Minister for Agriculture Food and the Marine of the work completed to-date. </p><p>  On foot of this analysis, I can inform the Deputy that the Government has agreed with the joint recommendation of myself and the Minister for Agriculture Food and the Marine that now is not the appropriate time to proceed with the sale of harvesting rights in Coillte, but instead the focus needs to be on the restructuring of Coillte as a company, to address the issues that were identified in the reviews undertaken.  To that end, I wish to further inform the Deputy that: </p><p>  Coillte is to undergo a fundamental restructuring, to be overseen by NewERA and the relevant stakeholder Departments, which will include operational streamlining, financial de-leveraging and a critical examination of the disposal options for its non-core activities such as telecoms and wind.</p><p>  A robust analysis will also be carried out to evaluate how to give effect to a beneficial merger of Coillte with Bord na Mona to create a streamlined and refocused commercial state company operating in the bio-energy and forestry sectors, as committed to in the Programme for Government.</p><p>  A priority in this regard will be the annual delivery of a material financial dividend to the State by Coillte.</p><p>  And finally, we intend to fill the significant number of vacancies that will arise on the Coillte board this year by persons with relevant experience and commercial expertise to drive the restructuring process and the merger with Bord na Mona if this is approved by Government.</p></reply>

In total, this represents in excess of approx 800 separate properties, a significant number of which are managed by the Office and presented to the public as sites of general visitor interest, whether arising from their singular scenic, historic, archaeological architectural, geological or other qualities.</p><p>  A relatively small number of heritage sites (70 no.) are presented by the OPW with full Visitor and Guide facilities.   The attendance at these sites in 2012 was approx 3.8 million visitors and the visitor income derived was in excess of &euro;7m.   This is clearly a very substantial undertaking which is happening in virtually all parts of the State and, though only approx one third of these sites are open on a year round basis, it can clearly be seen that the extent to which the State's tourism offering is underpinned by these attractions is already quite significant.</p><p>  Some of these attractions are among the most iconic of Ireland's historic places and are reknowned both nationally and internationally as premier visitor destinations.   Sites such as Dun Aonghusa on the Aran Islands, Kilkenny Castle, Kilmainham Gaol and many others attract significant numbers of visitors and are well known as premier places to visit.   Two heritage sites, Newgrange and Skellig Michael, possess World Heritage Site status from UNESCO and are particularly prized by visitors.   Other locations within the portfolio are however less well known and do not attract a similar volume of numbers.   In many of these cases, the sites in question have many undeniably fine qualities which I feel would make them ideal candidates for development and greater exposure to an increasing number of visitors.</p><p>  It is clear that Ireland's heritage plays a significant role in relation to both foreign and domestic tourism.   This is spelled out most explicitly recently in the report produced by the Heritage Council last year entitled The Economic Value of Ireland's Historic Environment.   The portfolio managed by the OPW clearly has a major role to play in relation to this aspect of the tourism economy and a number of proposals are underway within my Department to maximise the impact made by these properties in terms of supporting the visitor offering.   These proposals include:</p><p>  a targeted approach to a site publicity campaign that makes potential visitors more aware of the sites available to visitors and encourages greater footfall to these locations;</p><p>  greater engagement by local organisations and groups in the running of heritage sites through the &quot;Friends of Irish Heritage&quot; programme, leading to better integration with local communities, a broader sense that the visitor is engaging with real Irish people and extended opening arrangements during the Winter months when the sites might otherwise be closed;</p><p>  a continuing focus on excellent product standards including the quality and range of publications, Guided tours and the overall visitor experience;</p><p>  greater engagement with modern media including Apps information Website and Social Media etc in order to better publicise the various sites and encourage more visits.</p></reply>

The Government Decision of 1997 and the publication of the National Guidelines on Public Art by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism in 2004 formalised a national approach to the implementation of the Scheme. This Government Decision approved the inclusion of a 1% budget for art, subject to an overall cap of EUR64,000, in all Exchequer-funded capital construction projects. The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is responsible for Per Cent for Art policy and it is under this policy that OPW, and other participating Government Departments, continue to implement the Scheme.</p><p>  Each Government Department manages the Scheme according to its individual role and responsibilities. As the OPW has responsibility for the management of the State Art Collection which contains over 15,000 historic and contemporary art works and decorative objects and which are on display in hundreds of State owned properties throughout Ireland, it remains committed to the use of the Per Cent for Art Scheme.</p><p>  The majority of the contemporary artworks in the State Art Collection have been acquired under the Government's Per Cent for Art Scheme in recent decades. These works have been acquired from artists who are living and working in Ireland. Works have been purchased and commissioned from artists at different stages of their careers, with particular emphasis on those starting out in graduate shows and group exhibitions. OPW has also commissioned works in a wide variety of media - painting, sculpture, music and poetry through the Scheme.</p><p>  Since the early 1990s, OPW has organised a touring exhibition of artworks to bring the works in the State Art Collection to audiences throughout the country. These exhibitions, which in more recent times, have been organised in partnership with the Department of Finance and Personnel of Northern Ireland as a cross-border cultural project, have travelled to a wide variety of venues including arts centres, libraries, public galleries and visitor centres. The exhibitions are accompanied by illustrated catalogues that document the work of the included artists, serving as records of the events and providing information for researchers.</p><p>  The OPW has taken a strategic approach to managing the Scheme in recent years to ensure that the State Art Collection continues to enrich visitors' experiences in public buildings and to raise awareness of current contemporary art practice. Per Cent for Art funding is pooled to ensure the acquisition and commissioning of a variety of art projects to support the creativity of the current generation of artists and the infrastructure that surrounds their practice (galleries, foundries, framers, conservators, artist-led studios, etc).</p><p>  The OPW Art Management Handbook sets out the procedures and policies involved in the implementation of the Per Cent for Art Scheme within OPW managed properties. The OPW website contains information in relation to the implementation of the Per Cent for Art Scheme and the management of the State Art Collection. OPW also continues to publish illustrated catalogues documenting the collection and copies of these catalogues are available from the OPW Art Management Office. The Office further encourages access to information for research purposes and works from the State Art Collection are regularly placed on loan to exhibitions organised by other cultural institutions and artists to further facilitate public engagement with the Collection. </p><p>  Since its foundation in the mid 19th century, OPW has had responsibility for the presentation of State properties to millions of visitors from home and abroad. OPW continues to incorporate Irish art, craft and design into these properties to promote and encourage the creative output of artists, designers and craftspeople living and working in Ireland. The work created today, facilitated by the Government's Per Cent for Art Scheme, forms the heritage of the future.</p></reply>

Procurement of supplies and services accounts for around &euro;9 billion of current spending by the State per annum. This represents a very significant portion of overall spending and it is, therefore, essential that the Public Service achieves maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement.</p><p>  Progress has been made on several of the actions for procurement reform contained in the Public Service Reform Plan. The Government agreed on 12 June, 2012 to implement mandatory arrangements in respect of the centralised purchasing frameworks organised by the National Procurement Service (NPS), which will be transferring into the new Office of Government Procurement (OGP). These national arrangements have benefits that include:</p><p> - cash savings;</p><p> - administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering;</p><p> - greater purchasing expertise;</p><p> - improved consistency; and,</p><p> - enhanced service levels.</p><p>  While the key purpose of these reforms to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money, it is worth noting that such aggregation arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money with a minimal negative impact, or indeed a positive impact, on SMEs. While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements, these need not be accepted as the norm. The greater use, where appropriate, of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring on-going cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions.</p><p>  In addition, an external review of the central procurement function was commissioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The report of the review, which was published in September, found that significant savings can be achieved through the implementation of a transformational change to the central procurement model.</p><p>  In December 2012, arising out of recommendations in the report of the review of the central procurement function the Minister announced the appointment of a Chief Procurement Officer (CPO) to lead a key element of the Government's Public Service Reform agenda. The priority areas for the CPO include:</p><p> - integrating procurement policy, strategy and sourcing in one office;</p><p> - strengthening spend analytics and data management;</p><p> - much greater aggregation of purchasing across public bodies to achieve better value for money;</p><p> - examining the specifications set out for goods and services;</p><p> - evaluating demand levels to assess how demand and volume can be reduced; and</p><p> - strengthening supplier and category management.</p><p>  Since the appointment of the CPO, on 28 January 2013, he has initiated and completed a series of engagements (workshops and one-to-one meetings) with key stakeholders within the public sector and their representatives in relation to the development of the proposed governance structures, implementation plan, transition arrangements and savings targets for the procurement function. The following sectors were engaged in workshops / meetings: Health, Education, Local Government, Defence, Justice, and other Central Government Departments.</p><p>The Government agreed on 23 April 2013 a plan to reform procurement across the public service. This is one of the elements of the Public Service Reform Programme, led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The plan sets out ambitious targets and timelines for changes to the structure and operation of procurement and will deliver much needed savings for the Exchequer. A new organisation called the Office of Government Procurement will be formed and headed by the Government&rsquo;s recently appointed Chief Procurement Officer. The new office will be responsible for procurement policy and operations, working across the public service in delivering better value for the taxpayer. The Government has agreed an ambitious target of &euro;500m of savings to be achieved over 3 years through the transformation of public service procurement.</p><p>  To summarise: we in government want better value for money for our substantial procurement spend. To ensure the reform process takes account of the needs of stakeholders further consultations will be undertaken with industry representative associations, employees and workers' representatives as the new Office of Government Procurement is established.

The relevant paragraph in the HRA, headed &quot;Public Service Pensions&quot;, reads as follows:</p><p><i>&ldquo;Separately to this Agreement, the Parties note that the Government intends to align the reductions in public service pensions in payment with the reductions applied to serving staff. The Parties note that this measure will apply to pensions in payment greater than &euro;32,500 only&rdquo;</i></p><p>Reductions in those public service pensions valued in excess of &euro;32,500 are due to occur next month, on foot of provisions in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013.<b>  </b>With effect from 1 July 2013, the Act reduces those public service pensions valued at &euro;32,500 or greater, affecting all such pensions, including Office holder pensions, already payable on that date or awarded up to end-August 2014. The reductions range from about 2% near the &euro;32,500 threshold level (subject to no pension falling below &euro;32,500), to 5% in respect of the highest pensions.</p><p>In order to secure these pension reductions, the 2013 Act increases and extends the existing Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR). The PSPR is a tiered reduction of certain public service pensions which has been in place since 1 January 2011, and which features five increasing bands of pension income, with rising reduction percentages associated with each band. Specifically, the 2013 Act changes the PSPR with effect from 1 July 2013 to provide separately, in respect of two groups of pensioners, as follows:</p><p>In the case of the first pensioner group, revised higher rates of PSPR will apply to pensions above &euro;32,500 which have been subject to PSPR before July 2013, largely comprising pensions awarded up to end-February 2012.

The composition of the savings arising and subsequent reductions in expenditure can only be finalised when the results of the various ballots are known.</p><p>  The measures set out in the Agreement will enable the Government to achieve the targeted savings of approximately &euro;300 million in the public service pay and pensions bill in 2013, including savings on Local Government. Furthermore, it is estimated that the measures set out in the Haddington Road Agreement will reduce the public service pay and pensions bill by &euro;1 billion by the end of the Agreement.</p><p>  The Revised Estimates Volume was published on 17 April this year on the basis of the previous Labour Relations Commission (LRC) recommendations, prior to the recent re-engagement between the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform and the Trade Unions. These recommendations were, at the time, the most appropriate means of achieving the savings required and it was important that the relevant Oireachtas Committees could begin the process of examining the Vote allocations for 2013.</p><p>  While the recommendations set out in Haddington Road Agreement have changed since the previous LRC recommendations, the pay allocations for individual Votes based on the implementation of these recommendations remain largely the same.</p><p>  With regard to the economic impacts of the pay and pension savings, there are no easy options for Government in ensuring that Ireland's deficit targets are met.  However, by adhering to the medium-term fiscal plan and continuing to meet our fiscal targets we can generate positive confidence effects.

Procurement of supplies and services accounts for around &euro;9 billion of current spending by the State per annum. This represents a very significant portion of overall spending and it is, therefore, essential that the Public Service achieves maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement.</p><p>As part of our drive for greater value for money and increased efficiency, my Department commissioned a capacity and capability review of the central procurement function to identify the actions required to realise substantial savings in public procurement in the short and medium term.  This review is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>Approximately &euro;9 billion is spent by public bodies annually on the public procurement of supplies and services, and the review estimated that &euro;7 billion of this is &quot;addressable spend&quot;.  As the Deputy is aware, the review also estimated that implementation of its recommendations, over a three-year period, could yield potential annual savings in the range of &euro;249 million to &euro;637 million, depending on the approach taken. These estimated savings are broken down as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th colspan="5"><b></b><br /><b>Procurement Addressable Spend Suitable to be managed by Central Procurement Function</b><br /><b></b></th></tr><tr><td><b>Category</b></td><td><b>Procurement Addressable Spend &euro;m</b></td><td><b>Low Range Target Savings &euro;m</b></td><td><b>Mid-Range Target Savings &euro;m</b></td><td><b>High Range Target Savings &euro;m</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><b>Central Managed Categories</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>Professional Services</b></td><td>&euro;1,031</td><td>&euro;35</td><td>&euro;82</td><td>&euro;99</td></tr><tr><td><b>Facilities &amp;amp; Services</b></td><td>&euro;962</td><td>&euro;55</td><td>&euro;100</td><td>&euro;115</td></tr><tr><td><b>Minor Building/Civil Works</b></td><td>&euro;573</td><td>&euro;33</td><td>&euro;60</td><td>&euro;69</td></tr><tr><td><b>Utilities</b></td><td>&euro;551</td><td>&euro;8</td><td>&euro;18</td><td>&euro;22</td></tr><tr><td><b>ICT</b></td><td>&euro;454</td><td>&euro;26</td><td>&euro;47</td><td>&euro;55</td></tr><tr><td><b>Travel</b></td><td>&euro;290</td><td>&euro;4</td><td>&euro;23</td><td>&euro;28</td></tr><tr><td><b>Print &amp;amp; Stationery</b></td><td>&euro;178</td><td>&euro;9</td><td>&euro;17</td><td>&euro;17</td></tr><tr><td><b>HR</b></td><td>&euro;143</td><td>&euro;5</td><td>&euro;11</td><td>&euro;17</td></tr><tr><td><b>Office Equipment</b></td><td>&euro;99</td><td>&euro;3</td><td>&euro;8</td><td>&euro;10</td></tr><tr><td><b>Marketing</b></td><td>&euro;74</td><td>&euro;2</td><td>&euro;6</td><td>&euro;7</td></tr><tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td>&euro;4,355</td><td>&euro;180</td><td>&euro;373</td><td>&euro;438</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>*Travel excludes Education School Bus Contract already contracted</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><b></b><br /><b>Procurement Addressable Spend to be managed within sectors</b><br /><b></b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><b>Sector Managed Categories</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>Category</b></td><td><b>Spend</b></td><td><b>Low Range</b></td><td><b>Mid-Range</b></td><td><b>High Range</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>Medical</b></td><td>&euro;1,638</td><td>&euro;55</td><td>&euro;131</td><td>&euro;157</td></tr><tr><td><b>Plant</b></td><td>&euro;142</td><td>&euro;8</td><td>&euro;15</td><td>&euro;17</td></tr><tr><td><b>Managed Service</b></td><td>&euro;93</td><td>&euro;1</td><td>&euro;10</td><td>&euro;11</td></tr><tr><td><b>Fleet</b></td><td>&euro;89</td><td>&euro;3</td><td>&euro;7</td><td>&euro;9</td></tr><tr><td><b>Defence</b></td><td>&euro;71</td><td>&euro;1</td><td>&euro;2</td><td>&euro;3</td></tr><tr><td><b>Farming</b></td><td>&euro;18</td><td>&euro;1</td><td>&euro;1</td><td>&euro;2</td></tr><tr><td><b>Unclassified</b></td><td>&euro;476</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;0</td></tr><tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td><b>&euro;2,528</b></td><td><b>&euro;69</b></td><td><b>&euro;166</b></td><td><b>&euro;199</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><b></b><br /><b>Total Procurement Addressable Spend and Savings Totals</b><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Spend</b></td><td><b>Low Range</b></td><td><b>Mid-Range</b></td><td><b>High Range</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>Total Target Savings</b></td><td><b>&euro;6,900</b></td><td><b>&euro;249</b></td><td><b>&euro;539</b></td><td><b>&euro;637</b></td></tr></table></p><p>In relation to the above, I would point out that further work is underway within the newly established Office of Government Procurement to develop a more accurate baseline from which to measure possible savings.

The aim is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of location or nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.</p><p>  The National Procurement Service (NPS), which will be transferring into the new Office of Government Procurement (OGP), has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service&rsquo;s buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service. These national arrangements have benefits that include:</p><p> - cash savings;</p><p> - administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering;</p><p> - greater purchasing expertise;</p><p> - improved consistency; and,</p><p> - enhanced service levels. </p><p>  In some instances the take up of the NPS arrangements has been low. In order to increase the usage of the NPS arrangements and thereby secure best value for money, the Government decided that it should be mandatory for public service bodies to use specified national procurement arrangements. Last year my Department issued Circular 06/12 which implements the Government decision by making it a mandatory requirement that public service bodies avail of specified national arrangements put in place by the NPS. These national arrangements will secure best value for money and facilitate contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints.</p><p>  Where a mandatory framework arrangement exists, any public service body intending to make a purchase other than through the framework arrangement will need to ensure that it can explain the rationale for not using the NPS arrangement and provide a value for money justification that takes account of the full costs including those incurred in managing its own procurement process.</p><p>  While the key purpose of Circular 6/12 is to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money, it is worth noting that such aggregation arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money with a minimal negative impact, or indeed a positive impact, on SMEs. While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements, these need not be accepted as the norm. The greater use, where appropriate, of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring on-going cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions.</p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide. Parallel with these events the NPS also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.</p><p>  To summarise: we in government want better value for money for our substantial procurement spend.  To ensure the reform process takes account of the needs of stakeholders further consultations will be undertaken with industry representative associations, employees and workers&rsquo; representatives as the new Office of Government Procurement is established.  We are committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged in the process and will be encouraged, where necessary, to form alliances and networks to ensure they can tender on a competitive basis for this work.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-20a.129.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013062000064#WRDD00400"><p>I have answered a series of questions (Nos. 26589 &ndash; 26592 on 30thMay 2013) which contain a substantial amount of information in relation to the operation of Gift / Book shops at sites managed by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and which may be of assistance to the Deputy.   As indicated at that time, there are two types of retail operation at heritage visitor sites managed by the OPW; the first is where a small amount of material is sold directly by the sites themselves; the second is where a franchise operation manages the retail operation separate from the OPW.</p><p>  The majority of the 70 attended visitor sites managed by the OPW do not operate a separate retail outlet for gift merchandise but sell limited visitor material on an across the counter basis.  As this operation is managed by site Guide staff as part of their normal range of duties, it is not therefore feasible to derive accurate figures in relation to the cost base for the retail activity (as opposed to all of the separate guiding and related duties), and information relating to the profit generated by such activity is not available.   In the main, the kind of merchandise sold is low volume and focusses, for the most part, on postcards and publications related to the site or other historical sites nearby.</p><p>  Two visitor sites, namely Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne (Newgrange) Visitor Centre in Co. Meath and Dublin Castle have designated retail outlets which operate on a franchise basis.  The type of merchadise sold at these locations is much more varied and would encompass what might be termed more general visitor memorabilia rather than the historic publications material found at the majority of OPW manned sites.</p><p>  In the case of Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne Visitor Centre, the franchise operation was introduced in June 2012 with a fee of &euro;20,000 per annum payable. The fees for 2010, 2011 and 2012 in respect of Dublin Castle Gift Shop amounted to &euro;19,046.16. </p><p>  In general, the majority of OPW visitor sites have limited space and facilities to operate a retail outlet.   The primary focus at OPW sites is on the preservation and presentation of the sites in question and the commercial activity referred to is largely secondary.   The scope to develop more substantial retail outlets is therefore to an extent curtailed by both the lack of physical space and the distraction from the core aim.   There are consequently no immediate plans for the development / expansion of this area of operations, though additional franchise operations will be considered where space and other consi  derations permit.</p></reply>

Last year over 83% (428,000) of all persons applying for their passports in the State used Passport Express Irish citizens applied for their passports through Passport Express.  </p><p>  There is no requirement for applicants or parents of applicants to present at a passport office in person.  However for those who have non-emergency urgent travel, the Passport Service now operates an appointment system and extended opening hours in our Molesworth St office.  This has significantly reduced the incidence of queues and reduced waiting time for members of the public.  The should be noted that the minimum turn around time for a passport is 3 working days. </p><p>  In cases of genuine emergency every effort is made by the Passport Service to meet a travel date where the Passport Service is satisfied that:</p><p>  - the proposed journey is related to the death or serious injury or illness abroad of a close relative or a medical emergency relating to the applicant him/herself; and</p><p>  - the presence of the applicant at the foreign location in connection with such an unexpected event is necessary or highly desirable; and</p><p>  - the need to travel has arisen at short notice.</p><p>  Additionally, my Department provides a Duty Officer Service outside normal office hours to deal with matters requiring immediate attention, including the issue of passports. </p></reply>

The Government is acutely aware of the significant difficulties some homeowners are facing in meeting their mortgage and other debt obligations and it is committed to advancing appropriate measures to assist those mortgage holders who are experiencing genuine difficulty.  </p><p>  The Government has put in place a comprehensive strategy to address the problem of mortgage arrears.  The implementation of this strategy is overseen at Government level by a special Government Sub-Committee chaired by An Taoiseach, and at official level by a high level Steering Group chaired by my Department's Secretary General or other senior officials.  This Steering Group consists of senior officials from the Departments of the Finance, An Taoiseach, Environment, Community and Local Government, Justice and Equality, Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as the Central Bank and the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  This Group meets on a fortnightly basis and its purpose is to co-ordinate and drive the implementation of the strategy across Government and to receive and monitor the reports from the relevant Departments and agencies on the implementation of their respective areas of the overall strategy.</p><p>  Following on from the recommendations of the 2011 Inter-Departmental Report on Mortgage Arrears, the main elements of the mortgage arrears strategy are: </p><p><b>  - Innovative Personal Insolvency Reform:</b>  The Personal Insolvency Act, in place since the end of 2012, now provides accessible statutory insolvency frameworks to allow debtors and creditors reach arrangements to resolve unsustainable mortgage and personal debt positions.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland, which was officially launched in April, will oversee the operation of the new insolvency frameworks and will very soon be in a position to commence processing insolvency applications.</p><p><b>  - Comprehensive Advice and Guidance:</b>  In addition to existing arrangements, the Government has introduced a range of information and guidance resources to assist mortgage holders through what can be a difficult and stressful process.  A dedicated website, <i>,</i> has been put in place to provide general public information on mortgages arrears issues.  In addition, there is a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline, which was established under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, to provide more tailored information to individual callers.  Finally, a panel of accountants has been put in place to provide &#8220;one to one&#8221; independent advice to borrowers who have been provided a long term forbearance resolution offer by their lender in respect of a mortgage on their primary home.  All of these information services are provided at no direct charge to the users of the service.</p><p><b>  - Keeping families in their homes:  </b>As a social housing response, a &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; scheme is now in place on a nationwide basis.  This option is available to households who have unsustainable mortgages and who would qualify for social housing support.  Provided they meet this and other appropriate criteria, this allows families, in the context of an agreed resolution to an unsustainable mortgage, to remain in their home.</p><p><b>  - Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategies:</b>  The implementation of sustainable mortgage arrears solutions by individual banks for their distressed customers, with Central Bank oversight, is a key element of the overall framework to address the mortgage arrears problem.  The Central Bank initiative announced last March, sets time bound and measurable targets for the main banks, requiring them to systematically address their arrears book.  This is a very important step to resolve the impasse on arrears.  The Central Bank is initially requiring the main mortgage lenders to propose sustainable solutions to 20% of mortgages that are in arrears (of over 90 days) by end June.  The target rises to 30% by the end of September and to 50% by the end of December 2013.  The Central Bank will monitor and audit the performance of banks in relation to the targets and, crucially, will also assess whether the modifications provided are in fact sustainable solutions.  More recently, the Central Bank also announced a pilot initiative for the restructuring of multiple debt situations to test the viability of a negotiated approach where there is more than one lender involved.  In that overall context, and also in the context of the Central Bank's role in the area of protecting the consumer of financial services, I have also asked my officials to forward the submission from the organisation referred to by Deputy to the Central Bank for its attention and necessary follow up.</p></reply>

This increase is an international phenomenon. Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions.</p><p>  The function of my Department in relation to fuel prices is confined to taxes imposed on fuel.  In this regard, the Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase.  On the other hand, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  It should be noted however that businesses are entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on fuel.  For example, VAT incurred on auto-diesel and marked gas oil (MGO or green diesel) used in the course of business is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system.  There are no plans for taxation adjustments in this area as to do so could lead to significant costs to the Exchequer.</p></reply>

The Central Bank does not currently receive data on the level of arrears or the number of restructured payment arrangements that have been entered into. It should be noted, however, that under section 112 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, moneylenders are prohibited from increasing charges for credit should a consumer be in a default position.  The Central Bank has also informed me that they are in the process of conducting research into the moneylending industry and intends to publish the research findings later this year.

The following table which has been provided to me by Permanent TSB sets out the latest available deficits in the schemes as at 31 December 2012 and the number of members, deferred pensioners and pensioners of each of the schemes as at 31 December 2011.

Permanent TSB has informed me that contributions to this scheme ceased in March 2013 and the active employees are included in the Defined Contribution schemes from June 2013.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware a hearing is scheduled at the Labour Court on 21 June 2013 in relation to this matter.

The deputy will be aware that for a debtor to avail of bankruptcy in any given jurisdiction he/she must first of all establish that jurisdiction as his/her centre of main interest (COMI).  The establishment of COMI is a matter for the relevant authorities in the jurisdiction in which bankruptcy is sought.  NAMA advises that in each instance of bankruptcy involving a NAMA debtor it reviews its options and selects the most appropriate method of ensure the best possible return for the taxpayer. NAMA advises that it is currently challenging bankruptcy applications on the basis of COMI in two instances and in a further case is supporting the application of another secured bank with a view to having bankruptcy proceedings take place in Ireland.</p><p>  As advised in NAMA's Annual Report and Financial Statements, the Agency, as a secured creditor, is generally neutral on the locus of bankruptcy proceedings and its experience has been that the location has not tended to prejudice recoveries.  This position is based in part on its positive on-going engagement with several bankruptcy trustees of NAMA debtors who have been adjudged bankrupt in the UK.  The Agency also advises that the bankruptcy regime in the UK is well established, sophisticated and that bankruptcy trustees under the UK system possess extensive powers to compel production of legal and banking information, on a cross-border basis, from the bankrupt. These powers have been used in bankruptcy cases involving NAMA debtors to uncover significant undeclared assets.</p><p>  NAMA further advises that the comparatively shorter duration of bankruptcy in, for example, the UK is not a consideration for the Agency as the bankrupt's assets remain in the control of the bankruptcy trustee long after the bankrupt may have been discharged from bankruptcy and any failure to make full disclosure may result in the period of bankruptcy being extended.  NAMA advises that it challenges the release from bankruptcy of any debtor in instances where there is non-cooperation with the bankruptcy trustee.</p><p>  I am advised by NAMA that a total of 56 NAMA debtors have been declared bankrupt: 11 in Ireland, 44 in the UK and 1 in the US.  Debtors who have been declared bankrupt outside of Ireland had, by reference to the nominal or par value of loans, exposure to debt of approximately &euro;8 billion at the time of NAMA's acquisition of loans from the participating institutions.  NAMA has enforced over the assets securing these loans and continues to realise these assets.  When a debtor goes bankrupt what is generally available is the remaining unencumbered or unsecured assets.  The role of the bankruptcy trustee is, therefore, to realise any other residual unencumbered assets, including properties and cash, which the bankrupt may have and to make a distribution to the creditors including NAMA.  The bankruptcy trustee can also seek to have the bankrupt contribute from post-bankruptcy earnings through an income payment order.</p></reply>

This means, for example, that a business which engages in online bookmaking and which accepts bets from people in this country will be liable for betting duty on those bets, irrespective of where that business is based. The existing betting duty (1%) will be applied to such bets. The Finance Act also provides for the taxation of Betting Exchanges under the new arrangements; however the calculation of the tax will take account of their particular business model, in other words a 15% tax on the commission charged. In addition, excise duties are being applied to the granting and renewal of remote bookmakers&rsquo; and remote betting intermediaries&rsquo; licences. </p><p>  The Betting (Amendment) Bill, which will establish the regulatory framework for the licensing regime, was published in July last year.  Since that date work has been continuing by officials of my Department and Revenue on the drawing up of a number of amendments to the Bill to strengthen enforcement measures.  It is my intention, given the number of amendments, to go back to Government in the very near future for approval to republish the Bill.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that under the EU Technical Standards and Regulations Directive it will be necessary to show the published Bill to the EU Commission and other Member States, which could take 3 months for clearance. However, I hope to use this time to progress the Bill through the D&aacute;il subject to scheduling agreement between the Whips.</p><p>The tax changes provided for in the Finance Act can only be implemented once the Betting (Amendment) Bill is enacted.  While it is difficult to predict, the anticipated yield from online betting duty is estimated to be &euro;20 million in a full year. </p></reply>

Such a restriction would run counter to the EU-wide common system of VAT established on the principle that VAT is a general tax on consumption, exactly proportional to the price of the goods and services, however many transactions take place in the production and distribution process before the stage at which the tax is charged.  This principle is set out in Article 1 of the EU VAT Directive (Council Directive 2006/112/EC). Article 168 of the VAT Directive states that in so far as goods and services are used for the purposes of taxed transactions of a taxable person, the taxable person shall be entitled to deduct the VAT due or paid in respect of supplies to him of goods or services.  This right to deduct input VAT has been confirmed by the European Court of Justice in many cases brought before it.</p></reply>

Schools must apply directly to the Department with applications required to be supported with a report prepared by a professional who has assessed the individual special pupil's needs. Only furniture approved by the Department in such cases will be funded. Therefore the specific needs of each individual special needs pupil are required to be identified and supported by a statement to be submitted by the pupil's professional advisor with supporting information and details. This has not happened to date in this instance. On receipt of such information the matter will be explored further and a decision issued.  </p></reply>

The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required to ensure such placements are provided for.</p><p>Pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05.</p><p>Pupils with Down syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities. </p><p>My Department requested that the NCSE consider the issue of whether Down syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, in the context of its preparation of comprehensive advice on how the educational system supports children with special educational needs in schools. </p><p>The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category. </p><p>The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down syndrome pupils who are in the Mild General Learning Difficulty (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD. </p><p>It has not been recommended that an exception should be made for children with Down syndrome who are in the mild general learning difficulty range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.</p><p>However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs. </p><p>I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report. </p></reply>

Schools will be given flexibility to shape their own junior cycle programme by including a selection of subjects, short courses and other learning experiences that will allow their students to meet the requirements of the twenty-four statements of learning outlined in the Framework. Under the current system only 52% of schools - the voluntary secondary schools - are obliged to provide History as core. Yet 90% of students present for History in the Junior Certificate.  </p><p>History will become a discrete subject under the Framework. New specifications for History will be developed in for implementation in schools from September 2017 . In the event that a student does not study History as a discrete subject, there will be a requirement of schools to ensure that students meet the statements of learning, including &quot;values local, national and international heritage, understands the importance of the relationship between past and current events and the forces that drive change&quot;. Individual schools will have the flexibility to decide how they may do this. For example, a school or group of schools in a town, may opt to develop a short course in History to reflect a particular historical event relevant to their area. </p><p>I met with the representatives of the History Teachers' Association of Ireland in early 2012 and the discussion at that meeting helped to inform the final Framework document. I have every confidence that the changes envisaged in Framework for Junior Cycle will ensure that the place of historical study will be retained and given a new impetus across the junior cycle curriculum. Such an impetus should help to improve take up of History at senior cycle also.</p></reply>

Since I became Minister for Education and Skills, I have attempted to take steps to reduce the burden on families.  Shortly after coming into office, I met members of the Irish Educational Publishers Association and impressed on them the need to limit the cost of textbooks.  I also stressed to them the real need to avoid placing schools and families in a position where textbooks are altered unnecessarily.  The association responded positively to my approaches and agreed a voluntary code of practice among its members.  The code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years.  The publishers have also given me assurances that they will sell textbooks to schools at discounts so that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock textbook rental schemes.  All these developments are welcome.  I look forward to seeing the members of the Association implement these commitments.  The Department provided approximately &euro;15 million to first and second level schools by way of book grants in 2012.  The same level of funding will be provided in 2013.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware I launched new Guidelines for Developing Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools on 28 January last.  These guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated.  The aim of the guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes.  The publication of these guidelines followed a survey of schools by the Department, which I published in May 2012. T his had a 99% response rate at primary level, and showed that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme.  At second level, the response rate was lower, at 44%.  Of those which did respond, 88% of those in the VEC sector and 73% of those in the Community and Comprehensive sector operated a book rental scheme.  I believe these results show we have a good foundation to build on across the country. I  hope that schools that are not yet operating book rental schemes will be encouraged to use the guidelines to introduce them.  If they do, it will result in substantial savings for parents.  Schools which already have rental schemes can save parents up to 80% of the cost of buying new books.  A special Guide for Parents was also published to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them.</p><p>  I have been very clear in my support for book rental schemes.  All of us who are parents know how expensive textbooks can be and what a burden they place on already hard-pressed families at the start of every school year.  I am pleased to see the high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary level.  I believe these guidelines will encourage this practice across all schools in our education landscape.  I published a report on Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools and the Allocation of Textbook Grants by the Department of Education and Skills in May 2012.  This report presented four policy options to encourage schools to establish textbook rental schemes.  None of the options is ideal, as each involves a trade-off of advantages and disadvantages.  I will continue to monitor the number of schools operating book rental schemes and, if necessary, consider further steps to encourage schools to do so.  Educational book publishers are independent private companies and are not under the direct control of my Department.  Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second level, mainly in the case of language subjects, decisions on textbooks are taken at school level.  Individual schools need to adopt a more cost-conscious approach to the selection of books in their classes.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.  All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013-14 school year by 15 March 2013.  The NCSE has been processing these applications and schools will be notified by SENOs of their resource teaching and SNA allocation for 2013-14 in advance of the coming school year, based on the number of valid applications received.  I assure the Deputies that this process has been done as expeditiously as possible by the NCSE to allow schools and principals sufficient time to plan for the coming school year.  As the NCSE allocates resources to schools to support over 30,000 pupils annually, some time is required to process all of the applications which are received each year, in advance of notifying schools of their allocations.  I can advise the Deputy that the NCSE published details of allocations for SNAs and resource teaching hours for the 2013-14 school year yesterday, Wednesday, 19 June.  These details are now available on the NCSE website, <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.  They detail the allocations made for each school on a per county basis.</p></reply>

The walls are quite easily scaled in certain parts and the grounds are frequented by drug users and people abusing alcohol generally during the hours of darkness and especially at weekends. The grounds had been opened to the general public by the Office of Public Works, from 9.30 am to 5.00 pm, Monday to Saturday, in line with the opening hours of the nearby National Museum.  Unfortunately, it was becoming increasingly common for OPW staff to discover used syringes among other rubbish discarded by drug users.  In October 2012 a decision was taken to close the area to the public on health and safety grounds, as sufficient resources are not available to the OPW to sterilise the entire area every day before opening the gates. OPW considered that the risks associated with discarded needles were too great too continue to allow access to either their staff or the public.</p><p>  However OPW has been exploring ways of re-opening Croppies Acre and discussions are ongoing with Dublin City Council's Parks Department, in relation to the granting of a licence to the Council to manage and maintain the park.</p></reply>

The Government must also try to ensure that the available resources are spent carefully and that critical services continue to be delivered.</p><p>  I am aware of recent calls for an &#8220;Equality Budgeting&#8221; approach.  Many aspects of the expenditure reforms that I have been progressing - notably with regard to enhanced levels of transparency and the publication of a draft budget, which allows for public consultation and debate on the particulars of the budget before it is finalised - are already responding to this.  </p><p>  As you know, the new 'whole-of-year-budgeting' reform, announced in the <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014 </i>enhances the role and the policy relevance of the Oireachtas in particular with regard to the role of Committees in <i>ex ante</i> consideration of resource allocation priorities in each area.  This provides a forum in which Oireachtas Committees and Departments can assess and discuss the equality implications of any policy proposal in advance of the final Estimates.  Furthermore, the Government Programme places emphasis upon performance and delivery across public administration.  Performance Budgeting builds performance information right into the heart of the budget documentation and shows what outputs and outcomes are being delivered with public funds.  This information is now publicly available on the IrelandStat website and links the Government goals with associated outcomes.  </p><p>  A recent OECD report (titled &#8220;Crisis squeezes income and puts pressure on inequality and poverty&#8221;), published on 15 May, found that income distribution among Irish households was more equal than the average across the rest of all other OECD nations.  In addition to this, the most recent Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) 2011 illustrates the strong performance of social transfers in protecting those on the lowest incomes. In 2011, social transfers (including pensions) reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate from 50.7 per cent to 16 per cent.</p><p>  The Programme for Government contains a clear commitment that all public bodies would take due note of equality and human rights in carrying out their functions. The State and its bodies must, of course, comply with all provisions of equality legislation in the development and delivery of policies and services.</p><p> Finally, Cabinet procedures require that proposals put to Government indicate clearly whether there is any impact of the proposal on, amongst other things, gender equality, persons experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion and people with disabilities and these considerations are taken into account when taking Government decisions on Budget matters.</p></reply>

Policies are under constant review to ensure the best outcomes in meeting the operational requirements of client Departments in terms of location, size, cost, sustainability and that particular operational needs are delivered.  New initiatives in this regard include the development of a new standard office workplace specification and a review of office space allocation norms.</p><p>In recent years there have been substantial changes within the Civil Service in terms of numbers of employees, departmental and agency breakdown and in changing locational needs. The Commissioners have shifted focus to rationalisation of the existing property portfolio to address the reduced demand for office space. There is a time lag between the reduction in demand for space and the disposal of surplus space, particularly in the current poor market. Notwithstanding this, The Commissioners have succeeded in reducing the office property footprint every year since 2008, by a total of almost 1 million sq.ft. (c. 88,000 m.sq.) This ongoing programme of rationalisation has also driven down annual rental expenditure by almost &euro;30m since 2009.</p><p>The table schedules the current live leases held by the Commissioners of Public Works where an &lsquo;Upward Only&rsquo;

However, it is important to note that since the publication of &ldquo;Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016: Medium Term Exchequer Framework&rdquo; in November 2011 no further cuts have been made to the capital programme. That publication was the result of a major review of capital expenditure. It prioritised investment in infrastructure which would be most beneficial to supporting economic growth, thereby supporting sustainable employment growth in the medium term, meeting urgent social needs and maintaining our existing stock of infrastructure. It also took account of the fact that &euro;70 billion had been invested in the previous decade.</p><p>  At the time of publication of the report I noted that, should a funding source become available, there was much more that I wanted to deliver through investment in infrastructure. The deal I negotiated with the Troika with regard to the proceeds from the sale of State assets and the recovery of the PPP market are allowing us to now progress additional projects which we could not include in the 5 year framework.</p><p>  In July 2012, I announced a Stimulus Plan of &euro;2.25bn, comprising a &euro;1.4bn PPP programme and an Exchequer element of &euro;850m. The latter is to be funded from some of the proceeds from the sale of State assets and the new licencing arrangement for the National Lottery. On 5th June, as a follow up to last year&rsquo;s Stimulus Plan, I announced Exchequer investment of &euro;150m to fund school building projects, local and regional road maintenance and retrofitting of Local Authority housing. This &euro;150m investment is additional to that included in the existing budget. I expect that approximately &euro;70 million of this additional funding will be spent this year, with most of the remainder being spent in 2014 and a small amount in 2015.</p></reply>

The composition of the savings arising can only be finalised when the results of the various ballots are known.</p><p>  However, the measures set out in the Agreement will enable the Government to achieve the targeted savings of approximately &euro;300 million in the public service pay and pensions bill in 2013, including savings on Local Government. Furthermore, it is estimated that the measures set out in the Haddington Road Agreement will reduce the public service pay and pensions bill by &euro;1 billion by the end of the Agreement. </p><p>  The Revised Estimates Volume was published on the basis of the previous Labour Relations Commission (LRC) recommendations, prior to the recent re-engagement between the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform and the Trade Unions. These recommendations were, at the time, the most appropriate means of achieving the savings required and it was important that the relevant Oireachtas Committees could begin the process of examining the Vote allocations for 2013.  </p><p>  While the recommendations set out in Haddington Road Agreement have changed since the previous LRC recommendations, the pay allocations for individual Votes based on the implementation of these recommendations remain largely the same.</p></reply>

We are bringing public expenditure back onto a sustainable path and driving forward the public service reform agenda to ensure that efficiencies and reformed work practices play a full part in contributing to the overall budgetary consolidation effort which is essential to achieving our annual deficit targets.  To date, all quantitative fiscal targets set as part of the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support have been met in full.  </p><p>  Since this Government was established in 2011, a medium-term expenditure management process began with a Comprehensive Review of Expenditure exercise.  This exercise was carried out by all Departments in order to identify ways of reducing expenditure in line with commitments under the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland, while minimising the impact on service delivery.</p><p>  Following on from this, the Ministerial expenditure ceilings for 2012 - 2014 were introduced on an administrative basis in the <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report</i>, published in December 2011.  The CRE exercise forms the foundation of these ceilings and is the basis for all subsequent decisions on expenditure.  </p><p>  The <i>Expenditure Report 2013 was </i>published on 5 December 2012 and includes further well-specified expenditure savings measures across every area of Government spending.  While these structural economic and budgetary reforms that the Government is delivering will bring a return to prosperity and growth over the medium term, the current international economic position combined with the high levels of uncertainty across the world's financial market will require Ireland to maintain fiscal discipline into 2014.  </p><p>  For a detailed breakdown of Exchequer pay and non-pay spending by Departments, I would refer the Deputy to the Databank available from my Department's website which can be found at .</p></reply>

This method by which this is regulated is set out in the Funding Standard.</p><p>  The majority of defined benefit pension schemes are in deficit and face serious challenges in restoring their funding levels to enable the scheme deliver on the pension promise. It is acknowledged that the fundamental problem facing pension schemes is that pensions are significantly more expensive, due to increasing life expectancy and lower than expected investment returns which are reflect in increased annuity rates.</p><p>  The Funding Standard provides a benchmark against which the &lsquo;health&rsquo; of a scheme can be tested. When a scheme fails the Funding Standard that means that unless some action is taken, the scheme will not be able to pay all the benefits promised. The existence of the Funding Standard itself is not the central issue in relation to whether a scheme is properly funded. Rather the responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that the scheme is properly funded and managed.  However, the Funding Standard does provide the regulatory mechanism for ensuring that a scheme can live up to the &ldquo;promised&rdquo; level of pension benefits.</p><p>  Trustees of a defined benefit pension scheme are required to submit an Actuarial Funding Certificate (AFC) to the Pensions Board at regular intervals to indicate whether or not the scheme has sufficient assets to meet its liabilities.  If an AFC indicates that, in the actuary&rsquo;s opinion, the scheme does not satisfy the Funding Standard on the relevant date, the trustees must submit a Funding Proposal to the Pensions Board outlining how it is proposed to restore scheme funding levels.</p><p>  The funding proposal must set out a contribution plan which the actuary can certify as being such that s/he can reasonably expect its implementation to be sufficient to allow the scheme to satisfy the Standard within the period of the proposal.</p><p>  Section 52 of the 1990 Pensions Act provides that, by way of Regulation, certain defined benefit pension schemes may be exempt from the requirement to comply with the Funding Standard on the basis that &ldquo;some or all of the benefits under specified schemes or categories of schemes are, or may be, paid in whole or in part out of moneys provided from the Central Fund or moneys provided by the Oireachtas&rdquo;. </p><p>  EU Directive 2003/41/EC on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision (the IORPS Directive) is also relevant in this context. It provides that a Member State may choose to exempt a funded defined benefit pension scheme from the application of a national funding standard only if the scheme is &ldquo;made under statute, pursuant to legislation, and is guaranteed by a public authority&rdquo;.  Essentially, in order to exclude a scheme from the requirements of the Funding Standard, the payment of scheme benefits must be guaranteed by the State. </p><p>  The State does not guarantee or accept any liability for the funded schemes of the commercial State companies. In this regard, a case has been made by the ESB Pensions Governance Forum seeking exclusion from the requirements of the Funding Standard. This case is being examined at present.</p></reply>

Company directors holding 50% or more of the shareholding of a company are not normally regarded as falling within a normal employer/employee relationship and are therefore, deemed not to be employed under a contract of service and liable for PRSI Class A contributions (as an employee).  Instead, such company directors are deemed to be employed under a contract for services and to be liable for PRSI Class S contributions (as a self-employed person).

My Department and the bodies funded from its Vote Group are, however, involved in a wide range of cultural and heritage activities which promote Ireland as an attractive tourist destination worldwide. This includes promoting Ireland's history and rich culture through operating and making accessible our National Parks and Nature Reserves, our built heritage and also supporting the National Cultural Institutions and Arts Council in their work in presenting exhibitions and arts events.</p><p>  The Cultural Institution supported by my Department play a key in the development of tourism and the commemoration of particular historic and political events. For example, today members of the Kennedy family and I attended the exhibition in the National Library of Ireland dedicated to the visit of President John F. Kennedy to Ireland in June 1963.</p><p>  The opportunity to promote history-related tourism will be enhanced by certain special anniversaries in the coming years, particularly the millennial anniversary of the Battle of Clontarf in 2014 and the continuing centenary programme relating to the revolutionary period that included the World War, the Easter Rising and culminated in the founding of the Irish State.  In this regard, my Department will be working with all other stakeholders to ensure that the maximum benefit for tourism is obtained from any planned events. I recently met with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland to enhance co-operation between my Department in promoting heritage and cultural tourism and will continue to work with both bodies in order to progress this key agenda for Ireland. </p></reply>

In order to meet our overall 16% requirement, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport from renewable sources. </p><p>  Though these targets are challenging, I am confident that they can be met. My Department's Strategy for Renewable Energy 2012 to 2020 sets out the key strategic goals for the various renewable energy sectors in the context of Ireland's EU obligations. </p><p>  In addition, under the Directive, Ireland was required to set out in a National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) the trajectory towards meeting its legally binding targets.  The NREAP and the First Progress Report on the NREAP, which are available on my Department's website, show the sectoral and technology breakdown that we anticipate in the achievement of our target.</p><p>  By the end of 2011, we had reached 6.4% of overall energy consumption from renewable sources and the trajectory set out in the NREAP assumes that we will achieve the 16% target incrementally at approximately 1% per annum. </p><p>  At end 2012, 19.5% approximately of our electricity consumption was from renewable sources.</p><p>  In 2012 15.5% of Ireland's electricity demand was met by wind generation.  By the end of quarter one<i></i>  2013 1,763 MW of wind generation capacity was connected to the grid, with 238 MW of hydro power and 71 MW of smaller renewable sources (mainly landfill gas and biomass).</p><p>  To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. However, if we are to reach that target, the build rate of onshore wind farms must accelerate from an historic average of 180 MW per year to at least 250 MW per year.  It was for this reason that I decided to amend the terms of REFIT 2 to extend the closing date for applications to 31 December 2015, with projects required to be built by the end of December 2017. Support under REFIT 2 cannot exceed 15 years and will not extend beyond the end of December 2032.</p><p>  In order to take a structured approach to connecting the necessary amounts of renewable generation to the grid, the Commission for Energy Regulation established the Gate 3 process.  Under this process, grid connection offers have been made to around 3,900 MW of renewable generation, the bulk of which is wind. It is now a matter for project developers to accept or reject these offers in the coming months. </p></reply>

The report sets out details of the State Mining Leases, State Mining Licences and Prospecting Licences current as of 31 December 2012, and the total amount of all moneys collected by the Minister under or by virtue of any such Lease or Licence or otherwise in connection with the Minerals Development Acts for the twelve months ended 31 December 2012.  The next such report will be for the six months ending on 30th June 2013.  It will be presented to the Oireachtas as soon as possible thereafter.  Information on all current licences, including maps of locations, is accessible on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  As regards environmental considerations for extraction of minerals, I am precluded by the Environmental Protection Agency legislation from including conditions in a State Mining Lease or License which relate to control of environmental emissions.  These matters are regulated by the Agency under an Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Licence which is a requirement for all operating mines.  In addition, any new mining development requires planning permission.  Planning applications for mines are subject to Environmental Impact Assessment, which involves preparation by the developer of a detailed Environmental Impact Statement.  This must entail consideration of the potential impacts of the project on population, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climatic factors, material assets, including the architectural and archaeological heritage, landscape and the inter-relationship between the above factors, and will include a properly costed closure plan.  It is a requirement of all three permits that a financial surety or bond is in place from the outset to guarantee the availability of funding to implement the closure plan, whether at the end of life of the mine or in the event of premature closure.  </p></reply>

With regard to corporate governance, <i>Guidelines on the Governance of Integrated Local Development Companies and Urban Based Partnerships</i> were issued by the then Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, to all companies on 1 October 2007 (with an addendum to the guidelines issued in June 2009).  The guidelines were designed to assist the companies with the establishment of the company board structure (including the relevant sectors and pillars), and with the prescribed requirements of the Department to enable each Company to ensure eligibility for Departmental and European funding. In addition, the guidelines provided a model Memorandum and Articles of Association, along with a model of Corporate Governance Policy which was adaptable to meet individual requirements. </p><p>  In June 2012, my Department requested that Clondalkin, Palmerstown, Lucan, Newcastle (CPLN) Local Development Company, Dodder Valley Local Development Company and South Dublin County Council develop a plan to establish a single structure for LCDP delivery in the two areas in question.   The new structure, called South Dublin County Partnership Company Ltd was established in 2012. CPLN is therefore no longer contracted to deliver the LCDP on behalf of my Department.  In relation to the particular query raised in the Question, my Department is not aware of any such issue. </p></reply>

From this the National Countryside Recreation Strategy was published in 2006 and &ldquo;Leave No Trace&rdquo; has recently been established as the prevailing code for recreational users of the countryside. </p><p>  Comhairle na Tuaithe has provided a valuable forum bringing key stakeholders together building trust and co-operation. Access to the countryside for recreational users has proven to be an on-going problem for private landowners, state landholders, recreational users and tourists alike but issues have been significantly progressed through the efforts of Comhairle na Tuaithe and the introduction of the Walks Scheme. While the organisations represented on Comhairle na Tuaithe have individual views on many of the issues to be progressed, the National Countryside Recreation Strategy reflects the consensus view of its members. </p><p>Meetings are chaired by my Department. The group meets regularly to discuss and progress matters relating to rural recreation and activity tourism. My Department also sit on the National Trails Advisory Committee which oversees best practice in relation to trail planning and development.   </p><p>  Through Service Level Agreements between my Department and Local Development Companies, Rural Recreational Officers are employed to raise awareness of the walking and activity/recreation product, and to facilitate tourism and marketing initiatives, and they have negotiated and managed Walks Scheme maintenance contracts with over 1800 landowners, all on a permissive access basis. Work has recently commenced on renewing these maintenance contracts for a further five year period. The Rural Recreation Officers now represent a unique resource locally for providing best practice in trail maintenance, management, marketing and the development of a broad range of rural recreation and activity tourism products. </p><p>In light of the committees already in place and the very significant level of progress made through Comhairle na Tuaithe I feel that the establishment of an Access to the Countryside Advisory Council and the appointment or designation of county council officials as access officers is not warranted. There are approximately 620 trails throughout the country listed on the Irish trails website which are all based on permissive access.   </p></reply>

Such decisions are made in the context of the local development strategy of the individual groups and in line with Programme's Operating Rules and EU regulations. The LDCs can approve projects without the approval of my Department. </p><p>My   Department only becomes involved in a project once the Board of the LDC has approved it and the Board minutes are submitted to my Department for review. </p><p>  The only exception to this is projects that request funding of &euro;150,000 or more, these projects are required to seek final approval from my Department. Again, however, this is after Board approval. The assessment of these higher value projects usually involves detailed consultations between my Department and the relevant local development company. </p><p>  The project referred to in the Question is one such project. It was approved by County Kildare LEADER Partnership at their December 2012 Board meeting.  While a list of the projects approved at that meeting, including this project, was submitted to my Department on 21 January, 2013, its eligibility was not reviewed at that time as my Department was awaiting the submission of the entire project file for a full assessment in line with the Programme's Operating Rules. The project file was received in my Department on 3 May 2013. </p><p>The European Commission requires that there is clear demarcation in Member States between various grant schemes to ensure that there is no duplication of funding. In this regard, as there was funding for childcare facilities available from other Government Departments, my Department in setting out the Operating Rules for the RDP excluded projects relating to childcare as eligible activities for funding. The Programme's Operating Rules state &#8220;<i>Aid shall not be awarded or paid in respect of the following mainstream categories&amp;#8230;childcare</i>&#8221;. I understand that the project in question had previously secured funding from the National Childcare Investment Programme but the project did not proceed.   </p><p>  Following an assessment of the file, County Kildare LEADER Partnership was informed that my Department considered the project ineligible on the grounds that it was for the provision of a childcare facility. The Group has been advised that the decision is open to appeal to a Principal Officer in my Department. </p></reply>

However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  All organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.</p><p>  A vetting disclosure is made in response to a written request and with the permission of the person who is the subject of that request.  Garda vetting disclosures are issued to specified organisations registered with GCVU for that purpose in respect of a particular post or employment.  The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012.  The disclosure is made to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued.  Each time a new vetting application is received, a full vetting check is conducted to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.  The non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the certificate protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service.  It also affords the registered organisation the facility to assess suitability based on the most up to date information available on the applicant.</p><p>  I remain in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner as to how best the service can continue to be delivered and improved upon, while at all times protecting the integrity of the process.  Clearly, the protection of children and vulnerable adults is the primary objective of the Garda Central Vetting Unit and this must remain the case.  The possibility of introducing an e-vetting system has been assessed and the Garda authorities are now in the process of developing a system which will enable vetting applications to be submitted electronically through a secure web service.  In addition, the system will facilitate the checking and monitoring of applications.  The relevant work is being pursued on a priority basis and it will be completed as quickly as possible.</p><p>  The Garda Commissioner has informed me that there are currently 1 Superintendent, 2 Sergeants and approximately 113 civilian personnel assigned to the Garda Central Vetting Unit.  This civilian complement includes 23 staff recently transferred from the Department of Agriculture who are undergoing the required training course.  A further 9 personnel were allocated to the GCVU on 13th May 2013 and an additional 6 took up positions on the 31st May 2013.  When these staff have been fully trained on the vetting process I expect there will be a positive effect on vetting times.

The person concerned is the subject of a Deportation Order following a thorough and comprehensive examination of his asylum claim and his application to remain temporarily in the State.  The case of the person concerned was considered under Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).  The outcome of the consideration was that the decision to make a deportation order in respect of him remained unchanged.<i></i>He has no application for residency.  In addition he has been evading his deportation since 3 November, 2009 and should therefore present himself to the Garda Authorities without any further delay.</p><p>  As a general matter of policy, it would be logistically inconsistent to review a person's case who has failed a very fair and comprehensive asylum process, and who have thereafter proceeded to evade their deportation for years, by granting such persons residency in the State.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order remains an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

This permission appears to have been renewed on a regular basis by her local Immigration Officer until March 2010.  I am informed that when she attended the registration office of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) in May 2010, she was advised to contact my officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) regarding same.  However it appears that the next contact from the person concerned was in March 2012 when she presented to her local Immigration Officer.  She was refused registration on this occasion as she has been out of permission since March 2010.  The local Immigration Officer advised her to write to INIS outlining her situation prior to renewal of registration. I am informed that she was given this direction by him on 26th August 2012. <br /><br />  I understand that some documentation has since been received from the person concerned by INIS.  However, in order to assist in regularising her status in the State, further documentation was requested from her in writing on 13th March 2013.  To date no response has been received.  On receipt of the documents requested, her case will then be examined by the relevant officials in INIS.  Once a decision has been made on her status, this decision and the consequences involved will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.  I am also informed that the person concerned submitted an application for a Certificate of Naturalisation in August 2005.  This application was refused by my predecessor at his absolute discretion.  The person's legal representative was notified of the decision and the reason for same by letter dated 31st March 2009.  She may re-apply at any time when in a position to satisfy the statutory requirements.</blockquote>  Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  The conditions are that the applicant must -</p><p>- be of full age;</p><p>- be of good character;</p><p>- have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years;</p><p>- intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and</p><p>- have, <font color="#212100">before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows-</font></p><p><font color="#212100">(i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and</font></p><p><font color="#212100">(ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.</font></p><p>  A foreign national who is married to, or is the Civil Partner of, an Irish citizen for at least three years may apply for naturalisation under section 15A of the Irish Naturalisation and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, where they have been continuously resident in the island of Ireland for the year immediately prior to the date of their application and for two out of the four years prior to that year.  The marriage or civil partnership must be subsisting and recognised under Irish law.  Section 15A provides that the Minister may waive certain conditions for naturalisation if satisfied that the applicant would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship.</p><p>  Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, waive some or all of the statutory conditions in certain circumstances i.e. where an applicant is of Irish descent or of Irish associations; where an applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; or where an applicant is a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless persons.  It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b> The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

This permission was later renewed for a further three years, to 5  September, 2010, and more recently to 21 February, 2013.  </p><p>  On 1 April, 2013, the person concerned sought to have her permission to remain renewed for a further period.  However, her request to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) for renewal of registration was refused on that occasion as she was not in a position to produce a valid passport to attest to her identity and nationality, a stipulation provided for under the provisions of Section 9(2)(a) of the Immigration Act 2004. </p><p>  Given that the permission to remain of the person concerned has lapsed for some four months at this stage, she should now proceed to make a formal written renewal request to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), PO Box 10003, Dublin 1.  Upon receipt of such a request, the position in the State of the person concerned will be further considered.</p><p>  I am advised that there is no record of an application for a Certificate of Naturalisation having been submitted by the person concerned. </p><p>  In relation to the spouse of the person concerned, the position is that his permission to remain was renewed on 29 February, 2012 for a further three years, valid to 20<sup></sup>  February, 2015. However, it would appear that he was unable to obtain GNIB registration for the period set out in his permission to remain decision letter owing to his failure to produce a valid passport to attest to his identity and nationality.  As a result, he was 'registered' for a six month period, valid to 20 August, 2012, to enable him to take whatever steps were necessary to obtain a valid passport and, having done so, to present it to the GNIB so that his period of registration could be renewed in line with the position set out in his permission to remain decision letter, dated 29 February, 2012. </p><p>  The Deputy might wish to note that where a person has been granted permission to remain by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), the provisions of Section 9 (2)(a) of the Immigration Act 2004 require that person to 'register' with the Garda National Immigration Bureau as soon as possible thereafter.  In the context of any application for such registration, the person in question would need to have in their possession the following items:</p><p>(i) their original permission to remain decision letter,</p><p>(ii) their Passport and</p><p>(iii) the requisite registration fee.</p><p>  Given that the spouse of the person concerned has not, to date, produced a current valid passport, to attest to his identity and nationality, he should proceed to do so without further delay and, having done so, he should present it to the GNIB so that his period of registration can be renewed in line with the position set out in his permission to remain decision letter, dated 29 February, 2012. </p><p>  However, in the context of the passport related requirement, Section 9 (2)(a) of the Immigration Act 2004 specifically states that &quot;... he, or she, shall, as soon as may be, furnish to the registration officer ... and, unless he or she gives a satisfactory explanation for the circumstances which prevent his or her doing so, produce to the registration officer a valid passport or other equivalent document, issued by or on behalf of an authority recognised by the Government, which establishes his or her identity and nationality.&quot;  </p><p>  In the event that a person making an application for such registration cannot, in spite of their best efforts, obtain a passport then he or she would need to be able to show, through the production of verifiable documentary evidence, the efforts that they have made to obtain a passport and why they were unable to do so.  Where such verifiable documentary evidence is produced, the Garda National Immigration Bureau has the discretionary powers to effect registration without the production of a valid passport, however, this discretion will only be exercised in the most limited of circumstances.</p><p>  It will be open to the person concerned, and her spouse, to apply to the Citizenship Division of my Department for Certificates of Naturalisation when they are in a position to meet the lawful residency criteria applicable to the lodgment of such applications.  Details on the criteria to be met by persons lodging such applications are available from my Department's Website<font color="#0000FF">)</font>.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The position is unchanged since then:</p><p>The person concerned is a failed asylum applicant. Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 18th August, 2006, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.</p><p>  The person concerned initiated judicial review proceedings in the High Court, challenging the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in her case.  The judicial review proceedings were struck out on 4th July, 2008 meaning that the earlier decisions of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the then Minister stood.  The person concerned submitted an application for subsidiary protection.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</p><p>  In the event that the application for subsidiary protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made.  Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.  Given that the person concerned has no current right of residency in the State, the issue of an application for naturalisation does not arise at this time.</p></reply>

She has been advised to this effect on a number of occasions, most recently in a letter dated 20th November, 2012 sent to her legal representative.</p><p>  Upon receipt of the outstanding documentation, the position in the State of the person concerned can be considered further.  The Deputy should note that as the person concerned has no current right of residency in the State, she would not, at present, be in a position to meet the lawful residency criteria applicable to persons applying to my Department for a Certificate of Naturalisation.  Additionally, while the person concerned had permission to remain in the State for a period between late 2007 and early 2011, this was on the basis of student conditions which would not count as 'reckon-able residency' in the context of an application for a Certificate of Naturalisation.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

It would appear that the person may be in the State unlawfully and in breach of Section 5 (1) of the Immigration Act 2004 which provides that no non EEA national may be in the State other than in accordance with the terms of any permission given to him by or on behalf of the Minister.  Section 5 (2) of the Act provides that a non EEA national who is in the State in contravention of subsection (1) is for all purposes unlawfully present in the State.</p><p>  A person who is found to be in breach of the requirements of the Immigration Act 2004 may have committed an offence.  A person found guilty of such an offence is liable under Section 13 of the Act of 2004 to a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.  It is also likely that the person concerned, if he is in employment, would require a work permit issued by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  In general, a work permit is only issued where there is no Irish or EEA national available and qualified to do the particular job concerned.  A non EEA national who does not have a valid work permit and works in the State is in breach of the Employment Permits Acts 2003 and 2006.  Indeed, the employer is also liable to sanction for breaches of these Acts.  I would strongly advise that, as a matter of urgency, the person concerned contacts the General Immigration Division, INIS, 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 in relation to his situation.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The most recent was by way of correspondence in May 2013 with a request that an assessment of the use of an alternative anti-malaria drug Malaorne for the use of Permanent Defence Force personnel be carried out.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware when I advised in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 29110/13 and 28708/13, malaria is a serious disease that kills approximately 1 million people per year in sub-Saharan Africa alone.  It is a serious threat to any military force operating in the area. The anti-malaria regime in place in the Defence Forces &ndash; including the use of Lariam &ndash; has worked. In the decade of deployment to sub-Saharan Africa by the Defence Forces, not a single member of the Defence Forces has died from malaria and there are only three documented cases of personnel getting malaria.</p><p>  In relation to the use of Malarone, until September 2012, Malarone was only licensed for up to 28 days continuous use. Given that the usual deployment for the Defence Forces is 6 months, Malarone was not an option for the Defence Forces on overseas tours of duty to malarious areas where the duration of the tour exceeded the 28 day licensing limit for the drug. The 28 day limit was removed in September 2012.  There is, however, limited evidence as to the safety and effectiveness of Malarone being used for longer periods and the position is currently being reviewed by the Defence Forces&rsquo; Medical Corps. </p><p>  Over the years concerns have been raised concerning the use of Lariam. I have had all of these /concerns investigated thoroughly and have obtained the advice of leading medical experts, who concur with the practices followed by the Defence Forces in prescribing Lariam.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the anti- malaria regime in place in the Defence Forces, including the use of Lariam has worked.</p></reply>

I am aware that, like many other sectors, farmers can find it difficult to get investment credit due to the stricter assessments introduced as a result of the recent banking crisis. Ensuring that farmers have access to financing for farm investments is a crucial issue for me as ongoing new investment will have a major role to play in improving overall competitiveness at farm level by improving productivity and thus help contribute in meeting our ambitious targets set out in Food Harvest 2020.</p><p>  Despite some concerns expressed about lack of investment credit, a relatively small number of cases from the agri-food sector have come before the Credit Review Office.  I would encourage farmers to make use of this system should they have difficulty in accessing credit for farm investments.  I am aware that a number of banks have designed new credit facilities specifically tailored for the agri-food sector in recent times. In addition, the most recent Central Bank data for lending to SMEs, covering Q1 2013, shows that the primary agriculture sector was top of the list in value terms for new lending to SMEs during the quarter. With a total of &euro;149m, it was far ahead of the second placed wholesale/retail sector on &euro;92m and represented 32%, excluding Financial Intermediation and Property Services, of all such new lending during the period.</p><p>  I will continue to meet with relevant lenders on a regular basis to discuss agri credit issues including the need for them to continue to ensure new credit lines are available for investments in the farming sector.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-20a.577.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013062000064#WRV00700"><p>Commonage lands form an important part of the farming enterprises of many farmers, particularly along the West Coast.  They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism. However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. </p><p>  Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission. It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC (Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition), or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC. It is my stated aim that this will be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State Agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.</p><p>  I readily acknowledge that it will not be an easy task, but it is achievable if all stakeholders work in a co-operative basis. If action is not taken now, the areas will continue to deteriorate and will lead to more land abandonment. If this is allowed to happen, Ireland will lose a valuable resource from the point of view of farming, rural economy, bio-diversity and wildlife. While grazing is the only method of managing these lands, the task facing us is how to ensure that these grazing levels are appropriate to the individual commonages.</p><p>  In order to ensure that the achievement of this objective, as already stated, we need the input of individual shareholders. Grazing plans, at the level of each commonage, will allow for greater flexibility for shareholders and will enable the active farmers to increase their stock to cater for dormant and inactive persons. It will be matter for agreement between the shareholders &ndash; as was always the case &ndash; to decide how best to reach the stocking levels. Professional assistance will be required, in particular where the commonage has been damaged by under-grazing.</p><p>  The Grazing Plan will have to cater the traditional farming methods for the area, with provision made for sheep and other animals, such as cattle, providing that they are appropriate to the habitat. An appropriate time-scale will have to be put in place but the Plan should include the incremental steps to achieve GAEC. The whole concept will be output driven, in that the assessment of the Plans will be based on whether the commonage is in GAEC or not or whether the appropriate progress has been achieved.  </p><p>  Apart from ensuring that the Grazing Plan is valid, there are a number of other complications, including:</p><p>  - Dormant shareholders &ndash; in the majority of cases, these persons are no longer farming;</p><p>  - Current claimants on the commonages, who do not farm or manage the lands. The issue of whether the latter claimants will continue to be eligible for payment will have to be examined.   </p><p>  There are other issues that will need to be considered. These include the fact that many commonage habitats have been significantly damaged by under-grazing, with resulting problems that must be addressed including land abandonment, spread of scrub and invasive species.</p><p>  While it is generally accepted that this is a very complex matter and requires a very detailed action plan to cover the various issues, I intend to set out proposals on how these matters will be progressed in the near future.  </p></reply>

My officials are endeavouring to examine and reply to these correspondents as quickly as possible. In the meantime,  I have outlined, to both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, and in replies to previous Dail questions my response to the distressing events highlighted in this programme.</p><p>  The programme showed us what happens when you don't invest in building an effective system and culture of qualify-focussed, child-centred service provision, and when you don't invest in robust oversight and inspection.</p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to improve the quality of the free Preschool Year and, by extension, the quality of all early childhood care and education, through the implementation of standards and by reviewing training options for the workforce. These commitments have always been a key priority for me.</p><p>As part of this work programme, my Department and I have been progressing work on Ireland's first-ever Early Years Strategy and this why we have been working on a comprehensive<b></b>  Preschool Quality Agenda. </p><p>  We have identified 8 key areas of action which I believe need to be considered and addressed as a matter of urgency:</p><p> - increasing the qualification requirements for all staff in preschool services to a minimum standard at FETAC Level 5;</p><p> - improving the quality and curricular supports for preschool services when implementing the S&iacute;olta Framework and Aistear Curriculum; </p><p> - implementing the new National Preschool Standards;</p><p> - introducing a registration system for all preschool services;</p><p> - taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust;</p><p> - publishing inspection reports on-line as soon as possible;</p><p> - ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance; and</p><p> - increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance.</p><p><b>Increasing the required qualification standards of child care staff</b></p><p>  We are working to increase the required qualification standards of child-care staff. The majority of staff working in the sector now have qualifications to FETAC Level 5 and I believe that this should be made a requirement for all staff working in the sector by September 2015, and for new services by the earlier date of September 2014.  I am also proposing that the minimum qualification requirement for Preschool Leaders within the Preschool Year should be increased from FETAC Level 5 to FETAC Level 6 from those dates also.</p><p><b>Supports for Aistear and S&iacute;olta.</b></p><p>  We are working to improve support and mentoring for individual preschool services in implementing S&iacute;olta and Aistear.  This is essential if we are to ensure that all services understand and implement a child-centred approach to the care and education of young children.</p><p><b>Implementing the new National Preschool Standards.</b></p><p>  We are developing new National Preschool Standards, designed to support providers in delivering a high quality service and parents in choosing the child care best suited to their needs.  New day-care standards have been completed but have not yet been implemented.  Later this year it is intended to launch these standards alongside further standards on sessional care and child-minding which are currently being finalised. These standards will replace all current guidelines and will be implemented and inspected in line with the new registration system and improved inspection systems.</p><p><b>Registration of all child-care providers.</b></p><p>  Work is already underway in the Child and Family Services area of the Health Service Executive (HSE) to introduce a registration system for preschool services.  I understand this system will be in place for new services from the end of this year and will be phased in for existing services thereafter.  This is an important development because it will move services from the current position, where they are required to notify the Preschool Inspectorate of their intention to open, to a requirement to be inspected and found satisfactory, before being permitted to open.  All preschool services are currently required to pay an annual fee to the HSE of between &euro;40 and &euro;80.  I am looking at increasing this fee.  The additional funds raised will assist in improving inspection and supports for quality improvement.</p><p><b>Publication of Inspection Reports.</b></p><p>Parents will rightly demand and expect the highest standards and this will be a key factor in driving change in the sector.  Publishing inspection reports is an essential step in ensuring high standards and accountability. All <i>new</i> inspection reports will be made available on-line from the HSE as a matter of urgency.  All <i>current</i>   inspection reports will be made available on-line in 2014.</p><p><b>Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust.</b></p><p>  We are working on developing a more robust, consistent and regular inspection system  There has been a significant programme of work underway in the HSE over the past year to develop a single, consistent national inspection service (as opposed to 37 different local systems).  </p><p>  We propose moving to a position where there is consistent and assured national target rate for the frequency of inspection of preschool services, while ensuring capacity for prioritisation based on risk assessment.   The HSE is currently reviewing the regional spread of inspectors with a view to identifying whether either additional resources or redeployment of existing inspectors is required to achieve this. </p><p>  Building on this work, officials of my Department and the Department of Education and Skills have been examining options to incrementally develop a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for preschools; moving away from a narrow focus on compliance, and leading to a greater focus on children's outcomes, including educational development and child well-being.  This work is being informed by the findings of a recent Joint Pilot Inspection carried out in a small number of settings by Inspectors from the Health Service Executive and the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p><b>Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance.</b></p><p>  We are working to ensure consistent action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance. There must be a follow-through on inspections.  Clearly, services which are found to be in serious breach of the Regulations will face closure and prosecution.   It is proposed to develop a protocol with the Preschool Inspectorate which will take a calibrated approach and which will enable more decisive action to be taken in response to non-compliance.</p><p><b>Increased Sanctions for non-compliance.</b></p><p>  My Department will also be undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (No. 2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.  The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution, as is currently the case.  </p><p>  The recent broadcast highlighted practices on the part of individual staff members which were of very serious concern.  The responsibility of management must also be the subject of questioning.  Management is responsible for the selection and training of staff, the development of operational policies and practices and the management of day to day service delivery.  Most of all management is responsible for the culture and ethos of the preschool - they set the tone through their example, their interaction with children and parents and their guidance of staff.  </p><p>  This preschool quality agenda represents an essential building block towards the future extension of universal preschool provision; including the objective which I have previously spoken of in relation to introducing a second free preschool year. </p><p>  I believe it is critical to the quality agenda for early childhood care and education that my Department continues to work in close co-operation with the Department of Education and Skills, given the overlap of interest between the Departments in regard to education for children under 6 years of age, as reflected in S&iacute;olta, Aistear and the Workforce Development Plan, and the professional training role of the State funded training bodies.  The two Departments are already working together on these issues and on the development of a joint approach to preschool inspection.</p></reply>

This funding is being allocated to each HSE Region based on its percentage of population. Both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of the funding in a creative and flexible manner so as to secure as many places as possible for this cohort.  </p><p>  The demand for services for school-leavers continues to grow. The HSE expects that approximately 700 young people who have finished their education or life-skills training will require services in 2013.  Providing the level of services required within the additional funding provided will continue to be a challenge. Work in this area will be progressed largely in line with the HSE guidance document developed in 2012, which led to the successful placement of 99% of RT graduates and 96% of school leavers last year. </p><p>  It is envisaged that plans will be completed for each region shortly and submitted to Area Managers, Regional Specialists and Regional Director of Operations for agreement.  Arising from completed and approved plans, a communication process will be agreed with service providers to inform families of the services that will be available from September 2013. </p><p>  In respect of the specific question asked by the Deputy, as it relates to service matters I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The FCTC is the first international treaty negotiated under the auspices of WHO.  Article 11 of the Treaty relates to the packaging and labelling of tobacco products and in the Guidelines for the implementation of Article 11 Parties to the Treaty are requested to consider adopting standardised /plain packaging for tobacco products.  </p><p>  A considerable number of studies relating to tobacco packaging have been conducted internationally and as such it would not be possible for me to list all of the studies that have taken place in this regard.  However, the studies I was referring to in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 1019 includes one of the most comprehensive and recent reviews carried out in this area.  This review, entitled &quot;Plain Tobacco Packaging: A Systematic Review&quot; (Moodie et al), outlines the findings of  37 studies and provides evidence on the impacts of standardised/plain tobacco packaging.  The review included studies from 1980 up to the time of its publication.  The primary aim of the review was to assess the impact of standardised or plain packaging on the appeal of the packaging or product, the salience and effectiveness of health warnings and the perceptions of product strength and harm.  The review concluded that there is strong evidence to support the introduction of standardised/plain packaging.</p></reply>

A significant amount of preparatory work has already been completed.<b></b>A research review funded by the Atlantic Philanthropies to lay the foundations for the Strategy, titled <i>Creating Excellence in Dementia Care, A Research Review for Ireland's National Dementia Strategy</i> was published in January 2012.

While the development of the Strategy will have to have due regard to the constraints imposed by the budgetary situation, it is intended that it will be a transformative Strategy. It will have a very practical focus, will be action oriented and will focus on what can be done to make a difference to the lives of people with dementia.

Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to appropriate quality long-term residential care. Access to appropriate quality long-term residential care is underpinned by both the system of registration and inspection of nursing homes and the financial support available under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.</p><p>Essentially, our aim is to ensure that people are being cared for at the point of lowest complexity. People should only be entering long-term nursing home when they have passed the point of being able to be cared for at home. This means that only the most highly dependent people should be in long-term nursing home care. One of the key priorities identified in the HSE's <i>National Operational Plan 2013</i> is the progression of a Single Assessment Tool for older people. This standardised framework will ensure that there is a robust, equitable standardised care needs assessment nationally. It will also allow resources to be targeted towards those with the greatest needs and enable supports and services to be designed in the most appropriate way possible. The Nursing Homes Support Scheme applies to public, private and voluntary nursing homes and includes a principle of resident choice, i.e. the resident chooses their nursing home themselves, subject to the availability of a bed and the ability of the nursing home to meet their care needs. When a person selects a particular nursing home, that nursing home will carry out an assessment to ensure that it can meet the person's care needs. It is a matter for each private nursing home to determine, having regard to its Statement of Purpose etc., whether it can meet the persons care needs. Patients in acute hospitals that have difficulty finding a nursing home that can meet their particular care requirements are generally those that are most highly dependent. In the majority of cases, this category of patients are ultimately accommodated in public nursing homes. The Department is working closely with the HSE to develop an overall plan regarding future public nursing home provision for the Minister's consideration. The plan will reflect regional need and have regard to the current severe financial constraints, restrictions on public sector staffing and recruitment and the on-going need to meet service and safety standards; all of which pose challenges for community nursing units across the country.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is currently the subject of a review. The terms of reference for this review are as follows; taking account of Government policy, demographic trends and the fiscal situation; to examine the on-going sustainability of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme; to examine the overall cost of long term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices; having regard to 1 and 2 above, to consider the balance of funding between long-term residential care and community based services; to consider the extension of the scheme to community based services and to other sectors (Disability and Mental Health), and to make recommendations for the future operation and management of the Scheme. The review will look at possible alternative models of care. Work will continue on the review in the coming months with a view to completion by end 2013-early 2014.</p></reply>

This is at the discretion of the marketing authorisation holders. The standard industry practice across Europe is for prescription tablets to be packaged in sizes of 28, as this number has been found to be convenient for patients. Where the quantity of a preparation prescribed does not correspond with an original pack size and it is not feasible to supply the exact amount prescribed, the pharmacist may, in the exercise of his or her professional judgement and bearing in mind the nature of the product and his or her statutory obligations, supply the nearest pack size to the quantity prescribed.</p><p>  It is a condition of the Drug Payment Scheme that no individual or family grouping will pay more than &euro;144 in a calendar month (i.e.&euro;144 x 12 in a full year). The payment of a second &euro;144 (in the same pharmacy) should only arise when a person is intentionally getting the next month&rsquo;s supply on the grounds that he/she will be away the following month or for other such reason. To ensure that an individual or family makes no more than 12 payments in a year it is suggested by the HSE that, where appropriate, once in a 12-month period or periodically throughout the year more than a 28-day supply is given. The packaging will influence how this can be achieved.</p></reply>

All medicines containing fluoxetine authorised for the Irish market are Prescription Only Medicines, i.e. may only be supplied on foot of a prescription from a medical practitioner. Fluoxetine products are used to treat major depressive episodes, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Bulimia Nervosa. In the prescribing information, the usual starting dose of fluoxetine is 20 mg daily for adults. It may be necessary for the prescriber to increase the dose depending on the response of the patient to a maximum of 60 mg daily for adults. As for all prescribed medicines, patients who have been prescribed fluoxetine medicines should be reviewed periodically by their treating medical practitioner to ensure that both the medicine and the dose continue to be a suitable treatment for the individual patient.</p><p>  There are no dosage criteria in place for prescribed drugs and medicines reimbursed under the GMS or other community drug schemes operated by the HSE. Prescribers are responsible for prescribing the appropriate dosage level of a medicine in accordance with the patient's clinical needs. The supply of prescription medicines is controlled in law in a number of ways. Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, it is prohibited for a person to supply a prescription only medicine except in accordance with a prescription, and the supply must be made from a registered pharmacy by or under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist. A person who contravenes these Regulations is guilty of an offence.</p></reply>

They are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months. For persons with a terminal illness, no means test applies.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months. Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

Given the limited funds available, the decision was taken that the main priority to 2016 is to protect investment made to date, to maintain safety standards. and to progress affordable projects  such as Luas Cross City which add value to the existing network.  </p><p>  While Metro North was being procured as a Public Private Partnership (PPP) with a targeted  EIB loan of up to &euro;500 million it also required a very significant Exchequer contribution to support the PPP. This Exchequer contribution is not affordable within the funding envelope now available for transport projects to 2016. In addition, the successful awarding of a major PPP contract involving private funding of the size required for  Metro North is challenging at any time but is particularly challenging in current circumstances. The road  PPPs currently being progressed require a much smaller private sector involvement and do not require any further  Exchequer support  for construction.  Furthermore, securing the closure of these much smaller roads PPPS has proven challenging, with only one, so far, having being brought to financial close since 2008.</p><p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) is currently preparing an Integrated Implementation Plan for investment to 2018  in the GDA as required under the DTA ACT 2008. This plan will address the investment needs of the Swords /Airport corridor to 2018 based on available funding and will be subject to public consultation later this year. Furthermore I have asked my officials to prepare a Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport which will inform future investment plans and this work which will include a review of Metro North as well as other projects is underway.  Metro North is postponed not cancelled and is kept under review.  </p></reply>

The carrying out of works on these roads is a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The selection and prioritisation of road works to be funded from these State grants is also a matter for the local authority.  In carrying our the selection and prioritisation of road works, individual councils should ensure as far as practicable that priority is given to projects most requiring attention in the county as a whole and are reminded in the Memorandum on Grants for Regional and Local Roads that projects should be prioritised based on engineering need and structural deficiency within their entire network of regional and local roads.</p><p>  While the Department has no input into how a council allocates its own resources expenditure, it is hoped, particularly given the current financial circumstances, that this funding too is allocated to areas most in need.  The area engineer, in consultation with elected members, is best placed to prioritise projects and how funding should be allocated from own resources expenditure and I do not intend to direct county managers on this issue.  Under section 70 of the Roads Act 1993, it is the responsibility of landowners and occupiers of land to take all reasonable care to ensure that trees, hedges and other vegetation growing on their land are not a danger to people using or working on a public road.  I have no plans to amend this legislation.</p></reply>

To assist in setting these special speed limits, my Department issued Guidelines for the Application of Special Speed Limits to all local authorities in January 2011 and the onus is on local authorities to take them into account in relation to any special speed limits which they set.</p><p>  The purpose of these guidelines is to provide advice and guidance in relation to the making of speed limit bye-laws by county and city councils for the purpose of applying special speed limits. After taking the guidelines into account it is considered best practice for local authority officials to advise the elected members of their respective councils on what a suitable speed limit regime should be for different roads in their areas of responsibility. For new roads the local authority would have access to the the relevant technical information relating to the speed for which the road was designed.</p><p>  As part of a Direction given by the then Minister in January 2011, all local authorities were requested to undertake an assessment of special speed limits in their functional areas. I do not believe that the local authorities sufficiently engaged with this direction and as a result in 2012, I announced that a review of speed limits would be undertaken and to that end, my Department established a stakeholder group to progress this work. The Automobile Association, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Road Safety Authority, the National Roads Authority, representatives of local authorities and the National Transport Authority accepted my invitation to participate in the Working Group.  As the Deputy will appreciate, this is an issue which requires detailed consideration. I anticipate that the Group will report to me shortly, and I will give careful consideration to any recommendations contained in their Report.</p></reply>

The Council meets in this format in order to make decisions on common policies and approaches in the area of transport including areas where there may be scope to better integrate transport provision throughout the island.</p><p>  The most recent NSMC meeting in Transport Sectoral format took place on 17th April in Armagh. The meeting was attended by Alex Attwood MLA, Minister for the Environment in Northern Ireland, Danny Kennedy MLA Minister for Regional Development in Northern Ireland, and me. Amongst the agenda items for this meeting was an update on the A5 and A8 major road projects; a progress report on the work which is underway to allow for the mutual recognition of penalty points; a review of the ongoing cooperation in the areas of road user and vehicle safety as well as a discussion on EU matters which impact on the transport sector in the two jurisdictions. Other items which have previously featured on the agenda at NSMC Transport meetings have included the All Island Freight Forum, developments on the Dublin/Belfast Rail line and cross-border community based rural transport.</p><p>  The next NSMC meeting in Transport Sectoral format is scheduled for 28th November 2013.  I look forward to the very positive cooperation in the transport area continuing and to availing of any other beneficial opportunities for north/south cooperation, including in relation to an integrated transport system, in the future.</p></reply>

Conditions were attached to the permission which included the development of a scheme of demand management measures. The NRA in conjunction with the relevant local authorities have been working on such a scheme.    </p><p>  When I took over as Minister for Transport I undertook a review of tolling policy.  Having reviewed the position and and in the context of budgetary measures increasing VAT and carbon tax I came to the decision in late 2011 that new tolls would not be introduced during my term as Minister for Transport. In relation to the M50 specifically, the likely impact of multi-point tolling will be to push vehicles on to other roads and through local communities. At present, congestion is not the problem that it was when An Bord Pleanala granted permission to the M50 upgrade, but it will re-emerge as an issue if and when the economy recovers. At that point we will need a joined-up solution to deal with congestion across the Greater Dublin Area, and not just on the M50.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-20a.768.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013062000065#WRDD00400"><p>I have answered a series of questions (Nos. 26589 &ndash; 26592 on 30thMay 2013) which contain a substantial amount of information in relation to the operation of Gift / Book shops at sites managed by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and which may be of assistance to the Deputy.   As indicated at that time, there are two types of retail operation at heritage visitor sites managed by the OPW; the first is where a small amount of material is sold directly by the sites themselves; the second is where a franchise operation manages the retail operation separate from the OPW.</p><p>  The majority of the 70 attended visitor sites managed by the OPW do not operate a separate retail outlet for gift merchandise but sell limited visitor material on an across the counter basis.  As this operation is managed by site Guide staff as part of their normal range of duties, it is not therefore feasible to derive accurate figures in relation to the cost base for the retail activity (as opposed to all of the separate guiding and related duties), and information relating to the profit generated by such activity is not available.   In the main, the kind of merchandise sold is low volume and focusses, for the most part, on postcards and publications related to the site or other historical sites nearby.</p><p>  Two visitor sites, namely Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne (Newgrange) Visitor Centre in Co. Meath and Dublin Castle have designated retail outlets which operate on a franchise basis.  The type of merchadise sold at these locations is much more varied and would encompass what might be termed more general visitor memorabilia rather than the historic publications material found at the majority of OPW manned sites.</p><p>  In the case of Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne Visitor Centre, the franchise operation was introduced in June 2012 with a fee of &euro;20,000 per annum payable. The fees for 2010, 2011 and 2012 in respect of Dublin Castle Gift Shop amounted to &euro;19,046.16. </p><p>  In general, the majority of OPW visitor sites have limited space and facilities to operate a retail outlet.   The primary focus at OPW sites is on the preservation and presentation of the sites in question and the commercial activity referred to is largely secondary.   The scope to develop more substantial retail outlets is therefore to an extent curtailed by both the lack of physical space and the distraction from the core aim.   There are consequently no immediate plans for the development / expansion of this area of operations, though additional franchise operations will be considered where space and other consi  derations permit.</p></reply>

Last year over 83% (428,000) of all persons applying for their passports in the State used Passport Express Irish citizens applied for their passports through Passport Express.  </p><p>  There is no requirement for applicants or parents of applicants to present at a passport office in person.  However for those who have non-emergency urgent travel, the Passport Service now operates an appointment system and extended opening hours in our Molesworth St office.  This has significantly reduced the incidence of queues and reduced waiting time for members of the public.  The should be noted that the minimum turn around time for a passport is 3 working days. </p><p>  In cases of genuine emergency every effort is made by the Passport Service to meet a travel date where the Passport Service is satisfied that:</p><p>  - the proposed journey is related to the death or serious injury or illness abroad of a close relative or a medical emergency relating to the applicant him/herself; and</p><p>  - the presence of the applicant at the foreign location in connection with such an unexpected event is necessary or highly desirable; and</p><p>  - the need to travel has arisen at short notice.</p><p>  Additionally, my Department provides a Duty Officer Service outside normal office hours to deal with matters requiring immediate attention, including the issue of passports. </p></reply>

The Government is acutely aware of the significant difficulties some homeowners are facing in meeting their mortgage and other debt obligations and it is committed to advancing appropriate measures to assist those mortgage holders who are experiencing genuine difficulty.  </p><p>  The Government has put in place a comprehensive strategy to address the problem of mortgage arrears.  The implementation of this strategy is overseen at Government level by a special Government Sub-Committee chaired by An Taoiseach, and at official level by a high level Steering Group chaired by my Department's Secretary General or other senior officials.  This Steering Group consists of senior officials from the Departments of the Finance, An Taoiseach, Environment, Community and Local Government, Justice and Equality, Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as the Central Bank and the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  This Group meets on a fortnightly basis and its purpose is to co-ordinate and drive the implementation of the strategy across Government and to receive and monitor the reports from the relevant Departments and agencies on the implementation of their respective areas of the overall strategy.</p><p>  Following on from the recommendations of the 2011 Inter-Departmental Report on Mortgage Arrears, the main elements of the mortgage arrears strategy are: </p><p><b>  - Innovative Personal Insolvency Reform:</b>  The Personal Insolvency Act, in place since the end of 2012, now provides accessible statutory insolvency frameworks to allow debtors and creditors reach arrangements to resolve unsustainable mortgage and personal debt positions.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland, which was officially launched in April, will oversee the operation of the new insolvency frameworks and will very soon be in a position to commence processing insolvency applications.</p><p><b>  - Comprehensive Advice and Guidance:</b>  In addition to existing arrangements, the Government has introduced a range of information and guidance resources to assist mortgage holders through what can be a difficult and stressful process.  A dedicated website, <i>,</i> has been put in place to provide general public information on mortgages arrears issues.  In addition, there is a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline, which was established under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, to provide more tailored information to individual callers.  Finally, a panel of accountants has been put in place to provide &#8220;one to one&#8221; independent advice to borrowers who have been provided a long term forbearance resolution offer by their lender in respect of a mortgage on their primary home.  All of these information services are provided at no direct charge to the users of the service.</p><p><b>  - Keeping families in their homes:  </b>As a social housing response, a &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; scheme is now in place on a nationwide basis.  This option is available to households who have unsustainable mortgages and who would qualify for social housing support.  Provided they meet this and other appropriate criteria, this allows families, in the context of an agreed resolution to an unsustainable mortgage, to remain in their home.</p><p><b>  - Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategies:</b>  The implementation of sustainable mortgage arrears solutions by individual banks for their distressed customers, with Central Bank oversight, is a key element of the overall framework to address the mortgage arrears problem.  The Central Bank initiative announced last March, sets time bound and measurable targets for the main banks, requiring them to systematically address their arrears book.  This is a very important step to resolve the impasse on arrears.  The Central Bank is initially requiring the main mortgage lenders to propose sustainable solutions to 20% of mortgages that are in arrears (of over 90 days) by end June.  The target rises to 30% by the end of September and to 50% by the end of December 2013.  The Central Bank will monitor and audit the performance of banks in relation to the targets and, crucially, will also assess whether the modifications provided are in fact sustainable solutions.  More recently, the Central Bank also announced a pilot initiative for the restructuring of multiple debt situations to test the viability of a negotiated approach where there is more than one lender involved.  In that overall context, and also in the context of the Central Bank's role in the area of protecting the consumer of financial services, I have also asked my officials to forward the submission from the organisation referred to by Deputy to the Central Bank for its attention and necessary follow up.</p></reply>

This increase is an international phenomenon. Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions.</p><p>  The function of my Department in relation to fuel prices is confined to taxes imposed on fuel.  In this regard, the Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase.  On the other hand, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  It should be noted however that businesses are entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on fuel.  For example, VAT incurred on auto-diesel and marked gas oil (MGO or green diesel) used in the course of business is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system.  There are no plans for taxation adjustments in this area as to do so could lead to significant costs to the Exchequer.</p></reply>

It should be noted, however, that under section 112 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, moneylenders are prohibited from increasing charges for credit should a consumer be in a default position.  The Central Bank has also informed me that they are in the process of conducting research into the moneylending industry and intends to publish the research findings later this year.

The following table which has been provided to me by Permanent TSB sets out the latest available deficits in the schemes as at 31 December 2012 and the number of members, deferred pensioners and pensioners of each of the schemes as at 31 December 2011.

Permanent TSB has informed me that contributions to this scheme ceased in March 2013 and the active employees are included in the Defined Contribution schemes from June 2013.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware a hearing is scheduled at the Labour Court on 21 June 2013 in relation to this matter.

I can inform the Deputy that I have not been asked, and am not required, under the terms of the Relationship Framework to give approval for a wind-up of Permanent TSB's defined benefit pension schemes.</p></reply>

The deputy will be aware that for a debtor to avail of bankruptcy in any given jurisdiction he/she must first of all establish that jurisdiction as his/her centre of main interest (COMI).  The establishment of COMI is a matter for the relevant authorities in the jurisdiction in which bankruptcy is sought.  NAMA advises that in each instance of bankruptcy involving a NAMA debtor it reviews its options and selects the most appropriate method of ensure the best possible return for the taxpayer. NAMA advises that it is currently challenging bankruptcy applications on the basis of COMI in two instances and in a further case is supporting the application of another secured bank with a view to having bankruptcy proceedings take place in Ireland.</p><p>  As advised in NAMA's Annual Report and Financial Statements, the Agency, as a secured creditor, is generally neutral on the locus of bankruptcy proceedings and its experience has been that the location has not tended to prejudice recoveries.  This position is based in part on its positive on-going engagement with several bankruptcy trustees of NAMA debtors who have been adjudged bankrupt in the UK.  The Agency also advises that the bankruptcy regime in the UK is well established, sophisticated and that bankruptcy trustees under the UK system possess extensive powers to compel production of legal and banking information, on a cross-border basis, from the bankrupt. These powers have been used in bankruptcy cases involving NAMA debtors to uncover significant undeclared assets.</p><p>  NAMA further advises that the comparatively shorter duration of bankruptcy in, for example, the UK is not a consideration for the Agency as the bankrupt's assets remain in the control of the bankruptcy trustee long after the bankrupt may have been discharged from bankruptcy and any failure to make full disclosure may result in the period of bankruptcy being extended.  NAMA advises that it challenges the release from bankruptcy of any debtor in instances where there is non-cooperation with the bankruptcy trustee.</p><p>  I am advised by NAMA that a total of 56 NAMA debtors have been declared bankrupt: 11 in Ireland, 44 in the UK and 1 in the US.  Debtors who have been declared bankrupt outside of Ireland had, by reference to the nominal or par value of loans, exposure to debt of approximately &euro;8 billion at the time of NAMA's acquisition of loans from the participating institutions.  NAMA has enforced over the assets securing these loans and continues to realise these assets.  When a debtor goes bankrupt what is generally available is the remaining unencumbered or unsecured assets.  The role of the bankruptcy trustee is, therefore, to realise any other residual unencumbered assets, including properties and cash, which the bankrupt may have and to make a distribution to the creditors including NAMA.  The bankruptcy trustee can also seek to have the bankrupt contribute from post-bankruptcy earnings through an income payment order.</p></reply>

This means, for example, that a business which engages in online bookmaking and which accepts bets from people in this country will be liable for betting duty on those bets, irrespective of where that business is based. The existing betting duty (1%) will be applied to such bets. The Finance Act also provides for the taxation of Betting Exchanges under the new arrangements; however the calculation of the tax will take account of their particular business model, in other words a 15% tax on the commission charged. In addition, excise duties are being applied to the granting and renewal of remote bookmakers&rsquo; and remote betting intermediaries&rsquo; licences. </p><p>  The Betting (Amendment) Bill, which will establish the regulatory framework for the licensing regime, was published in July last year.  Since that date work has been continuing by officials of my Department and Revenue on the drawing up of a number of amendments to the Bill to strengthen enforcement measures.  It is my intention, given the number of amendments, to go back to Government in the very near future for approval to republish the Bill.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that under the EU Technical Standards and Regulations Directive it will be necessary to show the published Bill to the EU Commission and other Member States, which could take 3 months for clearance. However, I hope to use this time to progress the Bill through the D&aacute;il subject to scheduling agreement between the Whips.</p><p>The tax changes provided for in the Finance Act can only be implemented once the Betting (Amendment) Bill is enacted.  While it is difficult to predict, the anticipated yield from online betting duty is estimated to be &euro;20 million in a full year. </p></reply>

Such a restriction would run counter to the EU-wide common system of VAT established on the principle that VAT is a general tax on consumption, exactly proportional to the price of the goods and services, however many transactions take place in the production and distribution process before the stage at which the tax is charged.  This principle is set out in Article 1 of the EU VAT Directive (Council Directive 2006/112/EC). Article 168 of the VAT Directive states that in so far as goods and services are used for the purposes of taxed transactions of a taxable person, the taxable person shall be entitled to deduct the VAT due or paid in respect of supplies to him of goods or services.  This right to deduct input VAT has been confirmed by the European Court of Justice in many cases brought before it.</p></reply>

Schools must apply directly to the Department with applications required to be supported with a report prepared by a professional who has assessed the individual special pupil's needs. Only furniture approved by the Department in such cases will be funded. Therefore the specific needs of each individual special needs pupil are required to be identified and supported by a statement to be submitted by the pupil's professional advisor with supporting information and details. This has not happened to date in this instance. On receipt of such information the matter will be explored further and a decision issued.  </p></reply>

The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required to ensure such placements are provided for.</p><p>Pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05.</p><p>Pupils with Down syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities. </p><p>My Department requested that the NCSE consider the issue of whether Down syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, in the context of its preparation of comprehensive advice on how the educational system supports children with special educational needs in schools. </p><p>The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category. </p><p>The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down syndrome pupils who are in the Mild General Learning Difficulty (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD. </p><p>It has not been recommended that an exception should be made for children with Down syndrome who are in the mild general learning difficulty range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.</p><p>However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs. </p><p>I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report. </p></reply>

Schools will be given flexibility to shape their own junior cycle programme by including a selection of subjects, short courses and other learning experiences that will allow their students to meet the requirements of the twenty-four statements of learning outlined in the Framework. Under the current system only 52% of schools - the voluntary secondary schools - are obliged to provide History as core. Yet 90% of students present for History in the Junior Certificate.  </p><p>History will become a discrete subject under the Framework. New specifications for History will be developed in for implementation in schools from September 2017 . In the event that a student does not study History as a discrete subject, there will be a requirement of schools to ensure that students meet the statements of learning, including &quot;values local, national and international heritage, understands the importance of the relationship between past and current events and the forces that drive change&quot;. Individual schools will have the flexibility to decide how they may do this. For example, a school or group of schools in a town, may opt to develop a short course in History to reflect a particular historical event relevant to their area. </p><p>I met with the representatives of the History Teachers' Association of Ireland in early 2012 and the discussion at that meeting helped to inform the final Framework document. I have every confidence that the changes envisaged in Framework for Junior Cycle will ensure that the place of historical study will be retained and given a new impetus across the junior cycle curriculum. Such an impetus should help to improve take up of History at senior cycle also.</p></reply>

Since I became Minister for Education and Skills, I have attempted to take steps to reduce the burden on families.  Shortly after coming into office, I met members of the Irish Educational Publishers Association and impressed on them the need to limit the cost of textbooks.  I also stressed to them the real need to avoid placing schools and families in a position where textbooks are altered unnecessarily.  The association responded positively to my approaches and agreed a voluntary code of practice among its members.  The code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years.  The publishers have also given me assurances that they will sell textbooks to schools at discounts so that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock textbook rental schemes.  All these developments are welcome.  I look forward to seeing the members of the Association implement these commitments.  The Department provided approximately &euro;15 million to first and second level schools by way of book grants in 2012.  The same level of funding will be provided in 2013.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware I launched new Guidelines for Developing Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools on 28 January last.  These guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated.  The aim of the guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes.  The publication of these guidelines followed a survey of schools by the Department, which I published in May 2012. T his had a 99% response rate at primary level, and showed that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme.  At second level, the response rate was lower, at 44%.  Of those which did respond, 88% of those in the VEC sector and 73% of those in the Community and Comprehensive sector operated a book rental scheme.  I believe these results show we have a good foundation to build on across the country. I  hope that schools that are not yet operating book rental schemes will be encouraged to use the guidelines to introduce them.  If they do, it will result in substantial savings for parents.  Schools which already have rental schemes can save parents up to 80% of the cost of buying new books.  A special Guide for Parents was also published to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them.</p><p>  I have been very clear in my support for book rental schemes.  All of us who are parents know how expensive textbooks can be and what a burden they place on already hard-pressed families at the start of every school year.  I am pleased to see the high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary level.  I believe these guidelines will encourage this practice across all schools in our education landscape.  I published a report on Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools and the Allocation of Textbook Grants by the Department of Education and Skills in May 2012.  This report presented four policy options to encourage schools to establish textbook rental schemes.  None of the options is ideal, as each involves a trade-off of advantages and disadvantages.  I will continue to monitor the number of schools operating book rental schemes and, if necessary, consider further steps to encourage schools to do so.  Educational book publishers are independent private companies and are not under the direct control of my Department.  Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second level, mainly in the case of language subjects, decisions on textbooks are taken at school level.  Individual schools need to adopt a more cost-conscious approach to the selection of books in their classes.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.  All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013-14 school year by 15 March 2013.  The NCSE has been processing these applications and schools will be notified by SENOs of their resource teaching and SNA allocation for 2013-14 in advance of the coming school year, based on the number of valid applications received.  I assure the Deputies that this process has been done as expeditiously as possible by the NCSE to allow schools and principals sufficient time to plan for the coming school year.  As the NCSE allocates resources to schools to support over 30,000 pupils annually, some time is required to process all of the applications which are received each year, in advance of notifying schools of their allocations.  I can advise the Deputy that the NCSE published details of allocations for SNAs and resource teaching hours for the 2013-14 school year yesterday, Wednesday, 19 June.  These details are now available on the NCSE website, <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.  They detail the allocations made for each school on a per county basis.</p></reply>

The walls are quite easily scaled in certain parts and the grounds are frequented by drug users and people abusing alcohol generally during the hours of darkness and especially at weekends. The grounds had been opened to the general public by the Office of Public Works, from 9.30 am to 5.00 pm, Monday to Saturday, in line with the opening hours of the nearby National Museum.  Unfortunately, it was becoming increasingly common for OPW staff to discover used syringes among other rubbish discarded by drug users.  In October 2012 a decision was taken to close the area to the public on health and safety grounds, as sufficient resources are not available to the OPW to sterilise the entire area every day before opening the gates. OPW considered that the risks associated with discarded needles were too great too continue to allow access to either their staff or the public.</p><p>  However OPW has been exploring ways of re-opening Croppies Acre and discussions are ongoing with Dublin City Council's Parks Department, in relation to the granting of a licence to the Council to manage and maintain the park.</p></reply>

The Government must also try to ensure that the available resources are spent carefully and that critical services continue to be delivered.</p><p>  I am aware of recent calls for an &#8220;Equality Budgeting&#8221; approach.  Many aspects of the expenditure reforms that I have been progressing - notably with regard to enhanced levels of transparency and the publication of a draft budget, which allows for public consultation and debate on the particulars of the budget before it is finalised - are already responding to this.  </p><p>  As you know, the new 'whole-of-year-budgeting' reform, announced in the <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014 </i>enhances the role and the policy relevance of the Oireachtas in particular with regard to the role of Committees in <i>ex ante</i> consideration of resource allocation priorities in each area.  This provides a forum in which Oireachtas Committees and Departments can assess and discuss the equality implications of any policy proposal in advance of the final Estimates.  Furthermore, the Government Programme places emphasis upon performance and delivery across public administration.  Performance Budgeting builds performance information right into the heart of the budget documentation and shows what outputs and outcomes are being delivered with public funds.  This information is now publicly available on the IrelandStat website and links the Government goals with associated outcomes.  </p><p>  A recent OECD report (titled &#8220;Crisis squeezes income and puts pressure on inequality and poverty&#8221;), published on 15 May, found that income distribution among Irish households was more equal than the average across the rest of all other OECD nations.  In addition to this, the most recent Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) 2011 illustrates the strong performance of social transfers in protecting those on the lowest incomes. In 2011, social transfers (including pensions) reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate from 50.7 per cent to 16 per cent.</p><p>  The Programme for Government contains a clear commitment that all public bodies would take due note of equality and human rights in carrying out their functions. The State and its bodies must, of course, comply with all provisions of equality legislation in the development and delivery of policies and services.</p><p> Finally, Cabinet procedures require that proposals put to Government indicate clearly whether there is any impact of the proposal on, amongst other things, gender equality, persons experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion and people with disabilities and these considerations are taken into account when taking Government decisions on Budget matters.</p></reply>

Policies are under constant review to ensure the best outcomes in meeting the operational requirements of client Departments in terms of location, size, cost, sustainability and that particular operational needs are delivered.  New initiatives in this regard include the development of a new standard office workplace specification and a review of office space allocation norms.</p><p>In recent years there have been substantial changes within the Civil Service in terms of numbers of employees, departmental and agency breakdown and in changing locational needs. The Commissioners have shifted focus to rationalisation of the existing property portfolio to address the reduced demand for office space. There is a time lag between the reduction in demand for space and the disposal of surplus space, particularly in the current poor market. Notwithstanding this, The Commissioners have succeeded in reducing the office property footprint every year since 2008, by a total of almost 1 million sq.ft. (c. 88,000 m.sq.) This ongoing programme of rationalisation has also driven down annual rental expenditure by almost &euro;30m since 2009.</p><p>The table schedules the current live leases held by the Commissioners of Public Works where an &lsquo;Upward Only&rsquo;

However, it is important to note that since the publication of &ldquo;Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016: Medium Term Exchequer Framework&rdquo; in November 2011 no further cuts have been made to the capital programme. That publication was the result of a major review of capital expenditure. It prioritised investment in infrastructure which would be most beneficial to supporting economic growth, thereby supporting sustainable employment growth in the medium term, meeting urgent social needs and maintaining our existing stock of infrastructure. It also took account of the fact that &euro;70 billion had been invested in the previous decade.</p><p>  At the time of publication of the report I noted that, should a funding source become available, there was much more that I wanted to deliver through investment in infrastructure. The deal I negotiated with the Troika with regard to the proceeds from the sale of State assets and the recovery of the PPP market are allowing us to now progress additional projects which we could not include in the 5 year framework.</p><p>  In July 2012, I announced a Stimulus Plan of &euro;2.25bn, comprising a &euro;1.4bn PPP programme and an Exchequer element of &euro;850m. The latter is to be funded from some of the proceeds from the sale of State assets and the new licencing arrangement for the National Lottery. On 5th June, as a follow up to last year&rsquo;s Stimulus Plan, I announced Exchequer investment of &euro;150m to fund school building projects, local and regional road maintenance and retrofitting of Local Authority housing. This &euro;150m investment is additional to that included in the existing budget. I expect that approximately &euro;70 million of this additional funding will be spent this year, with most of the remainder being spent in 2014 and a small amount in 2015.</p></reply>

The composition of the savings arising can only be finalised when the results of the various ballots are known.</p><p>  However, the measures set out in the Agreement will enable the Government to achieve the targeted savings of approximately &euro;300 million in the public service pay and pensions bill in 2013, including savings on Local Government. Furthermore, it is estimated that the measures set out in the Haddington Road Agreement will reduce the public service pay and pensions bill by &euro;1 billion by the end of the Agreement. </p><p>  The Revised Estimates Volume was published on the basis of the previous Labour Relations Commission (LRC) recommendations, prior to the recent re-engagement between the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform and the Trade Unions. These recommendations were, at the time, the most appropriate means of achieving the savings required and it was important that the relevant Oireachtas Committees could begin the process of examining the Vote allocations for 2013.  </p><p>  While the recommendations set out in Haddington Road Agreement have changed since the previous LRC recommendations, the pay allocations for individual Votes based on the implementation of these recommendations remain largely the same.</p></reply>

We are bringing public expenditure back onto a sustainable path and driving forward the public service reform agenda to ensure that efficiencies and reformed work practices play a full part in contributing to the overall budgetary consolidation effort which is essential to achieving our annual deficit targets.  To date, all quantitative fiscal targets set as part of the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support have been met in full.  </p><p>  Since this Government was established in 2011, a medium-term expenditure management process began with a Comprehensive Review of Expenditure exercise.  This exercise was carried out by all Departments in order to identify ways of reducing expenditure in line with commitments under the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland, while minimising the impact on service delivery.</p><p>  Following on from this, the Ministerial expenditure ceilings for 2012 - 2014 were introduced on an administrative basis in the <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report</i>, published in December 2011.  The CRE exercise forms the foundation of these ceilings and is the basis for all subsequent decisions on expenditure.  </p><p>  The <i>Expenditure Report 2013 was </i>published on 5 December 2012 and includes further well-specified expenditure savings measures across every area of Government spending.  While these structural economic and budgetary reforms that the Government is delivering will bring a return to prosperity and growth over the medium term, the current international economic position combined with the high levels of uncertainty across the world's financial market will require Ireland to maintain fiscal discipline into 2014.  </p><p>  For a detailed breakdown of Exchequer pay and non-pay spending by Departments, I would refer the Deputy to the Databank available from my Department's website which can be found at .</p></reply>

This method by which this is regulated is set out in the Funding Standard.</p><p>  The majority of defined benefit pension schemes are in deficit and face serious challenges in restoring their funding levels to enable the scheme deliver on the pension promise. It is acknowledged that the fundamental problem facing pension schemes is that pensions are significantly more expensive, due to increasing life expectancy and lower than expected investment returns which are reflect in increased annuity rates.</p><p>  The Funding Standard provides a benchmark against which the &lsquo;health&rsquo; of a scheme can be tested. When a scheme fails the Funding Standard that means that unless some action is taken, the scheme will not be able to pay all the benefits promised. The existence of the Funding Standard itself is not the central issue in relation to whether a scheme is properly funded. Rather the responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that the scheme is properly funded and managed.  However, the Funding Standard does provide the regulatory mechanism for ensuring that a scheme can live up to the &ldquo;promised&rdquo; level of pension benefits.</p><p>  Trustees of a defined benefit pension scheme are required to submit an Actuarial Funding Certificate (AFC) to the Pensions Board at regular intervals to indicate whether or not the scheme has sufficient assets to meet its liabilities.  If an AFC indicates that, in the actuary&rsquo;s opinion, the scheme does not satisfy the Funding Standard on the relevant date, the trustees must submit a Funding Proposal to the Pensions Board outlining how it is proposed to restore scheme funding levels.</p><p>  The funding proposal must set out a contribution plan which the actuary can certify as being such that s/he can reasonably expect its implementation to be sufficient to allow the scheme to satisfy the Standard within the period of the proposal.</p><p>  Section 52 of the 1990 Pensions Act provides that, by way of Regulation, certain defined benefit pension schemes may be exempt from the requirement to comply with the Funding Standard on the basis that &ldquo;some or all of the benefits under specified schemes or categories of schemes are, or may be, paid in whole or in part out of moneys provided from the Central Fund or moneys provided by the Oireachtas&rdquo;. </p><p>  EU Directive 2003/41/EC on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision (the IORPS Directive) is also relevant in this context. It provides that a Member State may choose to exempt a funded defined benefit pension scheme from the application of a national funding standard only if the scheme is &ldquo;made under statute, pursuant to legislation, and is guaranteed by a public authority&rdquo;.  Essentially, in order to exclude a scheme from the requirements of the Funding Standard, the payment of scheme benefits must be guaranteed by the State. </p><p>  The State does not guarantee or accept any liability for the funded schemes of the commercial State companies. In this regard, a case has been made by the ESB Pensions Governance Forum seeking exclusion from the requirements of the Funding Standard. This case is being examined at present.</p></reply>

Company directors holding 50% or more of the shareholding of a company are not normally regarded as falling within a normal employer/employee relationship and are therefore, deemed not to be employed under a contract of service and liable for PRSI Class A contributions (as an employee).  Instead, such company directors are deemed to be employed under a contract for services and to be liable for PRSI Class S contributions (as a self-employed person).

My Department and the bodies funded from its Vote Group are, however, involved in a wide range of cultural and heritage activities which promote Ireland as an attractive tourist destination worldwide. This includes promoting Ireland's history and rich culture through operating and making accessible our National Parks and Nature Reserves, our built heritage and also supporting the National Cultural Institutions and Arts Council in their work in presenting exhibitions and arts events.</p><p>  The Cultural Institution supported by my Department play a key in the development of tourism and the commemoration of particular historic and political events. For example, today members of the Kennedy family and I attended the exhibition in the National Library of Ireland dedicated to the visit of President John F. Kennedy to Ireland in June 1963.</p><p>  The opportunity to promote history-related tourism will be enhanced by certain special anniversaries in the coming years, particularly the millennial anniversary of the Battle of Clontarf in 2014 and the continuing centenary programme relating to the revolutionary period that included the World War, the Easter Rising and culminated in the founding of the Irish State.  In this regard, my Department will be working with all other stakeholders to ensure that the maximum benefit for tourism is obtained from any planned events. I recently met with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland to enhance co-operation between my Department in promoting heritage and cultural tourism and will continue to work with both bodies in order to progress this key agenda for Ireland. </p></reply>

In order to meet our overall 16% requirement, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport from renewable sources. </p><p>  Though these targets are challenging, I am confident that they can be met. My Department's Strategy for Renewable Energy 2012 to 2020 sets out the key strategic goals for the various renewable energy sectors in the context of Ireland's EU obligations. </p><p>  In addition, under the Directive, Ireland was required to set out in a National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) the trajectory towards meeting its legally binding targets.  The NREAP and the First Progress Report on the NREAP, which are available on my Department's website, show the sectoral and technology breakdown that we anticipate in the achievement of our target.</p><p>  By the end of 2011, we had reached 6.4% of overall energy consumption from renewable sources and the trajectory set out in the NREAP assumes that we will achieve the 16% target incrementally at approximately 1% per annum. </p><p>  At end 2012, 19.5% approximately of our electricity consumption was from renewable sources.</p><p>  In 2012 15.5% of Ireland's electricity demand was met by wind generation.  By the end of quarter one<i></i>  2013 1,763 MW of wind generation capacity was connected to the grid, with 238 MW of hydro power and 71 MW of smaller renewable sources (mainly landfill gas and biomass).</p><p>  To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. However, if we are to reach that target, the build rate of onshore wind farms must accelerate from an historic average of 180 MW per year to at least 250 MW per year.  It was for this reason that I decided to amend the terms of REFIT 2 to extend the closing date for applications to 31 December 2015, with projects required to be built by the end of December 2017. Support under REFIT 2 cannot exceed 15 years and will not extend beyond the end of December 2032.</p><p>  In order to take a structured approach to connecting the necessary amounts of renewable generation to the grid, the Commission for Energy Regulation established the Gate 3 process.  Under this process, grid connection offers have been made to around 3,900 MW of renewable generation, the bulk of which is wind. It is now a matter for project developers to accept or reject these offers in the coming months. </p></reply>

The report sets out details of the State Mining Leases, State Mining Licences and Prospecting Licences current as of 31 December 2012, and the total amount of all moneys collected by the Minister under or by virtue of any such Lease or Licence or otherwise in connection with the Minerals Development Acts for the twelve months ended 31 December 2012.  The next such report will be for the six months ending on 30th June 2013.  It will be presented to the Oireachtas as soon as possible thereafter.  Information on all current licences, including maps of locations, is accessible on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  As regards environmental considerations for extraction of minerals, I am precluded by the Environmental Protection Agency legislation from including conditions in a State Mining Lease or License which relate to control of environmental emissions.  These matters are regulated by the Agency under an Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Licence which is a requirement for all operating mines.  In addition, any new mining development requires planning permission.  Planning applications for mines are subject to Environmental Impact Assessment, which involves preparation by the developer of a detailed Environmental Impact Statement.  This must entail consideration of the potential impacts of the project on population, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climatic factors, material assets, including the architectural and archaeological heritage, landscape and the inter-relationship between the above factors, and will include a properly costed closure plan.  It is a requirement of all three permits that a financial surety or bond is in place from the outset to guarantee the availability of funding to implement the closure plan, whether at the end of life of the mine or in the event of premature closure.  </p></reply>

With regard to corporate governance, <i>Guidelines on the Governance of Integrated Local Development Companies and Urban Based Partnerships</i> were issued by the then Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, to all companies on 1 October 2007 (with an addendum to the guidelines issued in June 2009).  The guidelines were designed to assist the companies with the establishment of the company board structure (including the relevant sectors and pillars), and with the prescribed requirements of the Department to enable each Company to ensure eligibility for Departmental and European funding. In addition, the guidelines provided a model Memorandum and Articles of Association, along with a model of Corporate Governance Policy which was adaptable to meet individual requirements. </p><p>  In June 2012, my Department requested that Clondalkin, Palmerstown, Lucan, Newcastle (CPLN) Local Development Company, Dodder Valley Local Development Company and South Dublin County Council develop a plan to establish a single structure for LCDP delivery in the two areas in question.   The new structure, called South Dublin County Partnership Company Ltd was established in 2012. CPLN is therefore no longer contracted to deliver the LCDP on behalf of my Department.  In relation to the particular query raised in the Question, my Department is not aware of any such issue. </p></reply>

From this the National Countryside Recreation Strategy was published in 2006 and &ldquo;Leave No Trace&rdquo; has recently been established as the prevailing code for recreational users of the countryside. </p><p>  Comhairle na Tuaithe has provided a valuable forum bringing key stakeholders together building trust and co-operation. Access to the countryside for recreational users has proven to be an on-going problem for private landowners, state landholders, recreational users and tourists alike but issues have been significantly progressed through the efforts of Comhairle na Tuaithe and the introduction of the Walks Scheme. While the organisations represented on Comhairle na Tuaithe have individual views on many of the issues to be progressed, the National Countryside Recreation Strategy reflects the consensus view of its members. </p><p>Meetings are chaired by my Department. The group meets regularly to discuss and progress matters relating to rural recreation and activity tourism. My Department also sit on the National Trails Advisory Committee which oversees best practice in relation to trail planning and development.   </p><p>  Through Service Level Agreements between my Department and Local Development Companies, Rural Recreational Officers are employed to raise awareness of the walking and activity/recreation product, and to facilitate tourism and marketing initiatives, and they have negotiated and managed Walks Scheme maintenance contracts with over 1800 landowners, all on a permissive access basis. Work has recently commenced on renewing these maintenance contracts for a further five year period. The Rural Recreation Officers now represent a unique resource locally for providing best practice in trail maintenance, management, marketing and the development of a broad range of rural recreation and activity tourism products. </p><p>In light of the committees already in place and the very significant level of progress made through Comhairle na Tuaithe I feel that the establishment of an Access to the Countryside Advisory Council and the appointment or designation of county council officials as access officers is not warranted. There are approximately 620 trails throughout the country listed on the Irish trails website which are all based on permissive access.   </p></reply>

Such decisions are made in the context of the local development strategy of the individual groups and in line with Programme's Operating Rules and EU regulations. The LDCs can approve projects without the approval of my Department. </p><p>My   Department only becomes involved in a project once the Board of the LDC has approved it and the Board minutes are submitted to my Department for review. </p><p>  The only exception to this is projects that request funding of &euro;150,000 or more, these projects are required to seek final approval from my Department. Again, however, this is after Board approval. The assessment of these higher value projects usually involves detailed consultations between my Department and the relevant local development company. </p><p>  The project referred to in the Question is one such project. It was approved by County Kildare LEADER Partnership at their December 2012 Board meeting.  While a list of the projects approved at that meeting, including this project, was submitted to my Department on 21 January, 2013, its eligibility was not reviewed at that time as my Department was awaiting the submission of the entire project file for a full assessment in line with the Programme's Operating Rules. The project file was received in my Department on 3 May 2013. </p><p>The European Commission requires that there is clear demarcation in Member States between various grant schemes to ensure that there is no duplication of funding. In this regard, as there was funding for childcare facilities available from other Government Departments, my Department in setting out the Operating Rules for the RDP excluded projects relating to childcare as eligible activities for funding. The Programme's Operating Rules state &#8220;<i>Aid shall not be awarded or paid in respect of the following mainstream categories&amp;#8230;childcare</i>&#8221;. I understand that the project in question had previously secured funding from the National Childcare Investment Programme but the project did not proceed.   </p><p>  Following an assessment of the file, County Kildare LEADER Partnership was informed that my Department considered the project ineligible on the grounds that it was for the provision of a childcare facility. The Group has been advised that the decision is open to appeal to a Principal Officer in my Department. </p></reply>

However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  All organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.</p><p>  A vetting disclosure is made in response to a written request and with the permission of the person who is the subject of that request.  Garda vetting disclosures are issued to specified organisations registered with GCVU for that purpose in respect of a particular post or employment.  The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012.  The disclosure is made to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued.  Each time a new vetting application is received, a full vetting check is conducted to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.  The non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the certificate protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service.  It also affords the registered organisation the facility to assess suitability based on the most up to date information available on the applicant.</p><p>  I remain in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner as to how best the service can continue to be delivered and improved upon, while at all times protecting the integrity of the process.  Clearly, the protection of children and vulnerable adults is the primary objective of the Garda Central Vetting Unit and this must remain the case.  The possibility of introducing an e-vetting system has been assessed and the Garda authorities are now in the process of developing a system which will enable vetting applications to be submitted electronically through a secure web service.  In addition, the system will facilitate the checking and monitoring of applications.  The relevant work is being pursued on a priority basis and it will be completed as quickly as possible.</p><p>  The Garda Commissioner has informed me that there are currently 1 Superintendent, 2 Sergeants and approximately 113 civilian personnel assigned to the Garda Central Vetting Unit.  This civilian complement includes 23 staff recently transferred from the Department of Agriculture who are undergoing the required training course.  A further 9 personnel were allocated to the GCVU on 13th May 2013 and an additional 6 took up positions on the 31st May 2013.  When these staff have been fully trained on the vetting process I expect there will be a positive effect on vetting times.

The person concerned is the subject of a Deportation Order following a thorough and comprehensive examination of his asylum claim and his application to remain temporarily in the State.  The case of the person concerned was considered under Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).  The outcome of the consideration was that the decision to make a deportation order in respect of him remained unchanged.<i></i>He has no application for residency.  In addition he has been evading his deportation since 3 November, 2009 and should therefore present himself to the Garda Authorities without any further delay.</p><p>  As a general matter of policy, it would be logistically inconsistent to review a person's case who has failed a very fair and comprehensive asylum process, and who have thereafter proceeded to evade their deportation for years, by granting such persons residency in the State.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order remains an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

This permission appears to have been renewed on a regular basis by her local Immigration Officer until March 2010.  I am informed that when she attended the registration office of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) in May 2010, she was advised to contact my officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) regarding same.  However it appears that the next contact from the person concerned was in March 2012 when she presented to her local Immigration Officer.  She was refused registration on this occasion as she has been out of permission since March 2010.  The local Immigration Officer advised her to write to INIS outlining her situation prior to renewal of registration. I am informed that she was given this direction by him on 26th August 2012. <br /><br />  I understand that some documentation has since been received from the person concerned by INIS.  However, in order to assist in regularising her status in the State, further documentation was requested from her in writing on 13th March 2013.  To date no response has been received.  On receipt of the documents requested, her case will then be examined by the relevant officials in INIS.  Once a decision has been made on her status, this decision and the consequences involved will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.  I am also informed that the person concerned submitted an application for a Certificate of Naturalisation in August 2005.  This application was refused by my predecessor at his absolute discretion.  The person's legal representative was notified of the decision and the reason for same by letter dated 31st March 2009.  She may re-apply at any time when in a position to satisfy the statutory requirements.</blockquote>  Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  The conditions are that the applicant must -</p><p>- be of full age;</p><p>- be of good character;</p><p>- have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years;</p><p>- intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and</p><p>- have, <font color="#212100">before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows-</font></p><p><font color="#212100">(i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and</font></p><p><font color="#212100">(ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.</font></p><p>  A foreign national who is married to, or is the Civil Partner of, an Irish citizen for at least three years may apply for naturalisation under section 15A of the Irish Naturalisation and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, where they have been continuously resident in the island of Ireland for the year immediately prior to the date of their application and for two out of the four years prior to that year.  The marriage or civil partnership must be subsisting and recognised under Irish law.  Section 15A provides that the Minister may waive certain conditions for naturalisation if satisfied that the applicant would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship.</p><p>  Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, waive some or all of the statutory conditions in certain circumstances i.e. where an applicant is of Irish descent or of Irish associations; where an applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; or where an applicant is a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless persons.  It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b> The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

This permission was later renewed for a further three years, to 5  September, 2010, and more recently to 21 February, 2013.  </p><p>  On 1 April, 2013, the person concerned sought to have her permission to remain renewed for a further period.  However, her request to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) for renewal of registration was refused on that occasion as she was not in a position to produce a valid passport to attest to her identity and nationality, a stipulation provided for under the provisions of Section 9(2)(a) of the Immigration Act 2004. </p><p>  Given that the permission to remain of the person concerned has lapsed for some four months at this stage, she should now proceed to make a formal written renewal request to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), PO Box 10003, Dublin 1.  Upon receipt of such a request, the position in the State of the person concerned will be further considered.</p><p>  I am advised that there is no record of an application for a Certificate of Naturalisation having been submitted by the person concerned. </p><p>  In relation to the spouse of the person concerned, the position is that his permission to remain was renewed on 29 February, 2012 for a further three years, valid to 20<sup></sup>  February, 2015. However, it would appear that he was unable to obtain GNIB registration for the period set out in his permission to remain decision letter owing to his failure to produce a valid passport to attest to his identity and nationality.  As a result, he was 'registered' for a six month period, valid to 20 August, 2012, to enable him to take whatever steps were necessary to obtain a valid passport and, having done so, to present it to the GNIB so that his period of registration could be renewed in line with the position set out in his permission to remain decision letter, dated 29 February, 2012. </p><p>  The Deputy might wish to note that where a person has been granted permission to remain by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), the provisions of Section 9 (2)(a) of the Immigration Act 2004 require that person to 'register' with the Garda National Immigration Bureau as soon as possible thereafter.  In the context of any application for such registration, the person in question would need to have in their possession the following items:</p><p>(i) their original permission to remain decision letter,</p><p>(ii) their Passport and</p><p>(iii) the requisite registration fee.</p><p>  Given that the spouse of the person concerned has not, to date, produced a current valid passport, to attest to his identity and nationality, he should proceed to do so without further delay and, having done so, he should present it to the GNIB so that his period of registration can be renewed in line with the position set out in his permission to remain decision letter, dated 29 February, 2012. </p><p>  However, in the context of the passport related requirement, Section 9 (2)(a) of the Immigration Act 2004 specifically states that &quot;... he, or she, shall, as soon as may be, furnish to the registration officer ... and, unless he or she gives a satisfactory explanation for the circumstances which prevent his or her doing so, produce to the registration officer a valid passport or other equivalent document, issued by or on behalf of an authority recognised by the Government, which establishes his or her identity and nationality.&quot;  </p><p>  In the event that a person making an application for such registration cannot, in spite of their best efforts, obtain a passport then he or she would need to be able to show, through the production of verifiable documentary evidence, the efforts that they have made to obtain a passport and why they were unable to do so.  Where such verifiable documentary evidence is produced, the Garda National Immigration Bureau has the discretionary powers to effect registration without the production of a valid passport, however, this discretion will only be exercised in the most limited of circumstances.</p><p>  It will be open to the person concerned, and her spouse, to apply to the Citizenship Division of my Department for Certificates of Naturalisation when they are in a position to meet the lawful residency criteria applicable to the lodgment of such applications.  Details on the criteria to be met by persons lodging such applications are available from my Department's Website<font color="#0000FF">)</font>.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The position is unchanged since then:</p><p>The person concerned is a failed asylum applicant. Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 18th August, 2006, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.</p><p>  The person concerned initiated judicial review proceedings in the High Court, challenging the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in her case.  The judicial review proceedings were struck out on 4th July, 2008 meaning that the earlier decisions of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the then Minister stood.  The person concerned submitted an application for subsidiary protection.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</p><p>  In the event that the application for subsidiary protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made.  Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.  Given that the person concerned has no current right of residency in the State, the issue of an application for naturalisation does not arise at this time.</p></reply>

The Deputy should note that as the person concerned has no current right of residency in the State, she would not, at present, be in a position to meet the lawful residency criteria applicable to persons applying to my Department for a Certificate of Naturalisation.  Additionally, while the person concerned had permission to remain in the State for a period between late 2007 and early 2011, this was on the basis of student conditions which would not count as 'reckon-able residency' in the context of an application for a Certificate of Naturalisation.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

It would appear that the person may be in the State unlawfully and in breach of Section 5 (1) of the Immigration Act 2004 which provides that no non EEA national may be in the State other than in accordance with the terms of any permission given to him by or on behalf of the Minister.  Section 5 (2) of the Act provides that a non EEA national who is in the State in contravention of subsection (1) is for all purposes unlawfully present in the State.</p><p>  A person who is found to be in breach of the requirements of the Immigration Act 2004 may have committed an offence.  A person found guilty of such an offence is liable under Section 13 of the Act of 2004 to a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.  It is also likely that the person concerned, if he is in employment, would require a work permit issued by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  In general, a work permit is only issued where there is no Irish or EEA national available and qualified to do the particular job concerned.  A non EEA national who does not have a valid work permit and works in the State is in breach of the Employment Permits Acts 2003 and 2006.  Indeed, the employer is also liable to sanction for breaches of these Acts.  I would strongly advise that, as a matter of urgency, the person concerned contacts the General Immigration Division, INIS, 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 in relation to his situation.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The most recent was by way of correspondence in May 2013 with a request that an assessment of the use of an alternative anti-malaria drug Malaorne for the use of Permanent Defence Force personnel be carried out.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware when I advised in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 29110/13 and 28708/13, malaria is a serious disease that kills approximately 1 million people per year in sub-Saharan Africa alone.  It is a serious threat to any military force operating in the area. The anti-malaria regime in place in the Defence Forces &ndash; including the use of Lariam &ndash; has worked. In the decade of deployment to sub-Saharan Africa by the Defence Forces, not a single member of the Defence Forces has died from malaria and there are only three documented cases of personnel getting malaria.</p><p>  In relation to the use of Malarone, until September 2012, Malarone was only licensed for up to 28 days continuous use. Given that the usual deployment for the Defence Forces is 6 months, Malarone was not an option for the Defence Forces on overseas tours of duty to malarious areas where the duration of the tour exceeded the 28 day licensing limit for the drug. The 28 day limit was removed in September 2012.  There is, however, limited evidence as to the safety and effectiveness of Malarone being used for longer periods and the position is currently being reviewed by the Defence Forces&rsquo; Medical Corps. </p><p>  Over the years concerns have been raised concerning the use of Lariam. I have had all of these /concerns investigated thoroughly and have obtained the advice of leading medical experts, who concur with the practices followed by the Defence Forces in prescribing Lariam.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the anti- malaria regime in place in the Defence Forces, including the use of Lariam has worked.</p></reply>

I am aware that, like many other sectors, farmers can find it difficult to get investment credit due to the stricter assessments introduced as a result of the recent banking crisis. Ensuring that farmers have access to financing for farm investments is a crucial issue for me as ongoing new investment will have a major role to play in improving overall competitiveness at farm level by improving productivity and thus help contribute in meeting our ambitious targets set out in Food Harvest 2020.</p><p>  Despite some concerns expressed about lack of investment credit, a relatively small number of cases from the agri-food sector have come before the Credit Review Office.  I would encourage farmers to make use of this system should they have difficulty in accessing credit for farm investments.  I am aware that a number of banks have designed new credit facilities specifically tailored for the agri-food sector in recent times. In addition, the most recent Central Bank data for lending to SMEs, covering Q1 2013, shows that the primary agriculture sector was top of the list in value terms for new lending to SMEs during the quarter. With a total of &euro;149m, it was far ahead of the second placed wholesale/retail sector on &euro;92m and represented 32%, excluding Financial Intermediation and Property Services, of all such new lending during the period.</p><p>  I will continue to meet with relevant lenders on a regular basis to discuss agri credit issues including the need for them to continue to ensure new credit lines are available for investments in the farming sector.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-20a.1216.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013062000078#WRV00700"><p>Commonage lands form an important part of the farming enterprises of many farmers, particularly along the West Coast.  They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism. However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. </p><p>  Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission. It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC (Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition), or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC. It is my stated aim that this will be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State Agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.</p><p>  I readily acknowledge that it will not be an easy task, but it is achievable if all stakeholders work in a co-operative basis. If action is not taken now, the areas will continue to deteriorate and will lead to more land abandonment. If this is allowed to happen, Ireland will lose a valuable resource from the point of view of farming, rural economy, bio-diversity and wildlife. While grazing is the only method of managing these lands, the task facing us is how to ensure that these grazing levels are appropriate to the individual commonages.</p><p>  In order to ensure that the achievement of this objective, as already stated, we need the input of individual shareholders. Grazing plans, at the level of each commonage, will allow for greater flexibility for shareholders and will enable the active farmers to increase their stock to cater for dormant and inactive persons. It will be matter for agreement between the shareholders &ndash; as was always the case &ndash; to decide how best to reach the stocking levels. Professional assistance will be required, in particular where the commonage has been damaged by under-grazing.</p><p>  The Grazing Plan will have to cater the traditional farming methods for the area, with provision made for sheep and other animals, such as cattle, providing that they are appropriate to the habitat. An appropriate time-scale will have to be put in place but the Plan should include the incremental steps to achieve GAEC. The whole concept will be output driven, in that the assessment of the Plans will be based on whether the commonage is in GAEC or not or whether the appropriate progress has been achieved.  </p><p>  Apart from ensuring that the Grazing Plan is valid, there are a number of other complications, including:</p><p>  - Dormant shareholders &ndash; in the majority of cases, these persons are no longer farming;</p><p>  - Current claimants on the commonages, who do not farm or manage the lands. The issue of whether the latter claimants will continue to be eligible for payment will have to be examined.   </p><p>  There are other issues that will need to be considered. These include the fact that many commonage habitats have been significantly damaged by under-grazing, with resulting problems that must be addressed including land abandonment, spread of scrub and invasive species.</p><p>  While it is generally accepted that this is a very complex matter and requires a very detailed action plan to cover the various issues, I intend to set out proposals on how these matters will be progressed in the near future.  </p></reply>

My officials are endeavouring to examine and reply to these correspondents as quickly as possible. In the meantime,  I have outlined, to both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, and in replies to previous Dail questions my response to the distressing events highlighted in this programme.</p><p>  The programme showed us what happens when you don't invest in building an effective system and culture of qualify-focussed, child-centred service provision, and when you don't invest in robust oversight and inspection.</p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to improve the quality of the free Preschool Year and, by extension, the quality of all early childhood care and education, through the implementation of standards and by reviewing training options for the workforce. These commitments have always been a key priority for me.</p><p>As part of this work programme, my Department and I have been progressing work on Ireland's first-ever Early Years Strategy and this why we have been working on a comprehensive<b></b>  Preschool Quality Agenda. </p><p>  We have identified 8 key areas of action which I believe need to be considered and addressed as a matter of urgency:</p><p> - increasing the qualification requirements for all staff in preschool services to a minimum standard at FETAC Level 5;</p><p> - improving the quality and curricular supports for preschool services when implementing the S&iacute;olta Framework and Aistear Curriculum; </p><p> - implementing the new National Preschool Standards;</p><p> - introducing a registration system for all preschool services;</p><p> - taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust;</p><p> - publishing inspection reports on-line as soon as possible;</p><p> - ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance; and</p><p> - increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance.</p><p><b>Increasing the required qualification standards of child care staff</b></p><p>  We are working to increase the required qualification standards of child-care staff. The majority of staff working in the sector now have qualifications to FETAC Level 5 and I believe that this should be made a requirement for all staff working in the sector by September 2015, and for new services by the earlier date of September 2014.  I am also proposing that the minimum qualification requirement for Preschool Leaders within the Preschool Year should be increased from FETAC Level 5 to FETAC Level 6 from those dates also.</p><p><b>Supports for Aistear and S&iacute;olta.</b></p><p>  We are working to improve support and mentoring for individual preschool services in implementing S&iacute;olta and Aistear.  This is essential if we are to ensure that all services understand and implement a child-centred approach to the care and education of young children.</p><p><b>Implementing the new National Preschool Standards.</b></p><p>  We are developing new National Preschool Standards, designed to support providers in delivering a high quality service and parents in choosing the child care best suited to their needs.  New day-care standards have been completed but have not yet been implemented.  Later this year it is intended to launch these standards alongside further standards on sessional care and child-minding which are currently being finalised. These standards will replace all current guidelines and will be implemented and inspected in line with the new registration system and improved inspection systems.</p><p><b>Registration of all child-care providers.</b></p><p>  Work is already underway in the Child and Family Services area of the Health Service Executive (HSE) to introduce a registration system for preschool services.  I understand this system will be in place for new services from the end of this year and will be phased in for existing services thereafter.  This is an important development because it will move services from the current position, where they are required to notify the Preschool Inspectorate of their intention to open, to a requirement to be inspected and found satisfactory, before being permitted to open.  All preschool services are currently required to pay an annual fee to the HSE of between &euro;40 and &euro;80.  I am looking at increasing this fee.  The additional funds raised will assist in improving inspection and supports for quality improvement.</p><p><b>Publication of Inspection Reports.</b></p><p>Parents will rightly demand and expect the highest standards and this will be a key factor in driving change in the sector.  Publishing inspection reports is an essential step in ensuring high standards and accountability. All <i>new</i> inspection reports will be made available on-line from the HSE as a matter of urgency.  All <i>current</i>   inspection reports will be made available on-line in 2014.</p><p><b>Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust.</b></p><p>  We are working on developing a more robust, consistent and regular inspection system  There has been a significant programme of work underway in the HSE over the past year to develop a single, consistent national inspection service (as opposed to 37 different local systems).  </p><p>  We propose moving to a position where there is consistent and assured national target rate for the frequency of inspection of preschool services, while ensuring capacity for prioritisation based on risk assessment.   The HSE is currently reviewing the regional spread of inspectors with a view to identifying whether either additional resources or redeployment of existing inspectors is required to achieve this. </p><p>  Building on this work, officials of my Department and the Department of Education and Skills have been examining options to incrementally develop a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for preschools; moving away from a narrow focus on compliance, and leading to a greater focus on children's outcomes, including educational development and child well-being.  This work is being informed by the findings of a recent Joint Pilot Inspection carried out in a small number of settings by Inspectors from the Health Service Executive and the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p><b>Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance.</b></p><p>  We are working to ensure consistent action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance. There must be a follow-through on inspections.  Clearly, services which are found to be in serious breach of the Regulations will face closure and prosecution.   It is proposed to develop a protocol with the Preschool Inspectorate which will take a calibrated approach and which will enable more decisive action to be taken in response to non-compliance.</p><p><b>Increased Sanctions for non-compliance.</b></p><p>  My Department will also be undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (No. 2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.  The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution, as is currently the case.  </p><p>  The recent broadcast highlighted practices on the part of individual staff members which were of very serious concern.  The responsibility of management must also be the subject of questioning.  Management is responsible for the selection and training of staff, the development of operational policies and practices and the management of day to day service delivery.  Most of all management is responsible for the culture and ethos of the preschool - they set the tone through their example, their interaction with children and parents and their guidance of staff.  </p><p>  This preschool quality agenda represents an essential building block towards the future extension of universal preschool provision; including the objective which I have previously spoken of in relation to introducing a second free preschool year. </p><p>  I believe it is critical to the quality agenda for early childhood care and education that my Department continues to work in close co-operation with the Department of Education and Skills, given the overlap of interest between the Departments in regard to education for children under 6 years of age, as reflected in S&iacute;olta, Aistear and the Workforce Development Plan, and the professional training role of the State funded training bodies.  The two Departments are already working together on these issues and on the development of a joint approach to preschool inspection.</p></reply>

This funding is being allocated to each HSE Region based on its percentage of population. Both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of the funding in a creative and flexible manner so as to secure as many places as possible for this cohort.  </p><p>  The demand for services for school-leavers continues to grow. The HSE expects that approximately 700 young people who have finished their education or life-skills training will require services in 2013.  Providing the level of services required within the additional funding provided will continue to be a challenge. Work in this area will be progressed largely in line with the HSE guidance document developed in 2012, which led to the successful placement of 99% of RT graduates and 96% of school leavers last year. </p><p>  It is envisaged that plans will be completed for each region shortly and submitted to Area Managers, Regional Specialists and Regional Director of Operations for agreement.

This review, entitled &quot;Plain Tobacco Packaging: A Systematic Review&quot; (Moodie et al), outlines the findings of  37 studies and provides evidence on the impacts of standardised/plain tobacco packaging.  The review included studies from 1980 up to the time of its publication.  The primary aim of the review was to assess the impact of standardised or plain packaging on the appeal of the packaging or product, the salience and effectiveness of health warnings and the perceptions of product strength and harm.  The review concluded that there is strong evidence to support the introduction of standardised/plain packaging.</p></reply>

Given that the number of people with dementia is expected to rise to between 141,000 and 147,000 by 2041, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to develop a National Alzheimer's and other Dementias' Strategy by 2013 to; increase awareness; ensure early diagnosis and intervention, and ensure development of enhanced community based services. A significant amount of preparatory work has already been completed.<b></b>A research review funded by the Atlantic Philanthropies to lay the foundations for the Strategy, titled <i>Creating Excellence in Dementia Care, A Research Review for Ireland's National Dementia Strategy</i> was published in January 2012. A public consultation process to inform the development of the Strategy was conducted in 2012 and a report of same published on the Department's website in February 2013. A Working Group, representative of key stakeholders from the Department, the HSE, the medical profession and the community and voluntary sector has been established, the first meeting of which took place in May. While the development of the Strategy will have to have due regard to the constraints imposed by the budgetary situation, it is intended that it will be a transformative Strategy. It will have a very practical focus, will be action oriented and will focus on what can be done to make a difference to the lives of people with dementia. It is intended that a draft of the Strategy will be completed by the end of 2013.</p></reply>

Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to appropriate quality long-term residential care. Access to appropriate quality long-term residential care is underpinned by both the system of registration and inspection of nursing homes and the financial support available under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.</p><p>Essentially, our aim is to ensure that people are being cared for at the point of lowest complexity. People should only be entering long-term nursing home when they have passed the point of being able to be cared for at home. This means that only the most highly dependent people should be in long-term nursing home care. One of the key priorities identified in the HSE's <i>National Operational Plan 2013</i> is the progression of a Single Assessment Tool for older people. This standardised framework will ensure that there is a robust, equitable standardised care needs assessment nationally. It will also allow resources to be targeted towards those with the greatest needs and enable supports and services to be designed in the most appropriate way possible. The Nursing Homes Support Scheme applies to public, private and voluntary nursing homes and includes a principle of resident choice, i.e. the resident chooses their nursing home themselves, subject to the availability of a bed and the ability of the nursing home to meet their care needs. When a person selects a particular nursing home, that nursing home will carry out an assessment to ensure that it can meet the person's care needs. It is a matter for each private nursing home to determine, having regard to its Statement of Purpose etc., whether it can meet the persons care needs. Patients in acute hospitals that have difficulty finding a nursing home that can meet their particular care requirements are generally those that are most highly dependent. In the majority of cases, this category of patients are ultimately accommodated in public nursing homes. The Department is working closely with the HSE to develop an overall plan regarding future public nursing home provision for the Minister's consideration. The plan will reflect regional need and have regard to the current severe financial constraints, restrictions on public sector staffing and recruitment and the on-going need to meet service and safety standards; all of which pose challenges for community nursing units across the country.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is currently the subject of a review. The terms of reference for this review are as follows; taking account of Government policy, demographic trends and the fiscal situation; to examine the on-going sustainability of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme; to examine the overall cost of long term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices; having regard to 1 and 2 above, to consider the balance of funding between long-term residential care and community based services; to consider the extension of the scheme to community based services and to other sectors (Disability and Mental Health), and to make recommendations for the future operation and management of the Scheme. The review will look at possible alternative models of care. Work will continue on the review in the coming months with a view to completion by end 2013-early 2014.</p></reply>

This is at the discretion of the marketing authorisation holders. The standard industry practice across Europe is for prescription tablets to be packaged in sizes of 28, as this number has been found to be convenient for patients. Where the quantity of a preparation prescribed does not correspond with an original pack size and it is not feasible to supply the exact amount prescribed, the pharmacist may, in the exercise of his or her professional judgement and bearing in mind the nature of the product and his or her statutory obligations, supply the nearest pack size to the quantity prescribed.</p><p>  It is a condition of the Drug Payment Scheme that no individual or family grouping will pay more than &euro;144 in a calendar month (i.e.&euro;144 x 12 in a full year). The payment of a second &euro;144 (in the same pharmacy) should only arise when a person is intentionally getting the next month&rsquo;s supply on the grounds that he/she will be away the following month or for other such reason. To ensure that an individual or family makes no more than 12 payments in a year it is suggested by the HSE that, where appropriate, once in a 12-month period or periodically throughout the year more than a 28-day supply is given. The packaging will influence how this can be achieved.</p></reply>

All medicines containing fluoxetine authorised for the Irish market are Prescription Only Medicines, i.e. may only be supplied on foot of a prescription from a medical practitioner. Fluoxetine products are used to treat major depressive episodes, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Bulimia Nervosa. In the prescribing information, the usual starting dose of fluoxetine is 20 mg daily for adults. It may be necessary for the prescriber to increase the dose depending on the response of the patient to a maximum of 60 mg daily for adults. As for all prescribed medicines, patients who have been prescribed fluoxetine medicines should be reviewed periodically by their treating medical practitioner to ensure that both the medicine and the dose continue to be a suitable treatment for the individual patient.</p><p>  There are no dosage criteria in place for prescribed drugs and medicines reimbursed under the GMS or other community drug schemes operated by the HSE. Prescribers are responsible for prescribing the appropriate dosage level of a medicine in accordance with the patient's clinical needs. The supply of prescription medicines is controlled in law in a number of ways. Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, it is prohibited for a person to supply a prescription only medicine except in accordance with a prescription, and the supply must be made from a registered pharmacy by or under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist. A person who contravenes these Regulations is guilty of an offence.</p></reply>

They are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months. For persons with a terminal illness, no means test applies.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months. Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

To achieve the most effective high quality outcomes for patients in the most cost efficient manner possible, the reform of the structures and governance for the delivery of hospital services is vital now.</p><p>  Implementation of the recommendations of the Group&rsquo;s Report has already commenced.  I have personally visited the areas covered by each of the 6 groups with my Department and the Director General Designate of the HSE, explaining the policy objectives and listening to the questions the staff in each of those areas have about this policy implementation.   The reaction has been positive.  Professor John Higgins is also carrying out a debriefing exercise, supported by my Department and the HSE, to help ready the hospitals for the impending changes.   Since the launch of the Report, he has held approx. 50 meetings with hospitals in this regard.  </p><p>  Implementation of the Report will be overseen by a National Strategic Advisory Group and driven by the HSE through the Hospital Groups Implementation team which is currently being established.  The National Strategic Advisory Group will be chaired by Mr Leo Kearns, CEO of the Royal College of Physicians.  Professor John Higgins will also be a member of this group, providing continuity and building on the significant goodwill and reassurance he has brought  to the formative phase of the establishment of these groups.  The group will provide guidance and on-going direction in relation to implementation of both the Hospital Groups Report and the Smaller Hospitals Framework.  It will also provide a forum to resolve issues and assist in the development of specific guidelines on the steps required for full implementation.  </p><p>  I will appoint Chairs of each Group in the next few weeks. Advertisements to seek other board members will be placed in parallel with the process of appointing the Group Chairs and the subsequent appointment of group CEOs and management teams. All appointments will be made based on the competencies the individual brings to the Board in line with the HIQA report on Tallaght. </p><p>  Within one year of the formation of Hospital Groups, individual groups will be required to submit a strategic plan which will outline its plans for future services within the group area. These strategic plans will determine the way services are provided within each group.  The implementation of these plans by each group with then be rigorously reviewed, including all necessary due diligence checks, to see whether they are in a position to advance to Hospital Trust status after the necessary legislation is put in place.  </p></reply>

Given the limited funds available, the decision was taken that the main priority to 2016 is to protect investment made to date, to maintain safety standards. and to progress affordable projects  such as Luas Cross City which add value to the existing network.  </p><p>  While Metro North was being procured as a Public Private Partnership (PPP) with a targeted  EIB loan of up to &euro;500 million it also required a very significant Exchequer contribution to support the PPP. This Exchequer contribution is not affordable within the funding envelope now available for transport projects to 2016. In addition, the successful awarding of a major PPP contract involving private funding of the size required for  Metro North is challenging at any time but is particularly challenging in current circumstances. The road  PPPs currently being progressed require a much smaller private sector involvement and do not require any further  Exchequer support  for construction.  Furthermore, securing the closure of these much smaller roads PPPS has proven challenging, with only one, so far, having being brought to financial close since 2008.</p><p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) is currently preparing an Integrated Implementation Plan for investment to 2018  in the GDA as required under the DTA ACT 2008. This plan will address the investment needs of the Swords /Airport corridor to 2018 based on available funding and will be subject to public consultation later this year. Furthermore I have asked my officials to prepare a Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport which will inform future investment plans and this work which will include a review of Metro North as well as other projects is underway.  Metro North is postponed not cancelled and is kept under review.  </p></reply>

The carrying out of works on these roads is a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The selection and prioritisation of road works to be funded from these State grants is also a matter for the local authority.  In carrying our the selection and prioritisation of road works, individual councils should ensure as far as practicable that priority is given to projects most requiring attention in the county as a whole and are reminded in the Memorandum on Grants for Regional and Local Roads that projects should be prioritised based on engineering need and structural deficiency within their entire network of regional and local roads.</p><p>  While the Department has no input into how a council allocates its own resources expenditure, it is hoped, particularly given the current financial circumstances, that this funding too is allocated to areas most in need.  The area engineer, in consultation with elected members, is best placed to prioritise projects and how funding should be allocated from own resources expenditure and I do not intend to direct county managers on this issue.  Under section 70 of the Roads Act 1993, it is the responsibility of landowners and occupiers of land to take all reasonable care to ensure that trees, hedges and other vegetation growing on their land are not a danger to people using or working on a public road.

To assist in setting these special speed limits, my Department issued Guidelines for the Application of Special Speed Limits to all local authorities in January 2011 and the onus is on local authorities to take them into account in relation to any special speed limits which they set.</p><p>  The purpose of these guidelines is to provide advice and guidance in relation to the making of speed limit bye-laws by county and city councils for the purpose of applying special speed limits. After taking the guidelines into account it is considered best practice for local authority officials to advise the elected members of their respective councils on what a suitable speed limit regime should be for different roads in their areas of responsibility. For new roads the local authority would have access to the the relevant technical information relating to the speed for which the road was designed.</p><p>  As part of a Direction given by the then Minister in January 2011, all local authorities were requested to undertake an assessment of special speed limits in their functional areas. I do not believe that the local authorities sufficiently engaged with this direction and as a result in 2012, I announced that a review of speed limits would be undertaken and to that end, my Department established a stakeholder group to progress this work. The Automobile Association, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Road Safety Authority, the National Roads Authority, representatives of local authorities and the National Transport Authority accepted my invitation to participate in the Working Group.  As the Deputy will appreciate, this is an issue which requires detailed consideration. I anticipate that the Group will report to me shortly, and I will give careful consideration to any recommendations contained in their Report.</p></reply>

The Council meets in this format in order to make decisions on common policies and approaches in the area of transport including areas where there may be scope to better integrate transport provision throughout the island.</p><p>  The most recent NSMC meeting in Transport Sectoral format took place on 17th April in Armagh. The meeting was attended by Alex Attwood MLA, Minister for the Environment in Northern Ireland, Danny Kennedy MLA Minister for Regional Development in Northern Ireland, and me. Amongst the agenda items for this meeting was an update on the A5 and A8 major road projects; a progress report on the work which is underway to allow for the mutual recognition of penalty points; a review of the ongoing cooperation in the areas of road user and vehicle safety as well as a discussion on EU matters which impact on the transport sector in the two jurisdictions. Other items which have previously featured on the agenda at NSMC Transport meetings have included the All Island Freight Forum, developments on the Dublin/Belfast Rail line and cross-border community based rural transport.</p><p>  The next NSMC meeting in Transport Sectoral format is scheduled for 28th November 2013.  I look forward to the very positive cooperation in the transport area continuing and to availing of any other beneficial opportunities for north/south cooperation, including in relation to an integrated transport system, in the future.</p></reply>

Conditions were attached to the permission which included the development of a scheme of demand management measures. The NRA in conjunction with the relevant local authorities have been working on such a scheme.    </p><p>  When I took over as Minister for Transport I undertook a review of tolling policy.  Having reviewed the position and and in the context of budgetary measures increasing VAT and carbon tax I came to the decision in late 2011 that new tolls would not be introduced during my term as Minister for Transport. In relation to the M50 specifically, the likely impact of multi-point tolling will be to push vehicles on to other roads and through local communities. At present, congestion is not the problem that it was when An Bord Pleanala granted permission to the M50 upgrade, but it will re-emerge as an issue if and when the economy recovers. At that point we will need a joined-up solution to deal with congestion across the Greater Dublin Area, and not just on the M50.</p></reply>

This permission was later renewed for a further three years, to 5  September, 2010, and more recently to 21 February, 2013.  </p><p>  On 1 April, 2013, the person concerned sought to have her permission to remain renewed for a further period.  However, her request to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) for renewal of registration was refused on that occasion as she was not in a position to produce a valid passport to attest to her identity and nationality, a stipulation provided for under the provisions of Section 9(2)(a) of the Immigration Act 2004. </p><p>  Given that the permission to remain of the person concerned has lapsed for some four months at this stage, she should now proceed to make a formal written renewal request to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), PO Box 10003, Dublin 1.  Upon receipt of such a request, the position in the State of the person concerned will be further considered.</p><p>  I am advised that there is no record of an application for a Certificate of Naturalisation having been submitted by the person concerned. </p><p>  In relation to the spouse of the person concerned, the position is that his permission to remain was renewed on 29 February, 2012 for a further three years, valid to 20<sup></sup>  February, 2015. However, it would appear that he was unable to obtain GNIB registration for the period set out in his permission to remain decision letter owing to his failure to produce a valid passport to attest to his identity and nationality.  As a result, he was 'registered' for a six month period, valid to 20 August, 2012, to enable him to take whatever steps were necessary to obtain a valid passport and, having done so, to present it to the GNIB so that his period of registration could be renewed in line with the position set out in his permission to remain decision letter, dated 29 February, 2012. </p><p>  The Deputy might wish to note that where a person has been granted permission to remain by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), the provisions of Section 9 (2)(a) of the Immigration Act 2004 require that person to 'register' with the Garda National Immigration Bureau as soon as possible thereafter.  In the context of any application for such registration, the person in question would need to have in their possession the following items:</p><p>(i) their original permission to remain decision letter,</p><p>(ii) their Passport and</p><p>(iii) the requisite registration fee.</p><p>  Given that the spouse of the person concerned has not, to date, produced a current valid passport, to attest to his identity and nationality, he should proceed to do so without further delay and, having done so, he should present it to the GNIB so that his period of registration can be renewed in line with the position set out in his permission to remain decision letter, dated 29 February, 2012. </p><p>  However, in the context of the passport related requirement, Section 9 (2)(a) of the Immigration Act 2004 specifically states that &quot;... he, or she, shall, as soon as may be, furnish to the registration officer ... and, unless he or she gives a satisfactory explanation for the circumstances which prevent his or her doing so, produce to the registration officer a valid passport or other equivalent document, issued by or on behalf of an authority recognised by the Government, which establishes his or her identity and nationality.&quot;  </p><p>  In the event that a person making an application for such registration cannot, in spite of their best efforts, obtain a passport then he or she would need to be able to show, through the production of verifiable documentary evidence, the efforts that they have made to obtain a passport and why they were unable to do so.  Where such verifiable documentary evidence is produced, the Garda National Immigration Bureau has the discretionary powers to effect registration without the production of a valid passport, however, this discretion will only be exercised in the most limited of circumstances.</p><p>  It will be open to the person concerned, and her spouse, to apply to the Citizenship Division of my Department for Certificates of Naturalisation when they are in a position to meet the lawful residency criteria applicable to the lodgment of such applications.  Details on the criteria to be met by persons lodging such applications are available from my Department's Website<font color="#0000FF">)</font>.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 18th August, 2006, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.</p><p>  The person concerned initiated judicial review proceedings in the High Court, challenging the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in her case.  The judicial review proceedings were struck out on 4th July, 2008 meaning that the earlier decisions of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the then Minister stood.  The person concerned submitted an application for subsidiary protection.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</p><p>  In the event that the application for subsidiary protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made.  Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.  Given that the person concerned has no current right of residency in the State, the issue of an application for naturalisation does not arise at this time.</p></reply>

The Deputy should note that as the person concerned has no current right of residency in the State, she would not, at present, be in a position to meet the lawful residency criteria applicable to persons applying to my Department for a Certificate of Naturalisation.  Additionally, while the person concerned had permission to remain in the State for a period between late 2007 and early 2011, this was on the basis of student conditions which would not count as 'reckon-able residency' in the context of an application for a Certificate of Naturalisation.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

It would appear that the person may be in the State unlawfully and in breach of Section 5 (1) of the Immigration Act 2004 which provides that no non EEA national may be in the State other than in accordance with the terms of any permission given to him by or on behalf of the Minister.  Section 5 (2) of the Act provides that a non EEA national who is in the State in contravention of subsection (1) is for all purposes unlawfully present in the State.</p><p>  A person who is found to be in breach of the requirements of the Immigration Act 2004 may have committed an offence.  A person found guilty of such an offence is liable under Section 13 of the Act of 2004 to a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.  It is also likely that the person concerned, if he is in employment, would require a work permit issued by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  In general, a work permit is only issued where there is no Irish or EEA national available and qualified to do the particular job concerned.  A non EEA national who does not have a valid work permit and works in the State is in breach of the Employment Permits Acts 2003 and 2006.  Indeed, the employer is also liable to sanction for breaches of these Acts.  I would strongly advise that, as a matter of urgency, the person concerned contacts the General Immigration Division, INIS, 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 in relation to his situation.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The most recent was by way of correspondence in May 2013 with a request that an assessment of the use of an alternative anti-malaria drug Malaorne for the use of Permanent Defence Force personnel be carried out.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware when I advised in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 29110/13 and 28708/13, malaria is a serious disease that kills approximately 1 million people per year in sub-Saharan Africa alone.  It is a serious threat to any military force operating in the area. The anti-malaria regime in place in the Defence Forces &ndash; including the use of Lariam &ndash; has worked. In the decade of deployment to sub-Saharan Africa by the Defence Forces, not a single member of the Defence Forces has died from malaria and there are only three documented cases of personnel getting malaria.</p><p>  In relation to the use of Malarone, until September 2012, Malarone was only licensed for up to 28 days continuous use. Given that the usual deployment for the Defence Forces is 6 months, Malarone was not an option for the Defence Forces on overseas tours of duty to malarious areas where the duration of the tour exceeded the 28 day licensing limit for the drug. The 28 day limit was removed in September 2012.  There is, however, limited evidence as to the safety and effectiveness of Malarone being used for longer periods and the position is currently being reviewed by the Defence Forces&rsquo; Medical Corps. </p><p>  Over the years concerns have been raised concerning the use of Lariam. I have had all of these /concerns investigated thoroughly and have obtained the advice of leading medical experts, who concur with the practices followed by the Defence Forces in prescribing Lariam.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the anti- malaria regime in place in the Defence Forces, including the use of Lariam has worked.</p></reply>

I am aware that, like many other sectors, farmers can find it difficult to get investment credit due to the stricter assessments introduced as a result of the recent banking crisis. Ensuring that farmers have access to financing for farm investments is a crucial issue for me as ongoing new investment will have a major role to play in improving overall competitiveness at farm level by improving productivity and thus help contribute in meeting our ambitious targets set out in Food Harvest 2020.</p><p>  Despite some concerns expressed about lack of investment credit, a relatively small number of cases from the agri-food sector have come before the Credit Review Office.  I would encourage farmers to make use of this system should they have difficulty in accessing credit for farm investments.  I am aware that a number of banks have designed new credit facilities specifically tailored for the agri-food sector in recent times. In addition, the most recent Central Bank data for lending to SMEs, covering Q1 2013, shows that the primary agriculture sector was top of the list in value terms for new lending to SMEs during the quarter.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-20a.1501.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013062000081#WRV00700"><p>Commonage lands form an important part of the farming enterprises of many farmers, particularly along the West Coast.  They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism. However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. </p><p>  Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission. It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC (Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition), or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC. It is my stated aim that this will be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State Agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.</p><p>  I readily acknowledge that it will not be an easy task, but it is achievable if all stakeholders work in a co-operative basis. If action is not taken now, the areas will continue to deteriorate and will lead to more land abandonment. If this is allowed to happen, Ireland will lose a valuable resource from the point of view of farming, rural economy, bio-diversity and wildlife. While grazing is the only method of managing these lands, the task facing us is how to ensure that these grazing levels are appropriate to the individual commonages.</p><p>  In order to ensure that the achievement of this objective, as already stated, we need the input of individual shareholders. Grazing plans, at the level of each commonage, will allow for greater flexibility for shareholders and will enable the active farmers to increase their stock to cater for dormant and inactive persons. It will be matter for agreement between the shareholders &ndash; as was always the case &ndash; to decide how best to reach the stocking levels. Professional assistance will be required, in particular where the commonage has been damaged by under-grazing.</p><p>  The Grazing Plan will have to cater the traditional farming methods for the area, with provision made for sheep and other animals, such as cattle, providing that they are appropriate to the habitat. An appropriate time-scale will have to be put in place but the Plan should include the incremental steps to achieve GAEC. The whole concept will be output driven, in that the assessment of the Plans will be based on whether the commonage is in GAEC or not or whether the appropriate progress has been achieved.  </p><p>  Apart from ensuring that the Grazing Plan is valid, there are a number of other complications, including:</p><p>  - Dormant shareholders &ndash; in the majority of cases, these persons are no longer farming;</p><p>  - Current claimants on the commonages, who do not farm or manage the lands. The issue of whether the latter claimants will continue to be eligible for payment will have to be examined.   </p><p>  There are other issues that will need to be considered. These include the fact that many commonage habitats have been significantly damaged by under-grazing, with resulting problems that must be addressed including land abandonment, spread of scrub and invasive species.</p><p>  While it is generally accepted that this is a very complex matter and requires a very detailed action plan to cover the various issues, I intend to set out proposals on how these matters will be progressed in the near future.  </p></reply>

To qualify, the herdowner must comply with the conditions of the BVD Eradication Programme, the statutory basis for which is set out in S.I. 532 of 2012.  In particular, the calves must have had an initial positive or inconclusive test for the Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Virus (BVD), and be removed from the herd, with a date of death notified to the Animal Identification Movement System (AIM).

My officials are endeavouring to examine and reply to these correspondents as quickly as possible. In the meantime,  I have outlined, to both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, and in replies to previous Dail questions my response to the distressing events highlighted in this programme.</p><p>  The programme showed us what happens when you don't invest in building an effective system and culture of qualify-focussed, child-centred service provision, and when you don't invest in robust oversight and inspection.</p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to improve the quality of the free Preschool Year and, by extension, the quality of all early childhood care and education, through the implementation of standards and by reviewing training options for the workforce. These commitments have always been a key priority for me.</p><p>As part of this work programme, my Department and I have been progressing work on Ireland's first-ever Early Years Strategy and this why we have been working on a comprehensive<b></b>  Preschool Quality Agenda. </p><p>  We have identified 8 key areas of action which I believe need to be considered and addressed as a matter of urgency:</p><p> - increasing the qualification requirements for all staff in preschool services to a minimum standard at FETAC Level 5;</p><p> - improving the quality and curricular supports for preschool services when implementing the S&iacute;olta Framework and Aistear Curriculum; </p><p> - implementing the new National Preschool Standards;</p><p> - introducing a registration system for all preschool services;</p><p> - taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust;</p><p> - publishing inspection reports on-line as soon as possible;</p><p> - ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance; and</p><p> - increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance.</p><p><b>Increasing the required qualification standards of child care staff</b></p><p>  We are working to increase the required qualification standards of child-care staff. The majority of staff working in the sector now have qualifications to FETAC Level 5 and I believe that this should be made a requirement for all staff working in the sector by September 2015, and for new services by the earlier date of September 2014.  I am also proposing that the minimum qualification requirement for Preschool Leaders within the Preschool Year should be increased from FETAC Level 5 to FETAC Level 6 from those dates also.</p><p><b>Supports for Aistear and S&iacute;olta.</b></p><p>  We are working to improve support and mentoring for individual preschool services in implementing S&iacute;olta and Aistear.  This is essential if we are to ensure that all services understand and implement a child-centred approach to the care and education of young children.</p><p><b>Implementing the new National Preschool Standards.</b></p><p>  We are developing new National Preschool Standards, designed to support providers in delivering a high quality service and parents in choosing the child care best suited to their needs.  New day-care standards have been completed but have not yet been implemented.  Later this year it is intended to launch these standards alongside further standards on sessional care and child-minding which are currently being finalised. These standards will replace all current guidelines and will be implemented and inspected in line with the new registration system and improved inspection systems.</p><p><b>Registration of all child-care providers.</b></p><p>  Work is already underway in the Child and Family Services area of the Health Service Executive (HSE) to introduce a registration system for preschool services.  I understand this system will be in place for new services from the end of this year and will be phased in for existing services thereafter.  This is an important development because it will move services from the current position, where they are required to notify the Preschool Inspectorate of their intention to open, to a requirement to be inspected and found satisfactory, before being permitted to open.  All preschool services are currently required to pay an annual fee to the HSE of between &euro;40 and &euro;80.  I am looking at increasing this fee.  The additional funds raised will assist in improving inspection and supports for quality improvement.</p><p><b>Publication of Inspection Reports.</b></p><p>Parents will rightly demand and expect the highest standards and this will be a key factor in driving change in the sector.  Publishing inspection reports is an essential step in ensuring high standards and accountability. All <i>new</i> inspection reports will be made available on-line from the HSE as a matter of urgency.  All <i>current</i>   inspection reports will be made available on-line in 2014.</p><p><b>Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust.</b></p><p>  We are working on developing a more robust, consistent and regular inspection system  There has been a significant programme of work underway in the HSE over the past year to develop a single, consistent national inspection service (as opposed to 37 different local systems).  </p><p>  We propose moving to a position where there is consistent and assured national target rate for the frequency of inspection of preschool services, while ensuring capacity for prioritisation based on risk assessment.   The HSE is currently reviewing the regional spread of inspectors with a view to identifying whether either additional resources or redeployment of existing inspectors is required to achieve this. </p><p>  Building on this work, officials of my Department and the Department of Education and Skills have been examining options to incrementally develop a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for preschools; moving away from a narrow focus on compliance, and leading to a greater focus on children's outcomes, including educational development and child well-being.  This work is being informed by the findings of a recent Joint Pilot Inspection carried out in a small number of settings by Inspectors from the Health Service Executive and the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p><b>Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance.</b></p><p>  We are working to ensure consistent action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance. There must be a follow-through on inspections.  Clearly, services which are found to be in serious breach of the Regulations will face closure and prosecution.   It is proposed to develop a protocol with the Preschool Inspectorate which will take a calibrated approach and which will enable more decisive action to be taken in response to non-compliance.</p><p><b>Increased Sanctions for non-compliance.</b></p><p>  My Department will also be undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (No. 2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.  The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution, as is currently the case.  </p><p>  The recent broadcast highlighted practices on the part of individual staff members which were of very serious concern.  The responsibility of management must also be the subject of questioning.  Management is responsible for the selection and training of staff, the development of operational policies and practices and the management of day to day service delivery.  Most of all management is responsible for the culture and ethos of the preschool - they set the tone through their example, their interaction with children and parents and their guidance of staff.  </p><p>  This preschool quality agenda represents an essential building block towards the future extension of universal preschool provision; including the objective which I have previously spoken of in relation to introducing a second free preschool year. </p><p>  I believe it is critical to the quality agenda for early childhood care and education that my Department continues to work in close co-operation with the Department of Education and Skills, given the overlap of interest between the Departments in regard to education for children under 6 years of age, as reflected in S&iacute;olta, Aistear and the Workforce Development Plan, and the professional training role of the State funded training bodies.  The two Departments are already working together on these issues and on the development of a joint approach to preschool inspection.</p></reply>

This funding is being allocated to each HSE Region based on its percentage of population. Both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of the funding in a creative and flexible manner so as to secure as many places as possible for this cohort.  </p><p>  The demand for services for school-leavers continues to grow. The HSE expects that approximately 700 young people who have finished their education or life-skills training will require services in 2013.  Providing the level of services required within the additional funding provided will continue to be a challenge. Work in this area will be progressed largely in line with the HSE guidance document developed in 2012, which led to the successful placement of 99% of RT graduates and 96% of school leavers last year. </p><p>  It is envisaged that plans will be completed for each region shortly and submitted to Area Managers, Regional Specialists and Regional Director of Operations for agreement.  Arising from completed and approved plans, a communication process will be agreed with service providers to inform families of the services that will be available from September 2013. </p><p>  In respect of the specific question asked by the Deputy, as it relates to service matters I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The FCTC is the first international treaty negotiated under the auspices of WHO.  Article 11 of the Treaty relates to the packaging and labelling of tobacco products and in the Guidelines for the implementation of Article 11 Parties to the Treaty are requested to consider adopting standardised /plain packaging for tobacco products.  </p><p>  A considerable number of studies relating to tobacco packaging have been conducted internationally and as such it would not be possible for me to list all of the studies that have taken place in this regard.  However, the studies I was referring to in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 1019 includes one of the most comprehensive and recent reviews carried out in this area.  This review, entitled &quot;Plain Tobacco Packaging: A Systematic Review&quot; (Moodie et al), outlines the findings of  37 studies and provides evidence on the impacts of standardised/plain tobacco packaging.  The review included studies from 1980 up to the time of its publication.  The primary aim of the review was to assess the impact of standardised or plain packaging on the appeal of the packaging or product, the salience and effectiveness of health warnings and the perceptions of product strength and harm.  The review concluded that there is strong evidence to support the introduction of standardised/plain packaging.</p></reply>

Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to appropriate quality long-term residential care. Access to appropriate quality long-term residential care is underpinned by both the system of registration and inspection of nursing homes and the financial support available under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.</p><p>Essentially, our aim is to ensure that people are being cared for at the point of lowest complexity. People should only be entering long-term nursing home when they have passed the point of being able to be cared for at home. This means that only the most highly dependent people should be in long-term nursing home care. One of the key priorities identified in the HSE's <i>National Operational Plan 2013</i> is the progression of a Single Assessment Tool for older people. This standardised framework will ensure that there is a robust, equitable standardised care needs assessment nationally. It will also allow resources to be targeted towards those with the greatest needs and enable supports and services to be designed in the most appropriate way possible. The Nursing Homes Support Scheme applies to public, private and voluntary nursing homes and includes a principle of resident choice, i.e. the resident chooses their nursing home themselves, subject to the availability of a bed and the ability of the nursing home to meet their care needs. When a person selects a particular nursing home, that nursing home will carry out an assessment to ensure that it can meet the person's care needs. It is a matter for each private nursing home to determine, having regard to its Statement of Purpose etc., whether it can meet the persons care needs. Patients in acute hospitals that have difficulty finding a nursing home that can meet their particular care requirements are generally those that are most highly dependent. In the majority of cases, this category of patients are ultimately accommodated in public nursing homes. The Department is working closely with the HSE to develop an overall plan regarding future public nursing home provision for the Minister's consideration. The plan will reflect regional need and have regard to the current severe financial constraints, restrictions on public sector staffing and recruitment and the on-going need to meet service and safety standards; all of which pose challenges for community nursing units across the country.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is currently the subject of a review. The terms of reference for this review are as follows; taking account of Government policy, demographic trends and the fiscal situation; to examine the on-going sustainability of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme; to examine the overall cost of long term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices; having regard to 1 and 2 above, to consider the balance of funding between long-term residential care and community based services; to consider the extension of the scheme to community based services and to other sectors (Disability and Mental Health), and to make recommendations for the future operation and management of the Scheme.

This is at the discretion of the marketing authorisation holders. The standard industry practice across Europe is for prescription tablets to be packaged in sizes of 28, as this number has been found to be convenient for patients. Where the quantity of a preparation prescribed does not correspond with an original pack size and it is not feasible to supply the exact amount prescribed, the pharmacist may, in the exercise of his or her professional judgement and bearing in mind the nature of the product and his or her statutory obligations, supply the nearest pack size to the quantity prescribed.</p><p>  It is a condition of the Drug Payment Scheme that no individual or family grouping will pay more than &euro;144 in a calendar month (i.e.&euro;144 x 12 in a full year). The payment of a second &euro;144 (in the same pharmacy) should only arise when a person is intentionally getting the next month&rsquo;s supply on the grounds that he/she will be away the following month or for other such reason. To ensure that an individual or family makes no more than 12 payments in a year it is suggested by the HSE that, where appropriate, once in a 12-month period or periodically throughout the year more than a 28-day supply is given. The packaging will influence how this can be achieved.</p></reply>

All medicines containing fluoxetine authorised for the Irish market are Prescription Only Medicines, i.e. may only be supplied on foot of a prescription from a medical practitioner. Fluoxetine products are used to treat major depressive episodes, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Bulimia Nervosa. In the prescribing information, the usual starting dose of fluoxetine is 20 mg daily for adults. It may be necessary for the prescriber to increase the dose depending on the response of the patient to a maximum of 60 mg daily for adults. As for all prescribed medicines, patients who have been prescribed fluoxetine medicines should be reviewed periodically by their treating medical practitioner to ensure that both the medicine and the dose continue to be a suitable treatment for the individual patient.</p><p>  There are no dosage criteria in place for prescribed drugs and medicines reimbursed under the GMS or other community drug schemes operated by the HSE. Prescribers are responsible for prescribing the appropriate dosage level of a medicine in accordance with the patient's clinical needs. The supply of prescription medicines is controlled in law in a number of ways. Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, it is prohibited for a person to supply a prescription only medicine except in accordance with a prescription, and the supply must be made from a registered pharmacy by or under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist. A person who contravenes these Regulations is guilty of an offence.</p></reply>

They are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months. For persons with a terminal illness, no means test applies.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months. Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

The reaction has been positive.  Professor John Higgins is also carrying out a debriefing exercise, supported by my Department and the HSE, to help ready the hospitals for the impending changes.   Since the launch of the Report, he has held approx. 50 meetings with hospitals in this regard.  </p><p>  Implementation of the Report will be overseen by a National Strategic Advisory Group and driven by the HSE through the Hospital Groups Implementation team which is currently being established.  The National Strategic Advisory Group will be chaired by Mr Leo Kearns, CEO of the Royal College of Physicians.  Professor John Higgins will also be a member of this group, providing continuity and building on the significant goodwill and reassurance he has brought  to the formative phase of the establishment of these groups.  The group will provide guidance and on-going direction in relation to implementation of both the Hospital Groups Report and the Smaller Hospitals Framework.  It will also provide a forum to resolve issues and assist in the development of specific guidelines on the steps required for full implementation.  </p><p>  I will appoint Chairs of each Group in the next few weeks. Advertisements to seek other board members will be placed in parallel with the process of appointing the Group Chairs and the subsequent appointment of group CEOs and management teams. All appointments will be made based on the competencies the individual brings to the Board in line with the HIQA report on Tallaght. </p><p>  Within one year of the formation of Hospital Groups, individual groups will be required to submit a strategic plan which will outline its plans for future services within the group area. These strategic plans will determine the way services are provided within each group.  The implementation of these plans by each group with then be rigorously reviewed, including all necessary due diligence checks, to see whether they are in a position to advance to Hospital Trust status after the necessary legislation is put in place.  </p></reply>

Given the limited funds available, the decision was taken that the main priority to 2016 is to protect investment made to date, to maintain safety standards. and to progress affordable projects  such as Luas Cross City which add value to the existing network.  </p><p>  While Metro North was being procured as a Public Private Partnership (PPP) with a targeted  EIB loan of up to &euro;500 million it also required a very significant Exchequer contribution to support the PPP. This Exchequer contribution is not affordable within the funding envelope now available for transport projects to 2016. In addition, the successful awarding of a major PPP contract involving private funding of the size required for  Metro North is challenging at any time but is particularly challenging in current circumstances. The road  PPPs currently being progressed require a much smaller private sector involvement and do not require any further  Exchequer support  for construction.  Furthermore, securing the closure of these much smaller roads PPPS has proven challenging, with only one, so far, having being brought to financial close since 2008.</p><p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) is currently preparing an Integrated Implementation Plan for investment to 2018  in the GDA as required under the DTA ACT 2008. This plan will address the investment needs of the Swords /Airport corridor to 2018 based on available funding and will be subject to public consultation later this year. Furthermore I have asked my officials to prepare a Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport which will inform future investment plans and this work which will include a review of Metro North as well as other projects is underway.  Metro North is postponed not cancelled and is kept under review.  </p></reply>

The carrying out of works on these roads is a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The selection and prioritisation of road works to be funded from these State grants is also a matter for the local authority.  In carrying our the selection and prioritisation of road works, individual councils should ensure as far as practicable that priority is given to projects most requiring attention in the county as a whole and are reminded in the Memorandum on Grants for Regional and Local Roads that projects should be prioritised based on engineering need and structural deficiency within their entire network of regional and local roads.</p><p>  While the Department has no input into how a council allocates its own resources expenditure, it is hoped, particularly given the current financial circumstances, that this funding too is allocated to areas most in need.  The area engineer, in consultation with elected members, is best placed to prioritise projects and how funding should be allocated from own resources expenditure and I do not intend to direct county managers on this issue.  Under section 70 of the Roads Act 1993, it is the responsibility of landowners and occupiers of land to take all reasonable care to ensure that trees, hedges and other vegetation growing on their land are not a danger to people using or working on a public road.  I have no plans to amend this legislation.</p></reply>

To assist in setting these special speed limits, my Department issued Guidelines for the Application of Special Speed Limits to all local authorities in January 2011 and the onus is on local authorities to take them into account in relation to any special speed limits which they set.</p><p>  The purpose of these guidelines is to provide advice and guidance in relation to the making of speed limit bye-laws by county and city councils for the purpose of applying special speed limits. After taking the guidelines into account it is considered best practice for local authority officials to advise the elected members of their respective councils on what a suitable speed limit regime should be for different roads in their areas of responsibility. For new roads the local authority would have access to the the relevant technical information relating to the speed for which the road was designed.</p><p>  As part of a Direction given by the then Minister in January 2011, all local authorities were requested to undertake an assessment of special speed limits in their functional areas. I do not believe that the local authorities sufficiently engaged with this direction and as a result in 2012, I announced that a review of speed limits would be undertaken and to that end, my Department established a stakeholder group to progress this work. The Automobile Association, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Road Safety Authority, the National Roads Authority, representatives of local authorities and the National Transport Authority accepted my invitation to participate in the Working Group.  As the Deputy will appreciate, this is an issue which requires detailed consideration. I anticipate that the Group will report to me shortly, and I will give careful consideration to any recommendations contained in their Report.</p></reply>

The Council meets in this format in order to make decisions on common policies and approaches in the area of transport including areas where there may be scope to better integrate transport provision throughout the island.</p><p>  The most recent NSMC meeting in Transport Sectoral format took place on 17th April in Armagh. The meeting was attended by Alex Attwood MLA, Minister for the Environment in Northern Ireland, Danny Kennedy MLA Minister for Regional Development in Northern Ireland, and me. Amongst the agenda items for this meeting was an update on the A5 and A8 major road projects; a progress report on the work which is underway to allow for the mutual recognition of penalty points; a review of the ongoing cooperation in the areas of road user and vehicle safety as well as a discussion on EU matters which impact on the transport sector in the two jurisdictions. Other items which have previously featured on the agenda at NSMC Transport meetings have included the All Island Freight Forum, developments on the Dublin/Belfast Rail line and cross-border community based rural transport.</p><p>  The next NSMC meeting in Transport Sectoral format is scheduled for 28th November 2013.  I look forward to the very positive cooperation in the transport area continuing and to availing of any other beneficial opportunities for north/south cooperation, including in relation to an integrated transport system, in the future.</p></reply>

Conditions were attached to the permission which included the development of a scheme of demand management measures. The NRA in conjunction with the relevant local authorities have been working on such a scheme.    </p><p>  When I took over as Minister for Transport I undertook a review of tolling policy.  Having reviewed the position and and in the context of budgetary measures increasing VAT and carbon tax I came to the decision in late 2011 that new tolls would not be introduced during my term as Minister for Transport. In relation to the M50 specifically, the likely impact of multi-point tolling will be to push vehicles on to other roads and through local communities. At present, congestion is not the problem that it was when An Bord Pleanala granted permission to the M50 upgrade, but it will re-emerge as an issue if and when the economy recovers. At that point we will need a joined-up solution to deal with congestion across the Greater Dublin Area, and not just on the M50.</p></reply>

I am aware that, like many other sectors, farmers can find it difficult to get investment credit due to the stricter assessments introduced as a result of the recent banking crisis. Ensuring that farmers have access to financing for farm investments is a crucial issue for me as ongoing new investment will have a major role to play in improving overall competitiveness at farm level by improving productivity and thus help contribute in meeting our ambitious targets set out in Food Harvest 2020.</p><p>  Despite some concerns expressed about lack of investment credit, a relatively small number of cases from the agri-food sector have come before the Credit Review Office.  I would encourage farmers to make use of this system should they have difficulty in accessing credit for farm investments.  I am aware that a number of banks have designed new credit facilities specifically tailored for the agri-food sector in recent times. In addition, the most recent Central Bank data for lending to SMEs, covering Q1 2013, shows that the primary agriculture sector was top of the list in value terms for new lending to SMEs during the quarter. With a total of &euro;149m, it was far ahead of the second placed wholesale/retail sector on &euro;92m and represented 32%, excluding Financial Intermediation and Property Services, of all such new lending during the period.</p><p>  I will continue to meet with relevant lenders on a regular basis to discuss agri credit issues including the need for them to continue to ensure new credit lines are available for investments in the farming sector.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-20a.1697.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013062000082#WRV00700"><p>Commonage lands form an important part of the farming enterprises of many farmers, particularly along the West Coast.  They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism. However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. </p><p>  Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission. It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC (Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition), or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC. It is my stated aim that this will be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State Agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.</p><p>  I readily acknowledge that it will not be an easy task, but it is achievable if all stakeholders work in a co-operative basis. If action is not taken now, the areas will continue to deteriorate and will lead to more land abandonment. If this is allowed to happen, Ireland will lose a valuable resource from the point of view of farming, rural economy, bio-diversity and wildlife. While grazing is the only method of managing these lands, the task facing us is how to ensure that these grazing levels are appropriate to the individual commonages.</p><p>  In order to ensure that the achievement of this objective, as already stated, we need the input of individual shareholders. Grazing plans, at the level of each commonage, will allow for greater flexibility for shareholders and will enable the active farmers to increase their stock to cater for dormant and inactive persons. It will be matter for agreement between the shareholders &ndash; as was always the case &ndash; to decide how best to reach the stocking levels. Professional assistance will be required, in particular where the commonage has been damaged by under-grazing.</p><p>  The Grazing Plan will have to cater the traditional farming methods for the area, with provision made for sheep and other animals, such as cattle, providing that they are appropriate to the habitat. An appropriate time-scale will have to be put in place but the Plan should include the incremental steps to achieve GAEC. The whole concept will be output driven, in that the assessment of the Plans will be based on whether the commonage is in GAEC or not or whether the appropriate progress has been achieved.  </p><p>  Apart from ensuring that the Grazing Plan is valid, there are a number of other complications, including:</p><p>  - Dormant shareholders &ndash; in the majority of cases, these persons are no longer farming;</p><p>  - Current claimants on the commonages, who do not farm or manage the lands. The issue of whether the latter claimants will continue to be eligible for payment will have to be examined.   </p><p>  There are other issues that will need to be considered. These include the fact that many commonage habitats have been significantly damaged by under-grazing, with resulting problems that must be addressed including land abandonment, spread of scrub and invasive species.</p><p>  While it is generally accepted that this is a very complex matter and requires a very detailed action plan to cover the various issues, I intend to set out proposals on how these matters will be progressed in the near future.  </p></reply>

To qualify, the herdowner must comply with the conditions of the BVD Eradication Programme, the statutory basis for which is set out in S.I. 532 of 2012.  In particular, the calves must have had an initial positive or inconclusive test for the Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Virus (BVD), and be removed from the herd, with a date of death notified to the Animal Identification Movement System (AIM).

My officials are endeavouring to examine and reply to these correspondents as quickly as possible. In the meantime,  I have outlined, to both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, and in replies to previous Dail questions my response to the distressing events highlighted in this programme.</p><p>  The programme showed us what happens when you don't invest in building an effective system and culture of qualify-focussed, child-centred service provision, and when you don't invest in robust oversight and inspection.</p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to improve the quality of the free Preschool Year and, by extension, the quality of all early childhood care and education, through the implementation of standards and by reviewing training options for the workforce. These commitments have always been a key priority for me.</p><p>As part of this work programme, my Department and I have been progressing work on Ireland's first-ever Early Years Strategy and this why we have been working on a comprehensive<b></b>  Preschool Quality Agenda. </p><p>  We have identified 8 key areas of action which I believe need to be considered and addressed as a matter of urgency:</p><p> - increasing the qualification requirements for all staff in preschool services to a minimum standard at FETAC Level 5;</p><p> - improving the quality and curricular supports for preschool services when implementing the S&iacute;olta Framework and Aistear Curriculum; </p><p> - implementing the new National Preschool Standards;</p><p> - introducing a registration system for all preschool services;</p><p> - taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust;</p><p> - publishing inspection reports on-line as soon as possible;</p><p> - ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance; and</p><p> - increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance.</p><p><b>Increasing the required qualification standards of child care staff</b></p><p>  We are working to increase the required qualification standards of child-care staff. The majority of staff working in the sector now have qualifications to FETAC Level 5 and I believe that this should be made a requirement for all staff working in the sector by September 2015, and for new services by the earlier date of September 2014.  I am also proposing that the minimum qualification requirement for Preschool Leaders within the Preschool Year should be increased from FETAC Level 5 to FETAC Level 6 from those dates also.</p><p><b>Supports for Aistear and S&iacute;olta.</b></p><p>  We are working to improve support and mentoring for individual preschool services in implementing S&iacute;olta and Aistear.  This is essential if we are to ensure that all services understand and implement a child-centred approach to the care and education of young children.</p><p><b>Implementing the new National Preschool Standards.</b></p><p>  We are developing new National Preschool Standards, designed to support providers in delivering a high quality service and parents in choosing the child care best suited to their needs.  New day-care standards have been completed but have not yet been implemented.  Later this year it is intended to launch these standards alongside further standards on sessional care and child-minding which are currently being finalised. These standards will replace all current guidelines and will be implemented and inspected in line with the new registration system and improved inspection systems.</p><p><b>Registration of all child-care providers.</b></p><p>  Work is already underway in the Child and Family Services area of the Health Service Executive (HSE) to introduce a registration system for preschool services.  I understand this system will be in place for new services from the end of this year and will be phased in for existing services thereafter.  This is an important development because it will move services from the current position, where they are required to notify the Preschool Inspectorate of their intention to open, to a requirement to be inspected and found satisfactory, before being permitted to open.  All preschool services are currently required to pay an annual fee to the HSE of between &euro;40 and &euro;80.  I am looking at increasing this fee.  The additional funds raised will assist in improving inspection and supports for quality improvement.</p><p><b>Publication of Inspection Reports.</b></p><p>Parents will rightly demand and expect the highest standards and this will be a key factor in driving change in the sector.  Publishing inspection reports is an essential step in ensuring high standards and accountability. All <i>new</i> inspection reports will be made available on-line from the HSE as a matter of urgency.  All <i>current</i>   inspection reports will be made available on-line in 2014.</p><p><b>Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust.</b></p><p>  We are working on developing a more robust, consistent and regular inspection system  There has been a significant programme of work underway in the HSE over the past year to develop a single, consistent national inspection service (as opposed to 37 different local systems).  </p><p>  We propose moving to a position where there is consistent and assured national target rate for the frequency of inspection of preschool services, while ensuring capacity for prioritisation based on risk assessment.   The HSE is currently reviewing the regional spread of inspectors with a view to identifying whether either additional resources or redeployment of existing inspectors is required to achieve this. </p><p>  Building on this work, officials of my Department and the Department of Education and Skills have been examining options to incrementally develop a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for preschools; moving away from a narrow focus on compliance, and leading to a greater focus on children's outcomes, including educational development and child well-being.  This work is being informed by the findings of a recent Joint Pilot Inspection carried out in a small number of settings by Inspectors from the Health Service Executive and the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p><b>Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance.</b></p><p>  We are working to ensure consistent action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance. There must be a follow-through on inspections.  Clearly, services which are found to be in serious breach of the Regulations will face closure and prosecution.   It is proposed to develop a protocol with the Preschool Inspectorate which will take a calibrated approach and which will enable more decisive action to be taken in response to non-compliance.</p><p><b>Increased Sanctions for non-compliance.</b></p><p>  My Department will also be undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (No. 2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.  The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution, as is currently the case.  </p><p>  The recent broadcast highlighted practices on the part of individual staff members which were of very serious concern.  The responsibility of management must also be the subject of questioning.  Management is responsible for the selection and training of staff, the development of operational policies and practices and the management of day to day service delivery.  Most of all management is responsible for the culture and ethos of the preschool - they set the tone through their example, their interaction with children and parents and their guidance of staff.  </p><p>  This preschool quality agenda represents an essential building block towards the future extension of universal preschool provision; including the objective which I have previously spoken of in relation to introducing a second free preschool year. </p><p>  I believe it is critical to the quality agenda for early childhood care and education that my Department continues to work in close co-operation with the Department of Education and Skills, given the overlap of interest between the Departments in regard to education for children under 6 years of age, as reflected in S&iacute;olta, Aistear and the Workforce Development Plan, and the professional training role of the State funded training bodies.  The two Departments are already working together on these issues and on the development of a joint approach to preschool inspection.</p></reply>

This funding is being allocated to each HSE Region based on its percentage of population. Both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of the funding in a creative and flexible manner so as to secure as many places as possible for this cohort.  </p><p>  The demand for services for school-leavers continues to grow. The HSE expects that approximately 700 young people who have finished their education or life-skills training will require services in 2013.  Providing the level of services required within the additional funding provided will continue to be a challenge. Work in this area will be progressed largely in line with the HSE guidance document developed in 2012, which led to the successful placement of 99% of RT graduates and 96% of school leavers last year. </p><p>  It is envisaged that plans will be completed for each region shortly and submitted to Area Managers, Regional Specialists and Regional Director of Operations for agreement.  Arising from completed and approved plans, a communication process will be agreed with service providers to inform families of the services that will be available from September 2013. </p><p>  In respect of the specific question asked by the Deputy, as it relates to service matters I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

However, the studies I was referring to in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 1019 includes one of the most comprehensive and recent reviews carried out in this area.  This review, entitled &quot;Plain Tobacco Packaging: A Systematic Review&quot; (Moodie et al), outlines the findings of  37 studies and provides evidence on the impacts of standardised/plain tobacco packaging.  The review included studies from 1980 up to the time of its publication.  The primary aim of the review was to assess the impact of standardised or plain packaging on the appeal of the packaging or product, the salience and effectiveness of health warnings and the perceptions of product strength and harm.  The review concluded that there is strong evidence to support the introduction of standardised/plain packaging.</p></reply>

Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to appropriate quality long-term residential care. Access to appropriate quality long-term residential care is underpinned by both the system of registration and inspection of nursing homes and the financial support available under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.</p><p>Essentially, our aim is to ensure that people are being cared for at the point of lowest complexity. People should only be entering long-term nursing home when they have passed the point of being able to be cared for at home. This means that only the most highly dependent people should be in long-term nursing home care. One of the key priorities identified in the HSE's <i>National Operational Plan 2013</i> is the progression of a Single Assessment Tool for older people. This standardised framework will ensure that there is a robust, equitable standardised care needs assessment nationally. It will also allow resources to be targeted towards those with the greatest needs and enable supports and services to be designed in the most appropriate way possible. The Nursing Homes Support Scheme applies to public, private and voluntary nursing homes and includes a principle of resident choice, i.e. the resident chooses their nursing home themselves, subject to the availability of a bed and the ability of the nursing home to meet their care needs. When a person selects a particular nursing home, that nursing home will carry out an assessment to ensure that it can meet the person's care needs. It is a matter for each private nursing home to determine, having regard to its Statement of Purpose etc., whether it can meet the persons care needs. Patients in acute hospitals that have difficulty finding a nursing home that can meet their particular care requirements are generally those that are most highly dependent. In the majority of cases, this category of patients are ultimately accommodated in public nursing homes. The Department is working closely with the HSE to develop an overall plan regarding future public nursing home provision for the Minister's consideration. The plan will reflect regional need and have regard to the current severe financial constraints, restrictions on public sector staffing and recruitment and the on-going need to meet service and safety standards; all of which pose challenges for community nursing units across the country.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is currently the subject of a review. The terms of reference for this review are as follows; taking account of Government policy, demographic trends and the fiscal situation; to examine the on-going sustainability of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme; to examine the overall cost of long term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices; having regard to 1 and 2 above, to consider the balance of funding between long-term residential care and community based services; to consider the extension of the scheme to community based services and to other sectors (Disability and Mental Health), and to make recommendations for the future operation and management of the Scheme. The review will look at possible alternative models of care. Work will continue on the review in the coming months with a view to completion by end 2013-early 2014.</p></reply>

This is at the discretion of the marketing authorisation holders. The standard industry practice across Europe is for prescription tablets to be packaged in sizes of 28, as this number has been found to be convenient for patients. Where the quantity of a preparation prescribed does not correspond with an original pack size and it is not feasible to supply the exact amount prescribed, the pharmacist may, in the exercise of his or her professional judgement and bearing in mind the nature of the product and his or her statutory obligations, supply the nearest pack size to the quantity prescribed.</p><p>  It is a condition of the Drug Payment Scheme that no individual or family grouping will pay more than &euro;144 in a calendar month (i.e.&euro;144 x 12 in a full year). The payment of a second &euro;144 (in the same pharmacy) should only arise when a person is intentionally getting the next month&rsquo;s supply on the grounds that he/she will be away the following month or for other such reason. To ensure that an individual or family makes no more than 12 payments in a year it is suggested by the HSE that, where appropriate, once in a 12-month period or periodically throughout the year more than a 28-day supply is given. The packaging will influence how this can be achieved.</p></reply>

All medicines containing fluoxetine authorised for the Irish market are Prescription Only Medicines, i.e. may only be supplied on foot of a prescription from a medical practitioner. Fluoxetine products are used to treat major depressive episodes, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Bulimia Nervosa. In the prescribing information, the usual starting dose of fluoxetine is 20 mg daily for adults. It may be necessary for the prescriber to increase the dose depending on the response of the patient to a maximum of 60 mg daily for adults. As for all prescribed medicines, patients who have been prescribed fluoxetine medicines should be reviewed periodically by their treating medical practitioner to ensure that both the medicine and the dose continue to be a suitable treatment for the individual patient.</p><p>  There are no dosage criteria in place for prescribed drugs and medicines reimbursed under the GMS or other community drug schemes operated by the HSE. Prescribers are responsible for prescribing the appropriate dosage level of a medicine in accordance with the patient's clinical needs. The supply of prescription medicines is controlled in law in a number of ways. Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, it is prohibited for a person to supply a prescription only medicine except in accordance with a prescription, and the supply must be made from a registered pharmacy by or under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist. A person who contravenes these Regulations is guilty of an offence.</p></reply>

They are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months. For persons with a terminal illness, no means test applies.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months. Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

Given the limited funds available, the decision was taken that the main priority to 2016 is to protect investment made to date, to maintain safety standards. and to progress affordable projects  such as Luas Cross City which add value to the existing network.  </p><p>  While Metro North was being procured as a Public Private Partnership (PPP) with a targeted  EIB loan of up to &euro;500 million it also required a very significant Exchequer contribution to support the PPP. This Exchequer contribution is not affordable within the funding envelope now available for transport projects to 2016. In addition, the successful awarding of a major PPP contract involving private funding of the size required for  Metro North is challenging at any time but is particularly challenging in current circumstances. The road  PPPs currently being progressed require a much smaller private sector involvement and do not require any further  Exchequer support  for construction.  Furthermore, securing the closure of these much smaller roads PPPS has proven challenging, with only one, so far, having being brought to financial close since 2008.</p><p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) is currently preparing an Integrated Implementation Plan for investment to 2018  in the GDA as required under the DTA ACT 2008. This plan will address the investment needs of the Swords /Airport corridor to 2018 based on available funding and will be subject to public consultation later this year. Furthermore I have asked my officials to prepare a Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport which will inform future investment plans and this work which will include a review of Metro North as well as other projects is underway.  Metro North is postponed not cancelled and is kept under review.  </p></reply>

The carrying out of works on these roads is a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The selection and prioritisation of road works to be funded from these State grants is also a matter for the local authority.  In carrying our the selection and prioritisation of road works, individual councils should ensure as far as practicable that priority is given to projects most requiring attention in the county as a whole and are reminded in the Memorandum on Grants for Regional and Local Roads that projects should be prioritised based on engineering need and structural deficiency within their entire network of regional and local roads.</p><p>  While the Department has no input into how a council allocates its own resources expenditure, it is hoped, particularly given the current financial circumstances, that this funding too is allocated to areas most in need.  The area engineer, in consultation with elected members, is best placed to prioritise projects and how funding should be allocated from own resources expenditure and I do not intend to direct county managers on this issue.  Under section 70 of the Roads Act 1993, it is the responsibility of landowners and occupiers of land to take all reasonable care to ensure that trees, hedges and other vegetation growing on their land are not a danger to people using or working on a public road.  I have no plans to amend this legislation.</p></reply>

To assist in setting these special speed limits, my Department issued Guidelines for the Application of Special Speed Limits to all local authorities in January 2011 and the onus is on local authorities to take them into account in relation to any special speed limits which they set.</p><p>  The purpose of these guidelines is to provide advice and guidance in relation to the making of speed limit bye-laws by county and city councils for the purpose of applying special speed limits. After taking the guidelines into account it is considered best practice for local authority officials to advise the elected members of their respective councils on what a suitable speed limit regime should be for different roads in their areas of responsibility. For new roads the local authority would have access to the the relevant technical information relating to the speed for which the road was designed.</p><p>  As part of a Direction given by the then Minister in January 2011, all local authorities were requested to undertake an assessment of special speed limits in their functional areas. I do not believe that the local authorities sufficiently engaged with this direction and as a result in 2012, I announced that a review of speed limits would be undertaken and to that end, my Department established a stakeholder group to progress this work. The Automobile Association, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Road Safety Authority, the National Roads Authority, representatives of local authorities and the National Transport Authority accepted my invitation to participate in the Working Group.  As the Deputy will appreciate, this is an issue which requires detailed consideration. I anticipate that the Group will report to me shortly, and I will give careful consideration to any recommendations contained in their Report.</p></reply>

The Council meets in this format in order to make decisions on common policies and approaches in the area of transport including areas where there may be scope to better integrate transport provision throughout the island.</p><p>  The most recent NSMC meeting in Transport Sectoral format took place on 17th April in Armagh. The meeting was attended by Alex Attwood MLA, Minister for the Environment in Northern Ireland, Danny Kennedy MLA Minister for Regional Development in Northern Ireland, and me. Amongst the agenda items for this meeting was an update on the A5 and A8 major road projects; a progress report on the work which is underway to allow for the mutual recognition of penalty points; a review of the ongoing cooperation in the areas of road user and vehicle safety as well as a discussion on EU matters which impact on the transport sector in the two jurisdictions. Other items which have previously featured on the agenda at NSMC Transport meetings have included the All Island Freight Forum, developments on the Dublin/Belfast Rail line and cross-border community based rural transport.</p><p>  The next NSMC meeting in Transport Sectoral format is scheduled for 28th November 2013.  I look forward to the very positive cooperation in the transport area continuing and to availing of any other beneficial opportunities for north/south cooperation, including in relation to an integrated transport system, in the future.</p></reply>

Conditions were attached to the permission which included the development of a scheme of demand management measures. The NRA in conjunction with the relevant local authorities have been working on such a scheme.    </p><p>  When I took over as Minister for Transport I undertook a review of tolling policy.  Having reviewed the position and and in the context of budgetary measures increasing VAT and carbon tax I came to the decision in late 2011 that new tolls would not be introduced during my term as Minister for Transport. In relation to the M50 specifically, the likely impact of multi-point tolling will be to push vehicles on to other roads and through local communities. At present, congestion is not the problem that it was when An Bord Pleanala granted permission to the M50 upgrade, but it will re-emerge as an issue if and when the economy recovers. At that point we will need a joined-up solution to deal with congestion across the Greater Dublin Area, and not just on the M50.</p></reply>
