Among the assigned roles is Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) meaning in practice to assist, when requested, An Garda Sioch&aacute;na who have primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State. e Defence Forces undertake a broad range of ATCP operations. One of the duties that the Defence Forces provide, pursuant to their role of rendering Aid to the Civil Power, is the provision of escorts during the transportation of explosives.  As this is a role only carried out at the request of An Garda Sioch&aacute;na, no monies are received by the Department of Defence for the provision of this service. </p></reply>

In that regard, all elements of the Defence organisation&rsquo;s expenditure have been critically reviewed in order to reflect the current financial climate.  Arising from the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in 2011, the Government decided to stabilise the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel. A major reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve is ongoing and this will ensure that within the reduced strength, the operational effectiveness of the Defence Forces is maintained. This is being achieved through the rationalising of headquarters, administrative and support functions and re-balancing force elements in favour of &ldquo;front line&rdquo; operational Units.</p><p>  While the reorganisation means that certain units are being disbanded, amalgamated or relocated, it maintains, as far as possible, the existing organisational strengths within the current locations.  </p><p>Given the complexity of the reorganisation process and the associated logistics to be managed by the Defence Forces, it is too early to say as to whether there will be an increase or decrease in fuel costs. This will only be evident when the full reorganisation is in place for a reasonable period.  To that end, I am advised that the Defence Forces are in the process of collating data on transportation costs with a view to determining the net costs involved.</p></reply>

In this regard, the level of remuneration in the Defence sector has maintained relativity with the levels available in other related public sector employments.</p><p>  A Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for members of the Permanent Defence Force was established in 1993.  It provides a formal mechanism for the representative Associations, RACO and PDFORRA, to engage with the Official side. The purpose of the scheme is to provide a means for the determination of claims and proposals from the Associations relating to remuneration and conditions of service.  Since 1993, there have been significant developments and improvements in the pay and conditions of military personnel.  The Representative Associations have been to the fore in advancing the interests of their members in this regard, bringing them in line generally with the pay and conditions available in other public service employments.  </p><p>  As the Deputies will appreciate, it has proved necessary to take very significant action in terms of adjusting downwards the pay and conditions for staff right across the Public Service.  The Defence Forces cannot be immune to these changes and indeed have had similar pay cuts and a radical reorganization of the Defence Forces structures, which has reduced numbers serving and promotional opportunities for personnel.  As a result of the continuing economic challenges facing the country and the requirement for further measures to restore fiscal sustainability, discussions have opened with the public sector trade unions affiliated to ICTU about mechanisms to deliver required savings of up to &euro;1 billion in the public sector pay bill in the period 2013 - 2015. In parallel, discussions are also taking place between officials of my Department and the Associations representing members of the Permanent Defence Force. </p><p>  It is of course open to the Representative Associations of the members of the Permanent Defence Force, subject to the terms of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme and the Croke Park Agreement, to avail of the mechanisms in place should they wish to pursue any particular concerns in relation to the pay and conditions of their members.</p></reply>

These are the numbers of personnel who regularly attend training with A Company, 62 Infantry Battalion, the sub unit who&rsquo;s catchment area encompasses the populated areas in question. am advised that the figure of 32 is based on information available for the training year November 2011 to October 2012.   The Deputy will be aware recently published a Value for Money Review of the Reserve Defence Force. </p><p>  Having accepted the review&rsquo;s recommendations directed that proposals for new organisational structures be prepared, taking account of the VFM report and the major re-organisation of the PDF. The Chief of Staff and Secretary General submitted an agreed report which set out detailed re-organisation proposals, including Unit structures and the location of Reserve Units. accepted these proposals.</p><p>  Work on implementing the recommendations of the VFM is underway. In this context would like to emphasise that the contribution and commitment of each and every member of the Reserve is valued and appreciated and sincerely hope that all members of the Reserve will continue to serve within the new organisation.</p></reply>

The purpose of the EU Battlegroups is to provide a rapid level of response to developing international crises, allowing the EU to intervene during the critical early stages or to reinforce an existing operation.  To date, no Battlegroup has been deployed.  </p><p>  Two invitations have been received by Ireland to participate in future EU Battlegroups.  One invitation has been received to participate in the Nordic Battlegroup 2015, together with Sweden, acting as Framework Nation, Finland, Norway and Estonia.  The second invitation has been received to participate in the EU Battlegroup 2016, with Germany, acting as Framework Nation, Luxembourg, Austria, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands. Discussions are ongoing with both the participants in both groups on Ireland&#8217;s potential contribution to these future Battlegroups.  In principle, I support Ireland&#8217;s continued participation.  However, any participation will be subject to formal Government approval at the appropriate time.</p></reply>

The Defence Forces have participated in UNTSO since 1958. Defence Forces personnel serving with this mission are based in Syria, Israel and Lebanon.  The main functions of UNTSO are to maintain regional dialogue, monitor ceasefires, supervise armistice agreements and to assist UN peacekeeping operations in Lebanon and Syria.     The six UNTSO Defence Forces personnel based in Syria are part of Observer Group Golan responsible for the Syrian side of the Golan Heights. One Irish officer is the Chief of Observer Group Golan and has responsibility for the conduct of operations by UN Military Observers within Israeli Occupied Golan and Syria. The remaining five (5) Defence Forces personnel are deployed as UN Military Observers and conduct their duties in support of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights. Their duties include manning Observation Posts, conducting fortnightly inspections of the deployment of Syrian Arab Armed Forces and conducting patrols within the Area of Limitation in order to ensure that no activities occur which could lead to the breach of the ceasefire between Israel and Syria.</p><p>  As the security situation in Syria remains highly volatile, Defence Forces personnel normally based in Damascus were relocated by UNTSO to offices and accommodation at UNDOF Headquarters in the Golan Heights, on 15 October 2012, as a temporary force protection measure. The Irish personnel continue to fulfill their roles from this temporary location. It is intended that they will return to offices and accommodation in Damascus should there be an improvement in the security situation.</p><p>  Six members of the Permanent Defence Force who had been deployed as unarmed military observers to the United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS) were withdrawn in August 2012 when the mission&rsquo;s mandate came to an end.</p></reply>

On 20 December 2001, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1386 under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, authorising the establishment of an International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, and there are fourteen UN Security Council Resolutions relating to ISAF, most recently UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2069 (2012), adopted on 9 October 2012. is latest UN Security Council Resolution extended ISAF&rsquo;s mandate for a further year until October 2013.   Ireland has participated in the NATO&ndash;led UN mandated mission since 5 July 2002, following the Government Decision of 2 July 2002, authorising the provision of seven (7) members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the force. The continued participation by seven (7) members of the Permanent Defence Force in ISAF is reviewed annually by the Government. The most recent decision by the Government was on 26 June 2012, when it agreed to continue to provide seven members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with ISAF for a further period from July 2012, subject to ongoing review by the Minister for Defence. Planning for the drawdown of ISAF generally is currently ongoing and the withdrawal of the Defence Forces personnel from the mission will be coordinated within the context of the overall ISAF drawdown plan.</p></reply>

The central recommendation from the VFM Steering Committee is for the retention of the Reserve with 4,000 personnel spread countrywide to be based in barracks and in 16 other locations. This requires the consolidation of existing Reserve Units throughout the country into a smaller number of full-strength Units. The retention of all locations was not a viable or sustainable option. </p><p>  A new &ldquo;Single Force&rdquo; concept will see PDF Units having Reserve components, rather than a parallel Reserve as at present. Reserve Units within barracks will be supported by their parent PDF Unit and the 16 Units outside of PDF installations will be supported by dedicated full time PDF personnel. This concept offers significant potential advantages in terms of training and development of the Reserve. The initiative of locating Reserve Officers within the Defence Forces command structure will likewise underpin the future of Reserve personnel. </p><p>  All options to avoid the need for personnel to relocate are being explored as part of the re-organisation process. Personnel are being offered the opportunity for reassignment and every effort is being made to minimise the requirement to relocate. Inevitably, given the scale of the re-organisation, it will be necessary for some staff to move to new locations.</p></reply>

In addition, the procurement of military equipment is prioritising operational capacity and two new Naval Service vessels are being procured from within the existing resource envelope.</p><p>  These measures will ensure that the Permanent Defence Force can continue to deliver required operational outputs for all approved Aid to the Civil Power and approved Aid to the Civil Authority requests. The PDF will also continue to meet Government requirements for overseas peace support operations. The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, is also available for deployments in response to emergencies and crises.  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces can continue to fulfil all roles assigned by Government.</p></reply>

However, one of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence (2000) is to provide Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice, means to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. A wide variety of military training activities are specifically designed to counter or respond to possible security emergencies.  The Defence Forces hold regular coordination and liaison meetings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to ATCP issues including identifying and responding effectively to any new or developing threats to internal and external State security.   While exact details in relation to the threat posed by dissident republicans cannot be made public for operational reasons, the Defence Forces maintain a strong and focussed operational awareness and response capability to all emerging threats within the State.</p></reply>

This has contributed to improvements in procedures and policies within the Defence Forces.   Recent trends show a significant increase in the number of redress of wrongs complaints being resolved within the military system, thus reducing the number of cases being referred to the Ombudsman for investigation, a fact I very much welcome.  In addition, it is anticipated that the new and comprehensive promotion system for NCOs agreed and introduced earlier this year will eliminate the many complaint referrals to the Ombudsman relating to promotion. Such referrals currently account for about a third of the caseload in the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office.  Against this background, the post of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is being filled on a part time, three day week basis, subject to ongoing review of caseload and referrals.  This remains the position.</p></reply>

Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a Joint Task Force involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking.</p><p>The Naval Service, as a member of the Joint Task Force, is also committed to an international initiative, the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre &ndash; Narcotics, (MAOC-N). The Centre which was established in 2007 has led to a greater focus on intelligence exchange amongst countries to tackle large drug shipments by sea. MAOC-N was set up by seven European countries and is designed as an international co-ordination force with access to national tasking agencies and requires participation and resources from all active members.An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service have full-time officers based at its Centre in Lisbon. Irish Naval Service personnel travel to the Centre when requested by the Joint Task Force. </p><p>The Naval Service operates eight general purpose patrol ships, which are tasked with coastal and offshore patrolling and surveillance for the State.The Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone at any one time.All vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that they also undertake general surveillance, security and other duties while on patrol.As the need arises, Naval Service vessels are deployed on drug interdiction operations. </p><p>A contract was placed in 2010 for the provision of two new Offshore Patrol Vessels with an overall length of 90 metres for the Naval Service. The acquisition of these new vessels will ensure that the Naval Service can continue to carry out its drug interdiction role in support of the Joint Task Force as well as its other taskings. </p><p>There are no plans to procure smaller coastal patrols vessels for the Naval Service. I am satisfied that Naval Service have the necessary resources to meet all their operational requirements including the support of the civil authorities in the prevention of drug smuggling into this country.</p></reply>

Central to those procedures is the requirement to allow fair competition between suppliers through the submission of tenders following advertising of the tender competition on the e-tenders site or on the European Defence Agency&rsquo;s Electronic Bulletin Board. Such tender competitions are open to any individual company or country in accordance with the terms of all UN, OSCE and EU arms embargos or restrictions. There are no such restrictions or embargos in place on Israel or Israeli companies. </p><p>  The primary purpose for the procurement of defensive equipment by the Department of Defence is to enhance the capability of the Irish Defence Forces on overseas Peace Support Operations and to afford the greatest possible force protection to Irish troops whilst on such missions.</p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains a roster of observers for election monitoring missions. We aim to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for both elections and constitutional referendums. Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union (EU) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), but have also been involved in missions organised by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Carter Centre. There are currently some 300 people on the Election Observation Roster. So far in 2012, 57 Irish observers have been involved in missions organised by both the EU and OSCE, in eleven countries. A review of the election roster is currently underway and my intention is to have this completed by the end of the first quarter of 2013.  The review will lead to the establishment of a new roster of individuals with the right mix of skills and experience to ensure that we maintain the excellent standard of election monitoring that Ireland has established.</p></reply>

Ireland is a firm friend of Kosovo, having been active as part of the international presence there since 1999. Ireland was one of the first States to recognise Kosovo&rsquo;s declaration of independence in 2008. We participated in the International Steering Group for Kosovo until the end of supervised independence on 10 September this year.   Irish personnel continue to participate in the EU Rule of Law mission in Kosovo (EULEX Kosovo) and the UN-mandated, NATO-led KFOR mission. Ireland provides support to Kosovo through contributions to the EU, UN and other multilateral organisations. Irish Aid has also contributed funding to Kosovo through its Partnership Programme for Europe and Central Asia. </p><p>  Our strong bilateral relationship is also evidenced by the number of Irish Government Ministers who have visited Kosovo in recent years. Most recently, my colleague, the Minister of State for European Affairs, Lucinda Creighton visited Kosovo in September, in the capacity of Ireland&rsquo;s Chairmanship of the OSCE, and as incoming EU Presidency. While there she met with the Deputy Prime Minister and the Deputy Foreign Minister, among other interlocutors. </p><p>We are encouraged by the recent resumption of the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue, and commend the efforts of Kosovar Prime Minister Hashim Tha&ccedil;i and Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Dačić   in this regard. We strongly encourage both sides to continue to work together to ensure further and sustainable progress. The improvement of relations between Serbia and Kosovo will be key for the EU aspirations of both. We would also encourage Kosovo to accelerate reforms in the areas of public administration, the rule of law, freedom of expression and the fight against corruption and organised crime.  </p><p>  We believe that the prospect of EU membership remains the EU&rsquo;s most effective tool in supporting reform and transformation for all of the countries of the Western Balkans. In that regard, we are supportive of Kosovo&rsquo;s EU perspective, as we are of the membership aspirations of all countries in the region. We will make every effort to progress Kosovo&rsquo;s EU perspective during our Presidency.</p></reply>

Peaceful protest is perfectly legitimate but respect for the rule of law is essential.  The attacks on the homes of elected representatives of the Alliance party and their families, and the death threats issued against members of that party are particularly distressing. These attacks, along with the destruction and damage caused to Alliance party offices are attacks on the democratic process itself. Assaults directed at PSNI officers such as we have witnessed are reprehensible and have no place in a civilised society.</p><p>  I spoke to David Ford on Thursday 6 December who is both Minister for Justice with devolved responsibility for policing and justice, and leader of the Alliance party. I conveyed to him the support of the Irish Government for the PSNI and solidarity with those members of his party who have had to endure assaults on themselves, their families and their property.  Yesterday afternoon I discussed the ongoing efforts of the two Governments in support of political progress with the Secretary of State Theresa Villiers.<b></b> Officials from my Department remain in close contact with members of the political parties, the PSNI and British officials on an ongoing basis.</p><p>  The Northern Ireland Assembly passed a motion on Monday morning with cross-community support which unequivocally condemned the rioting and the campaign of violent attacks on elected representatives and expressed its sympathy to all those who have been attacked or threatened.</p><p>  The Government will continue to do all in its power to support the political leaders in Northern Ireland as they work to move beyond the current tensions.

In line with this principle, the majority of social welfare payments are reckonable as income for tax purposes. These include long-term payments such as the Disablement Benefit, the State Pension, Widows, Invalidity and Blind Pensions, Carers Allowance and the One Parent Family Payment as well as short term benefits such as Job Seekers Benefit. Treating these payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.  Of course, the extent, if any, to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends on the level of income that a recipient has in a tax year.  If there is no other income besides the social welfare payment, the basic personal credits in force can be expected in most cases to ensure that no tax arises on the social welfare income itself.</p><p>  In addition, prior to the Budget day measure to treat maternity benefit as a taxable source of income, there were situations where an employee continued to be paid by her employer, in full, while on maternity leave and, based on her PRSI contributions, was entitled to Maternity Benefit from the Department of Social Protection and the previous non-taxation of such benefit resulted in an employee having a greater net take-home pay for the period of maternity benefit, than applied if she was at work.</p><p>  The rates of Maternity Benefit are earnings-related and are set to reflect post-tax income. It was never intended that a mother gain financially by being on maternity leave. The previous system that allows for a gain, for some recipients, was anomalous and not sustainable given the current budgetary constraints, hence the need to introduce taxation measures.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware, however, that in last week&rsquo;s Budget, I announced that maternity benefit will become fully taxable from 1 July 2013.  As maternity benefit was fully disregarded for tax purposes in 2011 and 2012, no direct refunds of tax were made by Revenue in respect of maternity benefit in those years. The Deputy may, however, be referring to the situation in which an employee resumes work after a period of maternity leave and has unused tax credits and rate bands available. Where this situation arises and the employee resumes work during the same year the employer would make any refund due on the first pay-date following return to work. In cases where the employee does not resume work until after the end of they year, she can apply to her local Revenue office for a review of her tax liability for the year.</p><p>  It is not possible to provide details of the amounts repaid, in 2011 or to date in 2012, to employees who have been on maternity leave as refunds arising from maternity benefit cannot be distinguished from refunds arising for other reasons.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, GNP equals GDP less net factor income from the rest of the world, the latter mainly relating to profit repatriation by multinational corporations.  Net factor outflows recorded a sharp fall in the second quarter of 2012 boosting GNP growth relative to GDP.

However I assume the Deputy is referring to Budget 2013 measures that impact on assets and investment income rather than earned income.  Details of such measures are set out below.</p><p><b>Local Property Tax</b></p><p>  The local property tax on residential properties will come into effect as of 1 July 2013.  There will be a system of market value taxable bands for properties valued up to &#8364;1m. The tax rate will be 0.18% up to &#8364;1m. The tax liability is calculated by applying the tax rate to the mid-point of the band.   For residential properties valued over &#8364;1m banding will not be applicable. The rate will be 0.18% of actual market value for the first &#8364;1m with a rate of 0.25% applying to any excess value over &#8364;1m. A half-year of LPT will be payable in 2013 with a full year payable in subsequent years. The revenue expected to be raised in 2013 is &#8364;250m. The revenue expected to be raised in 2014 is &#8364;500m. However the Household charge will be abolished in 2013 and the Non Principal Private Residence charge (NPPR) will be abolished in 2014. Arrears of both will continue to be collected.</p><p><b>Deposit Interest Retention Tax and Exit Taxes on Life Assurance Policies and Investment Funds</b></p><p>  The rate of retention tax that applies to deposit interest, together with the rates of exit tax that apply to life assurance policies and investment funds, are being increased by 3 percentage points and will now be 33% for payments made annually or more frequently and 36% for payments made less frequently than annually. The increased rates will apply to payments, including deemed payments, made on or after 1 January 2013. The revenue expected to be raised from the increase to DIRT is &#8364;47m for 2013 and is &#8364;60m for 2014. The revenue expected to be raised from the increase on exit taxes is &#8364;3m for 2013 and &#8364;4m for 2014.</p><p><b>Capital Gains Tax</b></p><p>  The current rate of 30% is being increased to 33%. This increase applies in respect of disposals made after 5 December 2012. The yield is estimated at &#8364;47m in 2013 and &#8364;48m in 2014.</p><p><b>Capital Acquisitions Tax</b></p><p>The current rate of 30% is being increased to 33%.  This increase applies in respect of gifts or inheritances taken after 5 December 2012. The measure is expected to yield &#8364;18m in 2013 and &#8364;27m in 2014. The current group tax free thresholds are being reduced by 10%. This reduction applies in respect of gifts or inheritances taken after 5 December 2012. This is expected to yield &#8364;10m in 2013 and &#8364;15m in 2014.</p></reply>

The Universal Social Charge is an individualised charge and as such, the estimate of yield is based on individual incomes of more than &euro;100,000. The estimated yield is based on confining the extension of the 3% rate to the portion of income which is in excess of &euro;100,000, that is, the increase is not applied to the portion of total income earned up to &euro;100,000.</p><p>  The figure is an estimate from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2010 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends in the interim.

This means that PRSI will be payable on all income generated from wealth such as rental income, investment income, dividends and interest on deposit and savings.</p><p>  Prior to Budget 2013, modified contributors paid PRSI on earnings derived from their employment but did not pay PRSI on any other stream of income e.g. from a trade or profession, or on unearned income (dividends etc.).  As a result of Budget 2013, modified contributors who <i>have income from a trade or profession</i> will now be subject to PRSI (at a rate of 4%) on the profits from the trade or profession and also on any unearned income that they may have.  Modified contributors are generally permanent and pensionable civil and public servants recruited before 6 April 1995 for example registered doctors and dentists employed in the civil service recruited prior to 6 April 1995.  Trade or profession relates to any trade or profession within the meaning of section 18 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, modified rate contributors are entitled to a state funded occupational pension based on their civil/public sector employment.  Such contributors have been exempt from PRSI on other streams of earned income and unearned income on the basis that payment of PRSI on such income could give rise to additional entitlement to social insurance pensions. With the abolition of this exemption, PRSI will be charged on the earned and unearned income of modified rate contributors but will not give rise to entitlement to social insurance benefits based on the payment of this PRSI contribution.</p></reply>

NAMA advises me that it permits appropriate overheads where necessary for the preservation and enhancement of the value of property securing its loans.  Overhead costs typically fall into two categories:</p><p>  (1) Cost associated with the repair and maintenance of properties, insurance premia, local authority rates and professional fees. These are essential costs which would be incurred regardless of whether the assets are managed by debtors or receivers. </p><p>  (2) Overhead costs also include allowances for the remuneration of debtors and the staff employed by the debtor to manage the assets.

The pillar banks regularly supply information to my Department and the Central Bank and much of this information is described by the banks as commercially sensitive.    In some cases, the banks may be willing to put the information requested into the public domain notwithstanding that it may be commercially sensitive. To my knowledge, neither pillar bank has published information on new lending to new customers.</p><p>  As the Deputy pointed out, the CEO of AIB told the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform that &#8364;600 million of its lending was specifically new lending. This includes both brand new facilities and top ups/increases to existing facilities but only the additional element of top ups is included in the &#8364;600 million.</p><p>  The CEO of Bank of Ireland told the same Committee that at least 97% of the &#8364;3.5 billion will be new or increased lending to existing or new customers. He also said that Bank of Ireland do not count restructured lending in their targets. Officials in my Department are continuing to engage with both banks and with the Central Bank and Credit Review Office on these numbers. </p><p>The lending targets imposed on the two pillar banks are only a part of the Government&#8217;s strategy to ensure that viable SMEs are able to access the credit they need. In my recent budget statement, I announced a ten point tax reform plan to help small businesses. I also announced the sanctioning of the appointment of additional reviewers in the Credit Review Office to ensure that SMEs appealing the banks&#8217; decisions to decline credit receive a considered and timely response to their application. We are currently engaged in a public consultation process in order to see what more the Credit Review Office can do to ensure SMEs are getting the support on bank lending they require and I would welcome any proposals from the Deputy on this topic which can be submitted to  <i><font color="#0000FF">croassessment@finance.gov.ie</font></i>   .

The estimation approach in the Thornhill report was used to illustrate indicative yields only, using unpublished Central Statistics Office (CSO) data based on mortgage transactions and the CSO&rsquo;s property price index. In making the Budget forecast this was updated to include regional variation in house prices and stock using data for county level housing stock, and regional variation in values from the CSO property price index. This results in a higher yield because of the higher weighting of higher value properties in counties with larger volumes of properties.</p><p>  In Autumn 2012, a national register of property values was published for the first time based on Stamp Duty data from the Revenue Commissioners on actual transactions in the years 2010-2012. The register is updated on an on-going basis. The distribution from the register results in a higher incidence of higher value properties. Using the same indicative rates an analysis based entirely on the register would result in a much higher yield compared with the method above.  However, caution has been applied to this approach given the low number of transactions, the high percentage of non-mortgage (i.e. cash transactions) and the possible bias in recent transactions towards transactions of higher quality housing stock which may not represent the generality of housing valuations in the State.</p><p>  A final method of estimation is based on the ESRI tax-benefit model SWITCH. In the SWITCH model, data on house prices come from the self-assessed value provided by the respondents to the Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) in 2010 with these values indexed to adjust to 2012 prices.  The SILC data are based on a sample of all private households, giving it the potential to provide a broader picture than one based on transactions or mortgages.  The SWITCH model produces an estimate lower than the first method.  </p><p>  The overall projections for revenue are a blended average of the approaches described above.</p><p>  As indicated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 55934/12, answered on 11 December 2012, the Property Price Register shows a higher percentage of houses valued over &euro;1m (c. 1% of the housing stock) than does the Thornhill Report.  However, the overall yield estimate does not solely rely on this data source for the reasons given above, in particular because properties which changed hands in the last two years are not necessarily representative of the overall stock of residential properties in the State.</p></reply>

The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism. Home Tuition is provided as an interim provision only and should not be regarded as an optional alternative to a place in school.</p><p>  As home tuition takes place outside the school environment it is a general condition of the scheme that the tuition provider where possible should be a qualified teacher who is registered with the Teaching Council. Where this is not possible, as in the case in question, approval may be given for a tutor with alternative qualifications to undertake the tuition. In such circumstances approval for nominated non qualified tutors is made on a temporary basis.  In case referred to by the Deputy the child is awaiting placement and the tuition has been approved until the end of the school year. However the tuition provider is not a qualified teacher and therefore her approval is temporary pending a qualified teacher being sourced. In the event that it remains problematic to source a qualified teacher my Department in consultation with the family in question will consider an extension of the current tutor arrangements.</p></reply>

The Government has decided to raise the pupil teacher ratio for PLC courses to the same level as that which applies in all free second-level schools &ndash; 19:1, from next September.</p><p>  This decision is being made at a time when the Government has succeeded in protecting the class sizes in primary and free second-level schools for the coming year, ensuring that our limited resources are rightly focussed on the children in our education system. </p><p>  While it would be preferable not to have to make any changes, it is hard to justify providing more generous pupil-teacher ratios to PLCs which educates adults, than second-level schools which cater for  teenagers.</p><p>  This change will reduce the number of teaching posts by 200 in PLC courses and may lead to some reduction in subject choices for students. The further education sector has expanded rapidly over the past few decades, developing many innovative programmes for its students. It is now up to the CEOs of each VEC to look at the resources available to them and to work with their Principals and staff to ensure they can continue to deliver programmes which closely meet the needs of both students and employers.</p><p>  PLC providers have been enrolling significantly above their allocation of places in recent years, and I do not expect that this measure will impact on the number of PLC places available.</p><p>  This necessary change will result in an estimated saving of &euro;12mn in a full year. As the change will be introduced at the start of the academic year in September 2013 the savings from Sept to Dec 2013 will be &euro;4mn. It is not possible to amend this measure without introducing additional Budget measures in education which would impact on other frontline services.</p><p>  There will be no change to the number of PLC places sanctioned by my Department. City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee (CDVEC) currently have an allocation of 457 teaching posts. Their revised allocation will be 409 teaching posts.</p><p>  These changes will not take effect until September 2013. In the meantime CDVEC will have an opportunity to plan for the reduced allocation across the schools/colleges under their remit.</p></reply>

This budget measure relates to the number of teachers allocated to small primary schools. I want to make clear that the budget measure does not require any of these schools to close.  In these current difficult budgetary times all public servants are being asked to do more with less and teachers in small schools cannot be exempt from this requirement.</p></reply>

The Government has decided to raise the pupil teacher ratio for PLC courses to the same level as that which applies in all free second-level schools &ndash; 19:1, from next September.This decision is being made at a time when the Government has succeeded in protecting the class sizes in primary and free second-level schools for the coming year, ensuring that our limited resources are rightly focussed on the children in our education system. While it would be preferable not to have to make any changes, it is hard to justify providing more generous pupil-teacher ratios to PLCs which educates adults, than second-level schools which cater for teenagers. This change will reduce the number of teaching posts by 200 in PLC courses and may lead to some reduction in subject choices for students. The further education sector has expanded rapidly over the past few decades, developing many innovative programmes for its students. It is now up to the CEOs of each VEC to look at the resources available to them and to work with their Principals and staff to ensure they can continue to deliver programmes which closely meet the needs of both students and employers.PLC providers have been enrolling significantly above their allocation of places in recent years, and I do not expect that this measure will impact on the number of PLC places available. This necessary change will result in an estimated saving of &euro;12mn in a full year. As the change will be introduced at the start of the academic year in September 2013 the savings from Sept to Dec 2013 will be &euro;4mn. It is not possible to amend this measure without introducing additional Budget measures in education which would impact on other frontline services.</p></reply>

This project focused on optimising output, improving customer service and the elimination of backlogs.  Part of the project was a detailed examination of workloads and a full assessment of existing capacity within the area and what capacity is needed in order to process the volumes of claims, both new and renewal, being received on a weekly basis.</p><p>  The outcome of this review is a detailed plan outlining the process required to manage both the   continuous weekly intake and backlog claims clearance.  This plan sees the current weekly new claim and renewal intake processed by one team, while the backlog is ring-fenced and a focused team assigned to this work with a clear plan for its elimination.</p><p>  This team including additional temporary resources has been identified and is already assigned and working on the backlog claims.  In order to reduce the time it will take to eliminate the backlog, some claims are being processed outside of Longford Social Welfare Services Office.  This team is fully focussed on the elimination of the backlog of claims in the shortest possible timeframe, concentrating in the first instance on those claims which were previously in payment but where payment has expired and continuing on to first-time new claims.  Within those categories, those waiting the longest will be processed first.</p><p>  It is expected that the backlog will be fully eliminated by the end of March 2013.  Claims which are approved by the backlog team will be backdated to the date of claim or the date of expiry of the previous claim, as appropriate, and all arrears due will be paid.</p></reply>

The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area. The Group has presented its report on this issue to me and I intend to publish this in the New Year. </p><p>  Achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports raises complex issues about the effectiveness and efficiency of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children.  The issues involved in this area are quite complex and further consideration, informed by the Advisory Group&rsquo;s Report will be required in deciding  how reform in this area might be progressed.  Issues of taxation are primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.  While I have had discussions with the Revenue Commissioners about the operational implications of certain issues related to the interaction of the tax and social welfare system, the taxing of certain benefits paid to high earners would  primarily be a policy matter for consideration with my cabinet colleagues.</p></reply>

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice.  The first two elements involve the enhancement of the website  and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board (CIB), both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears.</p><p>  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders.  This advice will be provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.</p><p>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &#8364;250 to an accountant of the borrower&#8217;s choosing for the provision of this advice.  The independent financial advice will be available to all mortgage holders in respect of a mortgage secured on a primary residence who have been offered longterm forbearance options by their lenders. </p><p>An operating protocol for the provision of this advice has been agreed between the main accountancy bodies and the Irish Banking Federation.  To date, some 2,700 accountants have confirmed to their accounting body that they wish to be part of the panel and their details are listed on a county by county basis on the website .</p><p>  The Central Bank of Ireland is engaging with lenders on the reporting requirements in relation to this new service and statistical details on the number of borrowers who have availed of the financial advice service should be available in early 2013.</p></reply>

In order to protect core weekly payments which people receive such as pensions, disability and carer&rsquo;s allowance we had to look very carefully at other additional payments such as the respite care grant.</p><p>  The respite care grant is paid to approximately 70,000 people each year, with some 5,000 people in receipt of more than one grant as they care for more than one person.  52,000 people are in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance and 26,000 in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance (DCA).  There are also 1,300 in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.  They receive the respite care grant automatically in June.  Persons who are in receipt of both DCA and carer&rsquo;s allowance receive one respite payment.  5,000 carers not in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s payment receive the grant.</p><p>  It is important to note that the revised rate of the respite care grant of &euro;1,375 will still be more than what it was in 2006 when the rate was &euro;1,200.  The estimated expenditure on carers in 2012 is over &euro;771 million: &euro;509 million on carer&rsquo;s allowance, &euro;24 million on carer&rsquo;s benefit, &euro;135 million on the respite care grant and &euro;103 million on domiciliary care allowance (DCA).  This represents an increase of almost &euro;20 million on expenditure in 2011.  Carer&rsquo;s also receive a free travel pass at an annual cost of &euro;6 million and carers who reside with the care recipient are eligible for the household benefits package at an annual cost of approximately &euro;30 million.</p><p>  Carers receive significant income supports from my Department, among the highest rates of income support in Europe.  A person getting certain qualifying payments and also providing full-time care and attention to another person can keep their main social welfare payment and get a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance as well.  The half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance was protected in Budget 2013.</p><p>  The respite care grant is available to all full-time carers regardless of their means while the income disregard and means test for carers allowance is the most generous in the social welfare system.  A couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of  up to &euro;35,400 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance while a couple earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate.  Carers are entitled to an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person and a respite care grant for each care recipient. </p><p>  I am aware the reduction in the respite care grant has implications for carers and their families; however, given the enormous pressures on the expenditure of my Department, I am not in a position to reverse this decision.</p></reply>

Out of the 2,544 applications received in my Department under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, 1,784 applicants have opted for financial compensation and 760 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation.</p><p>To date, a total of 2,105 payments and 180 turf deliveries have been made to applicants at a total cost of &euro;3,409,000.  A cost of &euro;51,000 was incurred in 2011 with the remaining cost of &euro;3,358,000 being incurred in 2012.</p><p>The scheme is comprised of a payment of &euro;1,500 per year, index linked, for 15 years or, where feasible, relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs where they can continue to cut turf.</p><p>Payments and turf deliveries have been made on the basis that applicants have indicated in their application forms that they fulfil all the qualifying criteria of the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme. My Department has been checking, and will be continuing to check, that all of the qualifying criteria of the scheme have been met in each case.</p><p>I am advised that at this stage one applicant has been informed that he does not fulfil the qualifying criteria. He has requested a Departmental review of the decision. Arrangements are also being considered by the Peatlands Council to put in place an appeals system where applicants wish to appeal the outcome of a review by the Department. While it may be anticipated that there will be further instances where applicants do not qualify, priority has been given to processing payments to those who clearly appear to meet the qualifying criteria on the basis of the information provided in their application forms.</p><p>3 applicants have been rejected because the areas on which they have been cutting turf are not within a raised bog special area of conservation.</p><p>An additional once-off payment of &euro;500 for qualifying turf cutters will be provided where legal agreements are signed with me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.   </p><p>Under the legislation the person liable for payment of rates is the person in occupation of a rateable property on the date of the making of the rate by the relevant local authority. The owner, rather than the occupier, may be liable for commercial rates if the property in question is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate. Should a person&rsquo;s occupancy commence after the date of the making of the rate, then that person is not primarily liable for rates for that year. However, as a subsequent occupier, that person can be held liable for up to two years arrears of rates if they cannot be recovered from the person with whom the primary liability lies.   </p><p>  Commercial rates income makes a significant contribution to the current funding requirements of local authorities. Rates provide the means by which local authorities can support the services essential to communities, and therefore business, across the full range of local activities including roads, water and waste services, fire and emergency, libraries and a range of community, amenity and social activities. </p><p>  I recognise that these are difficult economic times for many businesses and I am continuing to keep all matters relating to commercial rates under regular review.</p></reply>

At Garda Divisional level, it is for the Chief Superintendent to make appropriate arrangements for the distribution of vehicles throughout the Division in response to policing demands.  The Deputy will appreciate that a degree of flexibility in allocating and re-allocating vehicles among stations, so as to best match the allocation of resources with policing priorities, is crucial to the efficient management of the Garda fleet.</p><p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that the detailed allocation of vehicles is determined through a process of ongoing analysis of operational requirements.  In addition, they have informed me that the current policing arrangements for the area served by the relevant station, and indeed for the Cavan/Monaghan Division, are making the best use of available resources.  Moreover the Garda authorities have indicated that the needs of the area will continue to be examined as additional resources become available.</p><p>  In that context, the Deputy will be aware that 170 new Garda vehicles have recently been ordered on foot of an investment of &euro;3 million.  These vehicles are due to begin coming on stream in the coming weeks.  In addition, a further &euro;5 million is being made available for the purchase and fit-out of new Garda vehicles in 2013.  This level of expenditure, at a time of severe budgetary constraint, represents a very significant investment in Garda transport and I have no doubt that the additional funding will considerably strengthen the overall effectiveness of the Force in delivering a policing service to communities throughout the country.</p></reply>

Section 4(3) of the 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which includes the provision of statistics.</p><p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the total value of fines imposed by the District Court in 2011 was &#8364;38,031,000.00.  However, it should be noted that in the same period, a total of &#8364;12,833,000.00 worth of fines imposed were reversed as a result of a further application to court.  Fines imposed by courts are criminal sanctions generally payable to the Exchequer or, failing this, to the appropriate agency or authority nominated within the specific legislation that was breached and gave rise to a fine.  Fines are not paid to charities and no fines monies were paid to the Garda Benevolent Fund in 2011.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, funds are also paid from time to time to charities from the court&#8217;s poor box.  The court poor box is a non-statutory system used mostly by the District Courts to impose a financial charge on a defendant to be used for a charitable purpose, usually instead of imposing a criminal conviction.  Payments made to the court poor box are accounted for by the court office concerned and the accounting procedures are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Generally, charities are the recipients of poor box contributions but the decision is solely at the discretion of the Judge who is independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  I am informed by the Courts Service that in 2011, &#8364;1,733,641.85 was paid into court as a result of poor box orders and of this amount, &#8364;28,138.00 was paid to the Garda Benevolent Fund.</p><p>  In 2005, the Law Reform Commission examined the matter in its report entitled <i>The Court Poor Box: Probation of Offenders</i>   (LRC 75-2005).  The Commission recognised both the negative and positive aspects of the court use of the poor box and accordingly recommended that the court poor box be replaced by a statutory reparation fund.  A key element of the LRC recommendation was that the reparation fund should be ringfenced and used to assist programmes aimed at preventing offending behaviour and for the purpose of assisting victims of crime.  The Commission was of the view that the reparation fund should remain linked to the criminal justice process and thus broadly adhere to the principles of restorative justice.  I intend to bring forward legislation in the near future to replace the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 with modern provisions dealing with community sanctions and the role of the Probation Service in the criminal justice system.  In the context of that legislation, the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in relation to the court poor box are being examined by my Department with a view to bringing forward proposals for a transparent statutory retribution scheme.</p></reply>

The collection of court imposed fines for the Courts Service (it is intended this contract will coincide with the full implementation of the Fines Act 2010 which includes the payment of fines by instalment.)</i></p><p><i>I also recently approved an initiative to put in place a panel with legal expertise who will assist the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in processing a cohort of repatriation cases thus speeding up the overall process and reducing the time spent by persons in the Direct Provision system.  I would expect to see significant dividends from this initiative in the coming months.</i></p><p><i>All new services will be tested for suitability for external service delivery as they arise and in line with Government policy.</i></p></reply>

The stations selected for closure are those which are in areas that, in the professional opinion of the Garda Commissioner, could be better served by having Garda&iacute; patrolling the areas rather than being confined to a specific premises.  In coming to this view, the Commissioner would have taken all relevant factors into consideration, including the distance to other stations.</p><p>  Details of the closures are set out in the Policing Plan have for 2013 which is lodged in the Oireachtas library.  The Plan also provides details of the alternative policing arrangements for the areas in question.  In this regard, the Deputy will also be aware that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs, including in remote areas.  In this regard the Garda&iacute; continue to work closely with all communities to enhance community safety through a wide range of local fora such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch, as well as more formal structures such as Joint Policing Committees.</p><p>  The implementation of the reduction in the number of Garda stations and Districts will take place in full consultation with the local communities and staffing interests.  Local Garda management will shortly commence the process of engaging with these communities through the Joint Policing Committees and other fora to advise them of the revised policing arrangements for the localities in question.  The objective will be to ensure that the best possible policing service will be provided at all times.</p><p>  I am conscious of the need to maintain, to the greatest extent possible, the operational effectiveness of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is for that reason that a further &euro;5 million is being made available for the purchase and fit-out of new Garda vehicles in 2013.  This level of expenditure, at a time of severe budgetary constraint, represents a very significant investment in Garda transport and I have no doubt that the additional funding will considerably strengthen the overall effectiveness of the Force in delivering a policing service to communities throughout the country.  I am also confident that, when the relevant budgetary figures are being determined for 2014, the importance of investment in Garda transport will continue to be recognised.</p></reply>

It is very regrettable that this highly beneficial resource is abused in that way, causing great distress to many people. </p><p>  There are two approaches to tackling cyberbullying, that is to say, bullying over the internet, by mobile phone or by other technological devices. In the first instance, we must educate and alert people to the problem, how to detect it and how to overcome it. Everyone has a role to play, whether they are parents, teachers, classmates, work or team colleagues or mere 'bystanders'. </p><p>  I draw attention to the services available from the organisations participating in the Safer Internet Ireland Project, coordinated by my Department's Office for Internet Safety. The www.webwise.ie site provides valuable information and advice as well as links to other relevant sites.  </p><p>  The Deputy refers in particular to social networking sites. They have become very popular especially among younger people. Users need to be aware that those sites have their own rules. They usually have various options such as privacy settings and complaints procedures which may be availed of to prevent any unwanted access. Most of the major social networking sites have signed up to the EU's Safer Social Networking Principles. The Principles promote good practice with an emphasis on enhancing the safety of younger users. </p><p>  The second approach entails pursuing perpetrators under the criminal law. The current law has a number of relevant provisions.  Two sections of the Non-fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 are especially relevant. Section 5 deals with the offence of threatening to kill or cause serious harm. It has a maximum penalty of imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years. Section 10 provides for the offence of harassment. The section includes harassment 'by any means including by use of the telephone'. This offence attracts a maximum penalty of imprisonment of up to 7 years. </p><p>  At my request, the Law Reform Commission is examining an aspect of the requirements in section 10, namely the need to demonstrate persistence in the harassment. I await its conclusions.</p><p>  The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 may be relied upon in cases where the cyberbullying entails incitement to hatred on account of race, religion, nationality or sexual orientation.</p><p>  The Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 is relevant to the investigation and prosecution of the offences under the 1997 Act. It permits the retention of and access to data for those purposes where the offence is a serious one. In that regard, the Act identifies some specific offences but adds that the term also applies to any offence having a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment or more. The offences in sections 5 and 10 of the 1997 Act meet that criterion. </p><p>  While I can understand their reluctance to do so in many instances, victims, their families and friends must realise that their active participation is required if attempts to defeat the cyberbullies are to succeed. They can follow the simple but effective advice on how to deal with unwanted messages and they must assist the Garda&iacute; by reporting cases to them. The criminal law can be employed only when victims come forward and assist the Garda&iacute; in building a case against their tormentors.</p><p>  I have no immediate plans for new, more targeted, legislation but I will be keeping the matter under review. </p></reply>

To-date nine of these barracks - Clancy (Dublin), Castleblaney, Ballincollig, Fermoy, Naas, Monaghan, Cavan, Castlebar and a large portion of Longford - have been sold. </p><p>  In relation to the remaining barracks agreement has been reached for the sale of Lifford and Rockhill to Donegal County Council. Discussions are ongoing in relation to the possible sale of a portion of Clonmel Barracks to other State Agencies and the remaining part of Longford has been reserved for the OPW for the local Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>  Magee Barracks in Kildare and Columb Barracks in Mullingar remain the property of the Department. </p><p>  The total realised to-date in terms of sales of surplus property is &euro;84m approx. This, together with income of &euro;18m approx. from the sale of other smaller military properties and married quarters has been re-invested in providing equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces. </p><p>  All remaining vacated barracks as well as any properties identified as surplus to military requirements will be disposed of by my Department, taking account of the market conditions, so as to maximise the return to the Defence Forces. </p><p>  The monies received from the sales of surplus properties have returned to the Defence Vote as Appropriations in Aid. The increased levels of appropriations in aid have allowed the retention of funding levels for re-equipment. Some of the major more recent programmes include the acquisition of Light Tactical Armoured Vehicles, Mowag Armoured Personnel Carriers, two EC and six AW 139 helicopters and two new Offshore Patrol vessels, scheduled for delivery in 2014/2015. This approach is in line with the 2000 White Paper on Defence and the Government decision of February 2000 which, inter alia, approved &ldquo; the allocation of 100% of the revenue arising from the sale of property surplus to military requirements, for investment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces&rdquo;</p></reply>

However, it is imperative that the Department and the Defence Forces, similar to all other Government Departments, must take into account the current difficult economic environment we are now operating in. The budgetary situation will continue to dictate the level of funding available for new equipment and upgrades. Decisions will be made accordingly on a strictly prioritised basis with a view to maintaining the capability of all roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces. </p><p>  I am advised that military training techniques are up to date in all respects. Defence Forces training plans are specifically structured to provide the capabilities needed to execute the roles assigned to them by Government. The challenges of preparing military units for participation in international peace support operations constitute the major dimension of Defence Forces collective training. The primary focus of this training is the attainment of a capability for military interoperability in order to conduct peace support operations to international standards. Training standards in the Defence Forces are constantly benchmarked against best international practice and Defence Forces personnel have full access to the best international training standards available. </p><p>  A particular focus is maintained in ensuring that modern and effective equipment is available for overseas peace support operations. In this regard, the personal equipment, which the individual soldier has at his/her disposal in Lebanon and on other overseas missions is second to none and compares very favourably with the equipment in use by other countries.  <i></i></p></reply>

This requires the consolidation of existing Reserve Units throughout the country into a smaller number of full-strength Units. </p><p>  A new &ldquo;Single Force&rdquo; concept will see Permanent Defence Force (PDF) Units having Reserve components, rather than a parallel Reserve as at present. Reserve Units within barracks will be supported by their parent PDF Unit and the 16 Units outside of PDF installations will be supported by dedicated full time PDF personnel. This concept offers significant potential advantages in terms of training and development of the Reserve. The initiative of locating Reserve Officers within the Defence Forces management structure will likewise underpin the future Reserve.    </p><p>  These steps create a viable structure while addressing the inefficiency caused by having too many widely dispersed and under-strength Reserve Units. </p><p>  The changes to the current Reserve organisation are in response to a compelling case for reform and will dovetail with the significant changes that are occurring in the PDF organisational structures. </p><p>  I am satisfied that the changes when implemented will ensure a better Reserve and enhance overarching Defence capabilities. </p></reply>

The Agency was set up in 1994 to ensure an indigenous year round supply of milk for liquid consumption.  All farmers supplying milk for liquid consumption in the winter months do so under contracts with processors which must be registered with the Agency.  Farmers supplying milk in the winter months are paid a premium over the price paid to farmers who only produce milk in the spring-autumn period. This premium reflects the additional costs of producing milk in the winter months. </p><p>  There is a general prohibition of price fixing under EU and Irish competition law.  While prices paid for products in the marketplace are a function of a number of market forces and the negotiation of commercial contracts is essentially a matter for the contracting parties, the Programme for Government contains a specific commitment to enact fair trade legislation in the retail sector so as to ensure balance between various players in the grocery goods sector.

The measures introduced build on those introduced in Budget 2012 and will enable the sector to continue its success in realising the objectives of Food Harvest 2020. </p><p>  100% Stamp Duty Relief and 100% stock relief for Young Trained Farmers are both being extended, as is the ordinary 25% stock relief for other farmers.  </p><p>  I am also happy that new Capital Gains Tax provisions have been introduced to facilitate restructuring of farm land parcels. When taken together with the large reduction in Stamp Duty last year this measure should encourage farmers to restructure their holdings to improve efficiency.</p><p>  These taxation measures will directly benefit farmers in the West of Ireland and elsewhere.</p><p>  The tax changes in Budget 2013 incentivise inter-generational land transfer and facilitate farm re-structuring to improve efficiency. This is a clear message of support to the many dynamic younger farmers who plan to expand production over the coming years that I want to help them achieve their ambitions.  These changes will also help the sector realise the Food Harvest 2020 targets and increase agrifood exports.</p><p>  Budget 2013 was a difficult one for the Government, involving many tough decisions.  Although constrained by tight budgetary disciplines imposed right across the economy, I was determined to minimise the impact of the scale of the reduction so that the most important schemes and programmes which the sector relies upon most were protected to the greatest extent possible. </p><p>  I am pleased to say that, through re-orientating and re-scheduling payments, I have managed to fund new schemes and programmes while also reducing the scale of savings to a lower amount of &#8364;89 million compared to 2012, while protecting farm incomes. The 2013 budget reflects a significant Exchequer commitment of support for the agrifood sector and is recognition of the contribution which the sector can make to economic recovery and future growth.  Of particular interest to farmers in the West of Ireland is the increased allocation of &#8364;195 million in support of disadvantaged area payments.  This was done to underline my commitment to the protection of income for smaller farmers and<b><i></i></b>protect  farmers in disadvantages areas.  I have decided to focus on the protection of the smaller and most disadvantaged, including mountain sheep holdings whose payments will remain unchanged next year. In order to make the necessary adjustment, I intend to reduce the maximum area payable from 34 to 30 hectares.  This will not be applied to farmers in mountain areas.<b><i></i></b> These measures will mean that 72% of farmers will have no change in their income resulting from this change. </p></reply>

I have, however, made funding of &euro;10 million available for this Scheme in 2013. These funds will be used to continue to pay calves born the herds of Scheme participants when they become eligible for payment. Payments in respect of 2012 born calves, which are now eligible for payment, will commence next week. Taking into account payments of &euro;22 million, which will be issued in respect of 2012 born calves, the Exchequer will have paid &euro;158 million in total under this Scheme. This is a very substantial contribution to the very important beef sector.</p><p>  I am, therefore, pleased that a Value for Money Audit, which was undertaken in accordance with the Department of Finance Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative, established that the Scheme has largely achieved these objectives. The 34,000 participants, who continued in the Scheme over its five-year duration, are fully aware that following best practice in the breeding, animal health/welfare aspects and rearing of suckler calves leads to better prices and demand at weanling sale time.</p><p>  It was important to build on progress made under the lifetime of the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme.  Therefore, I have allocated &euro;10 million in 2013, financed from unspent Single Farm Payment Funds for a new support programme for suckler farmers to participate in a new Beef Data Programme. When taken together with residual payments of &euro;10 million under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme, this will amount to &euro;20 million in direct payments to suckler farmers in 2013. This programme will assist farmers in improving the genetic quality of Irish cattle and will maintain the data flow into ICBF in order to build further knowledge and more rapid progress in breeding and ultimately in profitability for farmers. In addition, the sum of &euro;5 million has been set aside to support the continuation for another year of the Beef Technology Adaptation Programme, a scheme that provides beef farmers with better information and improved skills to increase profitability on farms.</p></reply>

The SCP aims to retain young people in the formal education system to completion of senior cycle and to generally improve the school attendance, participation and retention of its target cohort.  The SCP is a key programme under the Department of Education and Skills' DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) action plan.</p><p>  I wish to inform the Deputy that &euro;26.456m is being allocated to the programme in 2013.  The allocation is in line with the proposals in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure for savings of 6.5% per annum in the SCP for the years 2012-2014.  In September 2012, the Local Management Committee responsible for each individual project was notified that a reduction on last year&rsquo;s allocation would apply for the coming academic cycle.  The full year budget for the SCP was confirmed earlier than in previous years to assist local committees to effectively refine programmes and deliver targeted interventions within budget.</p><p>  Each Committee was requested to review its Retention Plan to support young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage in their school, home and community life, to remain in education and to finalise a programme of supports to effectively target available resources to meet local needs.  Projects were advised to scrutinise all elements of expenditure and to seek to reduce costs and achieve efficiencies while prioritising evidence based services to support children&rsquo;s educational outcomes.</p><p>  The NEWB, which is responsible for the operational management and direction of the SCP, has made assistance available to each local project to review its planned programme.  The NEWB continues to work closely with management committees, schools and local SCP co-ordinators to ensure student supports are tailored to meet local needs.  The adjustment identified in CRE for 2013 and 2014 will be further considered in the context of a review of the programme to be undertaken in 2013.  This review will address the potential to achieve greater consistency in programme delivery, administration and other costs amongst the 124 local projects and related initiatives.  A core objective of the review will be to ensure that available funds are appropriately targeted to support those most at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving.</p></reply>

Child care services participating in the ECCE programme are paid a standard capitation fee of &euro;62.50 per week for each eligible child enrolled for the free pre-school year.  Under the terms of the ECCE programme, the pre-school leaders delivering the programme must hold a certification for a major award in childcare/early education at a minimum of level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) or an equivalent nationally-recognised qualification or a higher award in the childcare/early education field.  In keeping with the Government's commitment to increasing standards in the pre-school sector, a higher capitation payment of &euro;73 per week is available to childcare services in which all childcare workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the programme.  To qualify for the higher capitation rate, the pre-school leader must hold a qualification in a relevant discipline at a minimum of a full Level 7 award on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) and meet other conditions as set out by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>  Determination of the relevance of a discipline is established by the examination of the content of the programme of learning which led to the qualification.  This must contain the following elements - Child development birth to six years, Early Childhood Learning Theory and Practice, Child Health and Welfare 0-6 years.  The programme must also have contained a significant supervised practicum in relevant early childhood care and education settings.  A degree in Psychology does not satisfy the criteria and the only relevant discipline which fully complies with required content is Early Childhood Care and Education.  My Department has accepted the recommendations of the advisory group and the outcome has been transmitted to the City and County Childcare Committees and the National Voluntary Childcare Organisations and also brought to the attention of the Further and Higher Education sectors.  This information has clarified the position for childcare providers considering applying for the higher capitation payment.</p></reply>

Figures supplied by the HSE indicate that the number of whole-time- equivalent (WTE) social workers employed in the Children and Families Service area of the HSE was 1,300 at the end of July 2012.  The number of social workers recorded under the census as employed in the Children and Families Service area in 2010 and 2011 was 1183 and 1220 respectively.</p><p>  It is important to emphasise that work is ongoing within the HSE on the disaggregation of the Children and Families resource base from the HSE as part of the process of establishing the new Child and Family Support Agency next year.  Consequently the number of social workers assigned to the Children and Families Service area will continue to be subject to change as the mapping/classification of posts into care groups is further refined between now and the establishment of the new agency.  In the circumstances it is difficult to draw comparisons between current and past census returns which were not disaggregated to this degree for this service area.</p><p>  The HSE has made considerable progress over recent years in recruiting additional social workers, with over 260 social workers recruited under the Ryan Implementation Plan at end 2011.  The National Director of Children and Family Services, Gordon Jeyes, will continue to apply his discretion to the filling of social work vacancies, taking account of identified need and subject to services being delivered within available resources.</p></reply>

Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure my Department is seeking to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any  necessary reductions in funding. Youth organisations and projects will be advised of their 2013 allocations as soon as possible. </p><p>  Going forward to 2013, my Department is developing proposals to streamline the existing five separate funding lines so that projects will receive one funding stream allowing more flexibility in setting priorities, managing savings and reconfiguring service provision.  In addition, my Department will be commencing a formal Value for Money review which is expected to report by mid 2013.  There will be no cut to funding for local voluntary youth clubs.</p></reply>

Over 260 social workers have been recruited arising from implementation of the Report's Recommendations.  </p><p>  The Government has given approval to the drafting of a Bill to establish the Child and Family Support Agency.  Work on the preparation of the legislation is proceeding as a priority and the intention is that the Agency will be established in early 2013.  This will involve the transfer of over 4,000 staff. </p><p>  I welcome the allocation of &euro;546 million in the HSE vote for 2013 in respect of children and family services.  This consists of &euro;545 million in current expenditure and &euro;1 million in capital.  This level of budgetary provision for child welfare and protection services reflects the priority attached to the Government to this important area.  The overall level of resources being provided will be increased further by the inclusion within the remit of the new agency of the budget of both the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  Some final adjustments to the budget provision may be required on completion of a due diligence and disaggregation exercise which is currently underway within the HSE and which is due to be completed prior to the establishment of the new agency.</p><p>  Once the Agency is established, the Chief Executive designate, Gordon Jeyes, will be responsible for the management of the overall combined resource.  In this context he will have the discretion to fill vacant posts across all grades, including social workers, taking account of identified need and subject to services being delivered within available resources.</p></reply>

This support is provided through the provision of three childcare support programmes - the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  </p><p>  The CCS programme provides funding to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments.  Middle and low income working parents may also qualify for support.  Parents who qualify for the top rate of subvention under the programme receive &#8364;95 per week towards full-day childcare costs.  The CETS<b></b>programme provides &#8364;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places to participating childcare services for trainees and students who are deemed qualified by F&Aacute;S or the VEC.  Students on part-time courses are funded on a pro rata basis.    </p><p>  The ECCE programme provides one free  pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  Children aged between 3 years 2 months and 4 years 6 months at 1 September in the relevant year qualify for a maximum of 15 hours per week free pre-school provision over a 38 week period.  This is a universal programme to which all children have access.</p><p>  In 2012, the total expenditure by my Department on these three programmes is expected to be in the region of  &#8364;240 million.  These programmes have been maintained despite the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure and they represent a significant investment in supporting parents with the cost of childcare.    </p><p>  As part of Budget 2013, I announced with my colleague the Minister for Social Protection a joint school age childcare initiative which will provide further additional support to both the community and private childcare sector.  This initiative, which represents an annual investment of &#8364;14 million, will provide important support to parents in low income families wishing to take up employment, along with ensuring that quality after-school care is in place to support children's development.  </p><p>  Future developments relating to early years care and education will be considered during preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy which is currently being developed by my Department and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2013.  This Strategy will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as health, family support, learning and development and care and education and will identify the structures and policies needed to improve early year's experience in Ireland.  </p></reply>

A total of &euro;308 million in pay-related savings has been targeted for the health services in 2013.  These savings will be achieved under three separate headings, firstly by intensifying the implementation of the Public Service Agreement within the health services, secondly through the negotiation of an agreement on further workplace change and savings with public sector unions, as has been proposed by Government, and thirdly through further reductions in staffing numbers in 2013.  </p><p>  Required measures under the PSA include new rosters in hospitals, changes in skill mix in nursing homes, the implementation of the recent agreement reached with Hospital Consultants, a significant reduction in overtime and agency spending and a reduction in management grades.  Pay savings are also targeted from the reconfiguration of service models in hospitals, disability, mental health and children and family services.  </p><p>  The Government has initiated discussions with the Trade Unions on a new agenda for improvements in the productivity of public servants and reductions in the cost of delivery of public services.  Detailed engagement is expected to commence early in 2013, under the leadership of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p></reply>

The Programme for Government contains a commitment to put a permanent scheme of risk equalisation in place. This is a key requirement for the existing private health insurance market and is designed to keep health insurance affordable for older persons and to maintain the stability of the market.  </p><p>  I was pleased, therefore, to recently publish the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2012 on 18 October, to give effect to a new Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) to be applied from 1 January 2013. An effective and robust RES is required in the Irish private health insurance market in order to protect affordability for those who need it most.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2012 is now currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Scheme will take effect from 1 January 2013. The legislation provides for a range of credits to be payable to insurers on behalf of insured persons.  I recently announced the rates of risk equalisation credits to apply in 2013 at the Committee Stage debate on this Bill. </p><p>  The rates are funded by a stamp duty payable by all insurers in respect of each insured person. The credit is provided at source &ndash; that is, the cost of the policy is reduced by the amount of the risk equalisation credit. The measures are designed to result in no overall increase of premiums paid in the market and to spread the risk more evenly between the healthy and the less healthy, as well as the old and the young. This action is in line with plans to move to Universal Health Insurance, under which everyone will be insured for health care. A strong system of risk equalisation must be in place in order for this to be achieved. A more efficient, cost effective market will lead to greater competition and will encourage people to take out health insurance. The introduction of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2012 fulfils the commitment made in the Programme for Government to introduce a system of risk equalisation for the private health insurance market, as we move to develop a new system of universal health insurance.</p><p>  As part of Budget 2013, I announced further detail on legislation to provide for the charging of all private patients in public hospitals. Primary legislation will be introduced during 2013 to provide for charging of private in-patients in public hospitals where they are not in a designated private bed.  On that basis, Budget 2013 has provided for additional patient income of &euro;60 million in 2013.  The implementation date will be announced during 2013 when the new legislation is in place.  In the meantime, the maintenance charges for private in-patients in public hospitals remain unchanged. An additional &euro;5 million in patient revenue during 2013 arises from increasing the daily in-patient charge by &euro;5 from &euro;75 to &euro;80. The date of implementation will also be announced later in 2013. These measures are designed to recoup some of the cost of treating private patients in public hospitals and to generate much needed income for the public hospital system. </p><p>  The Government remains committed to keeping down both the cost of health insurance, so that it is affordable for as many people as possible, and the general cost of healthcare delivery, as part of measures to ensure the sustainability of the private health insurance market in the transition to a UHI system.</p></reply>

As well as listening more closely to service users, our mental health services have developed a number of initiatives to enhance the engagement with family members in the treatment process.  Involvement of family in a patient&#8217;s treatment and care is normally with the patient&#8217;s consent.   </p><p>  The issue of confidentiality is central to the doctor patient relationship and is a vital component in building trust.  Respecting the autonomy of the service user and meeting the information needs of family members is a central consideration in mental health treatment plans.  Where there is a risk of harm to the patient or others, the Medical Council Code of Ethics allows doctors to breach confidence in the interests of preventing harm.  The Mental Health Commission has also issued guidelines encouraging the involvement of family where appropriate in respect of admission to, treatment and discharge from Approved Centres.   </p><p>  It is recognised that where patients involve their families in their care and treatment planning, a better outcome for the patient is likely and I would encourage such involvement where possible.    </p></reply>

It is imperative that consultants, given their roles within the health system, lead this process.  The measures agreed between health service management and the consultant representative bodies at the Labour Relations Commission in September will allow for very significant reforms in how health and specifically consultant services are delivered and will ultimately lead to improved outcomes for users of the services.  </p><p>  In September 2012 I announced that, henceforth, the appointment of new consultants will be made at a new entry level pay rate, significantly reduced from the current starting level.  Therefore, doctors who have been successful at interview after 1 October are being appointed at 30% reduced salary rates.  Current consultants' pay is protected under the Croke Park Agreement and is not affected by the introduction of the lower rates.</p><p>  It is essential that salary levels in the public service, and particularly those attaching to the most highly paid positions, are as far as possible brought into line with those in comparable countries.  It is not sustainable, in the light of the State's serious financial difficulties, to continue to recruit at the previous rates.  If we are to continue to provide consultant-level career opportunities for doctors and, subject to the limitations on available resources, to replace consultants who retire and where possible expand overall capacity, this can only happen on the basis of a lower-cost model.  </p></reply>

Within its allocated budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects, including road maintenance, is a matter in the first instance for the NRA in accordance with Sections 17 &amp; 19 of the Roads Act.</p><p>  In line with the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework 2012-2016 and the outcome of the comprehensive current spending review last year, the NRA's capital budget in 2013 will be &euro;278m while the road maintenance budget next year will be &euro;41.6m.  The scale of the reductions in the allocations to the NRA obviously will present challenges over the course of 2013.  I do not expect any major new projects directly funded by the Exchequer  to commence construction in the coming year, however two PPP projects may proceed to construction.  As regards the Galway Outer Bypass this project is on hold pending the outcome of legal proceedings.</p></reply>
