What is involved at this stage is a preliminary gathering and examination of information on the part of the Commission for the purposes of getting an overview of the different tax ruling procedures in various Member States. I should add that this is not a formal EU State Aid investigation nor is it an enquiry that is specific to any one Member State.</p><p>  Ireland is fully co-operating with the Commission in this exercise. The Commission has requested information on Revenue&rsquo;s administrative practice in relation to the provision of advance opinions, as well as details of the type of opinions provided to companies. Revenue has provided the information sought by the Commission as required under EU law.  Advance opinions are provided by Revenue to clarify the tax treatment of a proposed transaction or business activity under existing legislation so that companies can file a correct tax return and comply fully with their tax obligations. Revenue opinions are non-binding and seek to provide a considered and consistent interpretation of the applicable tax rules as set down in the legislation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-10-03a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013100300047#WRA00700"><p>All companies that are tax resident in Ireland are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on the profits that are generated from their trading activities in Ireland.  A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits. Chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.  Companies that are not tax resident in Ireland and which do not carry on a trade in Ireland have no liability to Irish corporation tax and have no obligation to file an Irish corporation tax return.  However, a company that is not tax resident in Ireland will be liable to Irish corporation tax tax, if they carry on a trade through a branch or agency in Ireland, in respect of the profits arising to the branch or agency.   </p><p>  Specifically in relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I think it is important to be clear that an Irish incorporated company, that is not tax resident anywhere, is taxable in Ireland in respect of any profits that accrue to that company from activities or operations that take place in Ireland under the existing rules that I have just described.  The ability of a company to be tax resident nowhere appears to be the result of mismatches between the domestic rules of different countries with regard to determining the place of tax residence of a company.  Some countries, such as Ireland, rely primarily on the use of a management and control test to determine whether or not a company is tax resident in Ireland.  Some other countries rely primarily on an incorporation test to determine place of tax residence.</p><p>  Such mismatches can be exploited by companies to allow them to be tax resident nowhere.  The most effective way to deal with such arrangements is for countries to work together to examine these structures and to consider how international rules can be amended to ensure fair levels of taxation.  Ireland remains fully committed to this approach to ensure coherence in international taxation.  In this regard, Ireland is participating in projects at EU and OECD level which aim to address international tax issues.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-10-03a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013100300047#WRA00900"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, before this government entered office, taxpayers&rsquo; money amounting to &euro;46.3bn was injected into the banks, in the form of capital support, most of which went into the former Anglo Irish Bank. Subsequent to the formation of the current government the banks were required to raise a total of &euro;24bn as a result of the Central Bank&rsquo;s 2011 Prudential Capital Assessment Review (PCAR). However, primarily as a result of successful private equity contributions, asset sales and burden sharing with bondholders, the Government only had to inject &euro;16.5bn into the relevant institutions. In addition, the State acquired Irish Life for &euro;1.3bn to complete the recapitalisation of Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent, giving a total commitment of &euro;17.8bn. In all the State&rsquo;s Total Capital Investment in the Banks amounted to &euro;64.1bn at its peak.  This figure represents the gross capital or money committed to recapitalising these institutions and does not take account of revenues received directly or indirectly from the banks in return for State support, or indeed from disposals. The State has now started the process of exiting its bank investments and to date, successful disposals by the State of its bank investments include:</p><p>  - The entire &euro;1 billion holding of Contingent Capital Notes (CCN&rsquo;s) in Bank of Ireland.  The State disposed of its holding in the bonds at a price of 101% of their par value plus accrued interest. The transaction settled on Tuesday the 15th of January and the State was paid proceeds of &euro;1,056 million comprising principal of &euro;1,000 million, interest accrued of over &euro;46 million and a profit of &euro;10 million.</p><p>  - The sale of Irish Life earlier this year for a consideration of &euro;1.3 billion which was approximately a 30% premium to the price that was achievable when the previous bid process was suspended in November 2011. The consideration received resulted in the State recouping the full investment made by the taxpayer in Irish Life. In addition a &euro;40 million dividend was paid to the State on completion.</p><p>  Of course the State still has a sizable portfolio of banking investments which it has yet to monetise. The National Pension Reserve Fund&rsquo;s (NPRF) directed portfolio in Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland was valued at &euro;8.8bn at 30 June 2013. The State also holds contingent capital investments of &euro;2bn in AIB and PTSB and an equity position in PTSB.  The NPRF to date has also received a total of &euro;2.2 billion in cash from its Bank of Ireland investments &ndash; comprising preference share dividends, the repurchase of warrants by the Bank and the sale of ordinary shares to a consortium of private investors.</p><p>  Finally, in addition to the cost of capitalisation, the State has supported the banks&rsquo; deposit and funding activities as follows:</p><p>  - The Credit Institutions Financial Support Scheme (CIFS) which operated from 30 September 2008 to 29 September 2010; and,</p><p>  - The Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme (ELG) which operated until March 2013. </p><p>  The CIFS and ELG schemes provided guarantees from the State in return for the payment of a percentage fee of the covered liabilities. A total of &euro;4,106.6 million has been received into the Exchequer to date in fees and interest accrued from the covered banks in payment for these schemes. This is made up of &euro;763.7 million in respect of the CIFS scheme and &euro;3,342.9 million in respect of the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme (ELG). These amounts are expected to be offset by claims under the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee (&ldquo;ELG&rdquo;) scheme in relation to the liquidation of IBRC which could cost the State circa &euro;1bn in 2013 based on best estimates. (These costs would have been incurred by IBRC at some point regardless of the transaction.)</p><p>  It is the Government&rsquo;s stated intention to break the link between the Sovereign and the Banks which is a desire shared by our European partners. Should an opportunity arise to sell any further investments, this will be considered having assessed the best interests of the State.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-10-03a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013100300047#WRA01100"><p>I am advised that the contractual terms and conditions of customer mortgages and other borrowings have not changed as a result of the appointment of the Special Liquidators nor will they change as a result of the ultimate sale of these obligations to a third party.  The Special Liquidators are still in the process taking professional advice on the appropriate method of disposing of loan assets and on the appropriate criteria for determining who should qualify to bid for loan assets. As part of this process the Special Liquidators have written to all IBRC borrowers to update them on the sale of their IBRC Loans and Collateral Obligations and providing them with an opportunity to make written representations on the method of disposal of their loans and the criteria for determining who may bid for loan assets. </p><p>  I am advised that the Special Liquidators of IBRC are maintaining contact with its mortgage holders and with the Central Bank (as part of its overall Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategy (MARS) process) with a view to appropriately dealing with INBS mortgage holders in arrears on their mortgage.  The Special Liquidators also confirm that the residential mortgage customers of IBRC (in Special Liquidation) continue to enjoy the protection of the Central Bank Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and other protections in Irish consumer law.</p><p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, which applies to all mortgage lending activities of all regulated entities, except Credit Unions, operating in the State, remains a key protection for those cooperating INBS/IBRC mortgage holders who are in difficulty in meeting their mortgage commitments.  The Code provides, inter alia, that mortgage lenders should allow for a flexible approach in the handling of arrears and pre-arrears cases and that they should aim, as far as possible, at assisting the borrower who is in genuine difficulty having regard to the specific circumstances in individual cases. </p><p>  The continued applicability of the Central Bank Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and Mortgage Arrears Targets Programme will depend on the regulatory status of the ultimate acquirer of the portfolio which we will not know until the sales process has concluded. In the event that NAMA ultimately acquires this portfolio, the NAMA Board will determine its strategy at that stage. In doing so, NAMA will be mindful of its legal obligations and general market norms.  The Special Liquidators are under instruction to ensure that the valuation of all IBRC assets is completed by 30 November 2013 and that the sale of all IBRC assets is agreed or completed by no later than 31 December 2013 or as soon as practicable thereafter.</p></reply>

HP will also provide hosting facilities at a backup data centre for the purposes of business continuity. Both of these data centres are located in Dublin.  The Central Bank will remain in control and manage all sensitive systems and data. This new data centre will negate the requirement for the Central bank to build two new data centre environments to replace existing facilities which are at &lsquo;end of life&rsquo;. It will also enable supplier consolidation for a range of services currently being provided by a diverse group of up to seventeen external suppliers. This is a complex technical project and is made up of a number of phases, sequenced to mitigate risk and to move the key infrastructure as seamlessly as possible. I have been informed by the Central Bank that the project is progressing well and is scheduled for completion by end year.</p><p>  The incident to which the Deputy refers occurred on 17th September when one of the servers which had recently been migrated to the HP Data Centres became unavailable for a short period.  The incident in question was the result of a process failure which has since been identified and rectified as part of the standard transition arrangements.  The incident lasted for 15 minutes. The impact was minor and did not impact any business service of the Central Bank. </p><p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that its IT systems are operating within expected norms and service levels. Incidents can arise in the normal course of events and these are all investigated for root cause and any necessary remediation taken. This includes root cause that may be attributed to hardware, software, process compliance or human error irrespective of whether internally or externally generated.</p><p>  The responsibility for operational and security policies at the Central Bank continues to be a matter for the Central Bank Commission and the Governor of the Bank. The security of the technical aspects of the systems will be achieved through a combination of physical and logical protections, procedural and process protections, security features including encryption where necessary and on-going monitoring and reporting features. The steps taken comply with the Central Bank&rsquo;s internal security policies and those of the ECB and are underpinned by the contractual and legal arrangements with the IT provider.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-10-03a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013100300048#WRB00900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 19, 34 and 53 together.</p><p>  The Central Bank has advised that its Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) publication of March 2013 clearly defines the criteria by which a sustainable solution can be reported.  Where a borrower relies on legal action to address an arrears situation it must be able to demonstrate that &ldquo;an arrangement could not be reached or is not appropriate&rdquo; and therefore it is pursuing legal action as a restructure of the mortgage is either not possible or not an adequate solution.</p><p>  It is a key responsibility of financial institutions to do more to assist those in severe financial difficulty. Letters threatening repossession or legal action could not in my opinion be considered a sustainable solution under the mortgage arrears targets, and should only ever be considered after every possible avenue for solution has been exhausted. This is consistent with the Central Bank&rsquo;s MART document.  It should be noted that the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) provides that lenders may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where they have already made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative arrangement with a cooperating borrower. </p><p>  The MART document sets out three modes of generating a sustainable solution.  The first and most preferred type of solution is an arrangement where payments are re-established on the original, or an agreed revised schedule. The second mode is where the borrower opts for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement and the third mode is where an arrangement could not be reached or is not appropriate and ultimately involves surrender or repossession of the property.</p><p>  In his appearance at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, the Governor of the Central Bank acknowledged that more than sixty per cent of the end June proposals by the relevant banks were in the third mode. The Governor also informed the Committee that the Central Bank has commenced the audit of the banks&rsquo; returns on the end of June target and the Central Bank will have initial results of the audit in November (and will publish data in December).  This will ensure that the mortgage modifications proposed by the lenders are in fact sustainable.  The MART document also outlines the Central Bank&rsquo;s position and powers in this regard. The two specific measures the Central Bank can take relate to imposing additional provisioning and capital requirements on firms.  From 2014 the present value of future mortgage cashflows will be set at zero for the purpose of calculating impairment provisions where loans that are in arrears for greater than 90 days have not been subject to a sustainable solution.</p><p>  In the targets set by the Central Bank, repossession of a property can be counted as a conclusion once the case has progressed to the lodgement of the Civil Bill with the Circuit Court. The Central Bank has also informed me, however, that to count as a conclusion, the institution must be able to demonstrate that all regulatory requirements have been adhered to, in particular the CCMA obligation to ensure that repossession is a last resort.</p><p>  The Central Bank does not expect that repossession will be the lender&rsquo;s preferred solution to mortgage difficulties and in most cases engagement by the borrower will make the legal course unnecessary.

The measure was designed to boost tourism and create additional jobs in that sector. In line with best international practice it was introduced as a temporary measure and is due to expire at end December 2013, at which point it will revert to 13.5%. Retaining the 9% rate would be very costly to the Exchequer and would require an increase in taxation or reduction in expenditure elsewhere.  Any proposal to maintain the 9% VAT rate will be considered in the context of the Budget.</p></reply>

All of the Government&rsquo;s economic policies are designed with this objective in mind - repairing the banking sector, repairing the fiscal deficit and improving competitiveness will all contribute to economic recovery.  The latest data are reasonably encouraging. Domestic demand is showing signs of stabilisation.  In particular, consumer spending is up 0.7 per cent quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter this year and retail sales were reasonably strong over the summer period. </p><p>  In addition, developments in the labour market have been positive with employment up by 1.8 per cent in the second quarter this year which represents over 33,000 addition jobs.  We have now seen employment growth for four consecutive quarters.  Unemployment is down from its peak of 15.1 per cent in February last year to 13.3 per cent in September.  This improvement in the labour market will help support consumer demand by boosting disposable incomes and by enhancing confidence.  So, while I am not getting carried away, I am cautiously optimistic that a modest recovery is underway on the consumer spending front.</p></reply>

When these tests were postponed a new position was agreed with the Troika. Hence, in preparation for the timely introduction of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI), in consultation with staff of the EC, ECB and IMF, will now conduct a stress test in accordance with the new EU methodology ahead of, and in close proximity to, the upcoming SSM exercise.  The intention is to ensure that appropriate preparations are made early so that the Irish banks are in the strongest possible position to achieve the key goal for Ireland of a smooth entry into the SSM in 2014.</p><p>  Consequently the Irish authorities have agreed with the Troika that detailed preparatory work required for the stress test will be completed in 2013. The Central Bank of Ireland, in consultation with the Troika, will conduct a series of diagnostics to provide greater clarity regarding the underlying quality of banks&rsquo; balance sheets. A key element will be a comprehensive Balance Sheet Assessment to be finalised by end-November 2013.  It would not be appropriate to prejudge the outcome of this assessment and it should be noted that Irish banks remain well capitalised.</p></reply>

In common with the interest of other creditors I and my officials have been in contact with the Special Liquidators throughout the process to date to understand how the winding up has been proceeding. Twice weekly briefings have been established between officials of the Department of Finance and the Special Liquidators to review whether the liquidation of IBRC is being conducted in an efficient and timely fashion.

To ensure the ECB is truly a European level supervisor it will also directly supervise the three most significant banks in each participating Member State.  The Capital Requirements legislative package, CRD IV, contains a single rulebook for bank supervision and will apply to banks across the EU from 1 January 2014. When it assumes in full tasks under the SSM which is expected to be in late 2014, the ECB will apply the same CRD IV rules to banks under its supervision. Direct supervision by the ECB should not significantly impact on the banks concerned. In exercising direct supervision the ECB will continue to rely on the resources and cooperation of national supervisors. </p><p>  While the ECB will be responsible for the supervision of all EU banks it will rely on national level supervisors for the day-to-day supervision of the less significant credit institutions.  The ECB will issue instructions, regulations and guidelines to the national supervisors for tasks performed by the national supervisors as part of the SSM.  The ECB retains the right to intervene in any bank, at any time. National supervisors will also remain in charge of tasks not conferred on the ECB, for instance in relation to consumer protection, anti-money laundering and payment services.  In Ireland, the Central Bank of Ireland is the national level supervisor of credit institutions. The CBI is actively involved in the preparations for SSM in terms of its participation in all the main committees and their subgroups including also the appointment of staff to the ECB on a temporary basis.</p></reply>

On 13 January 2012, the Central Bank of Ireland secured a High Court Order for the appointment of a Special Manager to Newbridge Credit Union. Further High Court applications were made to extend the term of appointment of the Special Manager, the latest being in June 2013, and High Court Orders were secured for a 6 month extension period on each occasion.</p><p>  The Special Manager appointment was made because of Central Bank concerns in relation to the high level of loan losses incurred by the credit union, which impacted on the level of its reserves.  There were also concerns about some of the lending made, which went beyond the traditional type of lending normally provided by credit unions.  This action was taken to strengthen Newbridge Credit Union, protect members&rsquo; savings and ensure that Newbridge Credit Union can continue to operate effectively, providing financial services to the local community. </p><p>  The Central Bank is responsible for the regulation and supervision of credit unions.  That role includes the implementation of resolution action, where required.  The Central Bank undertook a process under the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011, involving the examination of possible combinations with other credit unions.  As part of this process, Naas Credit Union submitted a proposal to the Central Bank, setting out the basis upon which Naas Credit Union would be prepared to combine with Newbridge.</p><p>  At the request of the Governor of the Central Bank, I have confirmed that I am prepared, in principle, to support the proposal.  However, the proposal remains subject to amongst other things due diligence, completion of relevant documentation, Naas Credit Union board approval, regulatory consideration and High Court approval.  I expect that these steps will be completed expeditiously and that the Naas/Newbridge combination will be finalised by the end of this year.  This will necessitate a significant capital investment of taxpayers&rsquo; funds into Newbridge Credit Union to cover the losses at Newbridge and to ensure the protection of members&rsquo; savings and the stability of Newbridge into the future.  The successful combination of these credit unions is considered the best way to ensure the continuity of credit union services for members in Newbridge.</p><p>  I met with the Newbridge Action Group on 19 September.  Following that meeting, the agreed next steps were for the Newbridge Action Group to submit its proposal to me expeditiously.  Once received, I have agreed to communicate that proposal to the Central Bank with a view to a meeting between the Central Bank and the Group.  As yet no proposal has been received from the Newbridge Action Group.  I should also clarify that contrary to media reports no specific amount for the cost of the combination was mentioned by me to the action group.</p></reply>

However, the Central Bank has defined the concept of &lsquo;cooperation&rsquo; within the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, CCMA, which applies to all mortgage providers in the State.  Mortgage holders in arrears but who are deemed to be "co-operating" with their institution are provided additional protection from their lender.</p><p>  There is no information available to my Department on the scale of mortgage holders who have the clear capacity to meet their mortgage, and other financial commitments, but are refusing to do so.  Such an issue is one that can only be resolved by creditors and their debtors.  The standard financial statement, SFS, and the relevant provisions of the CCMA provide a framework to allow the resolution of a debt secured on a primary residence.  The Personal Insolvency Act also provides a legal framework to allow debtors and creditors to resolve positions of insolvency and over indebtedness in a fair way for all parties having regard to the insolvency of the debtor.  However, if creditors are of the view that a person has the clear capacity to meet their financial obligations but is refusing to do so, then the legal process and the Courts are at the disposal of such creditors to enforce the debt contracts of solvent debtors.</p></reply>

While the immediate crisis that this Government inherited when it took office has been averted, it remains important for relationships between institutions to be developed and sustained, in order to allow for confidential negotiations to take place, especially on particularly sensitive issues.  This is particularly the case in relation to the Irish authorities dealing with the ECB.  It is normal practice for states to protect the confidentiality of these discussions, and in fact is usually enshrined in the rules of association of institutions.</p><p>  Indeed, this is reflected in the Freedom of Information Act, which provides for exemptions for records relating to, for example, information received in confidence, commercially sensitive information and the financial and economic interests of the state in sections 24, 26 and 31.  These factors counterbalance the public interest, protecting the ability of the Government when negotiating or deliberating on matters of national importance.  It is considered that release of the correspondence sought would impact on the integrity and viability of the decision-making process to a significant degree without a countervailing benefit to the public, and would prejudice our relationship with the ECB.</p><p>  Any request which may be received from the recently announced banking enquiry will be considered taking account of the above considerations and also the terms of reference of the enquiry.</p></reply>

With that in mind, I am unsure as to the premise of the Deputy's question which seems to imply that Ireland has an "effective rate" that is significantly lower than our 12.5% rate.  All companies resident in Ireland are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on the profits that are generated from their trading activities in Ireland.  A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits.  Chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.</p><p>  I am aware of media reports which refer to the ways that some multinational companies structure their international tax affairs to minimise their tax costs and I understand that some of these reports have suggested that some companies in multinational groups pay Irish corporation tax at rates that are lower than 12.5%.  At this point it is important to state clearly that such companies are not paying a low rate of Irish tax &ndash; as already stated all companies in Ireland pay the standard 12.5% rate on their profits which are generated in Ireland.  The reports concerned appear to have incorrectly attributed to Ireland profits that represent the return due to assets in other jurisdictions, owned by group companies that are not resident in Ireland.</p><p>  The profits charged in Ireland fully reflect the functions, assets and risks located here by a multinational group.  The payments to the non-resident company represent the required remuneration of intellectual property assets funded and owned outside the State and its tax payments are properly reduced in these circumstances by reference to expenditure incurred for the purpose of its trade.  Ireland cannot expect to receive or retain the remuneration of these assets.</p><p>  The ability of multinational entities to lower their world-wide rates of tax using international structures reflects the global context in which Ireland and indeed all countries operate.  Differences arise in the legal and tax systems between countries.  International tax-planning takes account of these differences in national systems and rules.  The most effective way to deal with such arrangements is for countries to work together to examine these structures and to consider how international rules can be amended to ensure fair levels of taxation.  In this regard, Ireland is participating in projects at EU and OECD level which aim to address these issues.</p></reply>

Economic developments in Ireland&rsquo;s main trading partners - in particular the UK and the euro area - have underperformed international forecasters&rsquo; expectations in recent years.  This has contributed strongly to the downward revisions in GDP growth carried out by all domestic forecasters in recent years, including my Department.  This is one of the main factors necessitating the downward revision to the 2013 forecasts in each of the Stability Programme Updates.  It is also worth pointing out that forecasts are based on estimated outturns for key variables, such as GDP, which themselves are subject to revision.</p></reply>

I discussed how our economies have gone through a major transformation over the last number of years and we are finally starting to see signs of stability and growth.  I indicated that while no two economies are identical, there are many similarities between the causes of the crisis both sides of the border, there are common symptoms, and in my view, there are also common solutions evident in our recovery.</p><p>  On both sides of the border, families and businesses borrowed heavily to invest in residential and commercial property.  People got drawn into the property market with many small businesses moving beyond their core business and building up property portfolios.  These same families and business are now struggling under the weight of this debt. As a result we have a situation where thousands of families and business cannot fully engage with the economy. At the broader level the bursting of the bubble has forced Governments to introduce measures that would not be contemplated in normal times. NAMA, our asset management company, is one such example.</p><p>  Consistent with that theme, I met with First Minister, Peter Robinson, and the Finance Minister, Simon Hamilton at Stormont Castle in advance of the lunch to discuss NAMA&rsquo;s activity in Northern Ireland.  First Minister Robinson had raised concerns in the press earlier in the week that NAMA&rsquo;s policies in Northern Ireland may constrain Northern Ireland&rsquo;s recovery and so it was opportune that we were able to discuss this very important issue.  We discussed NAMA&rsquo;s involvement in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s economy generally.  NAMA&rsquo;s strategy in Northern Ireland is aimed at generating sustainable activity and transactions in the Northern Ireland property market &ndash; both through orderly sales and through targeted initiatives such as vendor finance and joint ventures that are designed to overcome the lack of funding in the market and enhance the future value of Northern Ireland assets through a programme of investment funding.  We also discussed how NAMA&rsquo;s concerns reflect the concerns of members of the Northern Ireland Executive about the negative impact fire sales would have on the economy.</p><p>  We discussed the very strong level of engagement NAMA has in Northern Ireland with all key stakeholders, which is supported by NAMA&rsquo;s Northern Ireland Advisory Committee.  NAMA is investing to enhance the value of its assets in Northern Ireland and has advanced significant amounts of new money into the Northern Ireland economy to assist in such projects as the construction of a new 95-unit housing development in Milmount, Dundonald, close to Belfast and to complete Lanyon Plaza and the Soloist Building which form part of a landmark office development in the centre of Belfast.  This investment comes at a time when there are very few other sources of funding for projects in Northern Ireland.  As has also recently been reported in the press, NAMA is working closely with local housing authorities and approved housing bodies in Northern Ireland and recently announced the sale of over 50 apartments to Oaklee Housing Association in Belfast.</p><p>  Our meeting was very constructive with both sides sharing an understanding of the importance of NAMA to the economy in Northern Ireland and of the care NAMA is taking in its dealings in Northern Ireland through on going measures of support and considerations regarding the management of the portfolio into the future.</p></reply>

The Government's focus is now firmly fixed on achieving a successful and durable exit from our programme. In this regard we are doing all that we can to achieve this end. We continue to meet our programme conditions and our strong implementation record has been recognised by our external partners and the financial markets. </p><p>  The options available to Ireland on exiting the programme fall into two broad categories. A successful exit without any further support or a successful exit supported by the European Stability Mechanism's and the IMF's precautionary backstop facilities. The second option has been referred to as Ireland having an 'insurance policy' to guard against the possibility of unfavorable external events that might arise.  </p><p>  By way of information, both the IMF and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) have a number of options available in relation to the precautionary financial assistance as follows.  The ESM's Treaty provides, in Article 14, that the Board of Governors may decide to grant precautionary financial assistance in the form of a precautionary conditioned credit line (PCCL) or in the form of an enhanced conditions credit line (ECCL). It also provides, at Articles 17 and 18 for primary and secondary market support facilities.  The Treaty also provides for the conditionality, terms and conditions to be attached to such assistance. Further information in relation to these instruments is available on the ESM website at .</p><p>  The IMF has a number of precautionary or standby type facilities including Flexible Credit Line (FCL), the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL), the Extended Funding Facility (EFF) and the Stand By Arrangement (SBA). These different instruments are designed to address different sets of circumstances, and the terms and conditions attaching to them are structured accordingly. Further information on these instruments is available on the IMF website at . </p><p>  In the case of both the ESM and IMF precautionary facilities, the nature of the conditionality would depend on the type of facility agreed and also the specific circumstances of the country making the application.  In general, such conditionality seeks to address the reasons underlying the application for assistance.</p><p>  The ECB's Outright Monetary Transaction (OMT) is another potential support for countries exiting a programme. The Governing Council of the ECB made a decision to establish Outright Monetary Transaction (OMT) on 2 August 2012, and issued a Press Release on 6 September 2012 which outlined its technical features. According to this ECB Press Release, the purpose of OMT is: &#8220;<i>Safeguarding an appropriate monetary policy transmission and the singleness of the monetary policy</i>&#8221;. In the Press Release, the ECB noted in relation to the coverage of OMT that it &#8220;<i>will be considered for Member States currently under a macroeconomic adjustment programme when they will be regaining bond market access</i>.&#8221; The Press Release also sets out that a necessary condition for OMT is strict and effective conditionality attached to an appropriate European Financial Stability Facility/European Stability Mechanism EFSF/ESM programme. </p><p>  Such programmes can take the form of a full EFSF/ESM macroeconomic adjustment programme or a precautionary programme (Enhanced Conditions Credit Line), provided that they include the possibility of EFSF/ESM primary market purchases. Finally the Press Release also notes that the ECB's Governing Council will decide on the start, continuation and suspension of OMT, following a thorough assessment, in full discretion and acting in accordance with its monetary policy mandate. The decision on whether to grant OMT or otherwise in any particular case is a matter for the ECB, which is an independent body. </p><p>  Ireland will be the first euro country to exit an EU-IMF programme of this type. In this context, discussions on Ireland's exit from the Programme took place during the recent review missions and some further clarity on the possible options that might be available in terms of exit strategy was achieved.  The issue will be considered further at the forthcoming Troika review scheduled for the second half of October.  No decisions have been taken to date by Government on any of the possible options that Ireland might wish to pursue in this matter.  However, all options that assist in supporting durable and sustainable future market funding will be considered in the light of what is appropriate for Ireland.</p></reply>

This package will help create jobs throughout local communities as it is focused on small scale capital works which tend to be more labour intensive than major new build projects.   With regard to further a stimulus package in Budget 2014, I am not prepared to be drawn into speculation on budgetary matters at this time. However, I will say that preparations for the Budget are well underway in my Department, in the Department of Public Expenditure and that expenditure on capital investment is a matter for my colleague Brendan Howlin, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

State support, on a gross basis, for the banking sector has amounted to approximately &euro;64 billion, which includes Exchequer payments, promissory notes in respect of IBRC and EBS, as well as funding from the NPRF.  The proceeds of all borrowing as well as revenues including tax and non-tax, and capital receipts are lodged to the Exchequer account to fund general expenditure.  In general, no specific tranches of borrowing were undertaken solely for the purpose of recapitalising the banking sector. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately quantify that part of the debt interest bill that relates to the borrowing undertaken to recapitalise the banks.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware however that the &euro;3.06 billion Promissory Note instalment due to IBRC at end-March 2012 was settled with a Government bond. The NTMA issued bonds with a nominal value of &euro;3.46 billion in order to meet the payment. The yield on the bonds and, therefore, the effective interest rate on the repayment of the &euro;3.06 billion, was just over 6.8%.  In February 2013, the IBRC Promissory Notes were cancelled and replaced with a portfolio of eight floating rate Government bonds for a total amount of &euro;25 billion. The bonds pay interest every six months (June and December) based on the six month Euribor interest rate plus an interest margin which averages 2.63% across the eight issues.</p></reply>

I published an assessment of the Credit Review Office late last year which contained a number of recommendations to make the CRO more effective in encouraging and increasing the supply of credit to SMEs. One of these recommendations was to increase the resources of the CRO and I sanctioned the appointment of additional reviewers at budget time last year. The procurement process for additional reviewers has been completed and the possible  implementation of a number of the remaining recommendations in the assessment is being examined.</p><p>  In looking at the implementation of other recommendations, my officials have also been considering where the CRO should fit into the broader overall strategy of ensuring credit availability for viable SMEs and the level of the threshold is one aspect of this strategy.</p></reply>

The discretionary fund of the NPRF, of approximately &euro;6.4 billion currently, will be channelled towards productive investment on commercial terms in the Irish economy.  Officials of my Department are currently preparing the necessary legislation which I hope to see enacted this year. </p><p>  Using the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, we will maximise our resources to enhance growth in the Irish economy and improve key infrastructure to maintain Ireland's attractiveness as a place to do business and to create jobs. It is not really possible at this time to estimate the expected effect on employment, although we do expect very significant economic activity and the creation of thousands of jobs. My Department is working alongside the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) to develop the broad parameters for the investment strategy for the ISIF, in parallel with developing the legislation, and it is envisaged that that work will align with the work being done by my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on a medium-term economic plan.</p><p>  It is envisaged that the ISIF will seek to leverage and maximise its resources by attracting private sector co-investment. I am conscious that it is important that a level of independence is maintained in order to attract that private sector co-investment. To do this, the fund will need to demonstrate clearly that it acts on a commercial basis, so that the very fact that it is prepared to finance a proposal will reassure other potential investors that the project is sound.  While the need for the State to provide for social welfare and public service pensions obligations has not abated, fostering economic activity and employment is currently a greater priority and this will in turn put the State in a better position to meet its pension obligations in the longer term.</p></reply>

I am informed by the NTMA that each rating agency visits Ireland at least once a year as part of their formal rating review processes.  Meetings are scheduled with all relevant authorities during these visits, including the Department of Finance, NTMA, Central Bank and other public and private sector bodies.  The NTMA also makes a detailed presentation to the agencies during its overseas investor visits whenever possible and updates them on a monthly basis (through email and conference calls) on developments in the public finances and the broader economy.  Outside these structures, any important information that may influence the credit rating is communicated directly to the agencies by the NTMA.

It also recognises that businesses with legacy debts may be viable.  One of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme.  The Irish Credit Bureau is a private entity and I have no direct function in the day-to-day operational decisions.  In relation to the credit ratings provided to SMEs my department recognised the need to reorganise the government reporting system and established an inter-agency working group at the end of 2010 to develop a strategy to put in place an effective credit reporting system in Ireland.  The working group's report formed the basis of the Credit Reporting Bill 2012.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Credit Reporting Bill, 2012 is currently passing through the Houses of the Oireachtas which provides for the creation of an effective statutory based credit reporting system.  The Bill includes the following provisions:</p><p>- The database will be owned by the Central Bank and the Bank will be responsible for the operation of the Central Credit Register. </p><p>- There will be mandatory reporting of a comprehensive range of credit information by credit providers. </p><p>- The Bill provides for controls with regard to access to information on the Register.  By including provisions relating to access to data and security measures as well as provisions to help to deal with identity theft, this legislation should inspire confidence in businesses and in the consumer.</p><p>- The legislation proposes to extend the role of the Data Protection Commissioner to deal with complaints from micro enterprises and SMEs (with a turnover of less than &euro;3m) in respect of their data held on the Credit Register.  This initiative may provide some comfort to enterprises where they have a concern in relation to the potential storing of inaccurate data and where they do not have the resources to take legal action through the Courts to seek to have the data corrected.  Inaccurate data on the Central Credit Register could result in the refusal of credit to a small company.  </p><p>- In line with International practice, it provides for a retention period of 5 years in relation to credit information with respect to debts from the day on which it is entered on the Register.  The Bill provides for the retention of information for a period of 6 months in relation to credit applications from the day it is entered on the Register. Anonymised information may be retained indefinitely.</p><p>  In addition, the Government is fully engaged in supporting the SME sector and has imposed SME lending targets on AIB and Bank of Ireland for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013.  Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion in 2012 and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.  Both banks achieved the targets for 2011 and 2012.  I have met the Boards of each of the banks in which the State has a shareholding three times since the start of this year.  At these meetings, I have emphasised the importance of access to credit for SMEs and the need for an adequate flow of finance to be available to viable small businesses in Ireland.</p><p>  In June 2013 the Central Bank set quarterly institution-specific performance targets for covered banks to move distressed SME borrowers onto longer-term solutions.  The targets set reflect the banks' capacity, processes and systems.  I should stress that the Credit Review process remains available to any SMEs whose credit has been reduced or withdrawn by AIB or Bank of Ireland as well as when credit is refused by them.  I would strongly advise any SME whose credit is reduced or withdrawn to avail of the services of the Credit Review Office.</p></reply>

In this context it was decided that there would be no private sector involvement for senior bank paper or Irish Sovereign debt without the agreement of our external partners.  The Deputy will be aware that there were discussions with our external partners on the issue of payment to bondholders.  I have advised the House on a number of occasions that our European partners expressed strong reservations about burden sharing with senior bondholders and the rationale for this position.  This commitment was agreed with our external partners and was the basis on which Ireland's financing strategy was built.</p><p>  This strategy is working well as evidenced by the reduction in pricing of Irish Sovereign debt in the secondary markets and the significant steps being taken towards regaining full market access by the NTMA.  It should also be noted that significant burden-sharing has been achieved through Liability Management Exercise (LME) transactions completed by the covered banks.  The purpose of the LMEs was to create additional core tier 1 capital and to strengthen the quality of the capital base of the Banks.  Since this Government came to into power, we reduced the cash required from the State by &euro;5.8bn, from burden-sharing with subordinated bondholders.  The contribution from burden-sharing with subordinated bondholders amounts to approximately &euro;15bn since the banking crisis began.</p></reply>

Macroeconomic developments thus far are supportive of the projected reduction in debt and deficit in the post-programme environment.  Quarterly National Accounts data for the second quarter show that real GDP increased by 0.4 per cent in the quarter.  Encouragingly high frequency data suggest a continuation of the positive momentum into the third quarter.  Of particular note were the tentative signs of a modest recovery in domestic demand.  Personal consumption increased by 0.7 per cent in the second quarter and strong retail sales in recent months are indicative of further growth in the third quarter.  We have also seen a return to growth in 'core' (excluding planes) investment, with both construction and machinery and equipment now growing.</p><p>  Labour market conditions have also improved markedly over the last year, with employment having increased in each of the last four quarters.  Employment was up by 1.8 per cent in year-on-year terms in the second quarter, representing an additional 33,800 jobs over the year.  The improvement in labour market conditions has also been reflected in the unemployment rate, with a standardised unemployment rate falling to 13.3 per cent in September, having peaked at 15.1 per cent in February 2012.</p><p>  These indicators point to a modest recovery in the Irish economy.  My Department will be publishing updated forecasts for 2013 and 2014 along with the Budget on October 15th which will take account of developments in the interim and which must be independently endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, in line with the European regulation on common provisions for monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans.  Also of note are the forecasts published by the Central Bank yesterday, pointing to moderate growth this year, as weaker export growth drags on the headline figure, with the rate of expansion set to pick up in 2014.</p><p>  On the fiscal side, we continue to meet and exceed our budget deficit targets.  It should however be noted that part of our current deficit is structural; in other words, economic recovery alone will not be sufficient to correct the deficit.  However, we have made significant progress in reducing the structural deficit in recent years and most of this correction has already been done.</p><p>  Ireland's considerable efforts in restoring our public finances to a sound footing has not only been reflected in the deficit figures but has also had significant confidence effects.  Ireland&rsquo;s 10 year bond yield has fallen by over 10 percentage points since peaking in July 2011, facilitating Ireland&rsquo;s return to the market for long-term financing earlier this year.</p></reply>

The Irish Presidency achieved a Council General Approach on this file which has enabled the Lithuanian Presidency to commence the next stage of the legislative process, which is the engagement via Trilogues with the European Parliament and Commission on this file.  The Tripartite discussions in relation to this issue are at an early stage and no agreement has been finalised thus far. This topic is scheduled for further Trilogue discussions in October. It is expected at this stage that agreement on commodities will form part of the final MiFID II package. </p><p>  This file, along with the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), seeks to protect against excessive financial speculation in the food and other commodity derivative markets.  The Regulation of derivative trading in the EU has been actively discussed within the EU since September 2010 when the Commission published its proposal for the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) to regulate this market in the context of over-the-counter (OTC) trades. The EMIR Regulation, which entered into force on 16 August 2012, implements reforms to derivatives trading, making it safer and more efficient. These reforms include obligations to clear and report derivatives and it also imposes obligations on non-financial firms who use derivatives.</p><p>  Under the current MiFID II proposals, the level of exemptions available has been reduced and more products will be defined as derivative financial instruments, when compared with MiFID I and will therefore fall within the scope of MiFID II and other financial legislation such as Market Abuse. MiFID II also contains important provisions relating to position management, position limits and product intervention. These provisions are in respect of all financial instruments, including commodity derivatives, and have the purpose of providing regulators with tools to avoid excessive speculation in financial instruments, including commodity derivatives. The Council is proposing that competent authorities will be obligated to establish and apply position limits on the size of a position in a commodity derivative which a person can have over a specified period of time. </p><p>  Furthermore, competent authorities will have product intervention powers whereby they may prohibit or restrict trading of financial instruments or prohibit or restrict investment activities when there is a threat to the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or commodity markets. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will have contingency and coordination powers in position management and product intervention to ensure consistent application across all Member States. In the exercise of its powers, ESMA will also have to consult public bodies competent for the oversight, administration and regulation of physical agricultural markets. </p><p>  EMIR and MiFID II combined are expected to result in a tighter regime for all derivatives, including food securities, whether traded OTC or through exchanges. The measures are intended to keep pace with trends in derivatives trading, in line with G20 commitments made at the 2009 Pittsburgh summit.</p><p>  We will continue to monitor developments on this file throughout the legislative process.</p></reply>

Decisions relating to the sale of properties securing its loans are an operational matter for the Board of NAMA which is guided by its commercial mandate under the NAMA Act 2009.  NAMA&rsquo;s role is that of a secured lender, like any bank they own the debt while the debtor or appointed liquidator still owns and controls the assets and is ultimately responsible for these assets, the Agency is therefore not in a position to compel its debtors and receivers to cede property either free of charge or at less than market value.</p><p>  NAMA fulfils its social obligation remit by facilitating a dialogue between NAMA debtors and third parties so as to enable the latter to acquire suitable property for social, sporting and other public purposes.

When considering any transaction under its social obligation, Section 10 of the NAMA Act requires NAMA to maximise the return on its loans for the benefit of the taxpayer.</p></reply>

Each application received by the Passport Service must, therefore, demonstrate that person's entitlement to Irish citizenship before a passport can issue to him/her. The children in question were born in the State in 2008 and 2010, their entitlement to Irish citizenship is, therefore, subject to the terms of section 6A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956 as amended (the Act).<font color="#004080"> </font>This provides that a person, born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person's birth, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding that<font color="#004080"> </font>person's birth.</p><p>  In line with guidelines provided by the Department of Justice, Equality and Defence, which is responsible for immigration and citizenship, the proofs of lawful residence of a non-EU parent, which are accepted and considered by this Department for the purposes of passport applications are immigration stamps in passports or the registration cards/books, which are given to persons registering with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  These are official documents which can be objectively verified by the Department.</p><p>  Passport applications for the children were received by the Department in August 2012.  Neither of these were finalized for passport issue on the grounds that the amount of their mother's lawful residence was insufficient to demonstrate their entitlement to Irish citizenship.  At the time these were processed, the evidence of the mother's lawful residence, which were taken into account by the Department, were her registration card and  correspondence from GNIB.  (The latter detailed the permission that were issued to her.)  However, towards the end of last year, the Supreme Court ruled that letters from the Department of Justice, Equality and Defence, which sanctioned a parent's residence in the State, could be accepted as evidence of lawful residence from the date of the letter.  This was an important ruling in that the period of residence between the date of the letter and the date of the first permission, issued by GNIB, was reckonable for the purposes of the Act.  </p><p>  In light of this, a full review of the submitted applications has been done. In the case of the younger sibling, I am pleased to inform you that the additional residence that arises from the Supreme Court ruling is sufficient to demonstrate this child's entitlement to Irish citizenship and thereby a passport. Accordingly, the Passport Service will make contact with his parents to arrange the submission of a new application form and photographs for his passport.</p><p>  Unfortunately, the position in regard to the older sibling is unchanged.   It is, therefore, open to her parents to pursue the question of her citizenship through the naturalisation process with the Department of Justice, Equality and Defence.  In the event that citizenship is granted to her, the evidence of her certificate of naturalisation will in this case be sufficient evidence of her Irish citizenship for her application for a passport.</p></reply>

The inescapable reality is that the crisis can only be resolved politically through a genuinely inclusive negotiating process.  In my address, I also reaffirmed the need for the removal of impediments to delivery of assistance necessary to alleviate the dire humanitarian situation and for full accountability for the 21 August gas attack and the many other serious human rights violations perpetrated in Syria. </p><p>  There is at present no Syrian Ambassador accredited to Ireland, following the departure of the last non-resident Ambassador from London in March 2012.

The decision to provide any specific form of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter based on the assessment an insurer will make of the risks involved.  Insurance companies as a matter of course carry out reviews of the risks that they are prepared to insure against and sometimes make decisions to discontinue certain types of cover which they consider high risk, such as homes in an area which is prone to subsidence.  These types of decisions are made sometimes on the basis of their broad past experience rather than looking at the individual circumstances of householders.  Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance. Their service can be contacted at (01) 676 1914 or by email at iis@insuranceireland.eu".</p></reply>

I understand that the purpose of the report is to encourage countries to achieve more efficient regulation; provide measurable benchmarks for reform; and serve as a resource for academics, journalists, researchers and others interested in the business climate of each country.</p><p>  The report includes detailed subnational data on the ease of doing business, ranks each location and recommends reforms to improve performance in terms of various indicators.  This enables countries to compare their business regulations with those of other relevant countries and to relate them to their own objectives for economic growth and development.  In October, 2012, after ten years of the Doing Business Report, the President of the World Bank Group appointed an independent panel of experts to review the Report and to seek further ways to improve it.  The review of the independent panel was published in June, 2013, and its recommendations included the retention of the Doing Business Report, a move to grouping by categories instead of aggregate rankings, increasing the report&rsquo;s level of transparency, reform of its methodology and the use of complementary information from enterprise surveys.</p><p>  As the findings and recommendations of the review are under ongoing consideration by World Bank management, it would not be appropriate to pre-empt the outcome of this process and any subsequent decisions which may be taken.  However, I understand that Irish Aid consider that the Doing Business Report provides a clear incentive and encouragement for many developing countries to reform their economies to attract more domestic and foreign investment which, in turn, stimulates growth and reduces poverty.</p><p>  Ireland ranks well in the Doing Business Report, achieving 15th position in the report published in 2012.  As World Bank Governor for Ireland, my Department has a lead role in liaising with the Doing Business team at the Bank.  In consultation with the relevant Government Departments and agencies, particular attention has been focused on areas of business regulations identified as in need of improvement in previous reports with a view to ensuring as far as possible that there is full recognition of progress made by Ireland in these areas.</p></reply>

It would not be appropriate for me to comment further on an individual property or transaction.  On the general social dividend point, Section 10 of the NAMA Act statutorily obliges NAMA to 'obtain the best achievable return for the State' from the management or its acquired loan portfolio. NAMA is obliged to carry out its functions in the context of the overriding commercial objective provided for by Section 10 of the Act and to recover the greatest amount possible for the taxpayer from the sale of loans and properties securing its loans.   </p><p>  As part of ensuring this, it is NAMA's clear policy that properties and loans that are for sale are openly marketed.  This ensures a competitive and transparent sales process and the best possible financial returns for the taxpayer.  Importantly however, the NAMA Board has committed to giving first refusal to any public authority, including Government departments, State agencies and local authorities, in respect of the purchase of property from NAMA debtors and receivers which may be suitable for their purposes.  In line with this commitment, NAMA has accommodated the release of lands and property for schools, health care facilities, community and recreational amenities and other uses. Examples include:</p><p>  - The identification of 4,350 houses and apartments for social housing</p><p>  - The identification of more than 70 sites as potentially suitable for new schools</p><p>  - The sale of sites to University College Dublin and University College Cork</p><p>  - The sale of the Opera Centre site in Limerick to Limerick City Council</p><p>  - The release of lands in Baldoyle, north Co. Dublin to Fingal County Council for parkland</p><p>  - Co-funding, with Fingal County Council, of an N2-N3 link road through lands in west Dublin to facilitate identified development requirements.</p><p>  NAMA is also engaging with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive in relation to possible sites and buildings for primary health care centres and other step-down and community health care facilities.</p><p>  The Agency, therefore, whilst working to obtain the best achievable financial return for the taxpayer, is very open to realistic proposals that achieve desirable social objectives and there are numerous examples of this.  In addition to NAMA's on-going engagement with public bodies in relation to specific initiatives, such as social housing, it is open to any public body to identify its interest in lands and property securing the Agency's loans.  </p><p>  I believe the approach determined by NAMA's Board is contributing in terms of its primary commercial objective, while at the same time contributing to the achievement of wider public policy objectives.</p></reply>

The Commission reviewed the future of credit unions and made recommendations regarding the most effective regulatory structure for credit unions, taking into account their not-for-profit mandate, their volunteer ethos and community focus, while paying due regard to the need to fully protect members&rsquo; savings and financial stability;</p><p>- Publication of the Credit Union Bill 2012. Over sixty of the recommendations in the Commission Report were included in the Bill;</p><p>- Publication of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012. The Act implements the statutory changes recommended in the Commission&rsquo;s final Report and is set out in four main parts: Prudential requirements; Governance; Stabilisation; and Restructuring;</p><p>- Introduction of a Fitness and Probity regime for credit unions;</p><p>- Introduction of payments to the Deposit Guarantee Scheme by credit unions;</p><p>- Establishment of Credit Union Fund and transfer of &euro;250m to the Fund.</p><p>As part of each Troika mission, the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF are updated on progress achieved in the credit union sector. Progress to date includes the strengthened regulatory framework as set out in the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012, the publication by the Central Bank of the Credit Union Handbook, the development of a tiered regulatory approach, the introduction of a Fitness and Probity regime for credit unions and the work of the Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo).  In addition, we have achieved all the benchmarks set out in the EU-IMF Programme in relation to credit unions including:</p><p>EU-IMP Programme Summary</p><p><table><tr><th>Objective</th><th>Achieved</th></tr><tr><td>Commission on Credit Unions Final Report by end-March 2012</td><td>Done</td></tr><tr><td>Credit Union Bill published by end-September 2012</td><td>Done</td></tr><tr><td>Commencement of Fitness and Probity regime</td><td>Done</td></tr><tr><td>Commencement of Deposit Guarantee Scheme</td><td>Done</td></tr><tr><td>Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012</td><td>Done</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;250m transferred into Credit Union Fund</td><td>Done</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-10-03a.203.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013100300054#WRH01700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 to 77, inclusive, together.</p><p>  Section 224 of the Companies Act, 1963, as it applies in modified form to the liquidation of IBRC pursuant to Section 10 of the IBRC Act, requires the directors of IBRC, unless &ldquo;the Minister thinks it fit to order otherwise and so orders&rdquo;, to prepare a Statement of Affairs in respect of IBRC (a &ldquo;Statement of Affairs&rdquo;) within 21 days of the date of the liquidation or such later date as I may specify. I have issued two Statutory Instruments (&lsquo;SIs&rsquo;) in relation to the timing and content of the Statement of Affairs to be prepared by the directors of IBRC. The first SI issued on 6th August 2013 (SI 304 of 2013) and a second SI issued on 18th September 2013 (SI 358 of 2013). Both of these SIs were necessary to facilitate requests made on behalf of the directors of IBRC in relation to the timing and content of the Statement of Affairs which they were required to produce.</p><p>  The effect of the two SIs was to extend the date of submission of the Statement of Affairs out to the 30th September 2013 and also to waive the requirement to include the personal details of debtors and depositors of the bank as at 7th February 2013 in the Statement of Affairs. No precedent exists as these are the first orders to be made under Section 224 of the Companies Act, 1963, as it applies in modified form to the liquidation of IBRC pursuant to Section 10 of the IBRC Act.</p><p>  I am advised that it was not feasible for the directors of IBRC to prepare a Statement of Affairs for IBRC within 21 days of the appointment of the special liquidators due to the complexity of the balance sheet of IBRC on liquidation and due to the amount of work required to be completed by the directors in preparing the Statement of Affairs. The liquidation of IBRC is arguably the largest and most complex liquidation of a company in the history of the State and I am satisfied that it was simply not feasible for the directors to complete the Statement of Affairs within the period specified in the Companies Act and for that reason I agreed to extend the submission date of the Statement of Affairs to the 30th September 2013. </p><p>  I also agreed that it would not be appropriate or necessary for the purposes of the orderly winding-up of IBRC for the directors to disclose personal details of the bank&rsquo;s approximately 2,500 depositors in the Statement of Affairs, as there would be a risk that such details, if they were included in the Statement of Affairs, could quite possibly make their way into the public domain. I further agreed that it would be inappropriate and unnecessary for the purposes of the orderly winding-up of IBRC to require the disclosure of personal information of the approximately 17,000 mortgage holders as well as other debtors of the bank as part of the Statement of Affairs. There is a risk that such information, if disclosed in the Statement of Affairs, could become publicly available and in my view this would not be in the interests of the orderly winding up of IBRC or the maximisation of the value IBRC&rsquo;s assets. </p><p>  The directors of IBRC remain obliged to produce a Statement of Affairs which will provide a detailed list of the assets and liabilities of the bank at the time of liquidation and the directors remain required to clearly set out the amounts owing by IBRC to secured, preferential and unsecured creditors at the time of liquidation. Information on aggregate amounts owing by debtors of the bank, and owing by the bank to depositors, upon liquidation will still be included in the Statement of Affairs along with estimates of the recoverable value of the assets.</p><p>  It is also important to note that the personal information concerning depositors and debtors which will not now be included in the Statement of Affairs is information which is already fully available to the Special Liquidators of the bank.   I made the decision to issue both the SIs following discussions and consultations between my officials and the directors of IBRC and the Special Liquidators of IBRC, who had no objection to the terms of the SIs.  The exclusion of personal information concerning depositors and debtors of the bank from the Statement of Affairs will not therefore have any adverse impact on the orderly winding-up of the bank&rsquo;s affairs. It is also important to note that the date of submission of the Statement of Affairs has not been negatively impacted by the introduction of the SIs.</p></reply>

Not all interventions conducted are in the form of an audit.  The appropriate compliance intervention is the one considered to be the most effective in targeting the specific risk or risks identified, and to influence the compliance behaviour of the taxpayer. By carefully selecting cases for intervention, and choosing the type of intervention, Revenue maximises the use of resources, and minimises the compliance burden on compliant taxpayers. Accordingly, the focus may vary from a comprehensive examination of all the taxes and duties for which a taxpayer may be liable, to a detailed check of a single tax-head, or a concentration on a single issue of concern.</p><p>This targeted approach is greatly supported and enhanced with appropriate technology, including the Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling system &ndash; REAP, integrating information obtained from multiple sources, and Integrated Case Management systems that facilitate case selection, provide invaluable information for evaluating Revenue&rsquo;s programmes, track the progress of cases and record the risks identified and examined.  REAP, developed by Revenue, categorises taxpayers in accordance with defined risk criteria and includes details of the compliance behaviour of the taxpayer in relation to filing and paying.</p><p>I am advised that these systems have enabled the Commissioners to gradually evolve and refine the recording and classification of compliance interventions and the approach currently in use is shown in Table 2 below in respect of 2012.  As a result, the data is not directly comparable over time and the Commissioners note that the previous approach may have resulted in some interventions being labelled as audits which today could be differently classified.  With this caveat, the Commissioners have set out in Table 1 details of audits and other compliance interventions carried out by them from <b>2008 - August 2013</b> inclusive.</p><p>I am satisfied that notwithstanding the pressure on resources and skills due to the loss of some experienced staff Revenue continues to carry out a substantial compliance programme involving audits and other compliance interventions.</p><p><b>Table 1:  Audit &amp;amp; Compliance Interventions 2008 &ndash; 2013 (End August 2013)</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>Year</b></th><th><b>Number of Compliance Interventions</b></th><th><b>Compliance Yield</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>2008</b></td><td>360,859 (Audits 13,414)</td><td>&euro;632.3m (&euro;569.2m)</td></tr><tr><td><b>2009</b></td><td>373,899 (Audits 12,419)</td><td>&euro;668.0m (&euro;602.m)</td></tr><tr><td><b>2010</b></td><td>465,804 (Audits 11,088)</td><td>&euro;492.7m (&euro;434.7m)</td></tr><tr><td><b>2011</b></td><td>557,568 (Audits 11,066)</td><td>&euro;521.8m (&euro;440.5m)</td></tr><tr><td><b>2012</b></td><td>537,821 (Audits  9,066)</td><td>&euro;492.4m (&euro;359.1m)</td></tr><tr><td><b>2013 (to end August)</b></td><td>431,650 (Audits  5,434)</td><td>&euro;394.8m (&euro;242.3m)</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2:  Extract from Revenue&rsquo;s 2012 Annual Report which sets out the classification of compliance interventions currently in use in Revenue.</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>Type of Intervention</b></th><th><b>Completed 2012*</b></th><th><b>Yield &euro;m</b></th><th><b>Completed 2011*</b></th><th><b>Yield &euro;m</b></th></tr><tr><td>Comprehensive (All taxheads) Audits</td><td>4,687</td><td>182</td><td>4,717</td><td>183.6</td></tr><tr><td>Multi Tax/Duty Audits</td><td>985</td><td>34</td><td>1,236</td><td>61.6</td></tr><tr><td>Single Tax/Duty Audits</td><td>2,624</td><td>100</td><td>3,345</td><td>126.9</td></tr><tr><td>Single Issue/Transaction Audits</td><td>770</td><td>43</td><td>1,768</td><td>68.4</td></tr><tr><td><b>Total Audit Intervention</b></td><td><b>9.066</b></td><td><b>359</b></td><td><b>11,066</b></td><td><b>440.5</b></td></tr><tr><td>Risk Management Interventions</td><td>125,073</td><td>88</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Assurance Checks</td><td>373,803</td><td>22</td><td>546,502</td><td>81</td></tr><tr><td>PAYE Compliance Checks</td><td>29,879</td><td>23</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><b>Total Interventions</b></td><td><b>537,821</b></td><td><b>492</b></td><td><b>557,568</b></td><td><b>521.5</b></td></tr></table></p></reply>

I am assured that Revenue continues to be very conscious of the challenges that exist for some businesses in meeting their tax obligations in a timely manner and its debt collection caseworkers will always seek to work proactively with taxpayers and viable businesses that engage positively to agree mutually satisfactory arrangements to overcome temporary cashflow difficulties in preference to deploying enforcement options.</p><p>I am informed that the total outstanding tax debt at 31 March 2013, the latest date for which debt data is available, amounted to &euro;2,006m. However the &lsquo;debt available for collection&rsquo; portion of the total debt, which excludes both debt under appeal to the Appeal Commissioners and insolvent debt was &euro;1,180m at that date. This figure, which is a more accurate reflection of the debt available to Revenue to manage through its debt management programmes was &euro;137m or 10% less than the same period in 2012. Of the &euro;1,180m &lsquo;debt available for collection&rsquo; figure at 31 March 2013, &euro;476m was under active enforcement and a further &euro;124m was the subject of phased payment arrangements.</p><p>In regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s request for a breakdown of the arrears, I am informed that the data is not maintained in the format requested. However the data is available at taxhead level and is attached in the table below.</p><p>In regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the number of Revenue staff engaged in arrears collection, primary responsibility for debt management rests with the Collector-General&rsquo;s Division. The purpose of the Collector-General&rsquo;s debt management function is to ensure the timely collection of the business and personal taxes for which Revenue has responsibility and, where timely compliance is not achieved, to undertake robust debt collection activity to recoup arrears.  The numbers of Collector-General staff involved in debt collection activity during the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 are as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of Staff</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>441</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>460</td></tr></table></p><p>Finally, I am assured by Revenue that, notwithstanding the continuing very difficult environment, achieving further reductions in collectible debt is a key strategic objective. I am satisfied that the continuing trend in decreasing levels of &lsquo;debt available for collection&rsquo; over the last couple of years is encouraging and clearly demonstrates the success of Revenue&rsquo;s current approach to debt management.</p><p><b>Analysis of Taxes Outstanding Debt at 31 March 2013</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>Tax Head</b></th><th><b>2013 &euro;m</b></th></tr><tr><td>VAT</td><td>434</td></tr><tr><td>PAYE</td><td>166</td></tr><tr><td>PRSI</td><td>159</td></tr><tr><td>Income Tax (excl PAYE)</td><td>647</td></tr><tr><td>Corporation Tax</td><td>241</td></tr><tr><td>Capital Gains Tax</td><td>260</td></tr><tr><td>Capital Acquisitions Tax</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Relevant Contracts Tax</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Environmental Levy</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>Air Travel Tax</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td><b>2,006</b></td></tr></table></p></reply>

These balances are available immediately to the State. At end-September 2013 there were Exchequer cash balances of &euro;12.5 billion.  At end-September 2013 there was also &euro;13.1 billion on hand in short-term investments, including bank deposits. The rate of return on NTMA investments is commercially-sensitive information. These investments are available to the State at short notice.  In 2012, the accounts of the NTMA show that there was &euro;129 million of interest received on deposits, including balances at the Central Bank of Ireland, and other investments.</p><p>  The average interest rate on General Government debt in 2013 was estimated at 4.3% in the April 2013 <i>Stability Programme Update (SPU)</i>.  This estimate is calculated by dividing the estimated General Government interest expenditure for 2013 by the stock of General Government Debt outstanding at the end of the previous year.  Using a similar methodology for Exchequer (or National) Debt and taking account of the replacement of the IBRC Promissory Notes, which were not part of the National Debt, by a portfolio of floating rate Government bonds which are, a similar interest rate was estimated for 2013 at the time of the April SPU. </p><p>  I am satisfied that the NTMA manages the cash balances in a prudent manner consistent with minimising risk and always having sufficient cash on hand to cover any volatility which might arise.  Finally, I would add that in view of its relatively strong funding position, the NTMA announced on Tuesday, 1 October, that it has decided to suspend its monthly Treasury Bill auctions for the final quarter of 2013. The NTMA has also decided to defer consideration of any further medium or long-term bond issuance until early 2014.</p></reply>

More high frequency data have also been encouraging and suggest a continuation of the positive momentum into the third quarter. In particular, I would point to signs of a modest recovery in domestic demand. Personal consumption increased by 0.7 per cent in the second quarter and strong retail sales in recent months are indicative of further growth in the third quarter. We have also seen a return to growth in &lsquo;core&rsquo; (excluding planes) investment, with both construction and machinery and equipment now growing.</p><p>  There has also been a marked improvement in labour market conditions over the last year, with employment having increased in each of the last four quarters. Employment was up by 1.8 per cent in annual terms in the second quarter, representing an additional 33,800 jobs over the year. The improvement in labour market conditions has also been reflected in the unemployment rate, with a standardised unemployment rate falling to 13.3 per cent in September, having peaked at 15.1 per cent early last year.</p><p>  These indicators point to a modest recovery in the Irish economy. My Department will be publishing updated forecasts for 2013 and 2014 along with the Budget on 15 October which will take account of developments in the interim and which must be independently endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, in line with the European regulation on common provisions for monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans.  The forecasts produced by the Central Bank yesterday suggest moderate growth this year as weaker export growth drags on the headline figure, with the rate of expansion set to pick up in 2014.</p><p>  On the fiscal side, we continue to meet and exceed our budget deficit targets. It should however be noted that part of our current deficit is structural; in other words, economic recovery alone will not be sufficient to correct the deficit. However, we have made significant progress in reducing the structural deficit in recent years and most of this correction has already been done.  Ireland&rsquo;s considerable efforts in restoring our public finances to a sound footing has not only been reflected in the deficit figures but has also had significant confidence effects. Ireland&rsquo;s 10 year bond yield has fallen by over 10 percentage points since peaking in July 2011, facilitating Ireland&rsquo;s return to the market for long-term financing earlier this year. </p><p>  As Ireland&rsquo;s EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support comes to an end this year the Government&rsquo;s focus is now firmly fixed on achieving a successful and durable exit from our programme, and a full and sustainable return to the financial markets, and we are doing all we can to this end. Macroeconomic developments thus far are supportive of the projected reduction in debt and deficit in the post-programme environment.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware of the Central Bank's initiative announced last March, which set time bound and measurable targets for the main banks, requiring them to systematically address their arrears book.  This is a very important step to resolve the impasse on arrears.  The Central Bank initially required the main mortgage lenders to propose sustainable solutions to 20% of mortgages that are in arrears (of over 90 days) by end June.  The target rises to 30% by the end of September, to 50% by the end of December 2013 and 70% by end of March 2014.  The Central Bank is now also requiring banks to agree sustainable solutions with 15% of their customers by the end of this year and 25% of their customers by the end of March next year. The Central Bank has informed me that it will monitor and audit the performance of banks in relation to the targets and, crucially, will also assess whether the modifications provided are in fact sustainable solutions. </p><p>  The Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) also provides a strong protection framework for borrowers who engage with their lenders. Under the CCMA lenders are required to proactively engage with their co-operating customers in order to help them address the situation - they must carry out a full assessment of the borrower's situation based on the Standard Financial Statement and each case must be examined on its individual merits and when a lender makes a sustainable forbearance offer to a borrower, the affordability assessment of the borrower needs to be based on both their current and prospective future servicing capacity for all borrowings  Lenders are required to explore all their options and where they do not offer an alternative repayment arrangement they must inform the borrower of the reasons for this and what alternatives are available.  </p><p>  The 'Keane Report' indicated that, given the recourse nature of mortgages, personal insolvency reform and in particular the introduction of new more accessible insolvency resolution frameworks, were essential for the resolution of the mortgage arrears problem. The Personal Insolvency Act is now law and the introduction of this Act should be a catalyst to incentivise banks to reach an agreed solution with individual borrowers in resolving mortgage arrears cases. The Insolvency Service of Ireland is already dealing with the first cases that have been submitted. </p><p>  The Mortgage Advisory Service, which is an extensive independent mortgage advice framework has been put in place by the Minister for Social Protection and comprises of an enhanced website, a Mortgage Arrears information helpline, and the provision of free independent 'one-to-one' professional advice to borrowers when considering a long-term forbearance or resolution offer from their lender.  </p><p>  In addition, the Minister for Housing and Planning has put the 'mortgage-to-rent' scheme on a nationwide basis.  Protecting the home of the most distressed mortgage holders through a 'mortgage-to-rent' scheme where the ownership of the house passes to an Approved Housing Body is a key housing support for those with distressed mortgages.  The existing owner then becomes a social housing tenant.  This option is now available in appropriate cases and will be of benefit to low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable to allow the family to remain in their home.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank compiles and publishes quarterly mortgage arrears, restructures and repossession statistics for both primary domestic homes (PDH) and buy-to-let (BTL) mortgages and my Department closely monitors these statistics closely. According to these Central Bank statistics, from Q3 2009, over 2,000 PDH properties have been taken into possession by the regulated lenders to Q2 2013 inclusive.  Full details are available on the Central Bank's website at <i><font color="#0000FF">www.centralbank.ie</font></i>. </p><p>  The mortgage arrears problem is a major problem that needs to be resolved for the long term economic and social health of the country and the Government has now put in place a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, the Government recognises that SMEs are the lifeblood of the economy and will play a vital role in the recovery of employment growth in our country. One of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme.</p><p>The Government has imposed SME lending targets on AIB and Bank of Ireland for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion in 2012 and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks have reported that they achieved their 2011 and 2012 targets and the recent Credit Review Office quarterly report commented &ldquo;both banks are on track to achieve their &euro;4bn loan sanction targets, assuming the pattern of previous years of a strong Q4 performance is repeated.&rdquo;</p><p>AIB and Bank of Ireland are expected to lend to viable businesses both for investment and working capital purposes. The Credit Review Office is available to assist businesses which have been refused credit. The recent CRO report shows that the Credit Review Office upheld the credit appeal in 150 cases or 55% of cases decided. The upheld appeals have resulted in &euro;18.5m credit being made available to SMEs and farms, protecting 1,521 jobs. This shows that there is a strong prospect of success for SMEs going to the Credit Review Office and I would strongly encourage SMEs refused credit to seek a review by the Office.</p><p>Taking the data in the recent demand surveys undertaken on behalf of my Department, covering the period April 2011 to March 2013, the average success rate of SMEs in having credit applications approved or partially approved is approximately 74%. It should be noted that there has been an increase in the number of applications fully approved in successive iterations of the demand survey to date.

It is the Government&rsquo;s vision that all viable businesses operating in Ireland should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs in a manner that supports growth and employment in the economy. The working capital requirements of many SMEs, including those in the sectors referenced by the Deputy, are often fulfilled by short term credit in the form of overdrafts or short term loans.</p><p>  The Government has imposed SME lending targets on AIB and Bank of Ireland for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion in 2012 and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks have reported that they achieved their 2011 and 2012 targets and the recent Credit Review Office quarterly report commented &ldquo;both banks are on track to achieve their &euro;4bn loan sanction targets, assuming the pattern of previous years of a strong Q4 performance is repeated.&rdquo;</p><p>  AIB and Bank of Ireland are expected to lend to viable businesses both for investment and working capital purposes.

This shows that there is a strong prospect of success for SMEs going to the Credit Review Office and I would strongly encourage SMEs refused credit to seek a review by the Office. </p><p>  The Government has taken a number of actions to improve the situation in relation to credit availability to SMEs.  The credit stream available to SMEs now includes the Microenterprise Loan scheme which can facilitate up to &euro;40million in additional lending to microenterprises over the next five years.  In addition, the Credit Guarantee Scheme is designed for SMEs who, because of lack of collateral or because of the specialised sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing bank credit.  </p><p>  It is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery. However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.</p></reply>

The Quarterly National Household Survey results for the second quarter of this year showed the strongest job creation since 2008.  Encouragingly this growth consisted of both full and part-time employment and was broad based across the different sectors of the economy.  In addition, the standardised unemployment rate reduced further in September, to 13.3 per cent, which is the lowest level since March 2010, but still unacceptably high.  We must now continue to build on the progress made over the past year as there is clearly still lots to do.  I would not like to single out any one particular job creation initiative introduced by the Government over the past two and a half years, as I feel all the various initiatives have worked in unison to bring about the labour market improvement.</p><p>  For instance, the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 builds on the success of the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, by focusing on creating an environment conducive to job creation. It hopes to achieve this by:</p><p>  - Building Competitive Advantage;</p><p>  - Assisting Indigenous Business to Grow;</p><p>  - Driving Entrepreneurship and Start-Up Companies;</p><p>  - Supporting Employment at Community and Local Level;</p><p>  - Developing and Deepening the Impact of FDI; and</p><p>  - Sectoral Opportunities.</p><p>  In addition to the Action Plan for Jobs, Pathways to Work 2013, published in July, is a 50-point action plan that focuses on labour market activation and builds on the success of Pathways to work 2012.  This plan focuses on:</p><p>  - More regular and ongoing engagement with the unemployed;</p><p>  - Greater targeting of activation places and opportunities;</p><p>  - Incentivising both the take-up of opportunities and employers to provide more jobs for people who are unemployed; and</p><p>  - Reforming institutions to deliver better services to the unemployed.</p><p>  In addition to these economy-wide initiatives, the Government has also introduced sector specific initiatives aimed at job creation, for example in the tourism and hospitality sector.  The Gathering Ireland 2013, along with the Jobs Initiative of reduced VAT for the tourism and hospitality sectors, aims at &#8220;jump-starting&#8221; the tourism sector, which is employment rich and has knock-on effects for the wider economy.  Recent figures show that visitor numbers from North America, Great Britain and mainland Europe are all growing, as trips to Ireland from January to August this year increased by 6.5 per cent compared to the same period last year. Employment in accommodation and food services activities is up 8 per cent on the year to the second quarter of 2013.  So all of the initiatives are having a positive effect.  The task now is to build on this momentum.</p></reply>

Having contracted for three successive years from 2008 to 2010, the economy recorded a second successive year of growth in 2012.  This recovery has been driven by strong export growth over the period, reflecting, in part, the considerable competitiveness gains achieved in the last number of years.  Inflation in Ireland has been below or on par with that of the euro area average for every month since March 2008 and the latest Commission estimates suggests a 22 per cent improvement in unit labour cost relative to the euro area average between 2008 and 2014.</p><p>  I am however cognisant of the fact that it is improvements in the domestic economy that are of greatest concern for the Irish public.  Domestic activity contracted sharply following the bursting of the property bubble, with domestic demand decreasing significantly between 2008 and 2012.  This has had severe ramifications for the labour market with the unemployment rate increasing by around 10 percentage points over this period. </p><p>  However recent indications have been that domestic demand is stabilising and is moving on to a modest recovery path.  Personal consumption was up by 0.7 per cent in the second quarter and strong retail sales in the third quarter, along with improving consumer sentiment, bode well for the second half of the year.  We have also seen a return to growth in &lsquo;core&rsquo; (excluding planes) investment, with both construction and machinery and equipment growing in the quarter.  Perhaps most pertinently, employment has now increased in each of the last four quarters, with employment up 1.8 per cent in the second quarter, representing an additional 33,800 jobs over the year. In line with this, the standardised unemployment rate stood at 13.3 per cent in September, having fallen from a peak of 15.1 per cent early last year.  While I would again stress that more must be done to tackle the still high level of unemployment, it is clear that we are now moving in the right direction.</p></reply>

The MTES is being developed jointly by the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform in conjunction with other relevant Departments and will establish the macroeconomic strategy and policy actions for achieving sustainable economic and employment growth for the seven years to 2020. </p><p>  A key commitment in my Department's Statement of Strategy is to engage more with our stakeholders. In that context two consultation exercises in relation to the MTES were undertaken by the two Departments in September 2013 which focused on the challenges to be addressed to achieve economic growth and job creation.  The first of these was a conference in Dublin Castle on 3rd September under the auspices of the Irish Government Economic Evaluation Service (IGEES) which <i>inter alia </i>  supports Departments in evaluating policy and providing economic analysis. The IGEES event was attended by representatives of government Departments and agencies, regulators, the Central Bank of Ireland, the ESRI, the Irish Fiscal Council and academia. </p><p>  In addition, a major consultative forum took place on Tuesday 24th September 2013,  again in Dublin Castle, at which around 160 representatives of businesses and enterprises, relevant government Departments and agencies and bodies representative of business and industry participated. This forum facilitated the exchange of ideas between Government and business with a view to Ireland maximising economic growth and meeting its fiscal commitments to the year 2020 and will help to inform the preparation of the MTES. It is intended that a short paper on the outcome of the MTES Forum of 24th September will be presented by my Department to the Global Irish Network Economic Forum on 4-5 October. The Global Irish Network is a permanent network of influential Irish and Irish-connected individuals abroad that provides Ireland with a valuable resource of international expertise.</p></reply>

One aspect of this Agreement relates to supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and as both Unions that represent SNAs namely, SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to the Haddington Road Agreement, the Department has implemented supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 2013/2014 school year.  The detailed arrangements are set out in Departmental Circular 0037/2013 which issued on 1 July 2013 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address: .</p><p>  With effect from 1 May 2013 once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service is notified by his/her employer that he/she is to be made redundant then he/she shall be deemed to be a member of a Supplementary Assignment Panel for SNAs. With the exception of SNAs who have been re-employed on permanent contracts or have chosen to opt out of the panel in accordance with the terms of Paragraph 39 of the circular, all SNAs who have been made redundant since 1 May 2013 are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel.</p><p>  SNAs who were made redundant prior to 1 May 2013 are free to apply for SNA positions. However, the revised rules on SNA recruitment are as set out in Departmental Circular 37/2013, the purpose of which is to facilitate those SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant in filling SNA vacancies which become available in other schools / ETBs. Accordingly, those SNAs who are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel are afforded preferential treatment in the filling of SNA vacancies.  For the 2013/2014 school year a list of SNAs who have been deemed to be members of the Supplementary Assignment Panel will not be made or kept by the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>  Eligibility for SNA vacancies is not confined to panel members and when advertising an SNA position, a school is obliged to list any essential qualifications that are required to fill the vacancy in addition to any specific competencies and/or requirements to meet the special educational needs of the pupil(s). If an employer does not receive an application for a vacancy from an SNA who is a member of the panel or if having interviewed all such applicants, it has been established that no such applicant can meet the essential qualifications that are required to fill the vacancy in addition to all specific competencies and/or requirements to meet the special educational needs of the pupil(s) then the employer can fill its vacancy in the normal manner from all the other applicants for the vacancy.  As the LRC proposals are part of a wider public-sector pay agreement that represent compromises by both employers and unions, I do not have the ability to alter the terms of that agreement.</p></reply>

Children with autism can enrol in these early intervention classes from the age of three.  There are now some 76 early intervention classes in recognised primary and special schools and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will establish further classes where the need is identified. My Department also provides funding through the Home Tuition Scheme for children with autism who are unable to access school placements and for children from age 2.5 who are too young to enrol in an early intervention class.  In addition to the general costs of operating these classes capitation grants are paid in respect of the children enrolled.  Typically other grants are included in the annual grant payment to schools and as such are not capable of being separately identified as requested by the Deputy.</p><p>  Separately, as the Deputy will be aware, children with special needs of pre-school age are provided for through the delivery of the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which was introduced in 2010. Furthermore the HSE provides for the inclusion of children with special needs in early years settings under their auspices.</p></reply>

In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers, the delivery of new schools, together with extension projects, will be prioritised in the coming years to meet significant demographic growth.

As there will be some enabling works required, my Department has been in on-going contact with the school authorities to resolve these issues, and the project has now been approved to proceed to the next stage and the appointment of a Design Team.</p></reply>

The target savings from this budget measure is 250 posts over the 3 year period. The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities and my Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the small schools that are affected by the budget measure. The detailed arrangements in relation to the appeals process are set out in the Department's Staffing Circular 0013/2013.

The decisions in relation to such matters will be announced at budget time. The Government will endeavour to protect frontline education services as best as possible. However, this must be done within the context of bringing our overall public expenditure into line with what we can afford as a country. The challenge will be to ensure that the resources that can be provided are used to maximum effect to achieve the best possible outcome for pupils.</p><p>  I recently received the report of the Value for Money Review of Small Primary Schools and I am currently considering it. I intend to discuss the report's contents with my Government colleagues. The Report will be published in due course following this consideration process. </p></reply>

It is not possible to reverse the budget measure in relation to guidance counselling. There are no easy solutions to this challenge. This Government has protected education as much as it can. Far greater reductions in the number of public servants are being made in other sectors relative to those in schools. But there are limits on the number of teaching posts we can afford.Guidance is a whole school activity and it does not just involve the guidance counsellor. Under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students.</p><p>  Since September 2012 guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. In this way principals have discretion to balance guidance needs with the pressures to provide subject choice. A framework document was published jointly by the Post Primary Management bodies and the NAPD (National Association of Principals &amp;amp; Deputies) in September, 2012 to provide guidance for school management in the allocation of teaching hours to guidance counselling in post-primary schools in the context of the decision in Budget 2012 to withdraw the provision of ex-quota guidance hours to schools. This should be of assistance to schools in terms of how they maximise guidance provision.</p><p>  My Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations. All 195 second-level school in DEIS have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools (23:1 in fee-charging schools).</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department. </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that in June of this year, I confirmed that despite the fact that there had again been an increase in demand for resource teaching allocations this year, I had maintained the allocations for schools at the level which had applied for the 2012/13 school year. This allocation was 85% of the Special Education Review Committee (SERC) recommended resource teaching allocations.  All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013/14 school year by 15th March, 2013. </p><p>The NCSE published details of all of their initial allocations for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013/2014 school year in June of this year. These details are now available on the NCSE website, www.ncse.ie, which details the allocations made for each school on a per county basis.  The NCSE allocated 5,284 whole time equivalent resource teaching posts to schools at this point. It should be noted that 700 of these posts are allocated to post primary schools to meet High Incidence and Learning Support needs. These posts remain allocated at 100% of the recommended levels.   </p><p>  In order to meet any late demand for resource teaching support arising between 15th March, 2013 and the start of the school year, the NCSE requested all schools to submit outstanding applications for resource teaching support to the NCSE by 20th September, 2013.  The NCSE is presently processing these applications and has estimated that up to 480 additional resource teaching posts will be required to meet demand in respect of valid applications received to 20th September 2013.  If this estimate is fully realised, this would provide for a total allocation of 5,764 whole time equivalent posts.</p><p>  In order to restore resource teaching hours to the level that existed in 2011/12, which was 90% of SERC recommended resource teaching allocations, 6,062 posts would be required, which would require an additional 298 posts at an approximate additional annual cost of &euro;17.9 Million.  In order to restore resource teaching hours to the level that existed in 2010/11, which was 100% of SERC recommended resource teaching allocations, 6,657 posts would be required, which would require an additional 893 posts at an approximate additional annual cost of &euro;53.5 Million.</p></reply>

Since the beginning of 2011 alone the numbers employed in the public service have fallen by more than 15,000.  While this level of reduction has posed challenges across many areas, frontline services have been protected and in parallel there has been real and permanent reform of service delivery models to the benefit of citizens and businesses.  </p><p>  Redeployment has been an important enabler of this managed reduction of public service numbers.  Since 2010 more than 10,000 surplus staff have been redeployed into areas considered a priority e.g. Garda Vetting.  Moreover, in order to strengthen the redeployment process, the Haddington Road Agreement provides for revisions to the redeployment arrangements to ensure more flexible and faster redeployment both within and across sectors. This should further improve the flow of staff across the public service and ensure that suitably skilled staff are available to meet the identified organisational, operational and business needs of public service organisations.</p></reply>

It is also my understanding that talks aimed at resolving the dispute have been scheduled since the start of this week and I welcome this development.  Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial relations issues lies ultimately with employers and workers and their respective representatives as appropriate.</p><p>  The State provides industrial relations mechanisms to assist parties in their efforts to resolve any differences they may have. I would urge the parties involved in this dispute to have regard to the availability of the industrial relations dispute resolution bodies to assist them in seeking a settlement and in addressing the underlying challenge of a major restructuring of the company.  Experience constantly shows us that what often appears to be the most intractable of matters is capable of resolution where both sides engage constructively and in good faith in this voluntary process.  The principle of good faith implies that both sides make every effort to reach an agreement and endeavour, through genuine and constructive negotiations, to resolve their differences.</p></reply>

The Forfas report &ldquo;Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2012&rdquo; published earlier this year, examined costs of doing business here and identified the relative importance of different areas of cost for different business sectors.  The report indicates that business costs in Ireland have reduced significantly in recent years, with overall price levels in the economy falling back to levels last experienced in 2002. The improvement in business cost competitiveness has been driven by significant reductions in property related costs (in terms of purchase and rent levels) and falling prices across a range of professional and business services. There have also been relative improvements in labour costs in Ireland which fell on average by 0.9% per annum in the period 2008-2011, while labour costs increased in the euro area by 4.6% per annum on average in the same period.  However, while these improvements are very welcome and indicate that the economy is moving in the right direction, we must continue to focus on actions to promote further cost reductions across the economy. The Forfas report makes a number of recommendations aimed at further improving our cost competitiveness position in relation to labour, property, transport, utility and professional services costs.</p><p>  Part of the objective of the Action Plan for Jobs has been the development of proposals each year that can improve our competitiveness.  The 2013 Action Plan includes a number of specific actions in this regard which address some of the areas highlighted in the Forfas report.  The implementation of these Action Plan measures, combined with the Government&rsquo;s broader agenda to enhance productivity, will play a key role in improving our competitiveness and realising our ambition of making Ireland the best small country in which to do business.</p></reply>

That Department organised and chaired a Working and Retirement Forum in Croke Park last December, at which a range of stakeholder groups, including employer and employee representative organisations, discussed issues around the ending of the State Pension (Transition) from January 2014.  The Group is currently considering the issues highlighted at the Croke Park Forum and is preparing preliminary proposals in this regard.</p><p>  Statutory law permits private sector workers to work past the age of 65, as there is no statutory retirement age for such employees in Ireland.  However, a contract of employment may contain a retirement age.  The existence of a clause in the employment contract setting out a maximum retirement age is a matter of contract between the employer and employee.  As matters currently stand for those employees who are obliged by their contract of employment to retire at 65 years but will not receive the State pension until 66 years, the Department of Social Protection has indicated that, in terms of financial supports, social welfare benefits will continue to be available to the age of 66 for those who are contractually obliged to leave employment.  Also, existing legislation provides that jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66, subject to the person having paid 156 or more qualifying contributions and satisfying the general scheme conditions.</p><p>  The Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2011, which aim to protect against discrimination in relation to access to employment on a number of grounds including age and give effect in national law to the EU Directive 2000/78/EC, come within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Justice, Mr Alan Shatter T.D.  The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has made rulings in a series of age-discrimination cases concerning Directive 2000/78/EC which prohibit discrimination in employment and occupation on various grounds, including age.  The CJEU has clarified that, under Directive 2000/78/EC, mandatory retirement ages may be set down if, within the context of national law, they are objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate social policy aim.</p></reply>

Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world class physical and digital infrastructure as well as the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.  IDA Ireland, however tries to influence these choices by prioritising the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass with sufficient scale of population, skills, infrastructure, companies, business services, etc. and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  With continuing enhancement and improvements in physical and digital infrastructure, an FDI project secured for one Gateway can have a positive impact on other Gateways and their surrounding areas.  It must be acknowledged, that the decision on where a client company will locate a new FDI investment is ultimately made by senior managers of the companies involved.</p><p>  A number of locations outside of Dublin and the main urban centres already facilitate the presence of a large number of multinational companies who have invested over the years, span multiple sectors and employ significant amounts of people.  The primary opportunity for attracting FDI to such regional locations lies with existing clients and the potential further investment opportunities from this base as approximately 70% of all FDI investments won by IDA is from the existing client base.  At the end of 2012 there were 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kerry employing 1,600 people.</p><p>  I am determined to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for foreign direct investment. In winning such investments, I am, however, mindful of the need to address the concerns that have been expressed to me by Deputies on all sides of the House about the relatively low level of site visits to certain regional locations. I have, accordingly, requested IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to work with my Department so that we can explore what further initiatives we can take to ensure we have a better approach to enterprise development in regional locations.  This exercise will complement the in-depth analysis of our FDI strategy which is currently being undertaken.  This analysis, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, the changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that will be introduced in 2014 and our approach to regional development will inform the formulation of an appropriate FDI strategy for the period post 2014.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-10-03a.355.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013100300060#WRO02100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 to 132, inclusive, together.</p><p>It should be noted that there is no statutory compulsory retirement age for employees in Ireland.  Responsibility for setting retirement age is a matter for the employer/employee relationship and the contract of employment.  It should also be noted that individuals who are awarded a State pension contributory  at age 66 can continue to work,  whereas one of the qualifying conditions of State pension transition requires the person to be retired from work.  The numbers in receipt of State pensions has been increasing significantly in line with demographic projections. This can be seen in the number of people qualifying for State pensions over the last five years as set out in the following table:</p><p><table><tr><th><b>No of recipients </b></th><th><b>2008</b></th><th><b>2009</b></th><th><b>2010</b></th><th><b>2011</b></th><th><b>2012</b></th></tr><tr><td>State Pension Transition </td><td>7,242</td><td>8,378</td><td>10,206</td><td>12,110</td><td>14,372</td></tr><tr><td>State Pensions Contributory</td><td>250,117</td><td>265,102</td><td>280,419</td><td>296,995</td><td>312,332</td></tr></table></p><p>In relation to supports for employers and employees in the private and public sector,  my  Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.welfare.ie</i>, provides comprehensive information on all the Department&rsquo;s schemes and services as well as a range of online services which include online claiming for State pension contributory, household benefits, child benefit, jobseeker&rsquo;s payments, widow(er)&rsquo;s and surviving civil partner&rsquo;s contributory pension and redundancy payments and insolvency payments.</p><p>The objective is to enable people to access services at a time and place that best suits their needs.  The use of online application forms reduces the administrative burden for the customer and facilitates efficient processing of claims by the Department.  Furthermore, my Department operates a network of some 125 social welfare local and branch offices throughout the country.  Each local office has dedicated information officers providing information on all the Department&rsquo;s schemes and services and who are available to assist with the completion of application forms where required.</p><p>The nationwide network of over 200 Citizens Information Centres also offers a drop-in service where callers can meet information providers face-to-face. Staff in these centres offer information, advice and advocacy to individuals on a wide range of public and social services, including the Social Welfare Appeals process.  I am satisfied that assistance and support is available to customers in advance of retirement, and indeed at all times, through my Department&rsquo;s offices and  through the Citizens Information Centres. This  enables them to access my Departments schemes and services in a timely and effective manner that best meets their needs.</p><p>The number of those retired from the public sector is a matter for the Minister for Public Service and Reform and I understand the Minister is responding directly to the Deputy in this regard. In relation to my own Department, the number of staff who have retired and the number who availed of pre-retirement courses over the past five years is shown in the following table.</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Year</b></th><th><b>No. retired</b></th><th><b>No of attendees at retirement course </b></th></tr><tr><td><b>2009</b></td><td><b>252</b></td><td><b>91</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>2010</b></td><td><b>95</b></td><td><b>34</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>2011</b></td><td><b>111</b></td><td><b>163</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>2012</b></td><td><b>292</b></td><td><b>66</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>2013</b></td><td><b>73</b></td><td><b>26 (to date)</b></td></tr></table></p><p>In terms of support for staff retiring from my own Department, all staff within the Department who are nearing retirement are offered a three day pre-retirement training course for themselves and their spouses/partners, currently provided by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. In addition, estimates of retirement benefits are made available to staff on request.  The training course deals with areas such as finance, pensions, legal matters, lifestyle, health, diet and other related topics which are presented by subject matter experts. The aim of the course is to provide assistance and specialised information to the retiree during this time of great change in their lives and help assist them to prepare for an active and enjoyable retirement.</p><p>Although not all staff avail of the option, the feedback received from those who do is very positive as it enables them to obtain important information, share ideas with other attendees and gives them a positive step in preparation for retirement. I am satisfied that any staff planning for retirement are offered the opportunity to avail of this service and that will continue to be the case.</p></reply>

Once fulfilment of those conditions is achieved, there are a number of additional payments that may be available to recipients in certain circumstances.  One such payment is the increase for qualified adult which is payable once the financially dependent adult satisfies a means test.   </p><p>  The decision to transfer or dispose of income or property is entirely a matter for the individual concerned.  However, where a Deciding Officer notes that a transfer of assets (income or property) has occurred by a person in respect of whom a means tested increase for qualified adult is being claimed, s/he will carefully consider all of the facts and circumstances of the individual case.  This includes requesting any necessary documentation or evidence in order to determine if that person has directly or indirectly deprived themselves of any income or property in order to qualify for or to improve the weekly rate payable.  If evidence in this regard is found, the payment will not be awarded or will be ceased.   </p><p>  Under the provisions of the governing legislation, an individual is not permanently disentitled.  If a significant change in circumstances is reported to the Department, this will be examined.  Each case is examined on its own merits taking all of the circumstances of the case into account.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-10-03a.369.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013100300061#WRP00900"><p>Increasing the State pension age and the abolition of the State pension (transition) are steps that have been taken to ensure the sustainability of pensions into the future.  The decision to reform the State pension was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  The State pension age will then increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.   </p><p>  It should be noted that until the 1970s, the standard age for receipt of State pension was 70 years of age.  This applied at a time when longevity was much lower and working patterns were more likely to be physically demanding.  State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension and was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.  Overtime, the age for State pension contributory was reduced to 66 years.   </p><p>  I am aware that there are concerns in relation to this matter.  However, the Deputy may wish to note that a significant number of people coming on to State Pension transition in 2012 did not come from work as many were already on other social welfare schemes well in advance of State pension transition age.  In December 2012 there were approximately 14,400 State pension (transition) claims in payment and of those, 12.5 per cent came from work with over 50 per cent coming from other social welfare schemes such as illness benefit, jobseeker's benefit and assistance, invalidity and carers indicating that significant numbers of people are leaving the workforce for a variety of reasons well in advance of State pension age. </p><p>  In terms of social welfare supports available to those at age 65 who are unable to remain in the workforce, the main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker's benefit.  Persons who qualify for a jobseeker's benefit who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).  All short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66.  I will keep this matter under review.</p><p>  It should be noted there is no statutory compulsory retirement age for employees in Ireland.  Responsibility for setting retirement age is a matter for the employer/employee relationship and the contract of employment.  However, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has made rulings in a series of age-discrimination cases concerning Directive 2000/78/EC, which prohibit work-related discrimination on various grounds, including age.  The CJEU has clarified that mandatory retirement ages may be set down by employers within the context of national law, whether by contract, custom and practice or other means, which must be objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate social policy aim, with the means of achieving that aim being both appropriate and necessary.  Consideration of these issues as they relate to enterprise and equality policy come within the respective remit of the Minster for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Justice and Equality. </p><p>  An interdepartmental Working and Retirement Group was initiated to consider the cross departmental policy issues arising and thereby improve the sustainability and adequacy of pensions systems.  The interdepartmental group, established in August 2012, is chaired by the Department of Social Protection, and includes representatives from the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Pensions Board.  Further engagement has also been undertaken with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health and Children and work in this regard is ongoing.</p><p>  The recently published OECD report on the Review of the Irish Pension System confirms that reforms are necessary if we are to continue to put pension provision on a sustainable footing given the changes in demographics, the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund, and the difficult fiscal situation.</p></reply>

There are no plans to change these arrangements.  The cost of the OFP scheme was &euro;1.06 billion in 2012 and is currently estimated to be &euro;935 million for 2013.  The reduction in expenditure on the scheme is as a result of all of the scheme reforms, including the reduction in the age limit of the youngest child for receipt of OFP.  Overturning the reforms that have been made to the scheme, including the restoration of the age limit of the youngest child at which a recipient's payment ceases to 18 years, would restore expenditure on the scheme to approximately &euro;1 billion <i>per annum</i>.   </p></reply>

To qualify for payment, a person must satisfy certain conditions, including the requirement to be available for and genuinely seeking full-time work.  The relevant legislation specifically excludes students who are attending a full-time day course of study from entitlement under the schemes.  Other educational situations, including online degree courses, are examined individually to determine if the conditions of the scheme are satisfied.  Factors considered in this context include whether the course is full-time or part-time and the overall level of commitment required from the course participant in terms of time and cost.  </p><p>  The level of commitment required to participate in a full-time course of education is not usually consistent with the requirement to be available for full-time employment.

However, during the course of 2013 the Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System (PASS), which commenced operation in Dublin in 2011, is being extended nationally.  When PASS is fully implemented nationally it will provide good quality, timely data which will allow housing authorities to report in relation to the on-going extent and the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed. </p><p>  In advance of the full implementation of PASS the most complete set of data available in relation to homelessness nationally is the Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s special Census report, Homeless Persons in Ireland, which was published on 6 September 2012.  This report indicated that a total of 65 individuals were sleeping rough on Census night, 10 April 2011, while identifying a further 3,743 people as housed in accommodation defined as emergency, transitional or long-term.  Of the total of 3,808 individuals included in the report, almost 60% were in long-term or transitional housing arrangements.</p><p>  From 1 February 2013, all residential rented accommodation is required to have its own separate sanitary facilities in accordance with the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008.  This has resulted in the phasing-out of the traditional &ldquo;bed-sit&rdquo;, where sanitary facilities are shared between different rental units.  The Regulations allowed a four year phasing in period to facilitate landlords with the time either adequately to meet the revised minimum standards or to remove unsuitable accommodation from the rental market.  Most landlords affected by these changes engaged with their tenants during this time to discuss the implications of any works that needed to be carried out on their properties and took steps to bring their accommodation into line with the new standards.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the private rented residential sector contains a sufficiently large stock of decent housing and of good landlords to ensure that those previously renting accommodation at the lowest end of the market can still be accommodated within that market but in better quality accommodation and that these Regulations should not contribute to an increase in homelessness.</p></reply>

On 18 July 2013, the Government approved the introduction of HAP. Approval was also given for the provision of funding to the local authorities to cover the costs of accommodating HAP claimants and administering the new Scheme. </p><p>  My Department and the Department of Social Protection are continuing to work closely on the legal, policy and operational issues involved in the development and introduction of HAP. Work has also continued on developing the business processes required to allow for a general scheme of a Housing Bill (providing for HAP) to be prepared for Government consideration this year.   </p><p>  My Department is also working closely with County and City Managers in overseeing plans for the implementation of HAP, but more specifically at this stage in relation to the test phase which is planned for 2014 (subject to the enactment of the relevant legislation). A Project Implementation Team has also been established, which will be responsible for detailed planning and implementation during the testing and roll-out phases. A detailed business process design exercise for HAP involving input from all the relevant key stakeholders is currently being finalised and once complete the implementation team will, in conjunction with my Department, develop a plan for testing the scheme in a number of local authorities in 2014 with full roll out of the scheme to follow once the test phase is complete.</p></reply>

I am informed that the Chief Information Officer (CIO) in Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is considering the introduction of a single number such as is used for emergency services in places such as New York and is engaged in consultation about a strategy to allow citizens improved digital access to all services. The Department and its agencies would have a part to play should the CIO come forward with proposals but would not be independently examining developments in this area.</p><p>While no entity falling under the remit of my Department operates a three digit 24/7 non-emergency contact number of the type set out by the Deputy, my Department has undertaken some targeted initiatives in this area. The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) operates a number of helplines to facilitate clients in making enquiries in relation to immigration and citizenship issues.  These helplines are provided between certain set periods each week.  The periods for which the helplines operate strikes a balance between facilitating customers in making queries to INIS and the overall priority of ensuring that immigration and citizenship applications are processed as quickly as possible.  Any widening of the periods of operation of the helplines would divert scarce resources away from case processing which would be contrary to the best interests of customers.</p><p>Since 2005, the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime has allocated just over &euro;700,000 in funding to the Crime Victims Helpline.  The Helpline is a confidential national helpline run by a team of trained volunteers. The main role of the organisation is to take calls from members of the public who are victims of crime and to respond to the caller's needs by providing appropriate information, referral to a relevant support organisation, emotional support and other responses according to the caller's needs.  They can be contacted on by means of a freephone number 116 066 during the following hours:</p><p><table><tr><th>Day</th><th>Time</th></tr><tr><td>Monday </td><td>10am - 7.30pm</td></tr><tr><td>Tuesday to Friday </td><td>10.00am. - 5.00pm</td></tr><tr><td>Saturday </td><td>2.00pm to 4.00pm</td></tr><tr><td>Bank Holidays </td><td>2.00pm - 4.00pm</td></tr></table></p><p>Outside those hours if a member of the public leaves a message asking the helpline to contact them they will do so promptly.  Due to lack of financial resources it is not possible to implement a 24/7 helpline.</p><p>There are also national help-lines available for victims of domestic and sexual violence.  These help-lines are provided with the assistance of state funding through the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The sexual violence helpline is provided by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and is provided on a 24/7 basis.  The national domestic violence help-line is provided by Women's Aid and operates from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. The decision to operate the domestic violence help-line on a 12 hour basis is, I understand, one that was made by Women's Aid on the basis of its experience of need and effectiveness.</p><p>In the European context, the EU is committed to establishing a series of help-line numbers beginning with 116 for crime victims, such as the 116 006 victims help-line, rather than a one for all number.</p></reply>

The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012 and expects to receive in the region of 350,000 applications by the end of 2013. </p><p>  Garda Vetting Disclosures are predicated on the signed authorisation of a vetting subject for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to disclose to the registered organisation &ldquo;details of all prosecutions, successful or not, pending or completed, and/or convictions which may be recorded in respect of them in the State or elsewhere&rdquo;; or alternatively that there are &ldquo;no prosecutions or convictions recorded in respect of them&rdquo;.  The disclosure is made to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued.  </p><p>  Each time a new vetting application is received, a full vetting check is conducted to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. The non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the certificate protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service. It also affords the registered organisation the facility to assess suitability based on the most up to date information available on the applicant. The Deputy will appreciate that the safety of children and vulnerable adults is the primary consideration and this must remain the case.</p><p>  It is essential that the GCVU has the resources required to perform this most critical of roles effectively and I have given this matter particular priority. In that regard I have been actively engaged with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. As a result of that engagement, I am pleased to say that the Commissioner has confirmed to me that there are now 134 whole-time equivalent staff (130 civilians and 4 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na) assigned to the GCVU, some 41 of whom have been redeployed from elsewhere in the public service since the end of March 2013. Some of these redeployed staff have only recently completed their training in the vetting process, and the full impact of their work will be seen in the coming weeks. Furthermore, I have also recently received sanction for the redeployment of 40 additional staff to the GCVU. This brings the total number of staff in that service to over 170 which, when compared to the average staff allocation of 78 at the Unit over the past two and a half years, represents an increase of 117%.</p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current average processing time for applications is now approximately 9 weeks from date of receipt. However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion. Nevertheless this is a significant improvement on the processing time of 14 weeks which existed in July this year. In the interest of fairness and equity, Garda vetting applications are processed in chronological order based on the date of receipt in the GCVU and all organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.</p><p>  Development of an e-Vetting solution is underway. This will facilitate the processing of all applications in an e-format, thus removing the time-consuming current process of manually managing all applications received . The initial phase of testing this e-vetting system will take place in the fourth quarter of 2013.  When this is achieved, this system will streamline the overall vetting process in this jurisdiction, and further contribute to reductions in processing times for all vetting applications.</p></reply>

Some of these redeployed staff have only recently completed their training in the vetting process, and the full impact of their work will be seen in the coming weeks. Furthermore, I have also recently received sanction for the redeployment of 40 additional staff to the GCVU.  This brings the total number of staff in that service to over 170 which, when compared to the average staff allocation of 78 at the Unit over the past two and a half years, represents an increase of 117%.  </p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current average processing time for applications is now approximately 9 weeks from date of receipt. However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  Nevertheless this is a significant improvement on the processing time of 14 weeks which existed in July this year.  In the interest of fairness and equity, Garda vetting applications are processed in chronological order based on the date of receipt in the GCVU and all organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.  </p><p>  Development of an e-Vetting solution is also underway.  This will facilitate the processing of all applications in an e-format, thus removing the time-consuming current process of manually managing all applications received.  The initial phase of testing this e-vetting system will take place in the fourth quarter of 2013.  When this is achieved, this system will streamline the overall vetting process in this jurisdiction, and further contribute to reductions in processing times for all vetting applications.</p></reply>

In recent years the maximum penalty for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority has been increased from one to five years, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also now have an extended power of search without warrant in relation to knives and offensive weapons.  </p><p>  At an operational level,  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na pro-actively target public disorder and anti-social behaviour, including knife related crime through the strategic deployment of Garda resources.  In this regard, areas identified as public order hot-spots by local Garda management are the subject of additional foot and mobile patrols.  In addition, Detective Units and Divisional Crime Task Forces may be utilised to provide a high visibility presence in areas such as late night bars, clubs etc, particularly when people are exiting, to deter and detect anti-social behaviour and possible altercations. However, it should be noted that many knife crimes occur in domestic settings and often with a degree of spontaneity, which increases the challenges for preventative policing and enforcement.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>  In relation to the investigation of specific knife-related crimes, I am assured that all appropriate resources, including any necessary technical and forensic facilities are employed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to secure detections and identify perpetrators of these crimes.  The Deputy will be aware that persons have been charged in connection with a number of the recent fatal stabbing incidents. </p><p>  In addition to these enforcement measures, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are involved in a number of awareness measures relating to knife crime, and I understand that the Garda Schools Programme and the Dublin Metropolitan Region Teenagers and Garda&iacute; Programmes are utilised and include talks on knives and other weapons for secondary school pupils, emphasising the dangers involved and the need for care, vigilance and social responsibility.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the vehicles purchased for use as mobile offices are being re-deployed for other Garda purposes. </p><p>  Overall, the Garda authorities have indicated that the Garda operational arrangements in place throughout the country are sufficient to ensure the continued delivery of a comprehensive policing service to all communities.  In addition they have confirmed that these arrangements will be kept under on-going review.</p></reply>

Furthermore, in both 2012 and 2011, Chinese nationals accounted for 11% of total visa applications, the third largest number of visa applications from a single country.  I can also advise the Deputy that in 2012 the approval rate for visa applications of Chinese Nationals was 96%, an increase from 93% in 2010.</p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that China is one of the seventeen countries covered by the Visa Waiver Programme which allows certain categories of visitor to the UK, including tourists, to travel on to Ireland without the need for an Irish visa. Information provided by Tourism Ireland to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department indicates that since the introduction of the visa waiver programme, new Tour Operator Programmes alone have contributed to an additional 6,000 Chinese nationals travelling to Ireland.   </p><p>  In relation to the United Kingdom, there is close cooperation between the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration service of my Department and the UK Home Office and I regularly discuss with both the UK's Home Secretary and Minister for Immigration matters relating to the operation and oversight of the Common Travel Area arrangement. In that context and building on success of the Irish Visa Waiver Programme, work is continuing in partnership with the UK Home Office on the development of short-stay CTA visa arrangements which would allow tourists and business visitors to travel to the CTA, with first arrival in either jurisdiction, and thereafter to travel freely throughout the CTA. The intention is that Chinese nationals will be among the principal beneficiaries of these arrangements.  I have no plans at this time to introduce any form of bond for visa applicants from any country.</p></reply>

The Visa Waiver Programme allows persons from seventeen designated countries to travel to Ireland on the basis of a UK visa and it has proved very effective in attracting increased numbers of visitors from emerging tourist markets. </p><p>  As visitors to Ireland availing of the Visa Waiver Programme do not need an Irish visa, the statistical data requested by the Deputy is not collected by my Department.  However, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department has been advised by Tourism Ireland that the total number of trips to Ireland of residents of countries covered by the programme increased by approximately 38% in the 18 months after the programme was introduced.  In addition, in relation to China and India alone, Tourism Ireland advises that some 55 new tour operator programmes to Ireland have been developed as a result of the introduction of the waiver programme. These programmes alone have contributed to over 13,000 additional visitors to Ireland from India and China.</p><p>  Building on success of the Programme, work is continuing in partnership with the UK Home Office on the development of short-stay CTA visa arrangements which would allow tourists and business visitors to travel to the CTA, with first arrival in either jurisdiction, and thereafter to travel freely throughout the CTA. It is planned for the rollout of such a visa arrangements to commence in 2014.  Prior to its introduction, the necessary technical and operational arrangements, including the capture of biometric data (fingerprints) in electronic format for visa applicants, need to be put in place between the two jurisdictions.  The operation of the Irish short-stay Visa Waiver Programme will be kept under review in the context of the introduction of Common Travel Area visa arrangements with the UK.</p></reply>

The conditions are that the applicant must:</p><p>  - be of full age</p><p>  - be of good character</p><p>  - have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years</p><p>  - intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and</p><p>  - have, <font color="#212100">before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows:</font></p><p><font color="#212100">  (i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and</font></p><p><font color="#212100">  (ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.</font></p><p>  A foreign national who is married to, or is the Civil Partner of, an Irish citizen for at least three years may apply for naturalisation under section 15A of the Irish Naturalisation and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, where they have been continuously resident in the island of Ireland for the year immediately prior to the date of their application and for two out of the four years prior to that year.  The marriage or civil partnership must be subsisting and recognised under Irish law. Section 15A provides that the Minister may waive certain conditions for naturalisation if satisfied that the applicant would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship.</p><p>  Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, waive some or all of the statutory conditions in certain circumstances i.e. where an applicant is of Irish descent or of Irish associations; where an applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; or where an applicant is a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless persons.

I can, however, confirm that the person concerned has, in recent weeks, provided further documentation. The Deputy can be assured that this documentation, together with all other information and documentation on file, will be fully considered in advance of a final decision being made. </p><p><i>The person concerned is a failed asylum applicant. Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 31st October, 2000, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making written representations to the then Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him. While written representations were submitted by and on behalf of the person concerned, no final decision was made in the case at that time.</i></p><p><i>Given that there was no further contact from or on behalf of the person concerned for some considerable time, it was taken that he had left the State and, as such, no further consideration was given to his case file. However, his case file was re-activated in May, 2008 when correspondence was received from his then legal representative indicating that further representations would be submitted. No further representations were submitted at that time. However, in June 2013, the legal representative of the person concerned made contact with this Department and, as a result, his case file has been re-activated. </i></p><p><i>The position in the State of the person concerned will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made.

There are currently 4,414 persons seeking international protection residing in 34 Direct Provision accommodation centres across 16 counties under contract to RIA.  Of these residents, approximately a third are children under the age of 18.</p><p>  I should firstly commend to the Deputy RIA's 2012 Annual Report available on its website - www.ria.gov.ie - which  includes greater detail than before on family make up in centres as well as additional information on facilities for children in each of the centres involved.</p><p> The Direct Provision system is unique and there is no direct comparison with other types of accommodation where children would reside, be they houses with gardens or apartment buildings. Some accommodation centres have more outdoor and indoor facilities than others.  However, any suggestions that children in these centres do not have opportunities for meaningful recreation activities are wide of the mark. Further details are available in the Report mentioned above. Of the current 34 asylum centres in RIA's portfolio, only 3 were specifically built for the sole purpose of accommodating asylum seekers, that is, they were 'purpose-built'.  All other centres must operate within the physical limitations of the premises' original use e.g. hotel, college dormitory, hostel, etc.  While all conform, at the very least, to minimum contractual and legislative standards, there are necessarily a range of facilities available in centres in the overall RIA portfolio, deriving from their original use.</p><p>  RIA and centre management work with local schools, community groups, sports clubs and NGO's to link children and families into community initiatives, sports and other activities to ensure access to the best available package of services. Children of asylum seekers can access recreational facilities available in the locality in which they are living.  Some Direct Provision Centres have on-site playgrounds.  Many centres will also facilitate NGO&rsquo;s who organise outings etc. Centres also have links with local community facilities which allow for free and discounted access to amenities outside of the accommodation centre.</p><p>  It is worth noting that asylum seeker children benefit from access to primary and secondary education on the same basis as Irish citizen children in the local community, and both schools and the Community Welfare Service are very supportive of those children in assisting with any associated costs in respect of equipment and transport. An exemption from fees for State Examinations is also available to asylum seekers who are holders of medical cards. Homework clubs and quiet spaces are provided in family centres to facilitate children doing their homework. </p><p>  On-site pre-school services are available in some of the larger direct provision centres. However, in all cases parents may opt to send their children to privately run pre-schools in the community. The Early Child Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme provides for free pre-school placements to all children, including children of asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation. </p></reply>

The person named was selected for a ground inspection which took place on 8 May 2012.

Payments in respect of the 2012 Scheme year are subject to a similar administrative checking process which includes verification of capital investments through checks on receipts.

This inspection identified discrepancies between the area declared and found resulting in an over-declaration in area of greater than 20%. Based on the terms and conditions of the scheme this results in no payment in respect of 2013.

Participants were required to attend a prescribed number of discussion group meetings or approved national events, in addition to completing two tasks, chosen from a menu of eight designed to enhance on-farm efficiency. The broad range of available task options allowed participants to choose those best suited to the business needs and particular characteristics of their beef enterprises.</p><p>  The person named did not qualify for payment because he failed to satisfactorily complete one of two selected tasks &ndash; the task related to the completion of a herd health plan in consultation with a veterinary practitioner. Participants who chose that task were required to join the Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) eradication programme, a condition of which was that herd owners had to submit tissue samples from all calves born on their holdings in 2012 to one of a number of designated laboratories. Task completion was verified by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) which maintains a database of laboratory results on behalf of Animal Health Ireland. Information received from ICBF indicated that the herd owner in question did not sample any animal born in 2012. While the calves born in 2012 were BVD-tested in January 2013, this does not meet the Task requirement for the 2012 Programme.</p><p>  It is the responsibility of participants and their facilitators to familiarise themselves with the Programme Terms and Conditions and with the consequences for breaches of the rules. In applying for the BTAP, farmers undertook to comply with the Terms and Conditions of the Programme and accepted that failure to abide by the rules could result in a loss of payment. It was determined following appeal that the individual concerned failed to fully comply with the BTAP Terms and Conditions and, accordingly, no payment is possible in this case. The person named has been notified of the decision in writing.</p></reply>

Approximately 68,000 children availed of the provision in 2012.  In line with the Programme for Government, I succeeded in maintaining the universality of the free pre-school year, including securing an additional funding requirement of &euro;9.8m in 2012 to address increased demand due to an increase in births since 2009.</p><p>  There is an increasing body of Irish and International evidence which quantify the benefits of early year&rsquo;s interventions in terms of improving children&rsquo;s outcomes and in delivering significant economic and societal return to the state. I this context I believe the introduction of a second year would benefit children&rsquo;s educational and developmental outcomes as well as proving significantly beneficial to children with special needs. In addition a second pre-school year would represent &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,000 worth of free childcare to parents and likely generate 4,000-5,000 new positions, albeit mostly part-time. The benefits of introducing a second year were further referred to in the OECD reports on Ireland published last week.</p><p>  However, the introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding, with the additional cost broadly in line with the cost of the current one year provision, which is &euro;175 million.  This funding is not currently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is currently operating.  However I would hope that this proposal is one which Government could continue to work towards as our public finances recover.</p><p>  In the meantime, I am progressing a Pre-School Quality Agenda involving a range of actions in eight key areas, aimed at improving quality within early years services and enhancing the regulatory regime.  I see this agenda as a key building block for any further extensive of universal childcare provision, including any proposal to introduce a second free pre-school year.  Future developments relating to early years care and education have been considered during preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy which will be published later this year.</p></reply>

Recognising the shortcomings in child care services which have been identified in Reports in recent years ( Ryan, Roscommon) this reform programme is aimed at strengthening the organisational capacity, business processes and systems  necessary to deliver safe and reliable child protection services.  </p><p>  One element of this programme involves a national review of all residential services including National High Support and Special Care Services which has been commissioned by the National Director. This national review is being implemented under the direction of the newly appointed Service Director for Children's Residential Services and the incoming Chief Operations Officer for Children and Family Services.  The HSE has a statutory responsibility to provide Alternative Care Services under the provisions the <i>Child Care Act, 1991</i>, <i>the Children Act, 2001</i> and the <i>Child Care (Amendment) Act, 2007</i>.  Children who require admission to care are accommodated through placement in foster care, placement with relatives, or residential care.  The HSE also has a responsibility to provide Aftercare services. </p><p>   The process is encompassing a comprehensive review of current capacity, current demand, occupancy levels, statutory and regulatory compliance and manpower management. The purpose of the review is to establish a fit for purpose national, standardised residential service which is fully integrated with all other Children and Family Services locally and nationally and which has the capacity and resources to meet anticipated demand.  The HSE has advised that the review will be completed in Q1 2014.</p></reply>

In line with the Programme for Government, I  have made a very significant commitment to maintaining the pre-school year on a universal and free basis despite the budgetary situation.  The free pre-school provision represents an annual investment in the region of &euro;175 million with standard capitation of &euro;2,375 being paid to service providers for each eligible child enrolled in their service. There is no further funding currently available to my Department to provide for any increased payments to services participating in the ECCE programme. </p><p>  It has always been the case that services opting to participate in the programme meet the cost of providing the pre-school year, including the costs of meeting the statutory entitlement of employees to paid leave, from the capitation provided.  It is a matter for each participating service to manage its business affairs including how the service aligns itself with the provisions of the programme.</p></reply>

It is not the intention of Government to legalise the use of cannabis.  Notwithstanding the Government&rsquo;s reluctance to loosen the controls on cannabis generally, Department officials have engaged with experts on how authorised cannabis-based medicinal products for patients may be legally prescribed by medical practitioners and used by patients suffering from Multiple Sclerosis in Ireland.  Draft Regulations amending the Misuse of Drugs Regulations were prepared, including amendments necessary to enable cannabis-based medicinal product Sativex to be prescribed in Ireland.</p><p>  In order to obtain input from stakeholders and interested parties on the text of these Draft Regulations, the proposed amending text and an explanatory document were published on the Department's website inviting written submissions.  The deadline for submissions was Friday 6th September.  Over 90 submissions were received and are currently being reviewed by my Department.  Arising from the consultation process, the Draft Orders and Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Regulations will be submitted to Government seeking the Government's approval to notify them to the EU Commission and Member States under the Technical Standards Directive.  At the end of the 3 month EU notification period, Government's approval will be sought to make the relevant Order.  It is anticipated that the new Regulations will be introduced early next year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-10-03a.708.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013100300066#WRDD00800"><p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for each local authority.  The application for INTERREG IVA funding by Louth County Council and its partners was for &euro;17.4m.  This amount was approved by the SEUPB.  Financial contributions were sought from my Department and the Northern Ireland Department of Finance &amp;amp; Personnel on the basis of this figure, with any balance to be funded by Louth County Council.  The funding which was to be provided by my Department for the Narrow Water Bridge Project represented a significant commitment given the current financial circumstances and the fact that the project did not perform well in cost benefit analyses from a transport perspective.</p><p>  On 9th July Louth County Council released a statement indicating that the tenders received ranged from &euro;26m to &euro;40m plus VAT which was substantially above the allocated budget for the project and leaving the Council with a substantial funding shortfall.  The Council also stated that while they would try to see if the shortfall could be filled through any combination of additional funding and cost reductions the project had been put on hold.  Unfortunately, on the basis of the tender prices received, the cost of the project is well beyond that projected and bridging the shortfall is very difficult.  Furthermore the increased cost of the project now has significantly reduced the Benefit to Cost Ratio associated with this project. </p><p>  I understand that the Special EU Programmes Body has been in discussion with Louth County Council and its project partners in relation to the financial viability and deliverability of the scheme.  This is to be expected given the scale of the cost increase.  It is a matter for the SEUPB, taking account of its responsibilities in relation to the allocation of INTERREG IVA funding, to assess the position and satisfy itself as to the deliverability of the project.  As part of this process SEUPB sought clarifications and additional information from the project partners which it is now assessing.  No formal proposal has been made by Louth County Council to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on increasing the Department&rsquo;s funding contribution.  Due to budget cut backs the Department for Transport, Tourism and Sport has had to curtail investment on major new / improvement projects in recent times to focus available funds on necessary maintenance and repair work and based on the current estimates.  As the Deputy will be aware, there is scheduled to be a further reduction of in excess of &euro;50m in the 2014 budget for Regional and Local Roads.  It is from this budget that any additional funds for the Narrow Water Bridge would have to come. </p><p>  Notwithstanding this, I have previously stated that I would be willing to consider helping to make up some of the shortfall but only in the context that there would be significant additional contributions from other parties including the Northern Ireland Executive.  As I understand it to date such a package of funding has not been put together.  The SEUPB is currently in discussions with Louth County Council and its project partners in relation to the financial viability and deliverability of the scheme.  It should be noted that there are other transport related projects with a cross-border dimension that could be consider for any unallocated INTERREG funding including improvements to the North-South railway.</p></reply>
