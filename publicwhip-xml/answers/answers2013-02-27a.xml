While this is a complex area, the fundamental objective is to enshrine three basic propositions:- </p><p>- If the Minister takes a decision personally, he or she should say so and account for it.</p><p>- If the decision is taken by the Department then the relevant, named official should say so and account for it.</p><p>- The Minister would then have to account for the degree of supervision and oversight he or she exercised over the Department </p><p>  I have asked the Government Reform Unit in my Department to carry out a review of the current accountability framework for ministers and civil servants set out in the Ministers and Secretaries Acts and the Public Service Management Act, 1997.</p><p>  Work is now at an advanced stage in my Department in finalising a policy paper based on the outcome of that review.  The paper examines the current legislative framework underpinning civil service accountability in these statutes, as well as the current administrative and organisational accountability arrangements in place.  It also explores the international practice and developments in this area. To assist with this work, a consultation process on these issues has been carried out; this initially included international academics, national experts and commentators and some senior civil servants.</p><p>  I expect to bring this paper to Government shortly to seek approval for the publication of the policy paper.  It is intended that the paper should act as a basis for a process of wider consultation on the proposed reforms.</p><p>  I look forward to hearing the views of the Deputy and other members of this House in the course of this consultation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-27a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013022700063#WRB00700"><p>In March 2012 in conjunction with Minister for Small Business John Perry and I launched a Report on Opportunities in Public Sector Procurement.Â  The Report, compiled by DCU, was a result of Ireland&#8217;s first national survey of public procurement practice, carried out by the National Procurement Service (NPS) of the OPW, with over 4,000 suppliers and 600 public procurers contributing to the research. Some of the key recommendations regarding micro industry are outlined below.</p><p><b>1. Minimise Barriers to Micro and Young Enterprises through Open Tendering</b></p><p>  Department of Finance Circular 10/2010 recommends that all supplies and services contracts below &#8364;125,000 and all works contracts below &#8364;250,000 are to be awarded under open procedure. The National Procurement Service actively promotes the use of the open procedure at its training courses for public sector buyers. It also provides a link on eTenders showing that the open procedure should be used below the Thresholds stated.</p><p><b>2. Facilitate Micro-enterprise Access through Lots and Joint Bidding</b></p><p>  The new eTenders website is designed to make it easier for public sector buyers to use lots when going to tender. It allows the buyer to specify the number of lots and then to provide detailed specifications for each lot. The new system also allows for suppliers to include a separate bid if where they win all lots available in a tender. Again the National Procurement Service actively promotes the use of Lots at its training courses for public sector buyers.</p><p>  Similarly the NPS encourages SMEs and micro-enterprises to collaborate on public sector tenders by encouraging joint bidding or consortium formation.</p><p>  In NPS competitions, the tender documents explicitly seek to encourage the participation of SMEs. A prime example of this is when the NPS decided to divide the office supplies contract into three individual lots for Stationery, ICT Consumables and Paper. SMEs that believed the scope of the competitions were beyond their technical or business capacity were encouraged to explore the possibilities of forming relationships with other SMEs or with larger enterprises.</p><p>  Through such relationships they could participate and contribute to the successful implementation of any contracts that resulted from these competitions and therefore increase their social and economic benefits. Larger enterprises were also encouraged to consider the practical ways that SMEs could be included in their proposals to maximise the social and economic benefits of the contracts that result from these tenders.</p><p><b>3. Reduce Paperwork Burden</b></p><p>  The NPS in conjunction with the Chief States Solicitors Office have produced a set of standardised documents for use by contracting authorities when tendering. This has permitted suppliers to become more familiar with the questions to be answered and the forms to be appended to their tender thus making it easier for them to respond to tenders. The new eTenders website also allows suppliers to load their corporate documents such as Tax Clearance Certificates, Accounts etc on to the site just once where they can be used for multiple tenders. These documents are stored securely and comply with the data protection requirements.</p><p>  The NPS places Prior Information Notices on the EU's official Journal, which give up to a years notice of intention to go to the market for goods or services. Similar information is also made available on the NPS web.</p><p>  The National Procurement Service (NPS) is working with an established collaborative working group to identify and implement practical solutions to challenges for the SME sector in relation to public procurement.</p><p>  In exceptional circumstances, and if appropriate, the NPS pilots innovative solutions that can involve research and expenditure up to EU thresholds with a view to informing future tender competitions and the development RFTs that would issue to market.</p><p>  The NPS Survey for 2013 has just closed and again has had a very positive response form both Suppliers and Buyers. A report on the findings of this latest survey will issue in the second quarter.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-27a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013022700063#WRB01000"><p>The Government&rsquo;s Public Service Reform Plan, published in November 2011, is based on five core commitments to change, which include "Placing customer service at the core of everything we do".  To this end, the Reform Plan includes a range of actions to improve the citizen&rsquo;s access to, and interaction with, Government services.</p><p>  No one has a monopoly on good ideas and a broad range of voices, opinions and perspectives should be used to inform and enhance the decision-making and planning processes.  In terms of public services, it makes sense that the views of service users are sought and valued, and I welcome all constructive input and feedback in this context.  For this reason, I regularly meet with the relevant Oireachtas Committees to review progress on the Reform Plan and outline planned initiatives.</p><p>  Engagement with the citizen and improving customer services are important and ongoing considerations for all Government Departments and Agencies.  As part of this, the Customer Charter initiative involves a process whereby Departments and Agencies are required to consult with their customers, to set service standards, to measure progress against those standards and to report on that progress in their annual reports.  To assist organisations in this process, my Department published revised guidelines for the Preparation of Customer Charters and Customer Action Plans last year.</p><p>  Consultation on specific policy issues is undertaken by the relevant Department or Agency.  For example, in the context of my own Department, members of the public were invited to submit suggestions for savings and efficiencies as part of the Comprehensive Expenditure Review in 2011.  More recently, my Department has undertaken consultation processes on issues such as the regulation of lobbying, Whistleblowers legislation and proposals for changes to the Civil Service Accountability framework.</p><p>  The overall reform programme also sets out to make Government more open, transparent and accountable.  Significant progress is being made in this area, for example, the extension of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s remit, establishing a legal framework for Oireachtas inquiries, reform and extension of Freedom of Information, regulation of lobbying and the introduction of comprehensive whistleblower protections.  In the context of being open to a wide range of voices and perspectives, I would also make reference to the Convention on the Constitution, which is a forum of 100 people, including 66 randomly selected citizens.</p><p>  Overall, we are making good progress on the implementation of our ambitious programme of Public Service Reform.  In this context, our objective is not just a leaner and more efficient Public Service, but also a more integrated, responsive and customer-focused Public Service.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-27a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013022700063#WRB01300"><p>On the 17th of July 2012, the Government announced its plans for an additional 2.25 billion euro investment in public infrastructure projects in Ireland. The most important contribution capital investment can now make is in providing the capacity for the economy to grow, which will in turn create employment.</p><p>  As the Deputy will recall, the stimulus package included 1.4 billion euro to fund the proposed new Public Private Partnerships (PPP) programme and the delivery of this is the initial focus for my Department.  This 1.4 billion euro investment is additional to the direct investment by the exchequer in infrastructure which will be some 3.4 billion euro in 2013.</p><p>  Job creation is a critical priority for Government. Investment in the projects included in the Stimulus package is expected to generate significant numbers of jobs spread out across the country. Previous analysis of each sector indicates that the investment in the PPP Pipeline may generate around 13,000 direct jobs and many more indirect jobs. It will also create much needed social and economic infrastructure and aid economic recovery.  I have asked my Department to update this analysis to verify these figures and help to target our scarce resources to best effect.</p><p>  I am anxious that this new Programme be rolled out as quickly as possible so that we can create the extra jobs on the ground without delay.  The PPP projects are large value investments and by their nature are complex and take time to develop and deliver both for the public and the private sector.  From the public sector side, my Department is working closely with the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) and Sponsoring Departments to progress projects and to accelerate delivery of the programme. On the basis of this work, NDFA expect to issues tenders for the schools bundles by end May, at the latest.  The tender for the Primary Care Centres Bundle is expected to be issued in August followed by the Grangegorman tender in September.  Tenders for the two new PPP roads projects are also due to issue by the summer.</p><p>  The preparatory work for the projects is well underway in the various Departments and Agencies. At this early stage in the process most of the employment impact to date has been in the technical and advisory areas.</p><p>  It is too early to provide exact numbers of jobs created so far, although some projects such as the new DIT Grangegorman project have already seen significant employment impact where a team of 40 architects, engineers, quantity surveyors and other specialists are already in place. Similarly in relation to the schools and primary care centres, a number of technical advisors and design teams are in place.</p><p>  The NDFA have established a model to track employment creation on Schools Bundle 3 PPP project which commenced last November. To date, it shows that 321 jobs have been created by this project, 274 direct jobs and 47 indirect jobs.  This model will be updated regularly and will be used to track job creation for Stimulus Package Phase 1 projects.</p><p>  Further employment benefits will be evident as the projects progress through the tendering phase and construction gets underway. The indicative timetable for the projects suggest construction is expected to commence on the first roads project in Q3 2013 and on the accommodation projects by Q4 2014.</p><p>  My Department together with the NDFA and the Sponsoring Authorities are also looking at how to maximise job creation as part of each tender competition that is in line with procurement regulations. With the NDFA, we are also examining ways to encourage SME participation by facilitating access to the programme and the NDFA is working with Enterprise Ireland to organise awareness raising events for SMEs.</p></reply>

Following intensive engagement in recent days between the parties, which was facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission (LRC), the LRC has developed and recommended a set of proposals for consideration and agreement that seeks to secure the &euro;1bn gross savings required by the Exchequer while ameliorating the impacts on public service staff particularly those on low and middle incomes to the greatest extent possible. Public servants will be able to consider the full set of proposals by the LRC which were published yesterday and the public service staff representatives who remained in negotiations have indicated that these proposals will be subject to ballot by members.</p><p>  I am satisfied that, subject to its ultimate acceptance and the necessary legislation being passed by the Oireachtas, the proposals will produce the necessary savings of &euro;1 billion over the lifetime of the Agreement.</p></reply>

Within that, it has been necessary to allow for some limited recruitment to protect service levels, but such exemptions are only considered in exceptional cases and in pressing circumstances.</p><p>  My Department is currently compiling the specific data and information requested, which will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.  In the meantime, the Deputy can consult my Department&rsquo;s web site, which has details on public service numbers and trends as far back as 1994.</p><p>  Looking forward over the course of the next few years, the public service will be required to deliver more savings and maintain services with fewer resources and staff.  Budget 2013 will deliver a further reduction in Public Service numbers to a ceiling of 287,000, and by end-2014 this must go down again to 282,500.</p><p>  It is part of the day to day function of the Boards and Management of all public bodies to assess, budget and plan for current and ongoing staffing requirements within the context of reducing public service numbers.  In support of this, the Strategic Workforce Planning Groups in each sector are currently ensuring that sectoral employers develop plans to deal on an ongoing basis with the operational and strategic consequences arising from the reductions in public service staffing numbers.</p></reply>

The estimate takes account of the reductions in pay arising from the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act, 2009, but does not take account of any offsetting reductions in taxes and levies. As the combined effect of the estimated marginal tax rate and the pension related reduction at a pay level for a public servant of &euro;100,000 p.a. or higher is at least 62.5%, the estimated net savings would be reduced to less than &euro;110m.</p></reply>

The purpose of this Circular is to inform all public bodies of the mandatory requirement to utilise central contracts, put in place by the NPS, when procuring a range of commonly acquired goods and services. Such central arrangements are targeted at securing best value for money and facilitating contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints. The eight mandatory contracts are:</p><p> - 1.	Stationery &amp; Office Supplies</p><p> - 2.	Paper</p><p> - 3.	Janitorial Supplies</p><p>  4.	ICT Consumables</p><p>  5.	Managed Print Services (When opting for managed print service solutions it is mandatory to use this framework agreement.)</p><p>  6.	Advertising (Print Media)</p><p>  7.	Motor Vehicles (Cars and Pick-up Trucks)</p><p> - 8.	Energy (Electricity and Natural Gas)</p><p> - The annual turnover required for each competition depends on the estimated value of the contract and will be different for every competition run by the NPS.</p></reply>

This amounts to an eventual saving in terms of annual pension outgo of some &euro;1.8 billion in current terms. The key features of the Single Scheme giving rise to this projected saving are career-average benefit accrual, higher pension age, and pension increases linked to consumer price inflation.</p><p>  Since the Single Scheme only applies to new-entrant public servants, this foreseen long-term annual outgo saving of one third will not be fully achieved until pension payments to current pensioners and current, pre-Single Scheme, staff  have ceased.  On this basis, realization of the full dividend to the public finances should be approached early in the second half of this century, with meaningful annual savings emerging during the period 2040 to 2050.</p><p>  At this early point in the year I am not in a position to give an estimate of the likely number of Single Scheme members who will be hired over the course of 2013. A particular uncertainty in this context is the fact that appointees to public service jobs who have worked in the public service in the 26 weeks preceding their appointment will generally not become members of the Single Scheme.</p><p>  With respect to the operation of the Single Scheme, my Department is liaising closely with Government Departments and other public service employers. A key priority during the current start-up phase of the scheme is to ensure the reliable collection and remittance of member contributions. Looking further ahead I am determined to ensure that all aspects of scheme functioning, including benefit accrual recording, communication with members and periodic actuarial review are delivered in a reliable and cost-effective manner.</p></reply>

In brief the current stages of the assessment covers Data Collection &amp; Surveying, Hydrology Analysis and Detailed Hydraulic Modelling.  This stage in turn will lead to the production of a detailed suite of flood hazard maps for public consultation.  Details of the Study and regular updates can be found on www.cfram.ie or .</p><p>  At present, detailed ground surveying of over 1,500 kilometres of watercourses in the Shannon is nearing completion.  The outcome of this stage of extensive activity will provide the necessary data to allow work on the development of sophisticated hydraulic models to be advanced.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, Jacobs Engineering was requested by the Office of Public Works (OPW) to carry out a review of the operating regulations and procedures of the control structures along the river Shannon - the River Shannon Water Level Operations Review.  The purpose of the report was to identify potential improvements with respect to flood risk management that could be introduced in the short term.  This review was carried out in advance of the detailed hydrological analysis and hydraulic modelling which is being addressed within the overall Shannon CFRAM Study.</p><p>  Arising from consultations on the report, it was agreed, to explore the possibility of carrying out a water level monitoring exercise, involving controlled raising and lowering of weir boards at selected locations, subject to favourable hydrological conditions.</p><p>  It is important to note that operational control of water flows and levels on the Shannon is a matter for both the ESB and Waterways Ireland.  The OPW met with both organisations recently to review the scheduling of such an exercise having regard to existing water management protocols operated by these two bodies for the major storage areas in the Shannon system.  It has been agreed that Jacobs Engineering will brief the two bodies shortly on their Operations report in order to advance the water monitoring proposal.</p></reply>

We are bringing public expenditure back to a sustainable level and driving forward the public service reform agenda to ensure that efficiencies and reformed work practices play a full part in contributing to the overall budgetary consolidation effort.</p><p>  The medium-term expenditure management process began with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE) exercise in 2011, which was carried out by all Departments to identify ways of reducing expenditure, in line with commitments under the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland, while minimising the impact on service delivery.</p><p>Ministerial expenditure ceilings for 2012 - 2014 were introduced on an administrative basis in the <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report</i>, published in December 2011.  The CRE exercise forms the foundation of these ceilings and is the basis for all subsequent decisions on expenditure.  The precise composition of the 2013 budgetary consolidation was set out in the <i>Expenditure Report 2013</i>, published on 5th December, 2012.</p><p>  As regards the question of incentives to achieve targets and reduce costs, it is relevant to note that the Medium Term Expenditure Framework envisages a new &#8220;carryover&#8221; facility for Departments that manage their allocations within budget in any year, so that they can use these savings in the following year.  Those Departments that are proactive in driving reform, innovation and structural planning will naturally be best-placed to avail of this facility into the future.  The consequence on Departments who exceed their current expenditure ceiling in any given year will be the assimilation of an offsetting adjustment in their envelope for the following year, and they will be required to devise appropriate policy measures to live within the reduced allocation.   It will be a matter for Ministers and Heads of Department/Office to devise forward-looking plans and policies and to ensure that the Ministerial Expenditure Ceilings are adhered to.</p><p>  The Implementation Body has reported total savings in the order of &#8364;1.5 billion over the first two years of the Agreement, which comprises of approximately &#8364;810 million and &#8364;680 million in pay and non-pay savings respectively. This is happening in a climate of industrial peace in the Public Service.  In addition, I welcome the recent proposals from the Labour Relations Commission agreed pay deal which will help reduce the Public Service pay bill by &#8364;1 billion.  While good progress has been made on delivering savings and implementing change, it remains a matter for each Minister and their Departments to ensure that the Vote-level allocations are adhered to and at the same time ensure that they continue to provide essential frontline services and respond to increasing demands.</p></reply>

Public procurement is discussed at policy level not only in terms of achieving cashable savings but also in terms of offering growth opportunities to small indigenous suppliers who have born the brunt of the downturn in the domestic and international economy.</p><p>  In NPS competitions, the tender documents explicitly seek to encourage the participation of SMEs. A prime example of this is when the NPS decided to divide the office supplies contract into three individual lots for Stationery, ICT Consumables and Paper. SMEs that believed the scope of the competitions were beyond their technical or business capacity were encouraged to explore the possibilities of forming relationships with other SMEs or with larger enterprises. Through such relationships they could participate and contribute to the successful implementation of any contracts that resulted from these competitions and therefore increase their social and economic benefits. Larger enterprises were also encouraged to consider the practical ways that SMEs could be included in their proposals to maximise the social and economic benefits of the contracts that result from these tenders. </p><p>  Codex Ltd, an indigenous company, won the Stationery contract, with an estimated value of &euro;10m per annum, and are sourcing up to 60% of their products using 136 local Irish agents and manufacturers. </p><p>  Furthermore, the ICT Consumables contract, worth an estimated &euro;8m per annum, was also won by another Irish SME, Datapac Limited.  The NPS has also, as part of its education and development remit, an active programme to educate SMEs in how to participate effectively in the public service procurement process.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 3,500 SMEs nationwide. </p></reply>

Following intensive engagement in recent days between the parties, which was facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission (LRC), the LRC has developed and recommended a set of proposals for consideration and agreement that seeks to secure the savings required by the Exchequer while ameliorating the impacts on public service staff particularly those on low and middle incomes to the greatest extent possible. Public servants will be able to consider the full set of proposals by the LRC which will be available shortly and the public service staff representatives who remained in negotiations have indicated that these proposals will be subject to ballot by members.</p></reply>

This will be of real and lasting benefit to all citizens, regardless of any headline figure on savings.  </p><p>  Specifically, the Public Service Reform Plan aimed to secure &euro;20 million in enhanced service efficiencies and value-for-money from the rationalisation programme.  This figure, however modest it appears, will be achieved.  The bulk of the savings are derived from a reduction in the number of public servants working in the State Bodies affected.  The rationalisation agenda is just one of the reform measures announced in the Public Service Reform Plan and the Programme for Government which facilitates the Government in ensuring delivery of critical services while still being able to reduce public service numbers.</p><p>  There will of course be other cash savings realised over time as organisations, financial systems, office accommodation etc. are rationalised into leaner, more coherent structures.  These savings, some of which will be once-off, will be factored into the overall budgetary framework as they arise.</p></reply>

To this end, we agreed on 2 October 2012 to accelerate the reduction in Public Service numbers in order to achieve the previous end 2015 target of 282,500 by end 2014 instead. </p><p>  Greater efficiencies in the way the Public Service is going about its business means that some functions and work areas are no longer required, and in such instances - where redeployment is not suitable - voluntary redundancy may be required.  </p><p>  For the time being, voluntary redundancy will be rolled out in three areas where a sound business case has been made &ndash; the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and specific parts of the Health and Education Sectors.  These Departments estimate that there will be scope to effect about 2,000 exits from their areas over time, mainly from back office support areas and management and administrative grades.  How this estimated number of exits translates into actual savings over the next three years will be determined by a number of variables, including the take-up rate among staff in the targeted areas, their number and grade mix, timing of departure, etc., information on which will not become apparent until the scheme is offered to the effected staff.    </p><p>  Analysis by my Department estimates that for every 1,000 employees who opt to participate in a voluntary redundancy programme there will be a gross cost of approximately &euro;109 million.   The gross payroll savings for 1,000 employees will amount to &euro;57 million every year.  Therefore the initial cost of 1,000 employees leaving would be recouped in two years.  On a net basis, the cost is in the order of &euro;100m and the savings in the order of &euro;37m.  Further savings will be realised in the future when these employees reach retirement age, because of their reduced pension entitlements.</p></reply>

In relation to improving access for SMEs to larger contracts, the guidance advises contracting authorities to consider sub-dividing of procurement requirements into &ldquo;lots&rdquo; where it would be appropriate, practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money. In cases where it is not possible to divide a larger contract into lots, contracting authorities are advised to ensure that the terms of the contract facilitate the inclusion of smaller enterprises. In this regard, tenders documentation can be developed in a manner that enables SMEs to combine with others to make a joint bid for a contract that they might not be in a position to perform on their own.</p><p>  Given the variety of supplies and services tendered for by the public sector, Circular 10/10 does not assign a monetary value to define what a large contract is. This is because certain contracts for supplies and services may not be suited to SMEs for non-monetary reasons (e.g. the supply of electricity, pharmaceuticals, heavy machinery and large scale IT software projects). </p><p>  I would add that National Procurement Service tender documentation has been developed to encourage the participation of SMEs. For example, the contract for office supplies was divided into three individual lots for Stationery, ICT Consumables and Paper. SMEs that believed the scope of the competitions were beyond their technical or business capacities were encouraged to explore the possibilities of forming relationships with other SMEs or with larger enterprises. Through such relationships they could participate and contribute to the successful implementation of any contracts that resulted from these competitions and therefore increase their social and economic benefits. </p><p>  Larger enterprises were also encouraged to consider the practical ways that SMEs could be included in their proposals to maximise the social and economic benefits of the contracts that result from these tenders. For example, Codex Ltd, an indigenous company, won the Stationery contract, with an estimated value of &euro;10m per annum, and is sourcing up to 60% of their products using 136 local agents and manufacturers. </p><p>  The National Procurement Service (NPS) established its 'Working Group to assist Small and Medium Enterprises' in February 2012 to facilitate open discussion on the issue of public service  procurement. The Working Group consists of representatives from the NPS, the Health Service Executive, the Irish Business and Employers Federation, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, Chambers Ireland, and the Small Firms Association. The Group has met on a number of occasions and has raised many issues relating to procurement and particularly how these issues impact on SMEs. Resulting from these discussions the NPS has developed a training programme to educate SMEs in how to participate effectively in the public service procurement process.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 3,500 SMEs nationwide.</p></reply>

My Department is reviewing both the level of expenditure on, and the procedures that are being used to procure, legal services. </p><p>  The paper &quot;<i>Reducing Public Expenditure on Legal Services: Avoid, Minimise, Recover&quot;</i>   published in the Expenditure Report 2012, details a range of measures which have already been taken to reduce expenditure as well as making recommendations for further areas where savings may be achieved. Specific reductions which have already been made include:</p><p>-  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009 which imposed reductions on levels of professional fees, including legal fees. The fees payable to State Solicitors, who act on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions in cases of indictable prosecution outside Dublin, were reduced by 8% with effect from May 2009 under the terms of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 (No 5 of 2009). The Act also provided that I carry out a review of the operation, effectiveness and impact of the amounts and rates fixed by regulation under the Act before the 30 June every year, and consider the appropriateness of these amounts and rates having regard to any change of circumstances.  I have conducted an annual review of the fees payable to State Solicitors in each year since the reduction of 8% in 2009 and have not found cause to vary the fees.  The review due for 2013 has not yet commenced but it is intended to be undertaken in the very near future.</p><p>-  From peak expenditure levels, the Chief State Solicitor&#8217;s Office (CSSO), has made reductions in spending of 28.6%, the Office of the Attorney General (AGO) 14.4%, and the  Office of the Director for Public Prosecutions (DPP) 11.3%.</p><p>- The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) pays set rates for specific services supplied by legal practitioners. In 2011 the Office implemented a 10% cut in these rates in response to a similar measure imposed by the Department of Justice on fees paid for the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme.</p><p>- The State Claims Agency is reducing fees paid to barristers by 25% and is establishing a legal costs unit which will handle third party costs associated with the Mahon and Moriarty Tribunals.</p><p>- A range of Offices have unilaterally sought and achieved reductions in legal fees. As part of the review of this area underway in my Department, a number of further cost-saving measures are being examined, including greater use of Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanisms; greater use of competitive tendering procedures; and more informed structures in departments to enable better case management and control access to legal services. The paper published in the Expenditure Report 2012 also sets out some guiding principles to ensure that the State interacts with legal matters in the most cost-effective manner possible:</p><p>- Avoid - all expenditure on legal services must be warranted, and the decision on whether a particular service is required at all, could be provided in-house, or needs to be sourced externally, should be made by personnel with the requisite expertise.</p><p>- Minimise - when external legal services are deemed necessary, they must be procured in the most cost-effective manner possible.</p><p>- Recover - when the State is involved in a successful case, every effort should be made to recover costs from the other party. This involves proper maintenance of the case file by  those practitioners representing the State.</p><p>  My Department will shortly issue a new Circular on Procurement of Legal Services and Managing Legal Costs. This Circular clarifies and underlines the importance of the obligations upon public bodies to comply with the procurement rules and guidelines in retaining legal services.  The Circular outlines appropriate competitive procedures that can be used in the engagement of legal services and sets out a number of approaches and tools for public bodies to use in managing legal costs.</p><p>  The Legal Services Bill, which will soon be entering Committee Stage, and which my colleague the Minister for Justice &amp; Equality intends to become law by the end of the year, contains measures which will help to ensure that the broader market for legal services operates in an efficient and cost-effective manner. The new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, which will replace the Office of the Taxing Master, will improve the predictability and openness of legal costs by producing transparent guidelines and publishing the results of its cost determinations.</p><p>  Officials in my Department are examining whether the market for Government advocacy work is currently operating in fair and open manner, and conducting a comparative analysis of the best methods of procuring counsel for State work.</p></reply>

In this regard, I would refer the Deputy to my reply on this issue (PQ 3066/13 - answered 23/01/13).</p><p>  The inclusion of a social clause in all public procurement contracts requiring that, for example, a quota of long-term unemployed be employed in the delivery of the contract poses a number of risks. In the current economic climate, and in particular bearing in mind the difficulties in the construction sector, businesses have for obvious reasons been reducing their existing workforce rather than taking on new employees. Consequently, it would be expected that, where a business is awarded a public contract, the work would be carried out by the existing employees of that business. In such circumstances a social clause requiring that a number of long-term unemployed be employed in delivering a public contract could either impose an additional cost on SMEs that they may not be able to afford, or result in an employee of the supplier being let go in favour of a long-term unemployed person. </p><p>  The Government has a wide range of measures that it is deploying to facilitate job creation and support labour activation, with particular emphasis on assisting long term unemployed people.  Obviously, the main purpose of the public procurement process is to ensure that goods, services and works are purchased by the State in a manner that is legal, transparent and of high probity, and our key requirement is the achievement of value for money.  Within this context, my Department and the National Procurement Service are examining the use of social clauses as an additional means of supporting activation and we are seeking to identify the scope for the use of social clauses in parts of the capital area in particular.</p></reply>

In the first instance we introduced salary reductions along with a general salary ceiling of &euro;250,000 per annum to all newly appointed CEOs in Commercial State Companies. In the second instance we sought voluntary reductions in the salary levels of those already serving CEOs with salaries in excess of &euro;250,000 per annum. </p><p>  The salary ceiling of &euro;250,000 per annum for newly appointed CEOs was arrived at through a combination of an across-the board 10% reduction and an additional reduction equivalent to that applied to public servants under the terms of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No 2) Act 2009.  In the interests of achieving fairness and balance, salary reductions were also applied in respect of newly appointed CEOs of commercial State companies with salary maxima below the ceiling of &euro;250,000 per annum.  This has had the effect of reducing the salary levels of all newly appointed CEOs in a proportionate manner while maintaining the established weightings between the Commercial State Companies. </p><p>  The sole exception to this arrangement is in respect of the more recently  appointed CEO of the ESB for whom a salary of &euro;318,083 per annum was approved and which is proportionate to the reductions imposed generally under the formula applied.   However, it is important to note that in this particular and exceptional case the CEO concerned has agreed to a reduced salary of &euro;295,000 per annum. Furthermore, it is Government policy that, in general, newly appointed CEOs are to be placed on the minimum point of the relevant salary range as opposed to the practice of assigning such personnel to around the mid range of such salary scales under an established pay formula for this purpose.</p><p>  The position in respect of CEOs who were already serving in June 2011 is that, for contractual reasons the imposition of reduced salary rates could not be unilaterally imposed by Government.  However, incumbent CEOs in the Commercial State Companies with a salary in excess of the general salary ceiling of &euro;250,000 per annum were requested to make a voluntary waiver of salary of 15%, or to waive a lesser amount if the application of the full 15% reduction would have brought their salary below the &euro;250,000 salary ceiling.</p><p>  All of the relevant incumbent CEOs whose salaries were, at the time of this request, in excess of &euro;250,000 per annum agreed to the application of the waivers. </p><p>  The system of Performance Related Award Schemes for the CEOs of Commercial State Companies has been discontinued for all serving and recent appointees to such positions.   </p><p>  While I have no statutory role in relation to the remuneration of staff below CEO level in Commercial State Companies, I have written to the relevant Ministers about this matter asking that they  write to the Chairs of the Commercial State Companies under their aegis to request that they ensure that cognisance is taken of Government policy on pay within the public sector when considering the remuneration of all future appointments of staff within those organisations and, specifically, that they ensure that 2nd tier management remuneration is set at levels that allow for reasonable headroom between this tier and the revised levels of salary which will apply to CEO posts.	</p></reply>

These guidelines set out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote SME involvement in a manner that is consistent with the principles and rules of the existing public procurement regulatory regime. The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.  The key provisions of the guidance include:</p><p>supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &#8364;25,000 or more to be advertised on the <i><font color="#0000FF">www.etenders.gov.ie</font></i>   website;</p><p>less use of &#8220;restrictive&#8221; tendering procedures and greater use of &#8220;open&#8221; tendering;</p><p>ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract;</p><p>sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical.</p><p>  Circular 10/10 has been in place for just over two years. It is clear that there is a need to ensure greater consistency in relation to the implementation of this circular. In this regard, the National Procurement Service (NPS) established its 'Working Group to assist Small and Medium Enterprises' in February 2012 to facilitate open discussion on the issue of public service  procurement.  The Working Group consists of representatives from the NPS, the Health Service Executive, the Irish Business and Employers Federation, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, Chambers Ireland, and the Small Firms Association.  The Group has met on a number of occasions and has raised many issues relating to procurement and particularly how these issues impact on SMEs.  Resulting from these discussions the NPS has issued two circulars to all buyers in, and suppliers to, the public service with the aim of improving practice in the procurement arena.</p></reply>

The South Coast Report of the Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study (ICPSS), published by OPW in 2011, provides some erosion hazard mapping.  These maps are strategic level predictive erosion hazard maps for the years 2030 and 2050 and do not distinguish between farmland or other types of land that may potentially be at risk from erosion.  The ICPSS report and maps are available on the OPW website www.opw.ie under Flood Risk Management/Publications.  </p><p>  Cork County Council may have carried out or commissioned other studies or surveys and the Council can be contacted directly on this.</p></reply>

As one measure to achieve this, the guidance advises that the sub-dividing of procurement requirements into &ldquo;lots&rdquo; should be considered by contracting authorities where it would be appropriate, practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money. </p><p>  The guidance also provides that in establishing framework agreements, contracting authorities are to consider how proposed arrangements will impact on SMEs.  They are required to ensure that the terms of the framework facilitate the inclusion of smaller enterprises if these can meet requirements or compete for particular lots.  Also smaller companies can combine with others to make a joint bid for a contract that they might not be in a position to perform on their own.</p><p>  Circular 10/10 has been in place for just over two years. It is clear that there is a need to ensure greater consistency in relation to the implementation of this circular. In this regard, the National Procurement Service (NPS) established its 'Working Group to assist Small and Medium Enterprises' in February 2012 to facilitate open discussion on the issue of public service  procurement. The Working Group consists of representatives from the NPS, the Health Service Executive, the Irish Business and Employers Federation, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, Chambers Ireland, and the Small Firms Association. The Group has met on a number of occasions and has raised many issues relating to procurement and particularly how these issues impact on SMEs.  Resulting from these discussions the NPS has issued two information circulars to all buyers in, and suppliers to, the public service with the aim of improving practice in the procurement arena.</p></reply>

In this regard, my colleague Minister of State Brian Hayes is working with Senator Feargal Quinn to develop the Senator&rsquo;s private member&rsquo;s Construction Contracts Bill into a robust piece of legislation. The Bill has passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.</p><p>  The key objective of the Construction Contracts Bill is to ensure that cash flows down the supply chain on all construction contracts. This issue is addressed in the Bill by providing statutory arrangements in relation to payments under construction contracts, including providing for interim payments. The Bill also provides the means for subcontractors to enforce these rights; by suspending their labour and the provision of statutory adjudication.  </p><p>  I understand that Minister Hayes will shortly bring proposals to Government in advance of Committee Stage. This is an important piece of legislation aimed at creating a more level playing field between contractor and subcontractor in the construction sector. Therefore it is essential that these complex issues are properly assessed so as to avoid imposing unnecessary regulatory or cost burdens on parties in dispute, the State or others.</p></reply>

Their &quot;Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011-2013)&quot;, which is published on the Revenue website (<i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>), includes a range of measures designed to complement each other in targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for illicit tobacco products.   This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and detection technologies, and optimum deployment of resources at both point of importation and within the country to intercept and seize illegal products and to prosecute those involved.</p><p>  Interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence, and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.</p><p>  In carrying out this important work Revenue works in close cooperation with other relevant agencies, both nationally and internationally. There is extensive cooperation between Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the agencies concerned in the State and in Northern Ireland work closely together, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market. In addition, cooperation takes place with other revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in the ongoing efforts to tackle the illicit trade at international level.</p><p>  Considerable success has been achieved in combating the illegal trade, and more than 95 million illicit cigarettes were seized during 2012.  Revenue is committed to ensuring that the highest possible levels of seizures of illicit product are achieved on an ongoing basis and will see to it that this work continues to have high priority.</p><p>  There has been considerable success also in detecting and prosecuting those involved in the illicit trade, with 132 convictions during 2012 for the smuggling or sale of illicit products.</p><p>  Revenue is conscious that those involved in the illegal trade in tobacco are constantly looking to avoid detection by seeking out new ways of smuggling the illicit product and putting it on the market, and that its own response needs to be agile and adaptive in combating this criminal activity to take account of this.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to give a definitive reply based on the information provided by the Deputy.  While there is no specific exemption from the LPT for a person with multiple sclerosis, the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013 contains a provision that, if enacted, may be helpful, depending on the particular circumstances involved.  Section 6 of the Bill provides for a reduction in the market value of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided by a local authority.  The impact of specific adaptations on a property can be to decrease the value which may in turn impact on the LPT liability.</p><p>  The market value reduction is limited to the lesser of the market value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme.  The relief ends on the sale or transfer of a property that has been adapted, unless the person with the disability continues to reside in the property.</p></reply>

This level of interaction has increased during the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union and my consequent role as Chairman of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council.    It should be noted that every economics and finance minister in the European Union is a member of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin). Each month the Ecofin Council meets to discuss economic policy coordination, economic surveillance, monitoring of Member States' budgetary policy and public finances, financial markets and capital movements, as well as other matters. In addition, the Eurogroup - which comprises ministers of the Member States whose currency is the euro - usually meets the day before the Ecofin meeting to deal with issues relating to the Economic and Monetary Union. Commissioner Rehn is also in attendance at these meetings.</p><p>  As Minister for Finance, I have regular contact with Commissioner Rehn mainly on the margins of these Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings. In the period from December 2012 to date (27 February 2013), Ecofin and Eurogroup meetings took place on the 3rd and 4th December 2012, 12th and 13th, the 21st and 22nd January 2013 and the 11th and 12th February 2013.</p><p>  Arising from Ireland&#8217;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union, I represented the EU alongside Commissioner Rehn and President Draghi at the G20 Meeting of Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in Moscow on 15 and 16 February. I had discussions with both the Commissioner and President Draghi in Moscow on both G20 and broader issues. </p><p>  Commissioner Rehn also attended the Oireachtas Committee on Finance &#8211; Presidency Interparliamentary Committee which I opened last Monday, 25th February.  I had a discussion with the Commissioner on a number of issues on the margins of the conference.</p></reply>

I will therefore limit my response to progress since then.  I chaired the ECOFIN Council meetings on 22 January and 12 February.  Minister of State Hayes represented Ireland as the delegate at both of these meetings.  At these meetings I provided Ministers with an update on the various banking regulation dossiers currently being discussed i.e. the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive (CRD IV) and the Bank Resolution and Recovery Directive (BRR). </p><p>  Having assumed the Presidency of the Council of European Union, Ireland is currently engaged in trilogue and tripartite discussions with the European Parliament and the Commission on the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive and on the Single Supervisory Mechanism.  In relation to these dossiers the engagement with the Parliament is now advanced and the Irish Presidency is hopeful of reaching a conclusion in the coming weeks.</p><p>  Work is also progressing on the Bank Resolution and Recovery dossier.  It would not therefore be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage except to say that in its European Presidency Ireland will be doing all it can to continue to progress work on these dossiers in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Furthermore the projections are full year averages rather than end-year forecasts.</p><p>  In this context, my Department&#8217;s latest forecast &#8211; published at Budget time &#8211; is for an average unemployment rate of 14.6 per cent this year.</p><p>  I am fully conscious that the long-term unemployed make up a substantial part of those currently unemployed.  For instance, figures published this morning show an unemployment rate of 13.7 per cent (unadjusted for seasonal factors) in the fourth quarter of last year; those unemployed for one year or longer account for three-fifths of these.</p><p>  The Government is fully conscious of the scale of this problem and several initiatives have been introduced to mitigate the challenges faced by those suffering from long-term unemployment and to eliminate barriers preventing re-entry into the workforce.  The <i>JobsPlus Initiative</i> , for example, which was introduced as part of the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs, aims to incentivise businesses to hire those who have been on the Live Register for 12 months or more by providing a cash-flow benefit to businesses based on the duration of unemployment. </p><p>  Finally, I would draw attention to the labour market figures published this morning.  These show annual employment growth in the fourth quarter of last year - the first time we have seen such growth since mid-2008. Also, Live Register figures for February show that the standardised unemployment rate now stands at 14.1 per cent, a significant fall from the 15.0 per cent figure seen in the same month in 2012.</p><p>  In summary, while it is clear that progress is being made in tackling the unacceptably high level of unemployment, I recognise that there is still more to do.  As such, job creation continues to be a key priority of the Government.</p></reply>

A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits and profits from certain petroleum, mining or land dealing activities.  I am aware of recent media reports which refer to the ways that some multinational companies structure their international tax affairs to minimise their tax costs and I understand that some of these reports have suggested that some companies in multinational groups pay Irish corporation tax at rates that are lower than 12.5%.</p><p>  At this point it is important to state clearly that such companies are not paying a low rate of Irish tax &ndash; as already stated all companies in Ireland pay the standard 12.5% rate on their profits which are generated in Ireland.  The reports concerned appear to have incorrectly attributed to Ireland profits that represent the return due to assets in other jurisdictions, owned by group companies that are not resident in Ireland.</p><p>  The ability of multinational entities to lower their world-wide rates of tax using international structures reflects the global context in which Ireland and indeed all countries operate.  Differences arise in the legal and tax systems between countries.  International tax-planning takes account of these differences in national systems and rules.  The only way to effectively deal with such arrangements is for countries to work together to examine these structures and to consider how international rules can be amended to ensure fair levels of taxation.</p><p>  In this regard, Ireland is participating in projects at EU and OECD level which aim to address these issues.  The Deputy may be interested to note that the work being undertaken by the OECD as part of their Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, makes explicit reference to how harmful international tax practices may lead to multinational companies having a competitive advantage over companies operating mainly on the domestic level.  Irish officials have been actively involved in the BEPS project and have recently attended and contributed to meetings on this issue.  In our current role as President of the EU Council, Ireland has invited the OECD to participate in an upcoming discussion on BEPS by high level officials.</p><p>  There is broad agreement internationally that responses to the tax practices of transnational, indeed global, corporations requires international coordination of policy, legislation and tax administration.  This level of coordination is necessary because the concerns arising are typically the result of the interaction of the tax regimes across countries in which multinationals operate &mdash; rather than the law or practice of any individual country.  </p><p>  As I have highlighted, the only way to effectively address this issue is at the international level and the appropriate action is being considered in this regard.  Ireland remains fully committed to this approach to ensure fair play in international taxation.</p></reply>

The statistical basis of this estimate was the estimated aggregate amount of the benefit likely to be paid and the proportion of that amount expected to yield income tax, and not the expected numbers of recipients.  Accordingly, a precise number of recipients that will be liable to income tax on the benefit is not available.

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are liaising with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to establish how local authorities will provide the Revenue Commissioners with information in relation to their LPT liability and the timing and manner of the payment of this liability.  The recently published Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013, which provides that where local authority owned properties are not exempt from LPT, the market value of each of these properties will be deemed to fall into the first valuation band, that is &euro;100,000 or less, which represents an LPT charge of &euro;45 per property for 2013.  This initial valuation of local authority owned properties will be valid up to and including 2016.  It will be a matter for the local authorities themselves to decide whether they will pass on the LPT liability to their tenants in the form of an increase in rent or whether they will absorb the liability without recourse to their tenants.  The 2013 Bill also provides that local authorities will have until 1 January 2014 to pay the LPT due for 2013.  These changes are of course subject to the Bill being passed by the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

Over &euro;8bn was sanctioned in 2012; of which approx. &euro;2.5bn (27%) is new lending drawn down.&rdquo;</p><p>  According to the Credit Review Office, the balance of the sanctioned lending represented restructured or refinanced credit to SMEs which the Credit Review Office in the past has noted is important in terms of sustaining the businesses and the associated jobs.  </p><p>  One of the most powerful ways of ensuring that the pillar banks provide credit to viable is the availability of the Credit Review process. The Credit Review Office can review decisions by the pillar banks to refuse, reduce or withdraw credit facilities, including applications for restructured credit facilities, from &euro;1,000 up to &euro;500,000. The Credit Review Office is currently overturning 55% of the refusal decisions referred to them and anyone who has been refused credit by the banks should avail of the services of the Credit Review Office.</p></reply>

Fiscal multipliers vary according to the fiscal instruments used, and the impact on both growth and job creation as a result can differ accordingly.</p><p>  Ireland is a small, open economy with imports accounting for over three quarters of GDP. As a result, a considerable amount of any stimulus is likely to leak out through a reduction in these imports. For this, and other reasons, the fiscal multiplier in Ireland tends to be somewhat lower than in many other European countries.</p><p>  When discussing the implications of an additional stimulus package for the Irish economy it is important not to lose sight of the current fiscal position of the State and the opportunity cost of such funds. The Government is acutely conscious that there remains a considerable gap between what we get in revenue and what we spend. This situation is not sustainable over the longer term. In addition to the requirement to bring our deficit to under 3% of GDP by 2015 as per the Excessive Deficit Procedure, it makes sense that we bring balance back to the public finances and stabilise and reduce our debt burden.  This is how we will ultimately create growth and jobs on a sustainable basis.</p></reply>

Great-West Lifeco emerged as the preferred bidder for Irish Life following this process. However as a result of fears of a Eurozone break-up on the part of Great-West Lifeco, they withdrew their offer in late November 2011 and the process was suspended. </p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, since the bid process was suspended valuation multiples in the life assurance industry have improved, as have Irish bond yields, while the underlying life assurance industry in Ireland remains challenging, as outlined by Mark Burke, Head of Life Insurance Supervision at the Central Bank of Ireland in a speech on 31 January 2013 to a Life &amp; Pension industry conference.</p><p>  These circumstances allowed the State to recoup in full the investment made by the taxpayer in Irish Life and a valuation which was significantly better than could have been achieved if a sale had concluded early in 2012. A fair value opinion which supported the decision taken by the State was received from our advisors Goldman Sachs. The disposal proposed achieves a good valuation for Irish Life, an asset which the State did not intend to hold for the medium-term as the acquisition itself had been financed with borrowed money. </p><p>  I believe the sale represents a very good deal for the Irish taxpayer. </p></reply>

It is important to the economy as a whole that creditworthy individuals are able to access credit when they decide to purchase a house for the first time.  Central Bank figures are published in Table A.1 Summary of Irish Private Sector Credit and Deposits which is available at <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i> . They show that lending to households for house purchase was 1.6 per cent lower on an annual basis at December 2012.  Transactions for house purchase declined by &#8364;4 million in the month of December 2012. </p><p>  The IBF/PWC Mortgage Market profile shows new mortgage lending in Q4 2012 at close to &#8364;1 billion and that first time buyers are approximately 60% of this lending, by value and volume.  The increase in this number over the Q4 figure for 2011 may be partly attributable to the ending of mortgage interest relief for borrowers. However it would appear to show that the banks were able to respond adequately to increased demand when called upon to do so but it is an area of activity in the banking sector that I will be keeping under review. </p></reply>

In the past week, the NAMA Chairman publicly stated that the Agency expects, after all negotiations have completed, to obtain about &euro;750 million by taking charges over previously unencumbered assets and by reversing assets transfers by certain debtors.  NAMA advises that the realised proceeds from these sources will be used to pay down debts owed to the taxpayer by these debtors.</p><p>  NAMA advises that the granting of charges over additional security, where such security exists, is a required demonstration of a debtor&rsquo;s willingness and capacity to work with the Agency to achieve the best possible outcome for the taxpayer and that debtors receive no consideration for providing such security as their NAMA debt obligations are generally in excess of such amounts provided to NAMA. </p></reply>

The primary aim of coastal activity is to prevent, detect and deter smuggling and illegal importation of controlled drugs and other goods.  It involves co-operation between land-based Revenue and garda&iacute;, the Maritime Unit and the Navy, and of course international authorities.  The Revenue Maritime Unit completes the range of responses now regarded as standard in international anti-smuggling activities.</p><p>  The use of cutters in Ireland was adopted having regard to the need to fill a gap between land-based resources and the Navy.  The choice of robust seagoing vessels was necessary for safe and effective operation in variable weather and sea conditions.  Internationally, the use of this kind of vessel is now standard.  The benefits are in gathering intelligence, providing a visible customs presence in coastal waters, and widening the scope of Revenue capability.  While searches (rummages) are carried out by the cutters, it is most unusual for them to seize more than small amounts of prohibited substances.  Seizures are more usually done onshore, at the point of disembarkation, for safety reasons.  Their intelligence and expertise have, however, contributed considerably to successful high profile operations, both nationally and internationally.</p><p>  The range of cutter activities mirrors that of land-based customs officers and includes:</p><p>- Patrol of the external frontier to outer limits of Territorial Sea (12 mile limit).</p><p>- Monitoring (overt &amp; covert) all vessel movements - Assess, Board, Rummage as required.</p><p>- Enforcement of import and export prohibitions and restrictions.</p><p>- Identification and securing of outstanding VAT/duty liability on pleasure craft.</p><p>- Information/Intelligence management.</p><p>- International anti-smuggling operations at sea.</p><p>- Managing and monitoring maritime information systems. </p><p>- Servicing national and international MOUs and Mutual Assistance requests.</p><p>- Supporting national anti-smuggling operations.</p><p>- Developing and servicing coastal contacts (Customs Drugs Watch Programme).</p><p>  The principal costs associated with the operation of the cutters are fuel costs, operational maintenance costs and staffing costs.  Each cutter has a crew of six, and is at sea for more then 200 days per annum, with 24/7/365 availability.  The fuel and maintenance costs for two cutters was &euro;299,411 in 2012; &euro;337,340 in 2011; and &euro;331,473 in 2010.</p><p>  As an island nation the provision of customs cutters to police our maritime frontiers is regarded as an essential investment.  The cost and adequacy of the present level of provision is continually reviewed.  For the moment, Revenue are satisfied that they have an effective service at reasonable cost, that meets their foreseeable needs.</p></reply>

The schools that were affected by these changes were those where the posts were not fully utilised for NCSE approved resource hours or where the teacher in the post was predominantly based in a neighbouring school.  The full criteria used is set out in the Department's Staffing Circular 0013/2013 which was recently published on the Department website.Base schools are required to co-operate with their neighbouring schools to ensure that any surplus capacity in the (25 hour) resource posts is made available to neighbouring schools to meet their NCSE approved resource hour requirements.

It also provides that cross sectoral redeployments will follow the arrangements agreed for the NCSSBs. </p><p>  The Public Appointments Service (PAS), which has day-to-day operational responsibility for the implementation of redeployment, has put in place a system of Resource Panels of Civil Service and State Agency staff to support the redeployment processes in those sectors agreed under the Croke Park Agreement.  Posts to be filled by redeployment are offered in the first instance to the relevant panel or panels.  It is a matter for the employer to identify the number and grades of posts to be redeployed in the first instance and to upload the posts onto the PAS panels.  Employers can do this early in the redeployment process to maximise the opportunities to place their staff.  There is no set time-limit within which individuals awaiting redeployment must be redeployed. </p><p>A &#8220;Redeployment Toolkit&#8221; which gives full details on each stage of the redeployment process has been agreed with the staff unions. It includes a section setting out responses to Frequently Asked Questions and is available on my Department&#8217;s website at <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>  . </p></reply>

We are bringing public expenditure back to a sustainable level and driving forward the public service reform agenda to ensure that efficiencies and reformed work practices play a full part in contributing to the overall budgetary consolidation effort.</p><p>  The medium-term expenditure management process began with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE) exercise in 2011, which was carried out by all Departments to identify ways of reducing expenditure, in line with commitments under the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland, while minimising the impact on service delivery.</p><p>  In recent weeks, extremely difficult and complex discussions have been underway between public service management and public service staff representatives seeking agreement on a series of measures that will secure an additional &euro;1 billion saving from the public service pay and pensions bill by 2015. </p><p>  Following intensive engagement in recent days between the parties which was facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission (LRC), the LRC has developed and recommended a set of proposals for consideration and agreement that seeks to secure the savings required by the Exchequer while ameliorating the impacts on public service staff to the greatest extent possible. </p><p>  All sectors of the public service have been asked to make a significant and proportionate contribution to the overall savings. It is very clear that the impact of measures proposed in this Agreement will affect all public service workers and not just front line workers.</p><p>  Public servants will be able to consider the full set of proposals by the LRC. The public service staff representatives who remained in negotiations have indicated that these proposals will be subject to ballot by members in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Half of the proceeds will be available to fund employment enhancing projects of a commercial nature.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-27a.398.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013022700067#WRS00700"><p>As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply to his Parliamentary Question on this subject on 10 October 2012, I agree that Departments and Offices should make every effort to contain and reduce all administrative costs including both insurance and procurement costs.  This approach is in line with Government&rsquo;s overall reform and efficiency agenda.  In light of the need to accelerate the reform agenda, my Department published the Public Service Reform Plan in November 2011. This plan identified procurement reform as a key instrument that can assist the public service to deliver services in an efficient manner. </p><p>  The reform plan includes specific measures to ensure that:</p><p>1. aggregated procurement arrangements are utilised across the public service; </p><p>2. public bodies have appropriately trained staff to implement reform and to ensure the State is getting value for money; and </p><p>3. greater emphasis will be placed on analysing what the State purchases in order to assess other savings that can be made through more efficient procurement methods.</p><p>  Since its establishment in 2009, the National Procurement Service (NPS) has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service&rsquo;s buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service. These national arrangements have benefits that include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency; and enhanced service levels. In some instances the take up of the NPS arrangements has been low. In order to increase the usage of the NPS arrangements and thereby secure best value for money, the Government decided that it should be mandatory for public service bodies to use specified national procurement arrangements.    </p><p>  The NPS has reported procurement savings to the end of 2012 under its frameworks of &euro;93.1m, comprising of &euro;7.5m in 2010, &euro;46.5m in 2011 and a further &euro;39.1m for 2012, which include administrative savings.  A breakdown of these procurement savings is not readily available by sector. The NPS has established a Working Group to develop the saving methodologies and reporting of procurement savings in the future.  </p><p>  Circular 06/12 implements the Government decision by making it a mandatory requirement that public service bodies avail of specified national arrangements put in place by the NPS. The list of categories subject to national procurement arrangements includes: electricity; natural gas; stationery and office supplies; paper; ICT consumables; managed print services; print media advertising; and, motor vehicles. These national arrangements will secure best value for money and facilitate contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints.  </p><p>  It is estimated that &euro;9 billion is spent by public bodies annually on the public procurement of supplies and services. This is a very significant portion of overall spending and it is essential that the Public Service is achieving maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement. It is for this reason that public procurement is one of the major pillars of key strategic importance under the Government&rsquo;s Public Service Reform Plan.</p><p>  In order to ensure that the necessary elements are in place to implement these ambitious reforms, my Department engaged Accenture to undertake a capacity and capability review of the central procurement function to identify the actions required to realise substantial savings in public procurement in the short and medium term.  Of the estimated &euro;9 billion annual spend on public procurement of supplies and services, there is procurement addressable spend of approximately &euro;7 billion. The review estimates that implementation of its recommendations, over a three-year period, could yield potential annual savings in the range of &euro;249 million to &euro;637 million, depending on the approach taken.  The final report on this review is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  Following the review, proposals were recently submitted to Government. These proposals represent a new consolidated and integrated approach to public procurement that includes integrating procurement policy, strategy and operations in one office through the establishment of a National Procurement Office (under the aegis of my Department) which will be headed by a Chief Procurement Officer; strengthening spend analytics and data management; examining the specifications set out for goods and services; evaluating demand levels to assess how demand (volume) can be reduced; and strengthening vendor and category management. </p><p>  These proposals have now been agreed by Government and the Chief Procurement Officer is preparing a Procurement Reform Implementation Plan, which will be submitted to Government by the end of Q1 2013.  </p><p>  These reforms will lead to reductions in the cost of goods and services; better procurement services at lower cost; introduction of technical standardisation; greater attention to contract management and better problem resolution; greater levels of professionalism among staff responsible for procurement; and better performance management of the central procurement function.</p></reply>

In relation to the recruitment of employees, Enterprise Ireland provides grant support up to a maximum of &euro;15,000 per job towards the recruitment of new employees under its Job Expansion Fund.  This scheme applies to SMEs which have been trading for at least two years with 10 or more full time employees, in manufacturing and/or high-growth potential traded services.  Companies must be looking to recruit a minimum of three new employees per application.  Enterprise Ireland can also provide partial funding towards the cost of recruiting a key manager with skills that are crucial to the future growth of client companies, but this is not intended to be a general recruitment subsidy. </p><p>  Financial assistance for employers who wish to take on new employees is more generally available through Revenue&rsquo;s Job Assist scheme and the Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>  Under Job Assist, an employer who recruits a person who has been on the Live Register for 12 months or more is entitled to a double write-off of the person&rsquo;s wages and employer&rsquo;s PRSI for three years.  </p><p>  Under the Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive scheme, employers are exempt from the payment of employer&rsquo;s PRSI contribution for 18 months if they recruit a person who has been on the Live Register for six months or longer. </p><p>  The take-up of these two schemes has been quite poor, in spite of increased promotion of the schemes under the Action Plan for Jobs 2012.  Under the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs, therefore, the Government has announced the introduction of a new single simplified scheme to replace Job Assist and the PRSI Incentive scheme from the middle of this year. </p><p>  The new JobsPlus scheme will provide a fixed grant payment to businesses for each new employee recruited from the Live Register who has been unemployed for 12 months or more.  In order to target the scheme in favour of the more long term unemployed, the value of the incentive will be set at two levels:  &euro;7,500 in respect of recruits unemployed for more than 12 months but less than 24 months; and &euro;10,000 in respect of recruits unemployed for more than 24 months.</p><p>  It is proposed that the new incentive will be payable on a monthly basis, in arrears, over a two year period.  </p><p>  The JobsPlus scheme will be operated by the Department of Social Protection.  Pending its introduction, Revenue Job Assist and the Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive scheme will continue to operate. </p></reply>

According to the Census, there were some 16,300 young persons (aged 15-24) in Kerry in 2011, which represents 14% of the population (aged 15 and over). </p><p>  There were 2,559 persons under 25 on the Live Register in County Kerry in January 2013, down 7.6% on the same month last year. </p><p>  Young people, typically, suffer disproportionately from job losses in recessions as they tend to have entered employment more recently, are more likely to hold temporary contracts and to be employed in cyclically sensitive industries than older workers.</p><p>  In the first instance, the Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.  Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.  Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.</p><p>  In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for interim measures to support the young unemployed and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market.  There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation.  These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies.  These initiatives are being rolled out in all areas across the country including Kerry.  Details of these initiatives have already been outlined in earlier PQs relating to youth unemployment policies at the national level. </p><p>  There are some programmes specific to Kerry that are also being run. F&Aacute;S provides a training course in Tralee, Deciding Your Future, which targets young unemployed clients from RAPID areas.  Employment Services in Kerry provide school briefing services where they meet with schools/students who request their services on an annual basis to provide them with an overview of services available. The Mentor Project runs out of the Kerry Diocesan Youth Service (KYDS) in Tralee and provides a mentoring service for early school-leavers who have re-engaged in training with the Leaving Cert Applied in the KDYS, Community Training Centre in Monavalley and Youthreach/Transforum Alley (funded by Kerry Education Service).    Clients (aged under 21) who are coming off these programmes are met on a one-to-one basis and provided with career guidance and referral services.  </p></reply>

Of this, just under &euro;595 million or 2.9% of total estimated expenditure will be spent on administration.</p><p>  My Department operates a range of means tested schemes and these schemes, including the means testing elements, are administered through a network of local and central offices.</p><p>  Means testing is an integral part of the administration process to decide if a person has an entitlement to a payment or a continuing entitlement to a payment and the amount of that payment for the following schemes: Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, one parent family payment, widows / widowers / surviving civil partners non-contributory pension, deserted wife&rsquo;s allowance, basic supplementary welfare allowance, farm assist, pre-retirement allowance, back to work allowance, back to education allowance, disability allowance, blind pension, carer&rsquo;s allowance, family income supplement and back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  In addition there is a means testing element to determining entitlement to an increase for a qualified adult and qualified child as well as the fuel allowance for social insurance schemes. </p><p>  The main components of workflow in the department&rsquo;s processing sections are claim processing, maintenance, control activity and dealing with enquiries. Means testing is just one aspect of the process.  The means of a claimant where required are established following an assessment of the claimant&rsquo;s financial position. This may be carried out at the relevant scheme office and, in some cases, may involve referral to a Social Welfare Inspector/Community Welfare Officer to carry out a home visit.  The means are determined by the Deciding Officer/Designated Person and as appropriate are used to adjust the amount of the payment, if any; a claimant will receive, subject to all the other conditions of the scheme being satisfied. </p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s administration processes are supported by shared infrastructure and IT systems. These systems support various aspects of claim processing, including means assessment.</p><p>  For the reasons outlined above it is not possible to disaggregate the specific administration costs relating to means testing as it forms just one element of determining entitlement to a specific payment and, in many cases, the staff who administer these schemes in Social Welfare Offices or as part of the Departmental Inspectorate are also simultaneously administering other schemes, including schemes which are not means tested.  </p></reply>

The Job Initiative programme initially provided three years full-time employment for people who &ndash; on entry to the scheme &ndash; were 35 years of age or over, unemployed for 5 years or more, and in receipt of social welfare payments over that period.   In November 2004 the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment decided to allow those already on the programme to remain until retirement age (at 66). Further recruitment onto the scheme was also halted from that date.</p><p>  A stakeholder conference was held on the 18th of February to consider the recommendations made in the Review of Employment Support Schemes including Job Initiative, published by this Department in November 2012. The conference provided stakeholders with the opportunity to debate the issues raised. Further consideration will now be given to the recommendations made over the next number of months.</p></reply>

A majority of all CE schemes reviewed fell within the &euro;500 - &euro;1,000 per place per year funding requirement bracket with the remainder requiring less than &euro;500 per year. The outcome of the Review permitted the Department of Social Protection to meet what was considered the essential costs of scheme sponsors in delivering the Community Employment Programme for 2012. Some flexibility was allowed for CE schemes who incurred eligible costs prior to the reduction in budget, where operations continued into the budget year of 2012.  At the same time, the Department achieved a budget reduction in 2012 of approximately 30% on materials/training expenditure for 2011. </p></reply>

One of the findings was that the requirement that an annual audit be conducted for each scheme without any limit being placed on the amount allowable for audit costs, had in certain cases resulted in value for money not being secured. A comparison of audit fees indicated that there was a wide variation in costs (minima &euro;20, maxima &euro;9,500).

Payment of his pension is abated pending the termination of his temporary contract.  The decision to re-employ the Chief Medical Advisor was taken due to his specific skills and his involvement in the policy reform of the illness related schemes, the difficulty and long lead-in time for replacing his skills, and the critical importance of ensuring continuity and a high level of service to customers of the Department.</p><p>  There are currently 262 temporary clerical officers employed in the Department. Temporary clerical staff are recruited to cover absences of permanent staff on maternity leave, long term sick leave, other statutory leave and also to provide cover for some staff availing of the shorter working year scheme. They are also recruited to alleviate work pressure in certain areas, and to assist in the roll out of the Public Service Card project.  Temporary contracts are offered for a specific timeframe or fixed purpose and the term can vary according to the purpose of the contract.   The contracts are kept under review by the HR Division and are terminated when the purpose for the contract has ceased.  Some of the costs involved in the recruitment of temporary staff can be offset, for example, where permanent staff avail of certain unpaid statutory leave such as the shorter working year scheme or unpaid leave; or where staff on long-term sick leave are on a reduced salary.</p><p>  The Citizens Information Board (CIB) currently has five temporary clerical officers assigned to provide general mortgage information and advice. The costs of their salaries are being met by the mortgage lenders. The CIB also has one agency staff member (0.5 full time equivalent) on an annual salary of &euro;16,158.</p><p>  The Office of the Pensions Ombudsman currently has one temporary clerical officer assigned.</p><p>  The Pensions Board currently has seven staff members employed on fixed term contracts, all of which will expire in the last quarter of 2014. In addition, the board currently has one temporary member of staff covering a staff absence.</p><p>  Temporary clerical officers are paid on a weekly pay scale ranging from &euro;421.92 to &euro;680.62 for staff employed in the public service prior to 1/1/2011 or &euro;379.72 to &euro;612.56 for new entrants employed from 1/1/2011.</p></reply>

I also hope to be in a position to provide some funding to the Council from my Department's share of the Environment Fund.  It will be a matter for the Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports in 2013 and future years having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.</p><p>  The scope to provide additional funding for the protection, conservation and development of the State&rsquo;s heritage is constrained by the current national economic difficulties and the significant reduction in the public finances. Between 2008 and 2011 the level of funding from voted expenditure to the Heritage Council was reduced by 55%.  However, my Department will continue to provide funding for the protection, conservation and development of our built and natural heritage, in so far as resources allow.  The allocation to the Heritage Council in 2014 will be subject to the normal budgetary processes.</p></reply>

Hedgerows are an important reservoir of biodiversity and habitat for birds, insects, wild flowers and other wildlife during the summer breeding season.  The purpose of these provisions is to protect bird life during the nesting season, to prevent forest fires, and to protect vegetation and wildlife habitats during the months of growth and reproduction.  I have no current plans to extend the period for hedge cutting.</p><p>  While hedgerows and scrub are important as wildlife habitats, they need to be managed in the interests of both farming and biodiversity.  Accordingly, I included a commitment in the National Biodiversity Plan 2011-2016 to review the overall policy in this area.  The commitment is to review, in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, both hedgerow and scrub regulation with a view to producing guidelines to encourage best practice for hedgerow and scrub management for wildlife. As part of that review, the potential for setting the relevant dates by statutory instrument, rather than in primary legislation as is the position currently, will be examined.</p></reply>

The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty.  The scheme is delivered through a combination of SEAI appointed Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage and via an area based approach.  Measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation and are free of charge to the customer.  My Department has been informed by the SEAI that a surveyor was allocated to the home in question but the homeowner was not able to provide proof of eligibility for the scheme at the time.  The scheme is available to homes which meet the following criteria:</p><p>- Owner occupied non-Local Authority homes</p><p>- Constructed before 2002</p><p>- The owner is in receipt of one of the following: Fuel Allowance as part of the National Fuel Scheme; Job Seekers Allowance for over six months and with children under seven years of age; or Family Income support.</p><p>  If the homeowner is eligible for the scheme they would be welcome to reapply.  However, the homeowner will need to provide proof of eligibility.  Queries in relation to individual applications are an operational matter for the SEAI and a dedicated hotline can be reached at 1800 250 204.  In addition, the SEAI has established a specific email address for queries from Oireachtas members, which can be sent to<i></i><i></i>and will be dealt with promptly.</p></reply>

In that regard, I was pleased to launch the first Carbon Monoxide Awareness Week on 24 September 2012.  The Awareness Week saw a sustained, multi-media publicity campaign to alert people to the dangers posed by carbon monoxide and to give them advice as to what they should do to be safe.  The issue was widely reported on television, on national and local radio and in both national and local press.  In respect of the possibility for a mandatory registration scheme for oil technicians, similar to those in place for the gas (RGII) and electricity (RECI) industries, I have asked my officials to meet with industry representatives to discuss the matter and I await the outcome of such discussions.</p></reply>

The current REFIT reference rates are as follows:</p><p>Technology                Price (Euro/MWh)</p><p>Large wind             =          69.235</p><p>Small Wind             =          71.664</p><p>Hydro                  =          87.455</p><p>Biomass/Landfill Gas   =      85.026</p><p>  Approximately 1900MW of renewable generation is currently connected to the Irish grid and almost 19% of electricity consumed in 2012 is estimated to have come from renewable sources.</p><p> Under the current implementation of REFIT only energy exported to the grid is eligible for support from the REFIT scheme.  REFIT is a market support scheme which incentivises electricity suppliers to enter so called Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with generators of renewable electricity.  To be accepted into REFIT both planning permission and a grid connection are required.  Under a PPA, the supplier undertakes to purchase all the output from a selected new renewable energy<font color="#FF0000"> </font>plant at contract prices which are fixed between the renewable electricity producer and the supplier at the commencement of each individual contract for 15 years.  Since January 2012 there is a VAT refund for the purchase of microgeneration equipment for farmers/agricultural businesses.  EirGrid is responsible for planning and development of the transmission grid.  Grid 25 is EirGrid&#8217;s comprehensive strategy for developing the grid over the coming years to meet our increasing renewable energy needs.  Through Grid 25 and the implementation plans for the different regions under that strategy, EirGrid has marked out the path for grid development to ensure that we can meet our renewable obligations.  More information can be found here:<i></i>.</p><p>  The behaviour of the power system will change with increasing levels of variable non-synchronous generation on it out to 2020.  The DS3 programme is EirGrid&#8217;s response to the these issues and involves the development of the appropriate new system operational policies and tools, and the identification of the capabilities and characteristics required from the conventional portfolio to meet the system needs out to 2020.  In terms of autogeneration for businesses, policies to support this include CER Decision 09/99, which provides for small renewable and low carbon generators, including autoproduction, to connect to the grid outside of the normal Gate process.</p></reply>

No other electricity supply company has to date chosen to enter the market and to offer a microgeneration feed-in-tariff on a commercial basis, although the Commission for Energy Regulation invited them to do so.  No company has opted to offer, on a commercial basis, a feed-in-tariff for microgeneration to the commercial and industrial sectors.  Previously, a joint ESB/Electric Ireland microgeneration support scheme for the domestic sector offering a total of 19c/kwh (comprising 10c/kwh from ESB Networks combined with the 9c/kwh from ESB Customer Supply (now Electric Ireland)) ran for 3 years (February 2009-February 2012) and had a take up of between 500 and 600 installations.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has been asked to provide my Department with analysis of other means through which the microgeneration sector could be supported, apart from through a feed-in-tariff funded from the Public Service Obligation.  In 2009, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) initiated a pilot microgeneration programme.  This involved 42 installations of various microgeneration technologies.  A final monitoring report on the performance of the installations and learning from the programme is awaited from SEAI.  This will inform future policy development.  In view of falling technology costs, the Department has also asked SEAI to update analysis on the costs of varying levels of support for microgeneration technologies, with a view to considering how the sector could be supported in the future.</p></reply>

When a micro-generator has been installed and ESBN have received payment for the import/export meter along with the necessary Electro-Technical Council of Ireland (ETCI) electrical certification, ESB Networks will install import/export metering. ESBN have informed us that the average connection time is 10 days approximately.  There is no charge to connect a micro-generator to the Distribution Network provided it complies with EN50438.  The draft European standard EN 50438 outlines the requirements for the connection of micro-generators in parallel with public low-voltage distribution networks and defines micro-generation as a source of electrical energy and all associated equipment designed to operate in parallel with the low voltage system, rated up to and including:</p><p>- 25A at low voltage[230V], when the network connection is single phase, or</p><p>- 16A at low voltage [230/400V], when the network connection is three phase.</p><p>  After the meter has been installed the customer must contact their electricity supplier regarding payment arrangements for any electricity that is exported to the grid.  The customer will need to have an agreement with their electricity supplier to purchase the electricity exported and to supply the electricity imported.  Both import and export must be with the same supplier.  The approach to supporting micro-generated electricity production in Ireland is not out of line with other EU States.</p></reply>

The aim is to attract matching funding from the private sector, such that the overall amount available for investment is greater than &euro;70 million.</p><p>  The Fund will be managed by an independent third party, not by a Government agency.  Government will be represented in its capacity as an investor in the Fund, on the same basis as other investors in the Fund.</p><p>  NewEra has been asked by Government to coordinate Government activities in ensuring that the Fund is established and appropriately managed, and has been meeting with sector participants and parties with experience in making and managing investments in the energy efficiency sector.</p><p>  While renewable energy can play a part in energy efficiency projects it is not envisaged that projects that are solely renewable energy based (without seeking, at the same time, to reduce energy consumption) will be financed by the Fund.</p><p>  The Fund will be supported by the creation of a National Energy Performance Contracting Policy Framework, which will standardise energy performance contracting in Ireland and provide a robust process for establishing the investment-ready projects.  Work on the Framework is well advanced with a public/private group established late last year.</p><p>I intend to launch the details of the Fund alongside the second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan tomorrow.  As part of the launch I will also issue a call for exemplar projects to test the Framework.</p></reply>

Section 29 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999, together with some more specific provisions such as section 27(3D)(b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, provide that an early plea of guilty should, as a general rule, be taken into consideration by the court when determining the appropriate sentence (in cases other than where the sentence is fixed by law).

The Scheme provides, inter alia, for the introduction of attachment of earnings to recover unpaid fines from a person's earnings. The Scheme also recasts a number of the key provisions in the Fines Act 2010, including those relating to the payment of fines by instalments (section 15).  Whereas under the 2010 Act, a person had to apply to the court to be permitted to pay a fine by instalments, the Scheme provides that this will become an automatic right. Given this significant change to the nature and scope of the instalment provisions in the Act, it is not my intention to commence section 15 until after it has been amended. I hope that it will be possible to enact the Fines (Amendment) Bill during 2013.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>  I can also advise the Deputy that the number of persons in custody at any one time for non payment of fines is but a fraction of the overall prisoner population. To illustrate this point, on 25 February 2013, 22 people (0.05%), out of a prison population of 4,261 in custody that day fell into this category.</p><p>  I am also committed to pursuing alternatives to custody.  The Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011 requires judges when considering imposing a sentence of imprisonment of 12 months or less to first consider the appropriateness of community service as an alternative to imprisonment.  It is expected that these measures, taken together, will all but eliminate the need to commit persons to prison for non-payment of fines.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

The Bill is, therefore, a key component of the Government's strategy to reduce legal costs in this country by way of increasing our competitiveness, both sectorally and nationally.</p><p>  The Legal Services Regulation Bill makes extensive provision, particularly in Part 9, for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients. The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles. These are contained in Schedule One and enumerate the various matters that may be taken into account if disputed costs are submitted for adjudication. These cost transparency measures will apply to barristers as well as to solicitors. </p><p>  Under the Bill it will no longer be permissible to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business. It will no longer be permissible to charge Junior Counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees. Legal practitioners will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients. This will be in the form of a Notice written in clear language which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions. Among other things, the Notice must, as set out in Section 90 of the Bill, disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not practicable, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated. A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client. When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs the Bill provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question. </p><p>  The Bill also provides that a new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator will deal with disputes about legal costs &#8211; at present these are dealt with by the Office of the Taxing-Master. The new Office, headed by a Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator, will modernise the way disputed legal costs are adjudicated with greater transparency.  The Office will be empowered to prepare Legal Costs Guidelines. It will establish and maintain a publicly accessible Register of Determinations which will include the outcomes and reasons for its determinations about disputed legal costs. Two new Taxing-Masters have been appointed by public competition under the enhanced qualification criteria of Part 14 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 to prepare the way for these modernisation measures. </p><p>  Taking account of developments and the pressures being experienced by legal practitioners in other open common law jurisdictions the Bill seeks to address the danger of Irish law firms and legal practitioners operating at a cost disadvantage.  Several types of new alternative business structure models have been, or continue to be, rolled-out in England and Wales, Scotland, Australia, Germany, Netherlands and parts of Canada in direct competition with Irish legal service providers - for example, solicitors, accountants and insurers practising as one business or &quot;multi-disciplinary practice&quot; providing their complementary services in a pooled and more cost-effective setting.  In other provisions the Bill lifts existing restrictions on direct professional access to a barrister and on barristers who share premises or costs from advertising themselves as such a group. The Bill also allows that a barrister in employment may provide legal services for his or her employer.   The Bill, therefore, contains numerous measures aimed at opening up the provision of legal services to more responsive and more competitive legal service models building on the enormous advances that have been made in supporting business technologies. </p><p>  Through its extensive legal costs transparency provisions and its provision for modern and more competitive business alternatives, the Legal Services Regulation Bill is providing an opportunity to ameliorate the cost to business and other consumers of legal services while also creating new business opportunities for the legal services sector. I am confident that this concerted approach to reducing legal costs will be of lasting benefit to all consumers of legal services and contribute to our early national economic recovery.  <b><font color="#000080">      </font></b></p></reply>

However, I refer the Deputy to my reply below to Parliamentary Questions No. 54456 of 4 December 2012, No. 2999 of 22 January 2013 and No. 4077 of 5 February 2013. The position is unchanged since then.<blockquote>  &quot;The Government has undertaken in its Programme for Government to ensure that people of non-faith or minority religious backgrounds and publically identified LGBT people should not be deterred from training or taking up employment as teachers in the State.<br /><br /><br />  I have previously expressed concern about the potential impact of section 37 of the Employment Equality Acts on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons. This section is designed to allow schools and other institutions to maintain their religious ethos. It was examined by the Supreme Court in 1996 when the Employment Equality Bill of 1996 was referred to it under Article 26 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court found that it is a reasonable balancing in legislation of the different rights involved, including chiefly the right to earn a living and the rights to freedom of religion and association. I am concerned however that, in practice, the balance is not a fair one and that in practice this provision can operate in a way that is unfair to LGBT persons. I consider that an extensive consultative process and formal assessment of the options should be undertaken. It is therefore my intention to ask the new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commissioners to examine the issue as a priority and to report on their views and recommendations to the two Ministers centrally concerned, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn and myself as the Minister for Justice and Equality and to the House. I am committed to bringing forward Government proposals for any necessary anti-discrimination amendment to this provision once this consultation process is completed  .&quot;</blockquote>  Concerning Section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act 2000, I refer the Deputy to my reply below to Parliamentary Question No. 53036 of 27 November 2012. My position remains unchanged.<blockquote>&quot;Equal status legislation aims to strike a necessary and appropriate balance between the right to the free profession and practice of religion, recognised by the Constitution and the principle of equality and has done so by providing a qualified exception, of limited scope, in Section 7(3) of the Equal Status Act 2000. A denominational primary or post-primary school may, under this provision, admit pupils of one religious denomination in preference to others and may refuse to take someone who is not of that denomination if this is essential to protect its religious ethos. Application of this provision is, moreover, subject to review by a court or tribunal, such review being on an objective basis and having regard to the need to reconcile the various constitutional rights involved. I have no plans at present to amend these provisions of the Equal Status Act.  &quot;</blockquote></p></reply>

Judge Quirke has been asked to examine how, taking into account the McAleese Report, the Government might best provide supports (including health services such as medical cards, psychological and counselling services and other welfare needs) for the women who need such supports as a result of their experiences.</p><p>  Judge Quirke has also been asked to advise on identifying the criteria and factors to be taken into account (such as work undertaken in the Laundries for no remuneration).  He will advise on the operation of the Fund and, in particular, the nature and amount of payments to be made out of the Fund.  A decision will be made on its detailed operation when he reports back in 3 months time.</p><p>  Women who have already received payments under the Redress Scheme are not being excluded. There is one small area of possible overlap.

While we do not have full details, we have reason to believe that women prisoners on release from prison did go there. It would also appear that women convicted of criminal offences might agree to reside there as an alternative to a term of imprisonment.  It was designated under section 108 of the Children Act 1908 for female, non Catholic children under 17 years, charged with criminal offences who might be remanded there or ordered to be kept there for a period not exceeding one month. </p><p>  Bethany Home was not a prison and did not have any of the restrictions normally associated with such an institution.  From the 1930s it was based in a house in Orwell Road, Rathgar.  My Department has not received any complaints regarding the treatment of any of the females who were there and who had links with the criminal justice system.  If the Deputy has any evidence of specific abuses with relation to this category of people, I would be happy to receive it.</p><p>  While this aspect of their work with women from the criminal justice system continued after the establishment of the Bethany Home, it would appear that the vast majority of its work (over 90%) related to maternity cases and acting as a home for infants up to three years old.  There were a significant number of Mother and Baby homes including the Bethany Home operating in the State at the time. </p><p>  However Mother and Baby homes do not have any of the characteristics  associated with a Magdalen Laundry - that is women working without pay in a laundry in an enclosed institution.  Magdalen Laundries did not accept pregnant women or young infants.  I understand that the Bethany Survivors Group do not argue that their situation is identical to that of the Magdalen Laundry survivors.</p><p>  The question of the inspection of maternity homes falls to the Department of Health.</p><p>  If the Deputy has any information that criminal offences having been committed, she should report the matter to the Garda&iacute; for investigation.</p></reply>

It has been raised by consumer groups and by the media, as well as in successive reports of the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman, which has previously noted:<blockquote>The current economic climate has affected many consumers across the range of complaints received, however it is most pointedly seen in the complaints regarding investments products. The main area of complaint with regards to investments is the alleged mis-selling of these policies. This complaint type accounted for over 37% of investment complaints for the period 2007-2010. The majority of complaints relate to the consumers&#8217; contention that they were sold unsuitable products.</blockquote>Its biannual review for July to December 2012, the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman again highlighted the mis-selling of financial products, noting that &quot;Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) complaints, representing 32% of all insurance complaints in 2012, have increased by 216% on 2011 figures&quot;, from 405 in 2011 to 1,280 in 2012, and that, &quot;in general, the main feature of the complaints concern the suitability of PPI for the consumer and the consumer's knowledge or lack thereof that they agreed to and paid for the product in the first instance&quot;.  I am also aware that the Central Bank has sought a review by banks of the sale of PPI and the refund of customers who could never claim under that insurance as purchased.</p><p>  While it is not under the aegis of my Department, the Financial Services Ombudsman was established under the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004 and became operational on 1 April 2005.  It is a statutory body funded by levies from the financial service providers.  The Financial Services Ombudsman can investigate, in an impartial and independent manner, complaints from individual customers and small businesses who have unresolved disputes with Financial Service Providers who are either regulated by the Financial Regulator or are subject to the terms of the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  Under current law, the Financial Services Ombudsman may not investigate a matter which occurred more than six years before the complaint is made.  This is in line with the limitation period for most civil claims in the courts, including contract.  This limitation period is provided for under section 57BX of the Central Bank Act of 1942, as amended by section 16 of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004.  The relevant provision states:<blockquote>&quot;(3) A consumer is not entitled to make a complaint if the conduct complained of&#8212;(<i>a</i> ) is or has been the subject of legal proceedings before a court or tribunal, or<br /><br />(<i>b</i> ) occurred more than 6 years before the complaint is made, or<br /><br />(<i>c</i> ) relates to a matter that is within the jurisdiction of the Pensions Ombudsman, or<br /><br />(<i>d</i> ) is of a class prescribed by Council.&quot;</blockquote>I would also point out that the statutory functions of the Financial Services Ombudsman Council include the keeping under review of the efficiency and effectiveness of the Office of the Ombudsman and advising &quot;the Minister for Finance, either at the Minister's request or at its own initiative, on any matter relevant to the Ombudsman's operation&quot;.  It would seem, therefore, open to the Council to make any relevant recommendations concerning the current limitation period that it considers appropriate to the Minister for Finance, who will be best placed to inform the Deputy whether or not such matters have so come to his attention.  I am aware that a different approach has been taken to this issue in the United Kingdom.  While consumers in that jurisdiction must bring complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service within six months of the final response letter from the business concerned, no limitation period applies to the matters on which the complaints are based.  The Law Reform Commission has made recommendations in relation to enhancing the coherence of the broader limitation of actions regime in its Report on the Limitation of Actions of December 2011 and in relation to the limitation period applicable to contract law which could have a bearing on the matters of concern to the Deputy.

Where a child is taken into the care of the state, the policy of the HSE is to place him/her in care settings, preferably in foster care, as close as possible to their home and community.  The age for all young people to leave the care of the state is 18 years, unless they a leave care prior to turning 18 years of age.</p><p>  As regards  separated children seeking asylum (SCSA), their immediate and ongoing needs, as well as their application for refugee status are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE) in accordance with the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) and the Child Care Act, 1991.  Where children are identified by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, at the point of entry as unaccompanied minors, the circumstances are investigated and if there are any concerns about the welfare of the child, they are placed into the care of the HSE.  Young children are always placed with foster carers, and older young people are either placed with a private foster company or, by their own preference, in dedicated children's  residential accommodation.  On reaching 18 years of age, or on completing their second level education during their 18th or 19th year, they are then referred by the HSE to the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA).  The Reception and Integration Agency arranges for their transfer to adult accommodation and service provision in the direct provision system.  </p><p>  The HSE and the RIA have an agreed policy in relation to the accommodation of separated children seeking asylum who reach the age of 18 years and there is regular liaison between the two agencies.  I am advised by the Department of Justice that  detailed discussions take place  between the Separated Children's Team in the HSE and RIA, to ensure the best RIA centre match for the young adult concerned.  RIA provides these young adults with full board and accommodation in a direct provision centre.  In practice and with the agreement of the Department of Justice, the HSE has retained young adults in after care for various durations and in very exceptional circumstances, for example where there is severe disability or serious mental or physical health issues.  In addition, the   HSE is committed to ensuring continuity of care for all young people who are undertaking their leaving certificate and therefore interprets &quot;18th birthday&quot;  as the end of a school year/leaving certificate year following their 18th birthday.  Any change of placement would only be in exceptional circumstances and in the young person's best interests.</p></reply>

The purpose of foster care inspections is to review compliance with regulations and standards for all children.  HIQA's inspection methodology includes interviewing HSE managers and social workers, a sample of children, carers and birth parents and review a range of files, including complaints.</p><p>  Foster care services in HSE Dublin North West Area have been inspected by HIQA on three occasions since September 2009, the most recent of which took place in October 2012.  Some progress was noted particularly in the area of foster carer assessment, approval and training with all general foster carers approved and significant improvements in the area of relative foster carers.  Some 96 % of children in foster care had been visited by a social worker within the preceding six months. </p><p>  Notwithstanding such progress, I was concerned to note that inspectors found that some deficits identified previously had not been rectified.  Inspectors found that there were inadequacies in systems to assess risk and to investigate and take timely action in response to concerns.  File keeping, data collection and analysis were also found to be lacking.</p><p>  The inspection found that sufficient foster carers have not been recruited within the area and this has provided difficulties in making placements and matching children with particular needs with the most suitable carers.  Recruitment of foster carers is of concern more generally and it is intended to conduct a national recruitment campaign in the coming months.    </p><p>  There were 38 complaints or allegations about 27 foster carers reviewed by HIQA. 34 complaints were investigated and 4 were underway.  Ten concerns relating to child welfare and 7 related to physical abuse were confirmed. Investigations were underway in the remaining cases. </p><p>  An Action Plan to address the weaknesses identified was prepared by HIQA.  In order to ensure that the Action Plan is fully implemented, I have requested that the HSE set up a high level oversight process to be lead by the Head of Quality Assurance to ensure implementation of all the HIQA recommendations.  I intend that this oversight process will provide regular updates to both me and HIQA on the implementation of the Action Plan.  Yesterday I met with Mr Gordon Jeyes Chief Executive Designated of the Child and Family Support Agency to review the actions underway to address the critical issues identified.</p><p>  An important finding in this inspection report is that many foster carers were providing high quality care and children's needs were being met.  Foster carers were committed and child centred in their approach.  They saw themselves as advocates on behalf of the child and availed of every opportunity to promote the child's best interests to achieve better outcomes.</p></reply>

In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultation.

Under this  facility, prescriptions for certain drugs and medicines may be renewed on a three monthly, rather than a monthly, basis.  Patients who are stabilised on their medication do not need to visit their General Practitioner (GP) every month in order to have their prescriptions renewed.  The facility to change prescriptions from monthly to quarterly for suitable patients provides efficiencies for GPs and patients, by reducing unnecessary consultations and journeys to the surgery and pharmacy.  In addition, Regulation 7(5) of the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003 as amended provides that prescriptions for medicinal products are valid for a period of six months from the date specified on the prescription.  Prescriptions for Controlled Drugs, which are listed in Schedule 2 and 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1988 as amended, are valid for fourteen days from the date on the prescription.</p></reply>

Approximately 20 will be offered to the market subject to a) agreement between the local GPs and the HSE on active local GP involvement in the centres and b) site suitability and availability.  The HSE is currently analysing the available sites in each location and engaging with the GPs in each location to determine their interest in participating in the primary care centre development.</p><p>  The HSE is also engaging with the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) as required to progress Primary Care Centre Public Private Partnership.  The NDFA as a centre of expertise will be responsible for the delivery of the Primary Care PPP programme on behalf of the HSE, including the management of the procurement phase and the provision of financial advice including a Value for Money assessment.  It has been reviewing the processes involved in procurement of PPP projects with a view to streamlining the process and delivering projects more quickly.  The preparatory work for the primary care centre project which precedes signing of any PPP agreements is well underway.  While it is not possible, at this time, to give start and completion dates for any of the individual 20 potential locations, the best estimate is that these primary care centres will be completed by late 2016.</p></reply>

The one remaining individual isÂ employed in connection with the preparation and attendance at the State&rsquo;s defence of High Court proceedings due to their specialised knowledge of the legislation concerned.</p><p>Of the others, five Radio Officers were rehired to fill essential vacancies in the Coast Guard until such time as recruitment processes for replacements could be completed.Â  One aeronautical engineer was rehired temporarily for the Air Accident Investigation Unit.Â  The other retired officials wereÂ contracted to carry out specific short term exercises.Â  These have all completed their work and are no longer employed in the Department.</p><p>The details of rehired staff and their renumerationÂ areÂ set outÂ in the table below.
