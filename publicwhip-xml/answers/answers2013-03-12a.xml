Implementation of the Action Programme is a high priority for Government as a key element of the overall reform agenda. This involves a substantial body of legal and other work to ensure that the necessary measures are in place ahead of the 2014 local elections. </p><p>  In order to meet that timeframe, work has been advancing quickly in a number of areas including in relation to local authority mergers in Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford; an independent review of local electoral areas by a statutory committee; integration of local micro-enterprise support service with local government through Local Enterprise Offices; the introduction of the local property tax to replace the household charge; continuing implementation of Local Government Efficiency Review measures, a Workforce Planning process, and implementation of the Steering Group report on the alignment of local/community development with local government. </p><p>Comprehensive, wide-ranging and detailed legislation will be required to provide for the range of measures in the reform programme,   and I am firmly committed to ensuring that it will be brought forward for enactment in good time before the 2014 local elections.</p></reply>

The Programme, worth &euro;49m in 2013, is managed by Pobal on behalf of my Department and delivered at a local level by the nationwide network of Local Development Companies and a small number of alternative delivery structures.  The services delivered by Local Development Companies cross Local Authority and County boundaries. It is not possible, therefore, to provide a county breakdown of the LCDP budget on the basis requested in the question.  I will circulate the Programme budget allocations for each Local Development Company for 2013 and their respective Programme administration costs with the official report.  In addition, a further &euro;1.44 million   has been allocated for the delivery of LCDP services in the Gaeltacht Areas and &euro;700,000 for the Dublin Inner City area. Administrative costs charged against the Programme are currently capped at 33% with the objective of reducing that figure to 25% by 2014.  In addition, Companies are expected to achieve further savings in overhead and operating costs including, where possible, sharing Local Authority facilities.</p><p><bu>Appendix 1</bu></p><p><table><tr><th colspan="2"><div>2013 Allocation to Local Development Companies under <br />the Local and Community Development Programme </div></th></tr><tr><td>Avondhu/Blackwater Partnership Limited </td><td>&#8364;419,374 </td></tr><tr><td>Ballyfermot/Chapelizod Partnership Company Limited </td><td>&#8364;635,116 </td></tr><tr><td>Ballyhoura Development Limited </td><td>&#8364;444,994 </td></tr><tr><td>Ballymun/Whitehall Area Partnership </td><td>&#8364;739,693 </td></tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown Area Partnership Limited </td><td>&#8364;907,555 </td></tr><tr><td>Canal Communities </td><td>&#8364;875,475 </td></tr><tr><td>Bray Area Partnership Limited </td><td>&#8364;839,483 </td></tr><tr><td>Breffni Integrated Limited </td><td>&#8364;741,784 </td></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Development Partnership Limited </td><td>&#8364;536,428 </td></tr><tr><td>Cill Dara Ar Aghaidh Teoranta </td><td>&#8364;1,020,227 </td></tr><tr><td>Clare Local Development Company Limited </td><td>&#8364;855,341 </td></tr><tr><td>Comhar Chathair Chorcai Teoranta </td><td>&#8364;1,211,826 </td></tr><tr><td>Comhar na nOilean Teoranta </td><td>&#8364;527,272 </td></tr><tr><td>County Kilkenny Leader Partnership Company Limited </td><td>&#8364;607,813 </td></tr><tr><td>County Sligo Leader Partnership Company Limited </td><td>&#8364;690,262 </td></tr><tr><td>County Wicklow Community Partnership Limited </td><td>&#8364;584,686 </td></tr><tr><td>Donegal Local Development Company Limited </td><td>&#8364;966,071 </td></tr><tr><td>Fingal Leader Partnership Company Limited </td><td>&#8364;363,686 </td></tr><tr><td>Forum Connemara Limited </td><td>&#8364;233,227 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway City Partnership Limited </td><td>&#8364;765,644 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway Rural Development Company Limited </td><td>&#8364;896,437 </td></tr><tr><td>Inishowen Development Partnership </td><td>&#8364;644,728 </td></tr><tr><td>IRD Duhallow Limited </td><td>&#8364;387,147 </td></tr><tr><td>Laois Community and Enterprise Development Company Limited </td><td>&#8364;564,064 </td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim Integrated Development Company Limited </td><td>&#8364;618,509 </td></tr><tr><td>Longford Community Resources Limited </td><td>&#8364;603,076 </td></tr><tr><td>Louth LEADER Partnership </td><td>&#8364;1,390,383 </td></tr><tr><td>Mayo North East Leader Partnership Company Teoranta </td><td>&#8364;562,019 </td></tr><tr><td>Meath Community Rural and Social Development Partnership Limited </td><td>&#8364;346,264 </td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan Integrated Development Limited </td><td>&#8364;668,578 </td></tr><tr><td>North &amp;

The RAPID programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclus ion in RAPID areas nationally. The programme has made substantial progress in identifying the needs of disadvantaged communities and in bringing forward appropriate local projects in response to those needs.   </p><p>My Department&#8217;s funding for 2013 includes an indicative allocation of more than &#8364;2 million for RAPID, which will be used to meet the Department&#8217;s existing contractual commitments on RAPID projects throughout the country, mainly Sports Capital top-ups a nd CCTV systems, jointly funded with the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Justice and Equality respectively.   </p><p>  My Department is not in a position separately to meet the salary costs, for 2013, of RAPID coordinators, who are local authority employees , and information on the current number of coordinators employed by local authorities is not available to me.   In 2011 and 2012 Local Authorities received funding for 50% of the salaries of 46 RAPID co-ordinators, totalling &#8364;1.58m in 2011 and &#8364;1.62m in 2012. The Local Government Fund continues to provide significant general purpose funding to local authorities to assist in meeting day-to-day operational costs.   The RAPID programme like other community development programmes will now be taken forward in the context of alignment of Local Government and Local Development in the context of the Local Government Reform Programme <i>Putting People First</i> .   </p></reply>

None of these important measures, whether it is the regeneration of seriously disadvantaged communities, the provision of special needs accommodation, retrofitting of older houses or the adaptation or improvement of private houses, can be stood down.  My objective is to ensure that our scarce resources are used to best effect in areas where need is most acute. </p><p>  This year I am allocating 12.4% of the housing budget, some &euro;34.2 million in all, to the grant schemes compared to 13.2% in 2012. I n allocating the available funding across all 34 city and county councils I did so in as transparent and as fair a way as possible. This year&rsquo;s allocations give first priority to those people who have already been approved for grants. This accounts for some &euro;18 million of the &euro;34.2 million available to me. After setting aside a contingency figure of around &euro;2 million, I allocated the balance on the basis of each authority&rsquo;s share of the applications on hand in January 2013. I believe this is a fair way of apportioning the funding. In the event that particular difficulties may arise in some local authorities in the course of 2013, I will use the reserve I have held to consider applications from local authorities for a supplementary allocation once the initial allocation has been exhausted.   </p><p>  I am currently reviewing the way the grant schemes are structured with a view to achieving more with the budget we have and ensuring that the maximum numbers of households are supported. My priority is to spread the benefits as widely as possible and to ensure fairness and value for money in the operation of the grant schemes. My intention is that the new grant structure will apply from 2014 onwards.</p></reply>

Over 200 responses were received and are currently under consideration. The results of this exercise will inform the drafting of the general scheme of a Bill to update the consent system for developments on the foreshore. I hope to bring the general scheme of this Bill to Government in the near future, with a view to publication later in the year. The Bill will seek to integrate the existing foreshore consent system within the planning system operated by the local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la. </p><p>  Ports strategy is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, who has recently undertaken a major review of ports policy. The new policy is designed to provide a coherent framework for all the State-owned ports and allow for their future development in a manner that suits their individual circumstances.  My Department was consulted on a range of issues, including the foreshore consent process, during the drafting of the policy. I understand that the new policy will be published as soon as possible following consideration by Government.   </p></reply>

Demand has been confirmed by local authorities for 1,314 of these units, for 637 of which discussion/negotiation has begun. Housing authorities have been assessing the suitability of the units identified with regard to location, local demand, the nature and type of the accommodation and sustainable communities&rsquo; principles. </p><p>  At the end of 2012, 179 properties had been delivered from the NAMA portfolio for social housing purposes. 57 properties were bought directly by local authorities with another 57 properties purchased directly by Approved Housing Bodies (AHB) through the Capital Assistance Scheme. A further 65 properties were secured by AHBs through a variety of leasing arrangements.

Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date is liable to pay the Household Charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver. It is a matter for an owner of a residential property to determine liability and pay the Charge.   The Local Government Management Agency is administering the Household Charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils.  I understand, from data provided by the Agency,   that as of 6 March 2013 the number of registrations, including waiver registrations, for the Household Charge is 1,167,332.   I will make a table available, with the official record, detailing the total number of payments and waivers registered for the Household Charge nationally and by local authority area.  The figures are also presented as a percentage of the estimated total number of liable properties nationally and per local authority area.</p><p>Overall, compliance continues to grow and now stands at over 72%.  The compliance rate from local authority to local authority varies considerably, however, from 87% in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown to 61% in Donegal. It is a matter for each individual local authority to use the provisions of the legislation, combined with their local knowledge and judgement, to increase compliance.  I expect that local authorities will use the available compliance avenues to the fullest to assist in funding the essential local services which are important for the well-being of every household and community.</p><p>I urge all liable persons who have not paid the Charge to visit www.householdcharge.ie or contact their local authority as a matter of urgency. Residential property owners who are unsure of their liability should also contact their local authority.</p><p>Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, Household Charge arrears for 2012 , including penalties and interest, will be capped at &euro;130 if paid by 30 April 2013.   Outstanding Household Charge liabilities will, on 1 July 2013, be increased to &euro;200 and will be come a Local Property Tax liability collectable by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p><table><tr><th>County/City Council </th><th><div>Estimated number of liable properties </div></th><th><div>Total registered (paid + waivers) </div></th><th><div>Registrations as a % of total estimated liable properties </div></th></tr><tr><td>Carlow </td><td><div>18,257 </div></td><td><div>13,131 </div></td><td><div>72% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td><div>25,611 </div></td><td><div>18,165 </div></td><td><div>71% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Clare </td><td><div>45,786 </div></td><td><div>34,982 </div></td><td><div>76% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork City </td><td><div>41,649 </div></td><td><div>29,043 </div></td><td><div>70% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork County </td><td><div>143,887 </div></td><td><div>99,452 </div></td><td><div>69% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td><div>65,331 </div></td><td><div>39,719 </div></td><td><div>61% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City </td><td><div>190,685 </div></td><td><div>142,373 </div></td><td><div>75% </div></td></tr><tr><td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown </td><td><div>74,390 </div></td><td><div>64,739 </div></td><td><div>87% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Fingal </td><td><div>90,286 </div></td><td><div>64,821 </div></td><td><div>72% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway City </td><td><div>27,086 </div></td><td><div>21,481 </div></td><td><div>79% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway County </td><td><div>62,851 </div></td><td><div>44,776 </div></td><td><div>71% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry </td><td><div>58,792 </div></td><td><div>45,061 </div></td><td><div>77% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td><div>68,215 </div></td><td><div>48,075 </div></td><td><div>71% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny </td><td><div>32,067 </div></td><td><div>22,889 </div></td><td><div>71% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Laois </td><td><div>26,185 </div></td><td><div>17,445 </div></td><td><div>67% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td><div>13,069 </div></td><td><div>9,639 </div></td><td><div>74% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City </td><td><div>20,380 </div></td><td><div>14,592 </div></td><td><div>72% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick County </td><td><div>46,473 </div></td><td><div>33,288 </div></td><td><div>72% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Longford </td><td><div>12,928 </div></td><td><div>9,620 </div></td><td><div>74% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td><div>41,176 </div></td><td><div>26,771 </div></td><td><div>65% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td><div>51,363 </div></td><td><div>41,631 </div></td><td><div>81% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td><div>60,652 </div></td><td><div>40,590 </div></td><td><div>67% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td><div>20,176 </div></td><td><div>14,583 </div></td><td><div>72% </div></td></tr><tr><td>North Tipperary </td><td><div>24,839 </div></td><td><div>18,865 </div></td><td><div>76% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Offaly </td><td><div>25,224 </div></td><td><div>16,455 </div></td><td><div>65% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon </td><td><div>23,888 </div></td><td><div>18,030 </div></td><td><div>76% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td><div>25,281 </div></td><td><div>19,299 </div></td><td><div>76% </div></td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin </td><td><div>81,822 </div></td><td><div>54,494 </div></td><td><div>67% </div></td></tr><tr><td>South Tipperary </td><td><div>30,368 </div></td><td><div>21,735 </div></td><td><div>72% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City </td><td><div>15,753 </div></td><td><div>11,059 </div></td><td><div>70% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford County </td><td><div>24,777 </div></td><td><div>17,271 </div></td><td><div>70% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td><div>29,872 </div></td><td><div>21,245 </div></td><td><div>71% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford </td><td><div>56,030 </div></td><td><div>38,812 </div></td><td><div>69% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow </td><td><div>45,665 </div></td><td><div>33,201 </div></td><td><div>73% </div></td></tr><tr><td>National </td><td><div>1,620,814 </div></td><td><div>1,167,332 </div></td><td><div>72% </div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The guidelines are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy development and the treatment of planning applications for such developments.</p><p>  To ensure that Ireland continues to meet its renewable energy targets and, at the same time, that wind energy does not have negative impacts on local communities, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and other stakeholders, is undertaking a targeted review of certain aspects of the Wind Energy Guidelines 2006.</p><p>  This focused review will examine the manner in which the Guidelines address key issues of community concern such as noise, proximity and visual amenity and any other potential impacts, as considered appropriate, as well as ways of building community support for wind energy development.</p><p>  The press notice - issued on 30 January 2013  &#8211; marks only the initial stage in that review process. It is essentially a pre-draft consultation intended to inform the preparation of revised draft guidelines. This early consultation allows for the public and other stakeholders to input into the process at an early stage. Other stakeholders that will be consulted include the Environmental Protection Agency and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.</p><p>  All statutory planning guidelines issue first in draft form for public consultation over a period of a couple of months. Once the consultation period is closed the submissions received on the draft guidelines are considered and taken into account in the final form of the guidelines. The draft guidelines will &#8211; like all other new or revised guidelines &#8211; go out for extensive public consultation for a period of 6 weeks to 2 months. The indicative timetable for the publication of the draft guidelines is Quarter 4 2013.</p><p>  Planning legislation provides for extensive public notification of proposed development at the development management stage, including proposed development for wind energy purposes. For example, article 17 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 &#8211; 2010 requires an applicant to erect a site notice in order to lodge a valid application for planning permission. Article 19 of the Regulations requires that this notice must be placed in a conspicuous position on or near the main entrance from a public road to the land or structure concerned, so as to be easily visible and legible by persons using the public road. Alternatively, if the land or structure does not adjoin a public road, the site notice should be placed so as to be easily visible and legible by persons outside the land or structure. The site notice must contain the date on which the site notice is erected and state that the planning application may be inspected or purchased at the offices of the planning authority and that a submission or observation in relation to the application may be made to the authority in writing, on payment of the prescribed fee, within the 5 weeks beginning on the date of receipt by the planning authority of the application. The applicant must erect the site notice no sooner than<b></b>2 weeks before making the application for permission in order to facilitate third party inspection of the application. Where it appears to a planning authority that any notice does not comply with these requirements, it may require the applicant to give further notice and evidence in relation to compliance with such a requirement.</p><p>  Article 18 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2006 also provides that a notice be published in a newspaper approved for this purpose. Each planning authority must decide which newspapers should be included on its approved list of newspapers to ensure that the newspapers used for the purpose of such notices have a sufficiently large circulation in its functional area.</p><p>  In addition the planning authority must, under section 34(3) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, have regard to any observations or submissions received concerning the proposed development in accordance with the relevant regulations.</p><p>  Any person who makes a submission to the planning authority may appeal the decision of the planning authority to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. The Board in some instances, at its own discretion, holds oral hearings in relation to cases being considered by it, further adding to the opportunities to participate in the decision-making process.</p></reply>

In that statement, a copy of which is available on my Department&#8217;s website (), I pointed out that Ireland already has a challenging greenhouse gas mitigation target for 2020, which is binding under EU law. Compliance with that target is not an option; it is absolutely paramount and any ambition we set at a national level must, and will, respect compliance with this fundamental mitigation commitment and future increases in ambition. As can be seen in Head 3 of the outline Heads of the Bill, the legislation being developed by Government will be unequivocal on compliance with existing and future obligations of the State under EU law and any international agreement to which the State becomes a party.</p><p>  Overall, the outline Heads reflect a strongly progressive approach to the fundamental challenge of greenhouse gas mitigation, having regard to Ireland&#8217;s distinctive greenhouse gas emissions profile and the challenges it presents for the agriculture and food sectors, in particular. Looked at in isolation, the formal construct of Head 4 for legal drafting purposes may not convey the true extent of the ambition being set by Government. However, when looked at in the broader context of all proposed provisions, particularly those in Head 5, and the parallel advances in policy development, the progressive and highly ambitious agenda now proposed by Government is clear.  The proposed provisions in Head 5 would place a statutory obligation on Government to adopt and implement national and sectoral plans to enable the State to transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy in the period to 2050.</p><p>  In anticipation of the planned legislation, work on the development of key sectoral mitigation plans has already been initiated.  In the update on progress on the development of national climate policy and legislation which I issued on 28 December 2012, I announced that Departments with responsibility for key sectors in the transition to a low carbon economy had already been tasked with the preparation of individual 2050 low-carbon roadmaps. This step in the overall policy development process provides an opportunity for the Departments concerned, who are best placed in terms of ownership and understanding of their sectors, to lead the process of framing the low-carbon vision/objective for their sectors and to undertake the evaluation that is necessary to develop a robust and cost-effective policy platform for delivery of that vision in their area.</p><p>  The key sectors are energy/built environment, transport and agriculture. While near zero carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions in 2050 should set the context for the energy/built environment and transport sectoral roadmaps, generally reflecting the ambition at EU level, carbon neutrality is considered to be the more appropriate approach in the case of the agriculture sector.</p><p>  The objective is to finalise these sectoral roadmaps &#8211; including a reasonable period of public consultation in the fourth quarter of this year. These sectoral roadmaps are an essential first step towards development of an overall national 2050 roadmap to a low-carbon society with a competitive low-carbon economy being finalised by my Department in early 2014.</p><p>  Consistent with the Government commitment to Ireland&#8217;s obligations under EU Decision 406/2009/EC and its progressive approach to the development of national climate policy, the focus for securing compliance with EU law in the period to 2020 will be on domestic mitigation rather than the purchase of additional carbon credits.</p></reply>

In addition to policy analysis by the Secretariat to the National Economic and Social Council and the public consultation which I undertook in 2012, I stated very clearly that the third pillar of the approach would be the pursuit of sectoral mitigation progress through the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and the Green Economy, based on positive engagement with the relevant Departments in whose sectoral areas progress must be made if we are to meet our binding targets under EU law.</p><p>  Significant moves forward have been made under this third pillar of the policy development agenda. In the update on progress on the development of national climate policy and legislation which I issued on 28 December 2012, I specifically addressed the sectoral challenge. Responding to the strong case made by the NESC Secretariat for the national climate challenge to be reframed &ndash; moving beyond a sole compliance approach, and re-focussing on a whole-of-government and societal agenda &ndash; I announced that Departments with responsibility for key sectors in the transition to a low carbon economy had already been tasked with the preparation of individual 2050 low-carbon roadmaps.

To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs. The social housing capital budget has been reduced from &euro;1.535 billion in 2008 to &euro;332.7m in 2012, with an anticipated outturn of some &euro;299m for 2013, and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities are forced to operate, the projected outcome for 2012 is expected to be in the region of 4,000 to 4,500 housing units. Given the current volatility of the market and different challenges to the channels of supply, it is difficult to estimate the likely output of new units for social housing this year. However, it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure delivery of housing units for social purposes.</p></reply>

Responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations rests with the owner of a building and with the builder/developer who carries out the construction works.</p><p>  Enforcement of the Building Regulations is primarily the responsibility of the 37 local Building Control Authorities who have strong powers to serve enforcement notices for non-compliance or to institute proceedings for breaches of regulatory requirements within a period of five years from the date the building has been completed. Building Control Authorities have successfully used such powers to achieve compliance.  However, my Department has no direct involvement in these matters.</p><p>  Homeowners and indeed their public representatives should report any concerns about non-compliance with the Building Regulations to the local Building Control Authority.</p><p>  Remediation of defects is a matter for resolution between the parties concerned, namely the owner and the builder/developer and their insurers.  In the event that a satisfactory resolution cannot be achieved through dialogue and negotiation the option of seeking a civil legal remedy can be considered.</p><p>  I have recently established the Pyrite Resolution Board under the chairmanship of Mr. John O&rsquo;Connor, former Chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, to oversee and ensure the effective implementation of a pyrite remediation programme for homeowners who have no alternative avenues for redress.  I am confident that the Board will require compliance with normal procurement procedures. I have also appointed four other Board members, who together with the Chairman, have the particular range of skills and experience to ensure that the public interest, and the interest of the affected homeowners, will be well served.  The Board will be working closely with the not-for-profit entity, which will be established by the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Concrete Federation and HomeBond to deliver an efficient and effective remediation scheme.</p><p>  Work is underway by the Pyrite Resolution Board on developing the scope and detail of a pyrite remediation scheme.  Issues in relation to testing for pyritic heave, eligibility criteria for homeowners, public procurement, certification, warranties and other key concerns will be considered by the Board in the context of its work.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there is an adequate legislative and financial system in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation.</p><p>  My Department provides 100% capital funding to housing authorities for the provision of new and refurbished Traveller-specific accommodation, such as halting sites and group housing schemes. Traveller families are also accommodated in local authority social housing dwellings, which are funded through the main local authority social housing programme. The most recent Housing Needs Assessment has shown that the vast majority of Travellers have opted for standard housing. Nevertheless, Traveller-specific accommodation continues to be provided by housing authorities, and funded by my Department, to meet the accommodation needs of those Travellers who opt for such accommodation.</p><p>  Between 2007 and 2012, &euro;170 million was allocated by my Department to local authorities for the provision of Traveller-specific accommodation. Funding under the Traveller Accommodation Programme is allocated annually to housing authorities based on the programmes submitted to my Department for the year in question. It is then a matter for housing authorities to progress those projects for which an allocation was provided and to arrange for the appropriate and timely drawdown of the funding from my Department.</p><p>  My Department carefully monitors the drawdown of expenditure and progress generally under the Traveller Accommodation Programme.

The requirements of the Building Regulations are set out in 12 parts (classified as parts A to M) addressing the legally enforceable performance standards which a completed building must achieve. My Department publishes a Technical Guidance Document (TGD) to accompany each part of the regulations outlining how the legal requirement may be achieved in practice. Part B/TGD B addresses the requirements in relation to Fire Safety.</p><p>  Primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings. Implementation of enforcement measures is a matter for the local building control authority.  Local authorities have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement as Building Control Authorities under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2007, and as Fire Authorities, Planning Authorities and Housing Authorities under other Acts relevant to the built environment. I am aware that local authorities have used such powers on a number of occasions where circumstances have given rise to concern and I expect local authorities to continue to use all of the powers currently available to them to address serious building defects.</p><p>  Neither I nor my Department have any function in relation to assessing, checking or testing compliance, or otherwise, of specific works or developments under the Building Control Acts or the Fire Safety Acts.</p><p>  My Department is currently engaged in a review of Part B/TGDB.

The most recent EPA report <i>Ireland&#8217;s Environment 2012 &#8211; An Assessment</i> states that the majority of groundwater bodies ( 85.6% ) are in good status as required under the Water Framework Directive. The general reduction in nitrate concentrations in groundwater observed in recent years has been attributed to the dilution effect of increased rainfall, reductions in inorganic fertiliser, improvements in organic fertiliser storage and the implementation of land-spreading restrictions.</p><p>  Groundwater quality is dependent to a large extent on the quality of surface water and so the upgrading of septic tanks and of waste water treatment plants can be expected to contribute to   improved groundwater quality.</p><p>  The priorities in my Department&#8217;s Water Services Investment Programme include the provision of works required to comply with Water Framework Directive requirements, to improve sewage treatment and collection infrastructure in accordance with the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, to respond to judgments of the European Court of Justice and to achieve environmental and public health objectives arising from various regulations and EPA reports dealing with water quality. A total of &#8364;328.7 million in Exchequer funding is being provided for water services capital investment this year including investment under the Rural Water Programme. My Department also provides funding from the Local Government Fund towards the operational costs of group water schemes.</p><p>  Over the past decade, substantial improvements have been made in the group water sector, reflected in improved infrastructure and management and leading to greater compliance with water quality standards. This has been accomplished through a partnership approach between my Department, the water services authorities and the group water sector itself, with the support of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes. My Department is committed to ensuring that the substantial progress made in the group water sector is sustained over the coming years.</p><p>  The implementation of the <i>National Inspection Plan 2013: Domestic Wastewater Treatment Systems</i>, published recently by the Environmental Protection Agency, will also contribute to the existing range of measures in place to improve and protect our water quality.</p></reply>

Kerry. There are 94 landholders associated with the pilot scheme at Mount Gable. The scope of the scheme at Carrauntuohill required review , as it was not feasible to progress a pilot access scheme there in isolation from the rest of the MacGillcuddy Reeks. Subject to the consent of landowners and with community support , it is intended to expand that scheme to include an area of approximately 100 square km stretching from the Gap of Dunloe in the east to Glencar in the West. This comprises almost the entire MacGillicuddy Reeks. Discussions with landowners and other stakeholders are on-going.</p><p>  Mountain access areas are by their nature sensitive habitats, and as such, great care must be taken to ensure that proposed developments do not generate negative consequences and lead to environmental degradation and habitat destruction. It is clear that some upland areas and mountains , and their unique ecosystems and habitats, are already suffering damage from recreational activity ; a properly constructed and funded Mountain Access Scheme offers an opportunity to address these matters, while also generating significant potential for tourism and recreation related job creation and associated development opportunities, in rural areas.</p><p>  A requirement of the proposed scheme is that participating landowners are protected against any potential claim arising from an accident or injury to a hill walker and while it has not proved possible to reach consensus on all aspects of the scheme to date, discussions with the farming organisations on the scope and scale of such protection are continuing.      </p><p>  Given the significant benefits that can accrue from an agreed community based Mountain Access Scheme   I am committed to ensuring that outstanding issues relating to its implementation on a national  basis will be resolved as soon as possible. </p></reply>

The difficulties facing the State&rsquo;s finances and the necessity to reduce public expenditure to sustainable levels are impacting on capital programmes all across the public service. My Department&rsquo;s housing programme is no exception. The level of capital funding available has decreased significantly in recent years along the lines highlighted in the <i>Medium Term Exchequer Framework for Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016.</i> Regrettably these steps are necessary to bring stability to the public finances. As a result, capital spending on housing programmes in 2013 is down on last year.</p><p>Reduced capital budgets inevitably give rise to difficult choices and decisions in allocating the available funding. This means balancing a dwindling capital budget across a range of important areas, and spreading those scarce resources in a way that meets the needs of those concerned as best we can. In addition to the Private House Grants, the capital budget needs to cover regeneration, improvements, energy retrofitting of the social housing stock and meeting the needs of older people and people in social housing with disabilities. For this I have allocated &euro;167m in 2013.</p><p>This year I am allocating 12.4% of the housing budget, some &euro;34.2 million, to the grant schemes compared to 13.2% in 2012. In allocating the available funding across all 34 city and county councils, I did so in as transparent and as fair a way as possible. In framing the 2013 allocations my Department wrote to each Local Authority requesting details of the numbers and value of grants where work had been approved to commence. Between them, local authorities reported contractual commitments in respect of approved grants totalling &euro;18 million. Local authorities were always encouraged to maintain continuity in terms of approving and paying grants and commitments carried forward into the new financial year always had first call on the available funding. This year each authority was allocated the full amount of their contractual commitments. Only one local authority, Laois County Council, reported a zero commitment for grants approved. The balance of the available funding was allocated on the basis of each authority&rsquo;s share of the new applications on hand in January 2013. I believe this is a fair way of apportioning the funding. I appreciate that this approach has resulted in lower than expected allocations for some authorities.</p><p>I accept that particular difficulties may arise in some local authorities in the course of 2013 and I have a contingency in place to deal with this. I have set aside a capital reserve of around &euro;2 million and I will consider applications from local authorities for a supplementary allocation once the initial allocation has been exhausted. I am currently reviewing the structure of the scheme with a view to achieving more with the decreasing budget and ensuring that the maximum numbers of households are supported. My priority is to spread the benefits as widely as possible and to ensure fairness and value for money in the operation of the grant schemes. This will involve an in-depth analysis of relevant factors which impact on the demand for grants, the scope and extent of eligible works and the level of grant payments to individual applicants. My intention is that the new grant structure will apply from 2014 onwards.</p><p>The detailed information in relation to the combined Exchequer plus local authority own resources allocations for the years 2012 &ndash; 2013 is set out in the following table:</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Local Authority</b></th><th><b>2012 Allocation</b></th><th><b>2013 Allocation</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>Carlow </b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;1,349,014</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;747,078.97 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Cavan </b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;1,625,000</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;1,038,155.24 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Clare</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;1,445,000</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;1,445,000.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Cork </b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;6,250,364</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;4,561,159.71 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Donegal</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;2,448,146</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;827,280.49 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>D&#8217;Laoghaire/Rathdown</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;1,110,602</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;731,197.36 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Fingal</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;2,072,365</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;1,588,467.61 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Galway</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;2,375,000</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;1,644,386.59 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Kerry</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;3,257,865</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;1,445,971.16 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Kildare</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;2,025,000</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;2,025,000.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Kilkenny</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;1,867,500</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;1,406,161.86 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Laois</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;1,084,827</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;260,923.46 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Leitrim</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;576,305</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;65,953.25 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Limerick</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;1,473,454</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;1,473,455.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Longford</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;1,243,575</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;687,674.34 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Louth</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;1,186,266</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;1,103,144.70 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Mayo</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;2,575,216</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;2,575,216.25 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Meath</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;997,208</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;487,123.12 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Monaghan</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;1,152,172</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;837,210.57 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>North Tipperary</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;1,200,000</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;425,757.37 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Offaly</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;1,125,000</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;625,000.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Roscommon</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;1,009,251</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;709,956.68 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Sligo</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;997,684</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;276,983.80 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>South Dublin</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;2,728,308</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;1,213,986.05 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>South Tipperary</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;3,111,713</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;1,087,988.81 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Waterford</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;994,766</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;414,024.05 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Westmeath</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;988,155</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;435,722.48 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Wexford</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;2,566,772</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;1,210,764.56 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Wicklow</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;954,794</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;567,117.69 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Cork City</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;1,749,741</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;1,749,741.25 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Dublin City</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;10,629,459</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;4,932,319.56 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Galway City</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;928,352</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;301,280.08 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Limerick City</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;1,525,000</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;1,010,884.61 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Waterford City</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;740,282</b></div></td><td><div>&#8364;348,841.83 </div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Sligo Borough Council</b></td><td><div><b>&#8364;385,844</b></div></td><td>( with Sligo Co   Co figure for 2013)  </td></tr></table></p></reply>

In 2013, the funds raised by the tax will accrue to the Exchequer. Should a disproportionate number of liable owners living in the functional area of a given local authority defer payment of the tax in 2014 or subsequent years under Part 12 of the 2012 Act, those deferrals will have a financial impact on that local authority. As the rate of deferral will not be known until individual homeowner LPT returns are made to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners by 28 May 2013, it is not possible to estimate the potential implications for any particular local authority.</p><p>  As regard local authority services, I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including:</p><p>-   A more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services;</p><p>-   Greater local scope for financial decision making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and</p><p>-   A strengthening of democracy at local level and a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates &ndash; a stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.   </p></reply>

The regulations I introduced in early 2012 under the Dog Breeding Establishments Act, 2010 stipulate that all dogs held in such establishments be microchipped once they reach 8 weeks of age or when a dog is moved from the establishment. This initiative will result in more and more dogs being microchipped over time.  To be properly effective, the compulsory microchipping of dogs should be supported by the development of registration systems for all dogs. It would also be necessary to have the co-operation of the dog-owning public in updating such registrations where ownership changes. These are large projects which would involve a significant investment of time and funding, but they remain under consideration by local authorities and my Department.</p><p>  Mandatory microchipping of all dogs will not in itself eliminate the problem of sheep worrying. The key to tackling this issue is responsible dog ownership. Dog owners should recognise the issues involved and their responsibilities to ensure that their dogs are controlled at all times, especially at night time and, most especially, before and during the lambing season. My Department is in dialogue with farming representatives regarding the promotion of such behaviour by dog owners.  A dog warden may seize any dog and detain it in order to ascertain whether an offence is being , or has been , committed under the Control of Dogs Act, 1986. This facilitates a dog warden in ascertaining whether a dog has worried livestock, in which case the owner or any other person in charge of the dog is liable to be found guilty of an offence.   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-12a.136.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1098" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013031200054#WRC03000"><p>It may be helpful to clarify for the Deputy that CSO tourism statistics for 2011 were in all cases published in 2011 and 2012, and that it would be inaccurate to suggest that CSO visitor statistics for 2011 have only now been published.  Currently, the CSO produces three sets of statistics on Tourism. The first, Overseas Travel,  which is published on a monthly  basis (based on a three month rolling  average),  is based  on the Country of Residence Survey (CRS) and provides  estimates  of  the  residency of tourists, i.e. where tourists to Ireland  are coming  from.  This is important information in helping to determine the key markets for tourists coming to Ireland and also helps to identify new and emerging markets. Data for the period November 2012 to January 2013 was published on 27th February.</p><p>  The second data source  is based on the Passenger Card Inquiry (PCI) and gathers important information on the profile and expenditure of tourists coming to Ireland and Irish residents holidaying abroad. For example, in respect of tourists coming  to Ireland, it highlights the mode of travel into  the  country, the route, residency, the reason for the journey, the type  of accommodation used, the average duration of stay and most importantly expenditure.</p><p>Both the CRS and PCI are frontier surveys, conducted at point of entry Air and Sea ports. The Tourism &amp; Travel release in respect of 2011 was published in September of last year. The 2012 Annual Tourism &amp; Travel release will be published before the end of this month.  Thereafter, data will be published quarterly.  The third source of data on Tourism is the Household Travel Survey, which is a postal survey  of  Irish  households  and  this  covers domestic trips within Ireland  by  Irish  residents  and  also provides additional information on international  travel  by Irish residents. The 2011 Household Travel Survey was published on 11 October of last year and results in respect of 2012 will be published before the end of May. After this data is released, data will be published on a quarterly basis.</p><p>  By any measure, these represent a comprehensive set of surveys to measure the industry, both in respect of domestic, inward and outbound tourism. The CSO  has  been engaged with the Department of Transport, Tourism &amp; Sport in examining  new  data needs and will be publishing new additional data (at a national  level)  in respect of key markets (France/Germany/Italy/Australia and  New Zealand) in terms of numbers of trips, the reason for the journey, average duration, reason by area of residence and expenditure. We will also introduce new tables showing expenditure cross classified by reason and by residence and trips by reason and by area of residence. This additional new detail will be published later this month.</p><p>  The Country of Residence Survey (CRS) has a sample size of 426,000 per annum.  The Passenger Card Inquiry (PCI) has a sample size of approximately 184,000 per annum. The Household Travel Survey samples in excess of 55,000 households per annum.  By international standards these sample sizes are extremely large.  The UK International Passenger Survey (the UK equivalent of the CRS and PCI) has a sample size smaller than that of Ireland, at 304,000, despite the difference in population.</p><p>  It can be noted that the domain of Tourism statistics is subject to EU regulation. The benefit of this regulatory framework is that it ensures a range of comparable statistics on Tourism across EU member states. The range and detail of information published by the CSO exceeds that required by EU regulation. However, it will never be the case that the CSO, whose remit is official statistics, will provide information to meet all demands. In the case of Tourism statistics, Failte Ireland also carries out  their  own  surveys  and  research including the Survey of Overseas Travellers, the Visitor Attitudes Survey and surveys of accommodation providers, which give further  detail  on  aspects such as visitors&rsquo; motivation for holidaying in Ireland,  activities  undertaken,  destinations  visited  and accommodation used. Such information complements the data produced by the CSO.  The CSO is always open to engagement with users of its statistics regarding data needs.</p></reply>

Civil society organisations play an important role in bringing citizens together to act collectively and participate in the development of their own countries and communities.  They have a strong role to play in demanding better services from the state and holding governments to account.</p><p>  In some developing countries, civil society organisations have come under increasing pressure in recent years as they seek to play their legitimate role in society.  In these countries, dialogue with civil society organisations is limited and the space for civil society engagement remains narrow or is, in some cases, shrinking.  This can severely limit the operations and effectiveness of organisations, notably those working on human rights and advocacy.</p><p>  Ireland has a long tradition of supporting civil society engagement.  Through the Government&#8217;s aid programme, we work to protect the space in which civil society organisations operate, and to foster an enabling environment for the work.  We channel a higher proportion of our development assistance through civil society organisations than other international donors.  Of Ireland&#8217;s total aid budget of &#8364;623 million this year, about a quarter will be channelled through civil society organisations to support their valuable work in, for example, improving access to health care and education, supporting livelihoods, and strengthening accountability, governance and democracy.  Tr&oacute;caire and a number of other organisations, such as Christian Aid and Frontline Defenders, are specifically funded by my Department to promote and facilitate strong civil society engagement across a range of countries.</p><p>  In Ireland&#8217;s nine partner countries, where we have a commitment to long term strategic assistance, we also provide funding to local civil society organisations.  This enables their participation at local and national levels of decision-making and their work for the fulfilment of human rights, especially for the most vulnerable.  Ireland&#8217;s partnerships in these countries are founded on respect for human rights, and we will continue to emphasise in our dialogue with partner governments that it is essential to ensure the role of civil society organisations is enhanced.</p><p>Internationally, by signing up to the 2011 Busan Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation, we have agreed to implement fully our commitments to enable civil society organisations to exercise their role as independent development actors.  At the most recent formal meeting of EU Development Ministers, in Luxembourg last October, I gave strong support to new Council Conclusions on Europe's engagement with civil society.  These commit Member States &#8220;to support and promote an enabling environment for an independent, pluralistic and active civil society in partner countries&#8221;<i>.  </i>The EU will work to improve dialogue with civil society organisations on the ground, and will continue close monitoring of legislation, regulations and other restrictions on the operation of civil society organisations in our partner countries.</p><p>  Ireland&#8217;s membership of the UN Human Rights Council presents a valuable opportunity to build on our contribution to the promotion and protection of an enabling environment for civil society.  We intend to advance this issue during our term on the Council, following a successful meeting on consolidating the space for civil society which Ireland organised during the September 2012 Human Rights Council session.  Ireland is also championing the UN Universal Periodic Review mechanism which reviews all member states&#8217; human rights records, including the treatment of civil society actors and human rights defenders.</p><p>The Government will continue to promote civil society-led initiatives and support other arrangements at national and international level to promote and monitor an enabling environment for civil society organisations.</p></reply>

In particular, I welcome the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework Agreement for the DRC and the Region, which was concluded in Addis Ababa on 24 February, in the presence of the UN Secretary General.  This important Agreement was reached by the Government of the DRC and ten neighbouring and regional countries.  The co-guarantors of the Agreement are the African Union, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and the United Nations.  It follows a brutal campaign of violence in eastern DRC by the so-called M23 group, which escalated in April 2012 and which has led to the deaths of many innocent civilians, appalling abuses of human rights and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people from their homes.  I would like to pay tribute to the work of the UN Secretary General and leaders of the countries of the Great Lakes region for their patient, intense mediation and negotiation efforts to try to broker a comprehensive framework for peace in the region.</p><p>  The adoption of the Agreement was welcomed on behalf of the EU in a joint statement by High Representative Catherine Ashton and Development Commissioner, Andris Piebalgs.  I am in full agreement with the statement which calls on all sides to continue negotiating in good faith and to refrain from violence.</p><p>  In the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s own words, a lasting solution requires at least four essential elements.  It must be anchored in the political will of the leaders of all countries in the region.  It must address the structural causes fuelling instability in the DRC itself.  It must respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity and legitimate concerns and interests of all concerned countries.  It also demands the commitment and long-term support of the international community.</p><p>  The Agreement contains important commitments from the Government of the DRC, from its neighbours and regional partners and from the international community.  However, as the Secretary General has also stressed, it represents the start of the process rather than the end.  Lasting peace will only be secured in the DRC if the Agreement is implemented in full and the opportunity it presents is fully grasped by all parties involved.</p><p>  The UN Secretary General plans to appoint a Special Envoy who, together with the relevant parties, will support the implementation of the Agreement.  He is also proposing the establishment within the UN mission, MONUSCO, of an Intervention Brigade to address security aspects of the crisis more comprehensively.</p><p>  The European Union will continue to play a constructive role, working through political and diplomatic engagement, development cooperation programmes, and support for MONUSCO.  The EU is also pursuing security sector reform programmes, through its Common Security and Defence Policy missions in the DRC.</p><p>  Ireland will also continue to play its part.  We are contributing a number of military observers to the UN Mission and over the past year Ireland has provided over &euro;10 million in assistance to those worst affected in the DRC.  This assistance has been channelled through the UN, international organisations, and our NGO partners.  Last week, we allocated a further &euro;3.8 million for humanitarian relief efforts in the DRC over the coming period. </p></reply>

Ireland works in nine Programme Countries mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and all our aid programmes are targeted at the poorest and most vulnerable.  Regular dialogue is an essential part of the work of our Embassies in their engagement with partner Governments.  The promotion and protection of human rights, equitable development and the eradication of poverty are important components of this dialogue.</p><p>  Our engagement is undertaken both bilaterally as well as jointly with other diplomatic missions, especially resident EU missions.  It includes meetings at the highest level, such as with the Head of State, Government Ministers and the Legislature, on a wide range of issues - political, economic and development.  Engagement also takes place through the various aid coordination mechanisms established at national and local level to oversee the implementation of development programmes funded by Ireland and other development partners.  Continuous assessments on governance conditions in our Programme Countries, including respect for human rights, are a part of this engagement.</p><p>  As well as monitoring progress, we also actively support the promotion of human rights and equality in our Programme Countries in a number of important ways.  This includes assistance to partner Governments in their work to eradicate poverty and promote and protect human rights, gender equality and the rule of law.  We support oversight institutions such as National Human Rights Institutions and Ombudsmen, as well as non-governmental organisations and others to advance human rights and equality, especially for the most vulnerable.  We also support national Parliaments, which are the cornerstone of democracy and good governance.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s current membership of the United Nations Human Rights Council provides a further opportunity to play a vibrant role in the promotion and protection of human rights worldwide, including in our programme countries.  We remain committed to a strong multilateral human rights system which can impartially monitor the implementation of human rights norms. In particular, Ireland is championing the UN Universal Periodic Review mechanism which reviews all member states&rsquo; human rights records.</p><p>  At the European Union level too, Ireland is playing a full and active part in ensuring human rights are advanced in our Programme Countries.  Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s determination to promote human rights and democracy through all its external actions.  Ireland, together with other EU Member States and the European Commission, agreed an EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy last year.  By working together effectively in promoting human rights, we believe our impact will be greater.</p></reply>

While the situation regarding the flag protests has been calmer in recent weeks, we remain fully engaged in our support of the work of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  The persistence of sectarianism in Northern Ireland, with the absence of political agreement on how to make progress towards a truly reconciled society, contributes to the likelihood of incidents such as those we have witnessed in recent weeks.  While we continue to work in support of efforts to address the root causes of sectarianism, it is vital that the rule of law is respected and that the PSNI is fully supported in implementing the rule of law. </p><p>  In addition to these issues, the focus of political leadership in Northern Ireland should be on maintaining and creating jobs through economic recovery, in which inward investment and tourism play such a crucial role.

The &euro;20 billion reduction in market borrowing requirement over the next decade to which the Deputy refers was calculated by comparing the estimated borrowing requirements from the market to finance the payments on the Promissory Notes under the previous arrangement to the requirements under the existing arrangement in which a portfolio of Irish Government bonds has replaced the Promissory Notes.</p><p>  The reduced borrowing requirement over the next 10 years arises due to a number of factors, the most significant of which is the fact that capital repayments are not required to be made over the period.  The borrowing requirement from the market is also reduced by the lower interest rate arrangement on the new bonds.</p><p>  Key assumptions applied to the calculation include a forecasted 6 month Euribor curve, forecasted ECB and sovereign refinancing rates and forecast of payments from the Central Bank of Ireland to the State.  Economic growth, net present value and inflation were not used in the calculation.

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  The USC is a tax payable on all gross income.  However, there are a number of exemptions and reliefs from the USC.  There is a lower exemption limit, which from 1 January 2012 is &euro;10,036 per annum, &euro;193 per week.  In addition, individuals in receipt of a full medical card or aged 70 years and over are not liable to the top rates of USC if their income is not exceeding &euro;60,000 per annum.</p><p>  In addition, it is important to point out that payments from the Department of Social Protection are exempt from the USC.  Furthermore, such payments will not be taken in to account in determining if an individual has exceeded the &euro;10,036 threshold.</p><p>  Finally, the introduction of further tax reliefs on the lines you suggest could not be justified given the current budgetary position and the need to provide equity between all citizens based on their level of income.  As the Deputy will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones.  The Deputy will also appreciate that I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer.  Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

However, the Group recognised the considerable pressures on the public finances and the need to bridge the gap between expenditure and revenue.  For this reason, the Group suggested that consideration be given to phasing in deductibility over a period of years.  The Group also considered that it is for Government, having regard to the prevailing budgetary situation, to decide on the time span for phasing-in deductibility and on what percentage of LPT to allow as a deduction from gross rents for tax purposes.  There is no provision in the current legislation for such deductions.  While it is the intention of the Government to introduce such a provision on a phased basis, neither the manner in which this will happen or the timing have yet been decided.</p><p>Listed in tabular format are the details of the cost of drivers for each Minister of State at my Department in the years 2010, 2011, 2012 and to date in 2013.

This will ensure a measure of certainty for all property owners. </p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners have prepared valuation guidance which, taken together with the owner&rsquo;s own knowledge of the property, will assist him or her in assessing its value.

The Act does not confer any preferential creditor status on the Revenue Commissioners, other than that which they would have in the normal course of events.  The usual rule is that the priority of a Revenue charge vis-&agrave;-vis other parties who also have a charge on the property will depend on the timing of the various charges.  Therefore, in the event of a repossession or forced sale of the property, the proceeds must be used to discharge charges in the order in which those charges arose.  The Revenue Commissioners will only have preferential creditor status over a mortgage provider where the LPT liability was due and payable before the mortgage provider advanced a loan in respect of the property.    On that basis, unpaid charges for LPT should not have an effect on currently outstanding mortgages.</p></reply>

The 30% rate of mortgage interest relief for those who took out their first qualifying home loan between 2004 and 2008 came into effect with the enactment of the Finance Act in March 2012. The regulations governing mortgage interest relief provide for the granting of the relief due to the borrower by the lender within the tax year. </p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that to apply the new 30% rate, specific technology developments were required to Revenue&#8217;s and to each of the lenders computer systems. While Revenue&#8217;s computer system was upgraded in late 2011 the speed of upgrading across the lenders was inconsistent. For that reason in January 2012, as an interim relieving measure, Revenue advised lenders to grant tax relief at the rate of 25% to those entitled to the new 30% rate of relief, given that the 25% rate was already a feature of the first time buyer mortgage interest relief regime and was not dependent on new IT upgrades taking place.</p><p>  Due to ongoing technology problems, Ulster Bank was unable to implement the 30% rate until the end of 2012 but did pay the interim 25%, as advised by Revenue, throughout the year.

It is important not to lose sight of what this CRD package is really about:  It is about protecting taxpayers into the future by building stronger European banks. We have seen how banks went into the financial crisis without sufficient capital and had to be bailed out by taxpayers across the EU. These new rules will make sure that our banks can better withstand future crises. CRDIV is also about providing a foundation for banking union and giving the future single supervisor a single rule book. The proposed rules on bonuses are part of the CRD package of measures to  better manage risk taking by banks. The aim is to make sure that bankers are taking decisions in the long term interest of the stability of the bank and that this is taken into account in their remuneration package.    The agreement reached on remuneration contains the following principles:</p><p>- a basic ratio of pay to bonus of 1:1 which can only increase to 1:2 with shareholder approval (with a quorum of 50% of shareholders, 66% of votes in favour would be required, and, if that quorum is not reached, 75% of votes in favour).</p><p>- in order to incentivise deferral of bonus pay, and facilitate claw-back of remuneration, a portion of the total bonus can consist of long term financial instruments, discounted with reference to factors reflecting risk inherent in the instruments (guidelines on the applicable discount factor will be issued by EBA).</p><p>- the EU Commission shall review and report on the application of these provisions, in close cooperation with the EBA, taking into account its impact on competitiveness and financial stability. </p><p>   ECOFIN on 5 March asked Member State's Ambassadors to finalise the negotiations with the Parliament on the basis of these principles.</p><p>  What is clear from discussions at EcoFin is that Member States want to move ahead to finalise these new capital rules. We hope to iron out the outstanding technical issues with the Parliament over the coming weeks so that we can finalise this key file during our Presidency.</p></reply>

The DGS is administered under the Deposit Protection Account by the Central Bank of Ireland and is funded by the credit institutions covered by the scheme.  The Deposit Protection Account (DPA) at the Central Bank covers retail deposits up to &euro;100,000 for all institutions regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.  This includes branches of Irish institutions operating in other EU Member States.  However, it should be noted that Eligible Liabilities Guarantee (ELG) deposits at the covered institutions, amounts above &euro;100,000 held at other institutions or corporate deposits at other institutions are not included.</p><p>The operation of the Deposit Protection Account is governed under European Communities (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Regulations 1995 (SI No. 168 of 1995).  The following table below shows the balance held at year-end in the Deposit Protection Account at the Central Bank of Ireland.  Each deposit-holding institution is required to maintain a balance on their DPA account of 0.2% of their total deposits (with a minimum amount of &euro;50,000 in the case of all institutions except credit unions). This percentage is calculated annually in December. Interest is paid by the Central Bank on the DPA balances (1).</p><p>In the following table, it is shown that at the end of 2012, the Central Bank held &euro;379 million, which represented 0.2% of the &euro;190 billion on deposit in Ireland at the end of 2012.  It is true to say that this was down 12.9% from the &euro;435 million held by the Central Bank at the end of 2011, which represented deposits of &euro;218 billion.  The decline in the DPA balance reflects the drop in deposits in Irish credit institutions.</p><p>DPA Balances</p><p><table><tr><th>Year End</th><th>Banks</th><th>Credit Union</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>379,390,200.00</td><td>23,633,580.57</td><td>403,023,780.57</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>434,740,900.00</td><td>0</td><td>434,740,900.00</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>537,900,500.00</td><td>0</td><td>537,900,500.00</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>608,262,200.00</td><td>0</td><td>608,262,200.00</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>669,408,300.00</td><td>0</td><td>669,408,300.00</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>526,093,100.00</td><td>0</td><td>526,093,100.00</td></tr></table></p><p>A comparison between the figures for deposits covered by the Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS) and the statements from my Department on the level of deposits in general is not entirely comparable. The Department of Finance Deposit Note on Deposit Trends at Irish Covered Banks of 14 February 2013 to which I presume the Deputy refers in his question, concentrates solely on the covered institutions - that is AIB Group, Bank of Ireland Group and permanent tsb.  Thus it covers both the DGS and the Eligible Liabilities Group (ELG) as covered in Ireland and the UK and to corporate and retail deposits at the three covered institutions.</p><p>I would also refer to the latest available figures from the Central Bank of Ireland, released on 28 February 2013 &quot;January 2013 Money and Banking Statistics&quot;, which show that Deposits from households were 1.2% higher on an annual basis at end-January 2013, while deposits from insurance corporations and pension funds and Other financial intermediaries increased by 8.2%. Deposits from Non-financial corporations rose by 5.2% over the same period.</p><p><i>(1)  Section 4 of the Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Act 2009 for credit unions provides that from 30 November 2012, each credit union will be required to maintain in the Deposit Protection Account at the Central Bank of Ireland, an amount equal to 0.2% of the deposits and shares held on behalf of members.</i></p></reply>

The administration of this scheme is the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners. A list of the bodies that qualify for the scheme is available on Revenue's website at the following link: http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/authorised-charities-resident.html.  For donations made pre-2013, the precise arrangements for allowing tax relief vary depending on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer only, a chargeable person subject to self-assessment or a company. For a PAYE only donor, the relief is given on a &ldquo;grossed up&rdquo; basis to the eligible charity or approved body, as the case may be, rather than by way of a separate claim to tax relief by the donor. The claim for refund is made by the eligible charity or approved body in respect of a PAYE donor. In the case of a self-assessed donor, that individual claims the relief and there is no grossing up arrangement. In the case of a company, it will claim a deduction for the donation as if it were a trading expense.</p><p>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that their obligation to observe confidentiality for charities and small groups of taxpayers would preclude them from disclosing the amounts of tax relief allowed to individual approved bodies under the donations scheme. However, they have provided details of the total amounts refunded under the scheme, in respect of PAYE donations only, to approved bodies during 2010 and 2011 and these are shown in the following table:</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Amount</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>&#8364;30.2m</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&#8364;26.3m</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This legislation provides for tax relief for health expenses incurred in the provision of health care. Health care is defined for the purposes of that legislation as the prevention, diagnosis, alleviation or treatment of an ailment, injury, infirmity, defect or disability and includes care received by a woman in respect of pregnancy.  Health care does not include routine ophthalmic or dental treatment.   The section provides that tax relief must be either for the costs of the services of a practitioner, defined as a person registered on the register established under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, or diagnostic procedures carried out on the advice of a practitioner, which includes &ldquo;physiotherapy or similar treatment prescribed by a practitioner&rdquo;.  Eligibility for tax relief is limited to expenses relating to treatment considered necessary and appropriate by a qualified practitioner.</p><p>  Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 consolidated all previous legislation pertaining to relief for health expenses, in particular section 12 of Finance Act 1967 which introduced the relief in the first instance.  This section also required that physiotherapy or similar treatment be prescribed by a practitioner before qualifying for relief.  This requirement has, therefore, been part of the qualifying criteria since the introduction of relief for health expenses and I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that guidance and instructions to staff have remained unchanged in this regard.</p><p>  For 2010 the cost of tax relief for health expenses was &euro;127 million and was availed of by 36,000 individuals who had sufficient income to benefit from a claim.  There is no specific breakdown in these figures of the costs related to physiotherapy.</p><p>  The costs of the relief, if self-referral for physiotherapy was allowed, would be unquantifiable but it would be expected to increase the overall cost to the Exchequer.  While the Government supports measures to lower the cost of medical treatment which should in turn lower the costs of health care provision by the State, an amendment as requested by the Deputy, if passed, would inevitably lead to calls for other treatments to similarly qualify for relief, which would greatly increase the overall cost of the scheme.  In addition, it would inevitably lead to self-diagnosis of ailments which could have dire consequences for patients where their own diagnosis proves incorrect and they have embarked on the wrong treatment in the absence of the correct medical advice.</p></reply>

This is based on personal income tax returns filed by non-PAYE taxpayers and information on gross profits derived from corporation tax returns for the year 2010.  The tax year 2010 is the latest year for which the necessary detailed information is available.   The gross income from all sources returned by self-employed individuals engaged in this activity for 2010 was &euro;94 million and the corresponding gross trading income returned by companies engaged in this activity for 2010 was &euro;894 million.</p><p>  Figures are rounded to the nearest million.</p><p>  As regards the largest earnings of the traders involved, the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; obligation to observe confidentiality for taxpayers and small groups of taxpayers would preclude them from giving this information.</p><p>  The sector identifier used on the tax records is based on the 4 digit &ldquo;NACE code (Rev. 1)&rdquo; which is an internationally recognised economic activity code system. The NACE codes are not essential for the assessment and collection of taxes and duties and the correct allocation and maintenance of these codes is subject to the limit of available resources. NACE code classifications on tax records are compiled by reference to the primary area of economic activity reported by individual and corporate taxpayers on their own behalf and the taxes collected are allocated to those codes without reference to the precise economic activity which generated them.</p><p>  While the accuracy of the NACE codes on tax records is sufficient to underpin broad sector-based analyses there will undoubtedly be some inaccuracies at individual level. This should be borne in mind when considering the information provided. The sector identified for this reply represents the closest equivalents in the NACE code system to the sector mentioned in the question.</p></reply>

I understand that the available information on possible losses to the Exchequer relates only to cigarettes. A survey in respect of 2011 carried out for the Revenue Commissioners and the Health Services Executive found that some 770 million illicit cigarettes were consumed in the State. This would indicate a loss of the order of &euro;258 million, in excise duty and VAT, in that year. A similar survey was undertaken in 2012 and the results are being compiled at present.</p><p>  I am advised also that the Revenue Commissioners do not have information on the loss caused to legitimate businesses by the illicit tobacco trade. They are, however, conscious of the threat that this criminal activity poses to law-abiding retailers, and taking action against it is a high priority for them. Revenue&rsquo;s programme of action resulted in the seizure of over 95 million cigarettes and 5,276 kilograms of tobacco in 2012, and 132 convictions for smuggling or sale of illicit cigarettes or tobacco were secured during the year.</p></reply>

As the previous contract recently expired, the Commissioners published an invitation to tender on the etenders website (etenders.gov.ie) on 8 February 2013, in line with standard procurement procedures.    In this invitation to tender, the Revenue Commissioners are seeking to establish a multiparty framework agreement comprising suitably qualified and experienced valuers to provide the Commissioners with independent expert advice where valuations of residential property, commercial property and development lands are being challenged by Revenue in connection with certain taxes and duties that they administer.  The title of the tender is &ldquo;Valuations of all Forms of Residential Property, Commercial Property and Development Land&rdquo;.  I am advised that the deadline for responses to the invitation to tender is 5 pm on Wednesday 20 March 2013.</p><p>  Finally, I am advised by the Commissioners that Local Property Tax (LPT) is a self-assessed tax so in the first instance it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  The Revenue Commissioners will not be valuing individual properties for LPT purposes.</p></reply>

There are standard rules which apply to the distribution of the assets of companies in liquidation and it would not be appropriate for me to interfere with these rules.  However the State does intervene to ensure that statutory redundancy is available through the Social Insurance Fund and that arrears of pay, sick pay, holiday pay or pay in lieu of statutory notice (limited to EUR600 per week up to a maximum of eight weeks) are payable from the Insolvency Payments Scheme.  The Minister for Social Protection will rank as a preferential creditor of IBRC in respect of any payments made to employees of IBRC from the Social Insurance Fund or the Insolvency Payments Scheme.  Any action taken by the Minister which might divert the assets from IBRC creditors to employees could be challenged in the Courts.</p><p>  The special liquidators were promptly in contact with staff on Thursday 7th February and, unlike in other liquidations, the majority of employees have now been re-hired by the special liquidators, for a minimum period of 3 months, to provide some level of assurance and to ensure an orderly wind-down of the business. In addition, some staff may, in time, be re-hired by NAMA or other purchasers of the assets. This should provide some reassurance to employees.</p><p>  The Special Liquidators have said that it is their key priority that all employees are fully kept up to date on all developments during the course of the special liquidation. They have indicated that their approach will be to talk with employees directly either in small groups or on a one to one basis and they also plan to communicate by email general updates to employees during the course of the special liquidation.</p></reply>

In order for Bank of Ireland to return to strength, meet the needs of the Irish economy and enable the State to exit its investment, it has to develop a profitable commercial enterprise and these results show that the bank is definitely well on its way to achieving this goal.    The positive takeaways would be that the profitability of the bank is improving with a net interest margin of 1.34% in H2 2012 up 0.14% from H1 2012, auguring well for this year and beyond. The removal of the ELG scheme this year and the on-going reductions in deposit rates will also help. The bank is well capitalised with its Core Tier 1 ratio of 14.4% stronger than the market expected at year end and while impairment levels are still very high, the trend here is downwards.</p><p>  There are still areas of concern however. Operating costs need to come down further while the level of non-performing loans is still rising, albeit at a slower pace.  Mortgage arrears at the bank look to be close to their peak, but as I&rsquo;ve said many times before I am not happy at the pace at which the banks are moving to deal with this issue. Addressing mortgage arrears is a top priority for the Government and we expect to see real progress on this issue in the months ahead.</p></reply>

Firstly, NAMA is imposing a financial reporting rigour on debtors to ensure that management information relating to each debtor&rsquo;s business is delivered to NAMA. In particular, debtors are subject to on-going reporting requirements in respect of the achievement of agreed milestones and debt repayment targets and current financial metrics such as rental receipts.  Debtors are also required to provide future cash flow forecasts and other specific information requirements identified by NAMA case managers.  Secondly, to provide additional assurance on the information received and to enhance control over cash flows, particularly rental income, NAMA also requires the appointment of independent monitors, including financial monitors, property management service providers and project managers, whose remit is to ensure that financial information provided by debtors is consistent with the underlying books and records.  These external service providers evaluate and report to NAMA on the completeness and accuracy of information presented by debtors in relation to both historical and future financial and property management activity and milestones which have been agreed with NAMA.  As the Deputy is aware, these milestones were agreed as part of the debtor&rsquo;s commitment to repay the amounts due to NAMA and in turn the taxpayer.</p></reply>

However, tax relief can only be claimed when an individual has a tax liability in the same tax year as the expenses were incurred.    I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that for the tax year 2011, any tax that was paid by the individual in question was refunded. As the individual concerned has not submitted a P60 for 2012, it is not possible to say if any refund will be due.</p><p>  While I appreciate the position of the individual in question, to amend one section of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in order to provide tax relief for current expenditure against tax that was paid in previous years would inevitably lead to calls for all tax reliefs to be similarly refundable based on taxes paid in any year. This would place an undue burden on the Exchequer and would be extremely difficult for the Revenue Commissioners to administer.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-12a.331.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013031200056#WRF04300"><p>The position is, as I stated in my Budget day speech of 5 December 2012, that from the 1st of July 2013, Maternity Benefit will be treated as taxable income.   It should be noted that it is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation. In line with this principle, the majority of social welfare payments are reckonable as income for tax purposes. These include long-term payments such as the Disablement Benefit, the State Pension, Widows, Invalidity and Blind Pensions, Carers Allowance and the One Parent Family Payment as well as short term benefits such as Job Seekers Benefit. Treating these payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.</p><p>  Of course, the extent, if any, to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends on the level of income that a recipient has in a tax year.  If there is no other income besides the social welfare payment, the basic personal credits in force can be expected in most cases to ensure that no tax arises on the social welfare income itself.</p><p>  There are situations currently where an employee continues to be paid by her employer, in full, while on maternity leave and, based on her PRSI contributions, is entitled to Maternity Benefit from the Department of Social Protection. The non-taxation of such benefit currently results in an employee having a greater net take-home pay for the period of maternity benefit, than if she was at work.</p><p>  The rates of Maternity Benefit are earnings-related and are set to reflect post-tax income. It was never intended that individuals would gain financially by being on maternity leave.  The introduction of the charge to income tax on maternity benefit payments will ensure that those with identical incomes will be treated the same for income tax purposes.</p><p>  However, it should be noted that maternity benefit payments will remain exempt from Universal Social Charge and PRSI.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners estimated that the expected yield from the taxation of Maternity Benefit payments will be &euro;15 million in 2013 and &euro;40 million in a full year.</p><p>  In addition, I would point out that as a result of Maternity Benefit payments becoming liable to income tax for all claimants with effect from 1 July 2013, a number of possible tax outcomes could arise:</p><p>  1. An individual may pay no income tax on their maternity benefit payment as their tax credits will be sufficient to reduce their tax liability to zero.</p><p>  2. An individual may pay income tax on their maternity benefit payments at the standard rate.</p><p>  3. An individual may pay income tax at the standard rate on a portion of the maternity benefit and the higher rate on the balance of the maternity benefit payment.</p><p>  4. An individual may pay income tax on their maternity benefit payments at the higher rate.</p></reply>

It will also play a vital part in securing the future competitive advantage of all enterprises and in enhancing future growth in productivity in this country.  My Department is providing a range of supports to unemployed people, including former construction workers, to up-skill and re-skill so that they are in a better position to avail of jobs as the economy recovers.</p><p>  Unemployed construction workers can avail of a suitable training intervention from a range of F&Aacute;S training courses at levels 3-6 on the National Qualifications Framework, to meet their career and employment aspirations taking into account their previous education and experience, skill and expertise, the evolving labour market and skill needs of employers/sectors.  Courses of particular interest to unemployed construction workers are F&Aacute;S 'green' energy courses as follows:</p><p>- Passive House (&quot;A&quot; rated) Building Envelope;</p><p>- Passive House Construction Mech Systems;</p><p>- Rainwater Harvesting;</p><p>- Domestic Thermal Insulation;</p><p>- Intelligent Building Control Systems;</p><p>- Small Scale Wind Systems Implementation;</p><p>- Micro Solar Photo Voltaic Systems Implementation.</p><p>- Overhead Line Worker being piloted by Tralee Training Centre, primarily aimed at unemployed construction operatives;</p><p>- Wind Turbine Maintenance to be piloted later this year by Tralee Training Centre, primarily aimed at unemployed electrical, plumbing mechanical construction craft workers).</p><p>  The impact of the economic downturn has led to a collapse in demand for apprentices from employers, particularly in construction related trades.  Significant numbers of apprentices have also been made redundant before completion of their training.  To assist redundant apprentices to complete their apprenticeships, F&Aacute;S has put the following interim measures in place:</p><p>  The temporary Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme (RAPS) provides supports for redundant apprentices to be placed with an employer to complete the minimum duration necessary to complete the on-the-job phases at Phase 3/5/7.  Employers can apply to F&Aacute;S to participate in RAPS subject to meeting the eligibility criteria.</p><p>  F&Aacute;S has also introduced a Competency Determination Mechanism (CDM).  This mechanism will provide redundant apprentices who have a time deficit in their apprenticeship with the opportunity to demonstrate their skills and knowledge against the occupational standard for the specified trade over a number of days in a F&Aacute;S Training Centre.</p><p>  The Labour Market Activation Fund (LMAF) was launched in March 2010 and was designed to assist in the creation of training and education provision for specific priority groups among the unemployed, namely the low skilled, and those formerly employed in declining sectors including the construction sector.  Over 12,500 unemployed people, including many former construction workers, benefited from training and education programmes when the fund ended in June 2011.</p><p>  As part of the Government's &quot;Action Plan for Jobs&quot; initiative, F&Aacute;S is administering the Labour Market Education &amp; Training Fund (LMETF) which was launched as MOMENTUM in December 2012.  &euro;20 million has been committed by the Department of Education &amp; Skills through the National Training Fund.  The aim of MOMENTUM is to provide a range of quality, relevant education &amp; training interventions for up to 6,500 individuals who are long-term unemployed including former construction workers.</p><p>  Skillnets funds enterprise-led training through a network model, where companies from networks representing specific industry sectors or geographical regions co-operate to deliver training programmes appropriate to current market requirements.  It is committed to supporting former construction workers.  While some of the training is designed to allow such job-seekers to secure employment within the construction sector, the main focus is on retraining former construction workers to enter alternative sectors with sustainable employment opportunities.</p><p>  Job-seekers from the construction sector can access training in two ways: </p><p>  EGFA significant number of redundant construction workers have been assisted, under the aegis of my Department, through the completion of a programme of supports co-financed by the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in 2012.  The EGF programme targeted a cohort of redundant construction workers and apprentices across three specific sub-sectors of the construction industry who had been verifiably made redundant between 1 July 2009 and 31 March 2010.  The sub-sectors covered by the programme were: construction of buildings; specialised construction services; and architectural and engineering services.  The EGF programme ran from 1st July 2009 to 9th June 2012 and provided a range of co-financed guidance, training, education and enterprise measures.  These included occupational guidance supports including tailored career planning courses provided by VECs; training courses and allowances administered by F&Aacute;S including on and off the job apprenticeship supports to allow those apprentices made redundant to progress their apprenticeships while unemployed; further and higher education courses delivered by the VECs and HEA-funded institutions; and entrepreneurial guidance and supports provided by the City and County Enterprise Boards for those clients interested in becoming self-employed.</p><p>  The programme also provided for the awarding of EGF Training Grants where a required training or education measure could not be delivered by a public institution but was available to the client through the private sector.  In total almost 11,000 separate interventions were provided to a total EGF eligible cohort of just over 8,000 redundant construction workers and apprentices in the relevant implementation period</p></reply>

There were a plethora of long-standing clustering arrangements in place which were not the most practical, efficient or cost effective way to allocate resources.  The new arrangements introduced in the current school year are designed to address the limitations of the previous arrangements.  Under the reforms to the teacher allocation process introduced for the current school year, schools were empowered to cluster and arrange their General Allocation Model resources in a manner that best suits their local needs, including in a manner that reduces travel between schools.  This school led process has resulted in over 97% of the overall GAM allocation being in full-time stand-alone or shared posts.</p><p>  Aside from the reforms to the GAM, the allocation of resource hours for individual pupils vary from year to year.  This is because of the ongoing individual assessment of pupils through the NCSE must operate on a later timescale.  The new arrangements involve the allocation of a network of permanent posts in base schools and again are designed to make the system work more smoothly at school level. 85% of all NCSE approved resource teaching hours in the 2012/13 school year were allocated to schools that had resource base posts.</p><p>  The staffing arrangements for the coming school year 2013/14 are outlined in Circular 0013/2013 which is available on the Department website.  When the allocation and redeployment process is completed later in the Summer schools that have complied with the arrangements outlined in the Circular will be given some discretion to operate, where possible, their own temporary local arrangements in relation to the day to day work arrangements of teachers in full-time shared posts.  These arrangements are aimed at minimising any time lost in travelling between schools.</p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is  to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils  seeking places.</p><p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement  an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard  a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children  from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis  of some other criterion. The criteria to be applied by schools in such  circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves. This selection process  and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and  must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process  where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the  Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil,  the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the  Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational  Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.</p><p>  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can  assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for  their child. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board,  National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at  01-8738700.</p></reply>

All of the NPS tender documents explicitly seek to encourage the  participation of SMEs in competitions, by encouraging them to explore the  possibilities of forming relationships with other SMEs or with larger  enterprises.</p><p>  In terms of public procurement reform, it has been estimated that &euro;9 billion is  spent by public bodies annually on the procurement of supplies and services.   My colleague Minister Howlin has highlighted the importance of ensuring that  the public sector is achieving maximum value for money and operational  efficiency in its approach to public procurement.  Centralising the procurement  of commonly used goods and services can deliver significant benefits which  include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of  tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency and enhanced  service levels.</p><p>  In addition, given the financial constraints within which we must all now work,  cost reductions and savings can go some way to helping Exchequer funded bodies,  such as schools, manage within reducing financial budgets.</p><p>  Given the potential benefits that can realised across the public sector, public  procurement is one of the major projects of key strategic importance under the  Government's Public Service Reform Plan.  The Public Service Reform Plan,  published in November 2011, provides for the development of a new policy  framework for procurement.   This work is now being led by the newly appointed  Chief Procurement Officer, Paul Quinn.  Under his leadership a new national  procurement office for the public sector is being established.  Paul is  currently working with officials across the public sector to put in place new  sectoral and centralised procurement arrangements.</p><p>  I do appreciate the concerns being raised by school supply companies and I have  asked relevant officials here in the Department, who are coordinating  procurement reform in the Education and Training sector, to take these concerns  into consideration in the context of the work being undertaken on procurement  reform.    </p></reply>

While my Department sets  out the constitution of Boards of Management and rules of procedure it is not  directly involved in the management of schools.</p><p>  Under the provisions of the Education Act, 1998, the Board of Management is the  body charged with the direct governance of a school, and it is the Board of  Management which employs the teachers at the school.  Accordingly, whereas my  Department provides funding and policy direction for schools, it does not have  the power to instruct schools to follow a particular course of direction with  regard to individual complaint cases.</p><p>  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints relating to the administrative actions or non actions of a school  recognised by my Department, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed  the school's complaints procedures. The key criterion for any intervention by  the Ombudsman for Children is that the administrative actions or non actions of  a school has, or may have, adversely affected the child.  Accordingly, officials in my Department are not in a position legally to  intervene in the dispute in question. </p></reply>

The Visiting Teacher service provides advice  and support to ensure that the needs of children and young people with hearing  impairment are met. This service is available at pre-school, primary and  post-primary levels. Specifically, the service works in partnership with  parents of pre-school children with hearing impairment, visiting their homes  and/or meeting them in groups to inform, advise and offer guidance in matters  pertaining to their education and overall development and in helping their  children to derive maximum benefit from the educational opportunities  available.</p><p>  My Department, through the Higher Education Authority (HEA), has established  and funds a Centre for Deaf Studies in Trinity College, Dublin which provides  diploma courses for ISL/English interpreters, deaf tutors and in deaf studies.

Schools may  choose to incorporate these short courses into their junior cycle programme  either for certification purposes or not for certification.  They may choose  not to opt for the new short course and may choose to continue to use existing  courses or other approaches to meet the Framework's Principles, Statements of  Learning and Key Skills relevant to these areas.  Schools will have the  flexibility to  determine how best to meet the range of Statements of Learning,  Key Skills and Principles that relate to the areas currently covered in SPHE.</p><p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle which I published last October will, inter  alia, aim to increase the importance of physical wellbeing in several ways:</p><p>  The Framework is based on eight Principles. The Principle of &quot;Wellbeing&quot;  undertakes to ensure that &quot;the student experience contributes directly to their  physical wellbeing.&quot; The Principle of &quot;Inclusive Education&quot; undertakes to  ensure that &quot;the educational experience is inclusive of all students and  contributes to equality of opportunity, participation and outcomes for all&quot;</p><p>  Contained in the Junior Cycle's Statements of Learning is the stated aim that  the student &quot;takes action to safeguard and promote his/her wellbeing and that  of others&quot;; is &quot;confident and competent in physical activity and is motivated  to be physically active&quot; and that he/she &quot;understands the importance of food  and diet in making healthy lifestyle choices&quot;.</p><p>  In addition, eight Key Skills are required for successful learning across the  curriculum and beyond the school. This is in recognition of the fact that  learning takes place both inside and outside of the formal school environment.  One of these Key Skills is &quot;Staying Well&quot;, which adopts a holistic approach to  wellbeing and includes &quot;Being healthy, physical and active&quot;. </p></reply>

The Schedule to the 2002 Act specified 123 institutions and section 4 of the Act enables the Minister for Education and Science to provide for the insertion into the Schedule of<blockquote>&quot;any industrial school, reformatory school, orphanage, children's home, special school which was established for the purpose of providing education services to children with a physical or intellectual disability or a hospital providing medical or psychiatric services to people with a physical or mental disability or mental illness in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function.&quot;</blockquote>Two Orders have been made specifying 16 additional institutions, in November 2004 and July 2005, bringing the total number of scheduled institutions to 139.  </p><p>The position of the Regina Coeli hostel was considered by my Department but it was not included in the Schedule as hostels did not come within the terms of section 4 of the Act.   A request to include an institution at the same address and known as the Morning Star Mother and Baby Home was also refused on the basis that there was no record of State responsibility for it.</p><p>  Following the publication of the Ryan Report in May 2009, there were a range of demands for the redress scheme to be extended, including demands to include specific institutions and categories of institutions. Having considered these demands, the then Government announced its decision not to revise the arrangements in its press statement of 15th April, 2010.</p><p>  While the original closing date for receipt of applications by the Redress Board was 15th December, 2005, the Board could accept late applications in exceptional circumstances.   The Residential Institutions Redress Amendment Act, 2011 removed the Board's power to accept late applications received on or after the 17th September, 2011.   The Board is continuing to finalise the remaining applications before it.</p><p>  Finally, I wish to clarify that the Bethany Home is not a scheduled institution under the Redress Scheme.  </p></reply>

The main conditions of the scheme are that students must be first-time undergraduates, hold inter alia EU/EEA/Swiss nationality in their own right, and have been ordinarily resident in an EU/EEA/Swiss state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.</p><p>  The position is that the assessment of eligibility in individual cases is a matter for each higher education institution to determine within the terms of the scheme. I understand from clarification received by my officials that in this case the relevant higher education institution has advised the student of their eligibility status.</p><p>  The Springboard programme provides free part time higher education courses for unemployed people in areas where there are identified labour market skills shortages, such as ICT, Manufacturing and International Financial Services. Springboard places are open to unemployed people who have a previous history of employment and there is no requirement that a person be progressing on the National Framework of Qualifications. More than 10,000 places have been provided under the two rounds of the programme to date. A new call for proposals for Springboard courses was issued to higher education providers at the end of February and is expected to provide for an additional 5,000 places in 2013.

Following intensive engagement between the parties, which was facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission (LRC), the LRC has developed and recommended a set of proposals for consideration and agreement. These proposals represent a balanced and integrated set of proposals and avoid the imposition of basic pay cuts to the 87% of  public servants on low and middle incomes.

In NPS competitions, the tender documents explicitly seek to encourage the participation of SMEs.  A prime example of this is when the NPS decided to divide the office supplies contract into three individual lots for Stationery, ICT Consumables and Paper.  The NPS actively encourages consortia to tender for their competitions.  SMEs that believed the scope of the competitions were beyond their technical or business capacity were encouraged to explore the possibilities of forming relationships with other SMEs or with larger enterprises.  Through such relationships they could participate and contribute to the successful implementation of any contracts that resulted from these competitions and therefore increase their social and economic benefits.  Larger enterprises were also encouraged to consider the practical ways that SMEs could be included in their proposals to maximise the social and economic benefits of the contracts that result from these tenders.</p><p>  One proven method to encourage the participation of SMES is through the use of lots in a competition.  In the current office equipment tender the NPS has divided the range of printers sought into five individual lots with plans to place up to seven companies on a framework for each lot.  Therefore, there is the potential for thirty-five different companies to win places on this new framework.</p><p>  In order to lighten the burden placed on SMEs when tendering the NPS operates in line with the best practise recommendations of the Department of Finance Circular 10/10.  These steps include the use of proportional criteria for turnover and qualification, proportional insurance levels being set, ensures that there is no requirement for companies to submit all relevant paperwork (e.g. tax clearance certificates, auditors statements) upfront.  The NPS also uses the CSSO approved standard suite of documents when drafting a tender and uses the eTenders website to ensure all companies can access the documentation and any clarifications quickly and freely.  There is a social clause included in current public works contracts which deals with pay and conditions of employment, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are considering how it may be possible to include a performance requirement for the employment of the long-term unemployed in future contracts.</p></reply>

The supplier, in effect, provides the full infrastructure required for all day-to-day office printing.  Research carried out by the National Procurement Service (NPS) has indicated that such an approach gives best value to the Irish public sector.</p><p>  The MPS Framework Agreement offers all public sector bodies in the State access to a print solution that is strategic, cost efficient and that can be tailored to the specific needs of the individual organisation.  Following an open competition, advertised on e-tenders and in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU), the Framework Agreement for MPS was established on 8 February 2012.  The Framework Agreement will be in place for two years, with an option to extend for a further two years.</p><p>  The value of the Framework Agreement over two years was estimated to be up to &euro;100 million.  Taking into account the value of the Framework and the fact that suppliers are required to provide all of the print devices upfront, from their own resources, the view was taken by the NPS that the &euro;10 million minimum turnover requirement was proportionate.  Tenderers who did not have the required turnover in their own right were invited to partner with other entities to satisfy this requirement.</p><p>  The minimum turnover requirement for entry into the Framework was an average of &euro;10 million per annum for the three most recent years of audited accounts or where the date of establishment is more recent for each year the entity has been established.  These turnover requirements were applied at the qualification stage as part of the competition for entry on to the MPS Framework Agreement.  Under S.I. No. 329 of 2006 &ndash; European Communities (Award of Public Authority Contracts) Regulations 2006, no changes can be made to the composition of a Framework for the duration of the Agreement.</p><p>   The MPS procurement competition explicitly sought to encourage the participation of SMEs.  Those SMEs that believed the scope of the competition was beyond their technical or business capacity were encouraged to explore the possibilities of forming relationships with other SMEs or with larger enterprises.  Larger enterprises were also encouraged to consider the practical ways that SMEs could be included in their proposals with a view to maximising the social and economic benefits of the contracts that result from these tenders.</p><p>  All of the Framework Members have operations in Ireland and provide local employment.  Four of the seven successful tenderers are SMEs (MJ Flood, Bryan S Ryan, Hibernian Business Equipment and Ergo).  One of the tenderers did not have the required turnover in their own right to qualify for the Framework and formed an alliance with a large manufacturer to satisfy the turnover requirement.  Furthermore, the Framework Members have indicated in their tender submissions that they will use a further 11 indigenous SMEs in the delivery of MPS.</p></reply>

National Procurement Service (NPS) tender documents explicitly seek to encourage the participation of SMEs.  They encourage SMEs who believe that the scope of a particular competition is beyond their technical or business capacity to explore the possibilities of forming relationships with other SMEs or with larger enterprises.  Larger enterprises are also encouraged to consider the practical ways that SMEs could be included in their proposals to maximise the social and economic benefits of the contracts that result from these tenders.</p><p>  The NPS uses the CSSO-approved standard suite of documents when drafting a tender and I have encouraged all other contracting authorities involved in public procurement to do the same &ndash; this use of standardised documents is designed to simplify the issues facing business when tendering for public contracts.  The standard tender documents provide that much of the documentary evidence of a tenderer&rsquo;s capacity to undertake a project is not required to be produced at tender stage &ndash; instead, tenderers are asked to declare that they have the necessary capacity and that they will be in a position to produce the necessary documentation when requested.  That documentary evidence (e.g., bank statements, audited accounts, proof of professional indemnity, etc.) need only be produced when a tenderer has been short-listed or is coming under consideration for the award of a contract.  This approach is aimed at reducing the up-front administrative burden for businesses interested in tendering for contracts.</p><p>  In line with the best practise recommendations of the Department of Finance Circular 10/10, contracting authorities are encouraged to ensure that requirement levels for turnover and insurance levels are proportionate to the particular contract.  There is a social clause included in current public works contracts which deals with pay and conditions of employment and, as I indicated to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n in reply to an earlier question, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are considering how it may be possible to include a performance requirement for the employment of the long-term unemployed in future contracts.

Following intensive engagement between the parties, which was facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission (LRC), the LRC has developed and recommended a set of proposals for consideration and agreement.  These proposals represent a balanced and integrated set of proposals and I have no plans to amend the proposals made.  All public servants, including frontline workers, will be able to consider the full set of proposals by the LRC which have been published and the public service staff representatives who remained in negotiations have indicated that these proposals will be subject to ballot by members.</p><p>  Both the Government and I are acutely aware of the very significant contributions made to date by all public servants by way of pay reductions, imposition of the pension related deduction, non payment of pay increases and the significant productivity arising over recent years facilitated by the Public Service Agreement.  Regrettably, the scale of the fiscal crisis inherited by the current Government and the absolute requirement to address and reduce the current deficit of 8% to less than 3% in 2015, requires a further contribution of &euro;1bn from the public service pay and pensions bill which accounts for some 35% of current expenditure.  The LRC proposals represent a fair and balanced set of proposals across all public service sectors to secure the savings required by the Exchequer while ameliorating the impacts for public service staff on low and middle incomes to the greatest extent possible.  In this regard, I am satisfied that the proposals have protected the core pay of 87% of the workers in the public service.</p></reply>

The flood risk assessment and the analysis of flood relief options for Clonakilty are being prioritised with a view to developing as soon as possible a comprehensive solution to the flooding problems the town experiences.  The hydrological and hydraulic analysis under this study is currently nearing completion, and consideration of the possible options to develop a solution has begun.  It is anticipated that a draft Preliminary Options Report will be provided to the OPW and Cork County Council for technical review in early summer, with a range of potentially viable options, including a provisionally preferred option, being subsequently presented to stakeholders and the public for consultation in mid-summer of 2013.

Upon the dissolution of the body corporate, such property becomes State property.  This function transferred in July 2011 to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 2011 and S.I. No. 418/2011 &mdash; Finance (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order, 2011.  The effect of Section 28 is that the Minister does not hold the assets of dissolved companies as beneficial owner.  He holds them in trust.  The title which the Minister acquires under this Section has been described as a defeasible title since, if the dissolved company is restored to the Register of Companies within twenty years of the date of its dissolution, its property is automatically restored to it.  The State Property Act also includes, in Section 31, a power for the Minister to waive the interest acquired under Section 28 of the Act.</p><p>  It is understood that the property which is the subject of the current question was held within a company which was struck off the Register of Companies in September, 1972 for failure to file annual returns with the Companies Office.  The beneficial owner of the property applied to the Department of Finance for a waiver of the interest acquired by the Minister for Finance under the provisions of the State Property Act and that waiver, in respect of which the consideration was &pound;160, was completed in October, 1986.  The effect of the waiver, which was not a sale by the State, would have been to allow the beneficial owner to complete the process of assembling a satisfactory title.  The waiver itself would have formed only a limited element in the establishment of that title and the transaction was a normal exercise of Departmental functions.  The price which the beneficial owner may have secured in a subsequent sale was not a matter for consideration in the context of the waiver and, accordingly, would not merit enquiry by me at this juncture.</p><p>  I am advised that all applications for waiver of property falling within the scope of Section 28 of the State Property Act are referred to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor for legal advice and that any policy issues that may arise in particular cases are given full consideration on their merits.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-12a.550.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013031200056#WRK02700"><p>I have consulted the Health &amp; Safety Authority on the technical issues raised by Deputy Fleming and am advised that the widespread use of slatted sheds for cattle housing makes slurry handling a major issue on Irish farms.  In this regard, I am informed that during slurry handling, the vast majority of deaths and injury are, in fact, associated with the use of tractors and machinery.  However, drowning in slurry and slurry gases also pose a major risk to farmers and farm families.</p><p>  During storage, and as the slurry decays, an anaerobic reaction takes place which produces a cocktail of toxic and potentially lethal gases.  These gases include Hydrogen Sulphide, Methane, Carbon Dioxide and Ammonia.  The most dangerous of these gases is Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S) as it is extremely poisonous both to people and animals.  It affects the nervous system and one lungful at high concentrations can cause death.</p><p>  There have been many incidents in which people were overcome by slurry gases.  Tragically, several people have been killed either by inhaling fumes or drowning associated with slurry pits.  In relation to H2S, at very low levels over 3 ppm (parts per million), H2S has a distinctive smell of rotten eggs.  Critically though, exposure to the gas at levels up to 150 ppm will quickly kill the sense of smell leading to the assumption that the gas has gone when, in fact, the levels may have become much higher and lethal.</p><p>  When slurry is agitated, H2S is released at levels often in excess of 1,500 ppm which can cause immediate unconsciousness, H2S poisoning (pulmonary oedema), Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), coma and death in just a few seconds.  H2S, even at lower levels above 500 ppm, can cause unconsciousness after just a few breaths.  One lung-full at high concentrations can cause instant death.</p><p>  The highest risk occurs when slurry is being &ldquo;agitated&rdquo;.  On such occasions, the gases trapped in the slurry, often beneath a crust, are released when it is mixed.  Studies indicate that levels are greatest when slurry is stored for several months, when slurry is mixed in deep tanks, when slurry is mixed in cold weather or after silage effluent or other additives are involved.</p><p>  In relation to animal bedding; straw, sand and woodchips/shavings/sawdust from virgin timber have often been used as a livestock bedding material.  Furthermore, some waste materials may be suitable for use as bedding materials provided they do not pose a risk to the animals bedded on it or to human health.  However, while waste plasterboard containing &ldquo;Gypsum&rdquo; may have been used in the past as a replacement bedding material, such use is now banned and is not known to occur in Ireland.</p><p>  The Health &amp; Safety Authority has informed me that a literature search was conducted in the UK to find evidence and scientific studies relating to the use of waste Gypsum and waste plasterboard as animal bedding and the likelihood of H2S being generated.  Very little literature was found on the use of waste Gypsum or plasterboard as animal bedding and there appears to have been no studies into the possibility of H2S generation.  Similarly, there have been no studies to determine if different bedding systems affect the likelihood of H2S, and if so, whether H2S generation can be prevented.</p><p>  Gypsum - usually produced from re-cycled plasterboard - can be applied direct to agricultural land as a soil conditioner.  In this regard, research is currently commissioned by Health and Safety Executive UK concerning Gypsum and its effect on H2S production in slurry and our Health and Safety Authority, in their regular contacts with their UK counterparts, await the results of that research which they expect within the next few months.</p><p>  In conclusion, the critical message to farmers is that all slurry contains potentially lethal levels of toxic gases, whether additives are involved or not.  In this regard, the recommended prevention strategies are: Never agitate slurry in still air conditions.  Open all doors and outlets to provide a draught.  Move all animals out of the shed before commencing.  At least two people should be present at all times.  Keep children and elderly persons away from the area when agitating.  Never stand over slats or near tank access points when agitation is in progress.  Avoid vigorous agitation in confined spaces.  Do not allow slurry to rise within 300mm of the slats or tank covers.  Keep all people away from the agitation point for 30 minutes after starting agitation.  Never enter the slurry tank (even an empty tank) unless you are wearing suitable breathing apparatus and/or a harness attached to a lifeline controlled by at least two other adults positioned outside of the area.  Where possible agitate from the outside the building.  Avoid smoking or the use of naked lights as slurry gases are highly flammable.  Gases can build up and remain in partially emptied tanks above the slurry, never enter a tank for any reason.  Put up warning signs to warn of the dangers when working with slurry.  I trust the Deputy finds the foregoing information useful.</p></reply>

The IP Protocol aims to encourage industry &ndash; both indigenous and FDI companies &ndash; and across all sectors, to collaborate with Ireland&rsquo;s universities, institutes of technology and other publicly funded research institutions; to use and commercialise the IP generated from such research and turn it into products and services for the global marketplace.</p><p>  A key feature of the IP Protocol is that it establishes &ldquo;ground rules&rdquo; which must be followed when agreeing terms around ownership of and access to all State funded intellectual property.  Feedback from industry, in particular, small and medium enterprises, is that this provides clarity and certainty and makes it easier to engage with research performing organisations to commercialise IP arising from State funded research.</p><p>  Another key aspect of the IP Protocol centres around the development of a &lsquo;one stop shop&rsquo; for businesses seeking to use IP deriving from publicly funded research.  This will be achieved through the establishment of a &lsquo;central Technology Transfer Office&rsquo; to provide an effective interface between industry and the research community and which will also drive a world class technology transfer system in Ireland, ensuring it is responsive to the needs of both industry and academia.  This will improve Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness for FDI, in particular for research and development across all sectors, including ICT.  It will place Ireland in a competitive position internationally and is part of a series of Government measures aimed at realising the vision for Ireland to become the best small country in the world in which to do business.  Work on the establishment of the cTTO is progressing well. Recruitment for the Director of the cTTO is underway and expected to be completed by Q3 2013.</p></reply>

The CEBs support the indigenous micro-enterprise sector in the start-up and expansion phases and stimulate enterprise potential at local level. The CEBs are the first port of call in terms of advice, direction, training and grant support for anyone who wishes to start a business. The CEBs will deal with queries from all potential clients (including those who have taken redundancy, whether in the public sector or not). Contact details for the CEBs are available on <i></i> . They offer a range supports including both financial assistance and non-financial assistance. The forms of financial assistance, which are available subject to certain criteria and conditions, are Priming Grants, Business Expansion Grants and Feasibility/Innovation Grants. The provision of non-financial assistance can take the form of a wide range of business advice and information services, management capability training and development programmes, e-Commerce training initiatives etc. Training courses include such topics as start-your-own-business, taxation for beginners, internet marketing, idea&#8217;s generation and negotiation skills. </p><p>In addition, Microfinance Ireland is providing support in the form of loans of up to &#8364;25,000 available to start-up, newly established or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks. The Fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus and is open to anyone with a viable business proposal. Applications for the new Microfinance Fund should be channelled through the local CEB.  Contact details for the CEBs are available on<i></i><i></i>.</p><p>  A Guide, entitled &#8220;Financial Support for Irish Business&#8221; has been published on my Department&#8217;s website at <i>www.djei.ie</i> under &#8220;latest publications&#8221; and includes information on supports, other than those available from the Enterprise Development Agencies, such as &#8220;Revenue Job Assist&#8221; and &#8220;Back to Work Enterprise Allowance&#8221;.</p><p>  A particularly important action in this year's Action Plan for Jobs 2013 is the launch of the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) which will see the merger of the CEBs with the Business Support and Enterprise Development functions of the Local Authorities. The APJ recognises that the indigenous micro-enterprise and small business sector is central to economic recovery, job creation and the future prosperity of the Irish economy. This merger will ensure that the national enterprise support model for these sectors is a premium model delivering high quality.</p></reply>

It is an offence under section 4 of the 1956 Act to promote or assist in the promotion of any kind of gaming or to provide facilities for any kind of gaming. Separately, it is an offence to operate as a bookmaker, or carry on business of a bookmaker, without a licence under the 1931 Act. </p><p>  Within that legal framework Enterprise Ireland (EI) is precluded from supporting companies that operate in the gambling sector, which includes all companies that earn their revenues from online betting, betting exchange, gambling, competitive social gaming and tipping markets. EI can provide limited support to Financial Spread-Betting Companies (FSB)/ Contracts for Difference (CFD) providers, only if these companies are regulated by a Financial Services Regulatory Authority. EI does support companies that earn revenue from supplying products or services to companies in the gambling sector (provided the earnings are not directly linked to amounts gambled).</p><p>  It is anticipated that two legislative proposals will significantly change the legislative and regulatory landscape. The Deputy will be aware that, in July 2012, the Minster for Finance published the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2012 which is designed to ensure a fair and equal treatment of all bookmakers and betting exchanges offering services in Ireland and will bring into the licensing and taxation regime all remote bookmakers and betting intermediaries (betting exchanges). The Minister for Justice and Equality has also announced plans to bring Heads of a Bill, provisionally entitled the Gambling Control Bill, to Government soon. The &lsquo;Gambling Control Bill&rsquo; is envisaged to be a comprehensive measure, establishing a transparent regulatory regime to cover betting and gaming, whether by terrestrial or remote means and will include gambling on virtual and actual events.</p><p>  I am very aware that innovation is a key feature of the gaming, betting and gambling industry; new forms are constantly emerging such as betting exchanges, which permit people to bet amongst themselves, without the need for a bookmaker.  Obviously, my Department will review, in conjunction with EI, the current policy on supporting companies that operate in the gambling sector when the above two proposed pieces of legislation have been enacted.</p></reply>

Invalidity pension recipients may participate in community employment (CE) schemes.  </p><p><b><i>Disability Allowance</i></b></p><p>  A person may work while in receipt of disability allowance and there is no hours limit.

Recipients are not permitted to do work unless it is work in respect of which his/her earnings do not, on  average, exceed &#8364;33 per week.  However a recipient may, with the prior written permission of the Department, be exempted from the &quot;no work&quot; rule for any period during which s/he is undergoing a course of training with a view to taking up some other occupation or s/he is engaged in part-time work for less than 20 hours a week which is in the nature of rehabilitation or occupational therapy.</p><p><b><i>Family Income Supplement</i></b></p><p>  This is a support for people working on low wages who have children and who are employed for at least 19 hours per week or 38 hours per fortnight.</p><p><b><i>Illness Benefit</i></b></p><p>  A person in receipt of illness benefit who wishes to work has the option of applying for the new Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB) scheme, if they have been on Illness Benefit for longer than 6 months.

It is not a means tested payment. An applicant need not give up employment completely. They may  still be eligible for this pension from age 65 if they earn less than &#8364;38 per week from part-time employment (paying PRSI at Class J), irrespective of the number of hours they work per week, or if they earn less than &#8364;5,000 per year from self-employment. The retirement condition ceases to apply when they reach age 66 whereupon they are automatically transferred to a State pension contributory.</p><p><b><i>State Pension (contributory)</i></b></p><p>It is a social insurance payment payable to applicants aged 66 and over, who satisfy certain contribution conditions (or who had been in receipt of State pension (transition) up to the date of their 66<sup>th</sup>   birthday).

Their State pension (contributory) entitlement and rate of weekly payment is not affected by the level of their earnings or by the number of hours they work per week.</p><p><b><i>Widow(er)&#8217;s and surviving civil partner&#8217;s contributory pension </i></b></p><p>  It is a social insurance payment for people who satisfy certain qualifying conditions. Entitlement is assessed on the basis of the applicant&#8217;s PRSI record or that of their late spouse or civil partner. It is not a means tested payment. If a person is awarded this pension, and is employed/self-employed, their weekly rate of pension payment is not affected by the level of their earnings or by the number of hours they work per week. </p><p><b><i>State Pension Non-Contributory</i></b></p><p>  There is no limit on the number of hours a person may work.  The payment is means tested. </p><p><b><i>Deserted Wives Benefit/Allowance &amp; Widows Non Contributory Pension</i></b></p><p>  There is no limit on the number of hours a person may work.

As a result, the average cost of providing transport has been reduced by 65% - from an average cost of &euro;280,000 per minister in 2010 to a current annual estimate of &euro;100,000 per annum. </p><p>  In line with the reformed arrangements, I now use my own car for official business. The travel /mileage rates payable depend on the car engine size and also incorporate a number of expense elements associated with the cost of running a car, such as road tax and insurance. The engine size of my car is 1400cc and the rate applicable is 46.25 cent per kilometre.</p><p>  The mileage costs which I have claimed since 01 May 2011 to 31 January 2013 amount to &euro;14,754.99.</p><p>  I have two civilian drivers, both on a remuneration rate of &euro;631.75 per week. The total salary costs involved to date has been &euro;112,259.85.</p><p>  They may also claim travel and subsistence allowances, in accordance with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regulations for necessary absences on official duties from home and headquarters. Total cost of travel and subsistence claimed by my drivers to date is &euro;2,298.04. </p><p>  The total cost incurred in all of the above amounts to &euro;129,312.88 for the period 01 May 2011 to 31 January 2013. This represents a significant reduction on the average cost of &euro;280,000 per minister per annum under the previous system. </p><p>  The previous practice whereby all Ministers were provided with State cars and Garda drivers fell within the remit of the Department of Justice and in this regard details of the costs involved in respect of 2010 would be a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality. </p><p>  There is no Junior Minister assigned to the Department.</p></reply>

As part of the 2013 budget package for the Department of Social Protection, the number of places on T&uacute;s is being extended by 2,500 so that the total places approved will increase from 5,000 to 7,500. To date 8,178 people have completed or are currently on work placements.  This figure includes supervisory/team leader positions.  As a relatively new initiative, T&uacute;s continues to be monitored and developed and to date has proven to be effective in meeting its objectives.  </p><p>  A person cannot apply to participate on T&uacute;s.  All selection is undertaken by random processes conducted at local level by the Department of Social Protection.  The selection is focused on those on the live register for a year or more and in receipt of a jobseekers&rsquo; payment.  I consider the current selection process effective and I have no proposals to alter these arrangements.  Eligibility for supervisory/team leader positions on T&uacute;s is the same for participants, i.e. it is confined to those on the Live Register for at least 12 months and in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance at the time of application. A person on a community employment scheme does not meet the criteria as they are not in receipt of a jobseekers payment.  T&uacute;s is focused on those on the Live Register for a year or more and have more limited job or work placement opportunities.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-12a.658.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013031200056#WRM02200"><p>The main item on the agenda of the recent Council of Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Ministers (EPSCO) meeting in Brussels was youth unemployment. Under my chairmanship, EPSCO gave political agreement to a Council Recommendation on an EU-wide Youth Guarantee.  The EPSCO Recommendation is that each Member State should ensure that young people receive a quality offer of employment or of continued education, an apprenticeship or traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed.  The Recommendation will be formally adopted by the Council at a later stage in Ireland's Presidency - most likely in May. </p><p>  The Recommendation encourages Member States to implement its provisions as soon as possible once it is formally adopted.  It is also recognised that implementation will need to be more gradual in countries with higher levels of youth unemployment and particularly severe budgetary problems.</p><p>  In anticipation of the formal adoption of the Recommendation, the government will review the current range of youth employment and training policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances.</p><p>  The scale and nature of the measures required will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO last week indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, showed a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier.  It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will, almost certainly require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education, training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment. All of these initiatives will be designed to enhance the labour market prospects of young people.</p><p>  In this regard the State already provides a significant number of places which are available to young people and the Department of Social Protection took steps in Budget 2013 to increase funding and places for schemes such as JobBridge, Community Employment, T&Uacute;S and a new state employment scheme in the local Government sector.

In particular, there will be a need for additional after-school child care provision to be made available in order to assist former OFP recipients to make their transition into activation and employment.   The joint child care initiative that Minister Fitzgerald and I announced as part of Budget 2013 is in recognition of the support that these individuals will require.  This initiative will provide approximately 6,000 after-school child care places for low-income families and social welfare income support recipients who gain employment and who have children of primary school age.</p><p>  Officials from my Department, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (D/CYA), and the Department of Education and Skills (D/ES) are presently working out the exact parameters of the scheme, which will be launched on a phased basis during 2013, commencing with a pilot in April, 2013.</p><p>  The after-school childcare scheme is being funded from savings of &euro;14 million coming from within my Department.  The D/CYA has confirmed that this equates to approximately 6,000 after-school childcare places including full-day care for school holidays. Given the current fiscal constraints it is not possible to allocate any additional funding to the scheme and so the number of places cannot be increased at this time.  </p></reply>

Claims are processed within a short time of receipt.</p><p>In respect of disability allowance, there are approximately 6,500 applications for disability allowance awaiting a decision. The average number of weeks to award a disability allowance application is currently approximately 17 weeks.  A recent analysis of the applications pending decision indicated that approximately 60% of them had been waiting for a decision for 12 weeks or fewer.   Following completion of a major service delivery modernisation project for the scheme, a plan is in place to deal with day-to-day intake of new claims along with a programme to eliminate the backlog.  Temporary staff has been assigned to the disability allowance area to assist in reducing the backlog.   The target is to have new applications actioned within a short period of receipt and to have the backlog of disability allowance applications actioned by the end of quarter 2 2013.</p><p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has supplied the following information with regard to the time taken to process appeals in the illness-related schemes:</p><p><b>Average Processing Times of Appeals  2012 </b></p><p><table><tr><th bgcolor="#C0E1FF"><div>-</div></th><th bgcolor="#C0E1FF"><div><br />Summary Decisions<br />(weeks)</div></th><th bgcolor="#C0E1FF"><div><br />Oral Hearings<br />(weeks)</div></th></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFD0">Disability Allowance</td><td bgcolor="#FFFFD0"><div>34.2</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFD0"><div>40.6</div></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFD0">Domiciliary Care Allowance</td><td bgcolor="#FFFFD0"><div>32.5</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFD0"><div>41.4</div></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFD0">Invalidity Pension</td><td bgcolor="#FFFFD0"><div>38.8</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFD0"><div>48.7</div></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFD0">Illness Benefit</td><td bgcolor="#FFFFD0"><div>41.8</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFD0"><div>50.6</div></td></tr></table></p><p>Appeals processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the deciding officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s inspectors and/or medical assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.</p><p>As a consequence of the very high number of decisions made in the last 9 months while backlogs have been reducing, there has been a corresponding substantial increase in the number of appeals being received.   Delays in the preparation of claims for appeal are arising as a consequence and this is regretted.  In addition, delays have developed in the processing of medical assessments and reviews due to a combination of factors including the increased workload for medical assessors and the reduced number of medical assessors due to retirements. The Department is addressing this issue and has recently run a competition to establish a new panel of medical assessors.  Three new medical assessors were appointed from this panel and all commenced work in November 2012.  It is expected that a further 8 medical assessors will be appointed from the panel in the near future.</p><p>In the interests of fairness and equity claim for illness-related schemes are generally processed in order of the date in which they are received.  However, the individual schemes may operate systems to appropriately prioritise certain claims in view of the particular circumstances.  For example disability allowance new claims received from 16 year olds who were previously in receipt of domiciliary care allowance and illness benefit claims from persons who have no other income are given priority.</p><p>The aim in respect of all social welfare scheme areas, including the illness-related schemes, is to process new claims within a short time of receipt and to process requests for appeals as quickly as possible.  Targets are set and monitored for each scheme.  It can happen that, from time to time, a backlog may build up in any scheme. This may be the result of a number of factors, changes in scheme conditions, and other demand on resources, long term sick leave, claim volume increases to name but a possible few.  In that event, the Department makes every effort to ensure that there is adequate resource to process the additional work.  In some cases, temporary staff may be assigned to help in these situations, but they are not used as a permanent solution.</p><p>Service delivery remains a key priority in my Department and processes are kept under continuous review to ensure that services are delivered promptly to customers.  Staffing needs are also kept under constant review to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  <b> </b></p></reply>

This system provides an integrated IT service for the administration, processing and generation of payments in respect of illness benefit claims. This system also handles the processing of claims for all short term schemes. The ISTS system is integrated with the Department&rsquo;s Central Records System and communicates with other systems as necessary.  </p><p>   Illness benefit claims are submitted to the Department following the customer&rsquo;s consultation   with their general practitioner via a written application form (MC1). These claims are then processed by deciding officers of illness benefit branch using the ISTS system. Claims are decided by deciding officers appointed by the Minister under section 299 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005.  A written notification of the decision is issued to the claimant automatically by the ISTS system. The average claim processing time for illness benefit claims is one week.  </p><p>  The customer is required to continue to provide certified evidence of their incapacity which is generally provided on a weekly basis in the form of a certificate completed by the customer and their GP (MC2). The claim is maintained on this basis.</p><p>  During the course of a claim to illness benefit, a customer may be asked to attend for medical assessment by a Departmental Medical Assessor for a second opinion as to whether they are incapable of work. The opinion of the Medical Assessor following this assessment is submitted to a deciding officer for consideration regarding the customer's continued entitlement to illness benefit. Any person who is dissatisfied with a decision made by a deciding officer of the Department, may, by giving notice of appeal to the Chief Appeals officer within the statutory time limit, have the question referred to an appeals officer for determination.</p><p>  An appeal may be sent directly to the Social Welfare Appeals Office or may be handed in to any office of the Department for transmission to the Appeals Office.In illness benefit cases the question normally at issue is whether the person is incapable of work.  When an appeal is received against a decision that a claimant is not incapable of work it is normally referred for a second opinion of a different Medical Assessor.  If this Assessor considers that the appellant is incapable the case is referred back to the deciding officer for a revised decision.  </p><p>  If the 2nd Medical Assessor also expresses the opinion that the person is capable of work, the appellant is notified of the result of this examination and is supplied with a form on which to set out the complete and up to date grounds of his/her appeal. The deciding officer may revise his/her decision at this stage in the light of  new evidences provided or the case is passed to the appeals officer for consideration. An appeals officer may decide to hold an oral hearing of the appeal and will invite the appellant to attend.  On the other hand the appeals officer may be able to deal with the appeal on the basis of the written evidence provided. The appellant will be notified in writing of the outcome of the appeal.  The appeals officer will take account of all available evidence, including medical reports furnished by the appellant and evidence adduced at any oral hearing if one is granted. </p></reply>

Jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is based on a person&rsquo;s social insurance record and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is based on weekly means. A fundamental qualifying condition for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment is that a person must be available for full-time work.</p><p>  Under EU Regulations, in certain circumstances a person on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit may retain payment for a period of up to 13 weeks, while seeking work in another EU Member State. However, it is not possible to transfer jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance in the same way.</p><p>  Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is listed by EU Regulation 883/2004 as a special non-contributory cash benefit and, as a result, it is paid &ldquo;exclusively in the Member State in which the persons concerned reside, in accordance with its legislation&rdquo;.  A jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance customer, to retain his or her payment, is therefore required to remain in the State. Locally, however, arrangements may be made between a local office and a person on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, permitting the person to travel abroad for a job interview or a short holiday.</p><p>  There are no plans to introduce changes to these arrangements.</p></reply>

This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people. In this context, the major elements of the Government&rsquo;s response are set out in the Pathways to Work policy which is aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of the job vacancies that are created are filled by people from the Live Register, with a particular focus on those who are long term unemployed or at risk of long-term unemployment.  Many of those who became unemployed at the height of the jobs crisis in 2009 have found it particularly difficult to find employment. They are now a target priority group for activation measures.</p><p>  The Government must also take account of the fact that many people who sign on to the Live Register will exit it again within a short-time frame, without any recourse to employment schemes or intensive activation measures. For example, in 2012, of those who signed on to the Live Register, 43% had left the Register within 3 months of first signing on. Given these high exit rates, it is appropriate to apply a qualifying duration on the Live Register as a criterion to allocate scarce resources, including places on employment and training/educational  schemes, to those most in need of support. Of course, some services (for example assistance with job-search activities, use of online job search tools, participation in part-time/evening and on-line training courses) are available to all unemployed persons, regardless of their duration of unemployment, if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices.</p></reply>

However, there is no record of receipt of an actual redundancy rebate claim form (RP3).</p><p>    I am advised that a claim would not have been considered as valid at that time until receipt of all the above detailed forms.  I am further advised that the documentation submitted in April 2012 included a copy of the RP2 form only.  Despite searches undertaken, it is regretted that it is not possible to ascertain whether or not original RP1 or RP3 forms were submitted in 2003.  </p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, the Department took into account the significant timeframe since the redundancy occurred and has accepted the bona fides of the company&rsquo;s stated position on this matter, namely, that a valid redundancy rebate claim was submitted in 2003.  In so doing, the Department has acted in good faith and promptly investigated the matter following contact from the accountant in April 2012.   On the basis of the documentation provided to my Department at that time, a redundancy rebate payment was authorised and payment issued by cheque to the company concerned on 4th   September 2012.</p><p>  The Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2013 do not contain any provisions enabling a payment to be made in respect of lost interest.</p></reply>

Due to its structure and purpose the  revised Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies does not apply to the Social Welfare Tribunal.  The Chairperson is sourced by the Department of Social Protection by way of a recommendation from the Labour Court with regard to a particular candidate&rsquo;s suitability.  The current Chairperson has held the position since 2003.  He is a former Rights Commissioner (1982 to 2001) with extensive experience in dispute resolution and has been proven to hold all of the qualifications, skills and competencies necessary for the position.  </p><p>  In view of his proven suitability and his stated willingness to continue in the position I re-appointed the Chairperson for a further three year term commencing on 5th October 2012. </p><p>  Relevant legislation provides that the four ordinary members of the Tribunal are appointed by the Minister on the recommendation of the  Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) and the Irish Business Employer Confederation (IBEC).  As the term of appointment to the Tribunal expired in October 2012 both ICTU and IBEC were requested to forward their nominations for the next term and I subsequently appointed the four ordinary members recommended for a three year period effective from 5th October 2012.  </p><p>  The names of the Chairperson and of the four Ordinary Members of the Board will be supplied to the Deputy directly.</p><p>  Members of the Tribunal do not receive a salary although attendance fees are payable for hearings and meetings.

These assessments are undertaken by the Marine Institute an Agency within the aegis of the Department of Agriculture Food and Marine.</p><p>  Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) is the agency which issues oyster dredge licences under the 1959 Fisheries (Consolidation) Act.  Until the completion of an Appropriate Assessment, IFI must ensure, on a precautionary basis, that no intensification of the oyster dredge fishery occurs.  This precautionary policy has been further strengthened the Habitats Directive as transposed by European Commission (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 </p><p>  In accordance with this principle, IFI limit the number of licences annually to no more than the average number of licences that have been issued over the previous 5 years when dredging actually took place, prior to 2011.  If the number of licences issued in 2011 was restricted then the number issued in the years after 2011 must not exceed that number until the Appropriate Assessment is completed by the Marine Institute. </p><p>  This precautionary management regime means that a total of 24 licences are available for issue in 2013 in the Lough Swilly area. </p><p>  The Appropriate Assessment, when completed, will provide a status report on the current fishery, identify potential impacts of current fishing and aquaculture activities in Lough Swilly and identify the necessary conservation measures required to ensure sustainable management of the fishery into the future. </p></reply>

It has been liberalised since 1999 and has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available on a county-by-county basis can be found on the website of the ComReg at <i>.</i></p><p>  The State can only become involved in the provision of broadband services on a  commercial basis in accordance with the market economy investor principle or in the provision of broadband services in instances of clear market failure, in accordance with EU State Aid rules.  The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.</p><p>  My Department entered into a contract in late 2008 with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (&#8220;3&#8221;) for the delivery of the National Broadband Service (NBS).  The scheme offers a basic broadband service, in line with EU State aid clearance, to fixed residences and businesses located within certain designated Electoral Divisions.  In County Longford, NBS services are available within 11 of its<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  55 Electoral Divisions.  Under EU State Aid rules, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.</p><p>  The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) was launched in 2011 in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive broadband provision.  This Scheme was aimed at making a basic broadband service available to unserved premises in rural areas, not already covered by the NBS.  Commercial service providers were in a position to offer services to all applicants under the Scheme from County Longford.</p><p>  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&#8217;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013, and the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  </p><p>  The Government&#8217;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&#8217;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  Specifically, it commits to:</p><p>70Mbps to 100Mbps available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015; at least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population; and a minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country.</p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&#8217;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015. The commercial sector is already making these investments in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.</p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention. </p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p><p>  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including Newtowncashel, County Longford, will have speeds of at least 30Mbps. </p></reply>

Better Energy Homes provides a financial incentive to private homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their homes.  Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying BER. By the end of February 2013 the Scheme had dispersed over &euro;150 million in Exchequer funding, providing 353,232 energy efficiency measures to 138,970 homes.</p><p>  The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan and the Programme for Government include a commitment to roll out a Better Energy Financing (i.e. pay-as-you-save) energy retrofit scheme for domestic buildings after 2013.  The Better Energy Financing (BEF) model proposes that the current suite of Exchequer funded grants for energy efficiency measures, excluding the low-income housing retrofit programme, will be replaced by a new financing scheme open to households and commercial operators.  </p><p>  The key benefit to the homeowner of such a financing mechanism is that the scheme will allow them to secure upfront financing for energy efficiency upgrades to their homes, and in the process remove one of the key energy efficiency barriers.  The consumer will also benefit through the creation of a robust quality assurance process that will protect consumers and ensure high-quality workmanship. </p><p>My Department has put in place a project team to design a replacement retrofit financing scheme under the direction of a Project Board representing key state and industry stakeholders.  Project resources have been drawn from industry experts and elsewhere in the public sector.  It is planned that the design of the scheme will be developed over the coming months and that a public consultation process will be undertaken later this year.  </p></reply>

This will determine whether it is beneficial for both countries to enter into an Inter-Governmental Agreement under the Renewable Energy Directive to provide for renewable energy trading.</p><p>  If an Inter-Governmental Agreement is entered into, there are potential significant employment opportunities.  All relevant State agencies, particularly in the enterprise area, would have to coordinate their activities early in the process to ensure employment potential of export projects is maximised.</p><p>  There are currently a number of potential project developers that have expressed interest in renewable export. In terms of our negotiations with the UK, we have not yet determined or agreed the selection process for potential joint projects, which will be a further matter to be discussed and negotiated in the coming year.   Any such selection process will, of course, be open and transparent.  It is in this context that Bord na M&oacute;na recently published a notice on etenders to establish market soundings with a view to exploring the possibility of collaborating with other market participants on a major renewable energy export project. This was not a public request for tenders nor a competition call and Bord na M&oacute;na clearly states that no decision to proceed with such a project has in fact been made.</p><p>Bord na M&oacute;na&#8217;s traditional peat business is in decline and due to environmental and climate change concerns, the company has embarked on its &#8220;New Contract with Nature&#8221; strategy, designed to transition the company towards a new more sustainable business.  Reducing its dependence on peat and maximising on opportunities in the low carbon economy are the core drivers of Bord na M&oacute;na&#8217;s transformation under its &#8220;New Contract with Nature&#8221;.   Bord na M&oacute;na has set objectives for the Group over the next 15 to 20 years to transform each of its business units, to be a leading provider of sustainable products and services both nationally and internationally.  It is vital for Ireland to grasp the opportunities for underpinning economic growth through sustainable, competitive<b></b>  energy policy.</p><p>  Bord na M&oacute;na&#8217;s ongoing strategy of diversification and commitment to sustainability is a key driver in the development of installed wind energy capacity at existing cut away bog sites and the company is progressing a number of significant wind farm projects on its properties.  The recent notice to determine &#8220;market soundings&#8221; is a further move in exploring future opportunities consistent with its diversification strategy.</p><p>In 2012 the Government announced a programme of State asset disposals which is currently progressing and which includes the sale of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&#8217;s energy business and some of ESB&#8217;s non-strategic power generation capacity. Bord na M&oacute;na is not part of the State asset disposal process.  </p></reply>

These stations were founded as commercial operations with creating a profit for their owners as their primary objective.  Station owners sought and accepted licences on clear commercial terms.  In many cases, their success in the licence application process was assisted by the voluntary commitments they gave in regard to the provision of public service type content, over and above that required by the relevant legislation.  The fact that some of these stations are now undergoing an understandable degree of financial stress does not mean that the State should immediately step in and provide funding &ndash; they are and remain commercial companies.     Moreover, it should also be noted that the very popularity of these stations in the communities they serve is, in many cases, as a distinct result of the local news content and current affairs type programming that they provide and which, in turn, gives them a powerful advertising presence and thus earning potential.  As the economy recovers, it is to be expected that this commercial pressure will ease as advertising revenues recover apace. </p><p>  In addition, as the Deputy may be aware, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) is presently engaged in the first five year review of the funding of public service broadcasting corporations, RT&Eacute; and TG4, under Section 124 of the Broadcasting Act 2009.  As part of this review, the Authority will specifically examine the impact of further &lsquo;top slicing&rsquo; of the available licence fee fund on the ability of these two broadcasters to deliver on their statutory public service mandates.  The findings of this review will be used to inform my Department&rsquo;s policy making in this area.</p></reply>

This involved 42 installations of various microgeneration technologies.  A final monitoring report on the performance of the installations and learning from the programme is awaited from SEAI.  This will inform future policy development. </p><p>  Electric Ireland has been offering a 9c/kwh feed in tariff, on a commercial basis, to domestic microgenerators since February 2009. No other electricity supply company has to date chosen to enter the market and to offer a microgeneration feed-in-tariff on a commercial basis, although the Commission for Energy Regulation invited them to do so.</p><p>  Previously, a joint ESB/Electric Ireland microgeneration support scheme for the domestic sector offering a total of 19c/kwh (comprising &#8364;10c/kwh from ESB Networks combined with the 9c/kwh from ESB Customer Supply (now Electric Ireland)) ran for 3 years (February 2009-February 2012) and had a take up of between 500 and 600 installations.</p><p>  In terms of current supports, it is noteworthy that the REFIT scheme operated by my Department does not set lower limits.  There are currently some very small hydro plants operating in the scheme, as well as some small landfill gas and anaerobic digestion (AD) plants. </p><p>  In REFIT 3, covering the biomass sector, the tariff structure is weighted in favour of smaller scale developments, with a higher tariff being offered for AD plants of less than half a megawatt (500 kW) and biomass CHP plants that are less than1.5MW (1500kW).</p><p><i>REFIT 3 Tariffs </i></p><p>  i. AD CHP (units less than or equal to 500 kWe) 15c per kWh</p><p>  ii. AD CHP (units of greater than 500 kWe) 13c per kWh</p><p>  iii.

Biomass CHP (units less than or equal to 1500kWe) 14c per kWh</p><p>  vi. Biomass CHP (units of greater than 1500kWe) 12c per kWh.</p><p>  SEAI has been asked to provide my Department with analysis of other means through which the microgeneration sector could be supported, apart from through a feed-in-tariff funded from the Public Service Obligation. In view of falling technology costs, the Department has also asked SEAI to update  analysis on the costs of varying levels of support for microgeneration technologies, with a view to considering how the sector could be supported going forward.</p></reply>

The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p><p>  In addition to consumer services, there are State-funded Metropolitan Area Networks throughout County Cork, specifically in Bantry, Blarney, Carrigaline, Charleville, Cork City, Dunmanway, Fermoy, Kanturk, Midleton, Mitchelstown, Passage West, Ringaskiddy, Skibbereen and Youghal.  These networks provide high capacity fibre connectivity for businesses and telecoms operators in the region.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  Specifically, it commits to:70Mbps to 100Mbps available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015; at least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population; and a minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country.</p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015. The commercial sector is already making these investments in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.</p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention. </p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p><p>  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including, Whitechurch  County Cork will have at least 30Mbps connectivity. </p></reply>

The focus of the Government is on implementing the Programme for Government commitment to reduce the number of TDs following the publication of the results of the 2011 census. The first step in this was taken with the enactment of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2011 to provide for the Constituency Commission to recommend a total number of members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann within the range of 153 to 160, reduced from a range of 164 to 168.

The final step was taken with the initiation of the Electoral (Amendment) (D&aacute;il Constituencies) Bill on 5 October 2012 to implement in full the recommendations of the Constituency Commission including a reduction in the number of TDs to 158. That Bill was passed by the D&aacute;il on 28 February 2013. It is now being considered by the Seanad.

The charge is set at &euro;200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties. It is a matter for an owner, whether resident in Ireland or elsewhere, to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the charge.   </p><p>  The provision of information to potentially liable owners was regarded as an important element in the introduction of the Non Principal Private Residence Charge in 2009 and in subsequent years. The associate d communication campaign, includes media advertisements funded by my Department, information made available by local authorities, and website hosted information, in circumstances in which the legal onus is on the liable owner to declare liability and make payment   has achieved its general goals of raising awareness and encouraging compliance . Much of this information, such as information available online and press advertisements in Irish communities , was available t o liable persons living abroad.   </p><p>  Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect the Non Principal Private Residence Charge and late payment fees due to it, and all Charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned. In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority. Guidelines have also been issued to local authorities in relation to the operation of the &ldquo;care and management&rdquo; provisions of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 and local authorities are expected to implement these guidelines appropriately.   </p></reply>

It is not intended that domestic water charges will commence before 2014. The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Government has also decided that Irish Water, a new State-owned water company to be established as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group, will be responsible for the metering programme. </p><p>The Water Services Bill 2013, which completed its passage through the D&aacute;il last week, will assign the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the metering programme. The Bill also assigns to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) the power to advise the Government on the development of a regulatory framework for water services.   </p><p>  Affordability measures will be addressed by my Department and the Department s of Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform , in consultation with the CER , Irish Water and other stakeholders, in the context of developing a water pricing framework. The agreed approach will then be reflected in the charging structure established by the CER. </p><p>  In addition, Irish Water will be required to have a range of options in place to assist householders who have difficulties in paying their bills. For example, a wide range of flexible payment options are available for the other utility services and it is expected that these will be replicated for water services. </p></reply>

The adoption of individual development contribution schemes is a reserved function of the locally elected members of each planning authority.   While planning authorities, and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, are required to have regard to the guidelines in performance of their functions under the Planning Acts, it is a matter for the members to determine the level of contributions and the types of developments to which they will apply.   Dublin City Council&rsquo;s current development contributions scheme was adopted by the elected members before the publication of the new statutory guidelines. Nevertheless, the scheme reflects very closely the final content of the statutory guidance and contains several innovative provisions that are fully consistent with the pro-jobs/pro-planning objectives of the guidelines.</p><p>  The guidelines were issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act s 2000 - 2012. This means that planning authorities are required to have regard to the guidelines in performance of their functions under the Planning Acts. However, the guidelines do not seek to alter the roles and functions of the elected members, the executive functions of local authorities or the role of my Department. They are intended, rather, to provide the necessary statutory and policy framework within which individual development contribution schemes are adopted by each local authority.</p></reply>

The statement emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness. The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.  When I published the statement, I announced a set of indicators which will be used to demonstrate the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed. These indicators will give a clearer picture of homelessness in Ireland, and, in quantifying its on-going extent, will support the bringing forward of realistic and practical solutions.</p><p>  While I acknowledge that the approach to all forms of homelessness, including child, youth and adult homelessness should be fully integrated, my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is currently overseeing a review of the Youth Homelessness Strategy.  I established a high-level three-person oversight group for the purpose of reviewing the approach being advocated in the statement, reviewing progress with indicators, identifying obstacles and proposing solutions.  In relation to the funding available for homelessness accommodation and related services, the Revised Estimates Volume to be published shortly by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will outline the level of funding available in 2013. The allocation of this funding to housing authorities will be undertaken by my Department in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Primary legislation is required to underpin the imposition of the levy and my Department is currently advancing the drafting of the General Scheme of a Bill to provide for this. It is my intention that the Bill will be published and enacted in the shortest possible timeframe and there will be no delay on my part in this regard.</p><p>  The Government also approved the establishment of a Pyrite Resolution Board and I have previously announced its establishment under the Chairmanship of Mr. John O&rsquo;Connor, former Chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and the appointment of four Board members. The construction stakeholders (the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Concrete Federation and HomeBond) have agreed to establish a not-for-profit entity to operate the remediation scheme. The Resolution Board will work closely with the entity to oversee and ensure the effective implementation of a pyrite remediation scheme for homeowners who have no other avenues of redress open to them.  The Pyrite Resolution Board is working on drawing up the precise scope of the remediation scheme, eligibility criteria, procedures, priorities, etc. It is also in the process of developing its own website where it will publish documentation and a system for receiving applications from eligible homeowners.</p><p>  My Department is also engaging in discussions with a number of financial institutions facilitated by the Irish Banking Federation with a view to securing a loan facility which the not-for-profit entity would draw down to permit the earliest possible commencement of remediation works. It is intended that detailed negotiations with the prospective lenders on the terms and conditions of this facility will be concluded by the not-for-profit entity. Loan funds drawn down would be repaid over time from the proceeds of the statutory levies.   </p><p>  Pyrite remediation works have been completed on a number of social housing projects and in a number of other cases they are at the early stages of investigation and testing. Extensive remediation work to address pyrite problems in the apartment complex of 124 units at Sillogue 4, Ballymun and the Clancarthy Senior Citizens complex have been completed, while tenders have been received in the case of six units at Avilla Park. While my Department is making funding available for these projects, in the longer term, all legal liabilities will be pursued with a view to recouping the cost of these works. </p><p>  The report of the Pyrite Panel indicated that 1,100 private dwellings had been or were in the process of being remediated at March, 2012. I understand remediation works, funded under various forms of insurance cover, are progressing in a considerable number of cases and are also being undertaken directly by builders.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s responsibility is to ensure that there is an adequate legislative and financial system in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation.</p><p>  The 1998 Act places a strong emphasis on consultation with all stakeholders and interested parties, an important requirement in ensuring good community relations between the Traveller and settled community on the issue of Traveller accommodation.  Local Authorities are required to prepare their multi-annual Traveller Accommodation Programmes in consultation with other statutory bodies, community groups and other relevant parties, Travellers and the public in general. Local authorities are also required to establish a Local Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee (LTACC), which is representative of Travellers, local authority elected members and the public. The primary role of the LTACC is to advise on Traveller accommodation issues locally.  The purpose of these consultative arrangements is to ensure that the interests of all concerned with, or affected by, proposals for Traveller accommodation are considered and to facilitate a planned and comprehensive response by housing authorities to the accommodation needs of Travellers.</p><p>  The current round of Traveller Accommodation Programmes will conclude at the end of 2013 and local authorities are currently making arrangements for the adoption of a new round of programmes for the period 2014-2018.

While many important developments were encouraged by these schemes, independent reviews concluded that the tax costs of the initiatives were high relative to the outputs achieved. The Department of Finance wound down previous schemes to take account of the current adverse economic climate and the legacy costs of such schemes to the Exchequer, as investors sought to use their reliefs and capital allowances. Similarly, the Urban and Village Renewal Programme 2000-2006, through which grant assistance was provided by my Department to local authorities for a range of interventions to upgrade the fabric of the built environment in cities, towns and villages, ended in early 2008. That scheme involved total EU and Exchequer co-financed expenditure of over &#8364;158m. The 2007-2013 Urban<b></b>and Village Regeneration Programme, administered by my Department, was deferred due to budgetary constraints. </p><p>  Nonetheless, my Department remains committed to working with local government and other community development and enterprise stakeholders to ensure that a recovering economy will result in an even distribution of opportunity. In this regard there is a need to target in an integrated way urban<b></b>areas which face particular problems resulting from both the economic downturn and investments in the past which did not facilitate the development of sustainable communities capable of benefiting from the period of high prosperity or coping with the subsequent downturn.  Major regeneration programmes in Ballymun and Limerick together with a range of other remedial works schemes across the country are being prioritised to assist in addressing this deficit. </p><p>  In addition, I am also seeking to ensure that the forward planning process plays a part in supporting urban development. My Department recently published statutory guidelines for planning authorities on Development Contributions. These contain a strong focus on supporting vibrant town centres by directing planning authorities to put in place reduced rates of development contributions or waivers to support town centre development and to incentivise activity through lower development contributions in the areas prioritised for development in the relevant core strategy. </p></reply>

This figure continually fluctuates as households are allocated housing and new households apply for housing support. Detailed information on the latest statutory assessment of housing need, carried out in March 2011 and including a breakdown by housing authority, is available on my Department&#8217;s website &#8211; , or on the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency's website at </p><p>  The Government&#8217;s housing policy statement, published in June 2011, clearly identifies that the priority for Government will be to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support.</p><p>  I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested.  To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.  The social housing capital budget has been reduced from &#8364;1.535 billion in 2008 to &#8364;332.7m in 2012, with an anticipated outturn of some &#8364;299m for 2013, and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities are forced to operate, the outcome for 2012 is expected to be in the region of 4,000 to 4,500 housing units. Given the current volatility of the market and different challenges to the channels of supply, it is difficult to estimate the likely output of new units for social housing this year. However, it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&#8217;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure delivery of housing units for social purposes.</p></reply>

In addition, the Arsenic, Cadmium, Mercury, Nickel and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Ambient Air Regulations 2009 transpose the fourth &#8220;daughter&#8221; Directive 2004/107/EC and specify target values and monitoring requirements for arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.   </p><p>  The EPA publishes a comprehensive annual report on air quality, based primarily on the monitoring requirements of the CAFE Directive. The most recent report, <i>Air Quality in Ireland 2011 &#8211; Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality</i>  , was published in September 2012 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2011, compared to the CAFE Directive standards, based on data obtained from the 29 monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network. The Report confirmed that air quality in Ireland is of a high standard, with no individual exceedances of EU limit values recorded for 2011. </p><p>  However, the EPA's latest figures on air pollutants responsible for long-range transboundary air pollution such as acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone pollution, published in February 2013, suggests that emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx) were above the specified emission ceiling in 2011, caused primarily by emissions from the transport sector. </p><p>  In respect of monitoring of water quality, the EPA, local authorities, Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Marine Institute all monitor rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters plus ground-water quality under the Water Framework Directive on a three-year cycle.  This extensive monitoring programme provides a good overview of current water quality and trends as they develop.</p><p>  Water quality trends emerging in recent years include a notable decline in the incidence of serious pollution events from 39 sites in the 2004-2006 period, to 20 sites in the 2007-2009 period and currently down to 11 sites. There has also been a stabilisation in the length of river channel regarded as unpolluted, at approximately 71% of the length surveyed. However, the period has also been marked by a steady decline in the number of river sites at high ecological status.</p><p>  Comprehensive reports on water quality are published every three years by the EPA and are available for download at .</p></reply>

Section 44<b></b>of the Defamation Act 2009 provides for the Minister for Justice and Equality to make an Order, subject to the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas granting statutory recognition as a Press Council to a body that seeks recognition as such. It requires that the Minister be satisfied that the applicant body complies with the provisions set out in Schedule 2. No more than one such body can be recognised and the order may be revoked.   On 21 April, 2010, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform signed the Defamation Act 2009 (Press Council) Order 2010  (S.I. No. 163 of 2010) granting recognition to the Press Council of Ireland. e Order took immediate effect.</p><p>  e new complaints system which is operated by the Press Council recognised pursuant to the Defamation Act is, I believe, providing a useful, efficient and cost free remedy for members of the public who are affected by breaches of the Code of Practice. </p><p>  Formal recognition of the Press Council grants qualified privilege to the decisions and reports of the Press Council and the Press Ombudsman. is strengthens and underpins the system of press regulation in Ireland which can only serve to improve the service to the general public.</p><p>  It is appropriate that strong emphasis is being placed by the Press Council and Ombudsman on resolving complaints through conciliation or mediation. Moreover, the print industry is, in general,  committed to the press complaints initiative and has provided the necessary financial backing to support its operation. is cooperation is vital to the long term success of the new Irish press complaints system. </p><p>  A most important requirement is that publications that are members of the Press Council have to publish in full, decisions of either the Press Ombudsman or the Press Council, which uphold complaints made under the Code of Practice for Newspapers and Periodicals. </p><p>A review of the operation of the Defamation Act 2009 is required within five years of its coming into operation.</p></reply>

The objective of the network is to reduce the number of speed related collisions and so save lives, as excessive or inappropriate speeding is a major factor in road traffic collisions and fatalities.</p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na determine the scheduling of the speed monitoring and survey sessions carried out.  I have no role in this process, it being an operational policing matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am informed that a targeted approach to speed enforcement is being undertaken in order to significantly reduce the incidence of fatal and serious injuries and improve road safety.  To this end, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in conjunction with the National Roads Authority, completed an extensive analysis of the collision history on the road network. Sections of road have been identified where a significant proportion of collisions occurred whereby speed was deemed the primary contributory factor.</p><p>  Based on this analysis, a list of speed enforcement zones has been developed with the aim of providing information to motorists in order to raise awareness of speeding in these zones. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na utilises these zones in order to direct speed enforcement activity, in a proportionate and targeted manner.</p><p>  I am also advised that safety cameras only operate on sections of road which have a history of collisions occurring where speed was a contributory factor. The locations of these speed enforcement zones are in the public domain and are available on the Garda website www.garda.ie.  </p><p>These speed enforcement zones are continually reviewed in light of survey data, collision history and local feedback to ensure that enforcement activity is properly targeted.   Surveys continue to be conducted to ensure the appropriate deployment of safety cameras on roads which have been identified as subject of inappropriate speed and where fatal and serious injury collisions continue to occur.</p></reply>

The Deputy is aware that Criminal Courts of Justice complex was provided on the basis of a public private partnership contract covering the design, construction, fit out, maintenance and provision of services.  Following an extensive procurement exercise, the Courts Service entered into a contract with a Public Private Partnership Company (PPPCo) in October 2007.    </p><p>  The Courts Service contract is therefore with the PPPCo which has sub-contracted various elements including the design and construction, as well as the provision of services, to a range of third party contractors.  G4S is one of these subcontractors and has been contracted by the PPPCo to provide a range of facility management services in the Criminal Courts of Justice including maintenance, cleaning, security, health &amp; safety, portering and management of utilities. </p><p>  A monthly unitary charge payment which covers the provision of the above services by G4S in addition to payments for the design and construction of the Criminal Courts of Justice amounts to &euro;1.6 million per month (VAT exclusive).  Financing, insurance and ICT services are also covered by the unitary charge.  In addition there are some items which are paid on a per usage basis.  Therefore G4S receives a proportion of the above unitary charge payment.  These contractual and financial arrangements between the PPPCo and its subcontractors are internal commercial matters for the PPPCo. </p><p>  The contract provides that 43% of the unitary charge is subject to indexation based on the CPI each year. The contract runs until February 2035 at which time the complex will be handed over to the ownership of the Courts Service in a &lsquo;as built&rsquo; standard.</p><p>  It is worth noting that this PPP contract was dealt with in detail by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his 2008 Annual Report and was also examined by a sitting of the Public Accounts Committee of this House in July 2010.  </p><p>  I should also mention that, following the construction of the Criminal Courts of Justice, the Courts Service was able to cease leaseholds on various buildings in which courtrooms had been provided, including the Distillery Building, King's Inns, the old Richmond Hospital and Bow Street.  In addition to the very considerable annual lease and rental costs, buildings also had to be maintained, cleaned and secured.  Ongoing operational savings have also been made for other criminal justice agencies, including the Irish Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

One of the consequences of that decision was that the transport arrangements in place for Ministers of State became applicable to Government Ministers, subject to very limited exceptions on security grounds.  In addition, it was decided that former Presidents and Taoisigh would only be supplied with official transport for important State occasions.

In that context, I am informed by the Garda authorities that records in relation to the cost of providing Office Holder transport have not been maintained in a manner which allow for the identification of costs associated with individual Office Holders.

The various sections of the Charities Act are subject to implementation through commencement orders.  Sections that it was possible to commence in advance of the establishment of the Charities Regulatory Authority, as provided for under the Act, have been commenced. The remainder will be commenced following the establishment of the Authority. </p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the full implementation of the Charities Act, including the establishment of a Charities Regulatory Authority, had to be examined in the context of the comprehensive review of expenditure, which took place in 2011.  Arising from this review, I delayed bringing this legislation into force as we considered how best to achieve the objectives of the Act in a context of Government spending reductions.  It remains an objective of the Government to strengthen the regulation of the sector in effective and proportionate ways.  </p><p>To advance this, a public and stakeholder consultation is being conducted by my Department on the implementation of the Charities Act and the establishment of a register of charities.  Issues covered in the consultation paper include the establishment of a Charities Regulatory Authority; the statutory registration of charities and granting of charitable status; and reporting requirements for registered charities.  Submissions should be made at .</p><p>The consultation period will run until 20 March 2013.</p></reply>

It is further provided in Section 87(3) that such information may, at the Authority's discretion, be included in the Database, notwithstanding the fact that such a lease was entered into before the commencement of Section 87. Section 87(4) provides that Section 87(3) shall not apply to a commercial property lease entered into more than 5 years before the commencement of Section 87. I am advised by the Authority that it is satisfied that the information available on commercial leases entered into on or after 1 January 2010 is accurate and reliable and that it proposes, on the initial publication of the database, to include all leases entered into with effect from that date.</p><p>  Section 88 of the Act also provides that the Authority make the information available on the Commercial Leases Database publicly available "on the payment of the appropriate fee". While the Authority will make certain limited information available free of charge, all of the information, which tenants are required to furnish to the Authority under Section 88 of the Act, will only be made available on the payment of a fee.</p></reply>

So called "Join Irish Citizen" applications are taken to include Join Spouse (Irish National), Join Partner (Irish National) &amp; Join Parent (Irish National). Application numbers in this cohort have remained relatively consistent over time, with only minor variations from month to month.</p><p>  There is no significant backlog in the processing of applications. On average fewer than 100 applications are awaiting a decision at any given time and decisions on applications received in my Department  in early February are currently being finalised.  However, as each application is individually considered on its own merits, the actual processing time for dealing with such applications can vary depending on the particular circumstances of each case and the level of investigation required.  The long term or permanent nature of the intended stay in Ireland means that they require more in-depth consideration than straightforward short-stay visa applications.  In many cases, extra documentation or clarification must be sought from the persons involved and those cases cannot be finalised until the relevant documentation or clarification has been received.  Staff in my Department are fully aware of the importance of these applications to the families involved, and commencing processing of applications in the order in which they arrive is considered the fairest approach.</p><p>  On a broader note, policy in relation to visas for purposes of family reunification (not solely Join Irish Citizen applications) is currently being revised.  As a result, consideration of visa applications from dependent relatives in the ascending line, e.g. parents, to join family members in Ireland is temporarily suspended pending publication of the policy.  Applications may continue to be made, but applicants should note that these will be considered in the framework of the revised policy when published. A notification to this effect has been posted on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, www.inis.gov.ie.</p></reply>

This policy applies equally to cases which the Department&rsquo;s interpretation of the law have been upheld in the Courts as it does to cases where the Courts have found against such interpretation.  There are sound and well grounded reasons for this approach; to comment in detail on specific cases would carry the risk that the Department would be accused of interfering with the doctrine of the separation of powers between the State and the Courts.  This doctrine which is enshrined in the Constitution is of course a fundamental cornerstone of our system of justice and its interface with the executive.</p><p>  However, I would point out that my Department in its approach to legal challenges acts on foot of the legal advice available to it from the State's law officers.  In considering its approach, as well as considering the specific facts of each individual case, it must have regard to the wider implications of any such challenges and as such is required to act in order to maintain the integrity of the State's immigration policies and procedures.  My Department in dealing with all such cases acts in good faith, with integrity, in accordance with the law as it understands it to be at that time, and in accordance with the legal advice available to it.</p><p>  I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service that Bills of Cost have not been yet processed.

The Bill is, therefore, a key component of the Government's strategy to reduce legal costs in this country by way of increasing our competitiveness, both sectorally and nationally.</p><p>  The Legal Services Regulation Bill makes extensive provision, particularly in Part 9, for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients. The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles. These are contained in Schedule One and enumerate the various matters that may be taken into account if disputed costs are submitted for adjudication. These cost transparency measures will apply to barristers as well as to solicitors.</p><p>  The Bill also provides that a new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator will deal with disputes about legal costs &#8211; at present these are dealt with by the Office of the Taxing-Master. The new Office, headed by a Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator, will modernise the way disputed legal costs are adjudicated with greater transparency.  The Office will be empowered to prepare Legal Costs Guidelines. It will establish and maintain a publicly accessible Register of Determinations which will include the outcomes and reasons for its determinations about disputed legal costs.</p><p>  In addition, the Bill facilitates the setting up of new business models for the profession, in line with some of the innovations and advances made in other common law jurisdictions. These new or &quot;alternative&quot; business structures will be optional in parallel to the current and more traditional forms of legal practise and their introduction will, as provided in the Bill, follow a process of public consultation.  In other provisions the Bill lifts existing restrictions on direct professional access to a barrister and on barristers who share premises or costs from advertising themselves as such a group. The Bill also allows that a barrister in employment may provide legal services for his or her employer.   The Bill, therefore, contains numerous measures aimed at opening up the provision of legal services to more competitive legal service models building on the enormous advances that have been made in supporting business technologies.</p><p>  In relation to the role of legal executives, and as I have set out in previous Replies, the Legal Services Regulation Bill does not make any provision in relation to the role or status of legal executives nor is any such provision envisaged. As the Deputy will be aware, a number of proposals have been circulated in this regard by the Irish Institute of Legal Executives Ltd on behalf of its members. However, these are very far-reaching and represent a major and substantive departure beyond the currently recognised status and functions of a legal executive in this jurisdiction. They relate <i>inter alia</i>  to &quot;a right of audience in the District and Circuit Courts, before tribunals and, subject to review, subsequently in all courts&quot;, and to the eligibility of members for quasi-judicial and judicial appointments (e.g as District Court judges or as members of Tribunals). These proposals also draw heavily from the regulatory and practise models of England and Wales which have a distinct history and do not always correspond to those of our jurisdiction nor to those set out under current Government policy in the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011.</p><p>  While recognising that there may be additional benefits and efficiencies to be found for consumers and for the legal services sector in a more developed role for &quot;legal executives&quot; in the future, the very far-reaching proposals being made on their behalf at this time lie beyond the scope of the Legal Services Regulation Bill. They impinge on fundamental issues of substance including in relation to the courts and the judiciary. Such matters will, therefore, need to be considered separately on their own merits and in their own right, while others may come to be considered in due course by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority.

Legislative provisions relating to the regulation of money lending are provided for in the Consumer Credit Act 1995,  which is the responsibility of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p><p>  The regulation of licensed money lending is a matter primarily for my colleague, the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank of Ireland is the competent authority in this jurisdiction with regard to licensed money lending activity.  Under the 1995 Act unlicensed money lending is an offence. Persons who engage in money lending and who do not hold the necessary licence granted by the Central Bank are committing an offence under section 98 of the Act.  A person found guilty of an offence is liable on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.</p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation acts as a liaison point between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs with regard to investigations of unlicensed money lending.  I am further informed that all allegations of unlicensed money lending are investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at local level,  with the assistance of the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, where necessary.</p><p>  As I have said previously, I would strongly encourage those who may have information concerning the operation of unlicensed money lenders to notify An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who will take all measures open to them to enforce the law in this area.  I can assure the Deputy that where there is any identified requirement for additional legislative provisions in aid of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's powers under the Consumer Credit Act 1995, I will not hesitate in bringing  proposals to the attention of my colleague the Minister  for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that responsibilities in this area arise for a number of Departments. Insofar as my Department has a role in this area and in the context of the investigation of illegal money lending,  I would, of course, consider any views which the credit union movement put forward.</p></reply>

Section 12 of the Bill outlaws cruelty to all animals irrespective of whether they are classified as protected.</p><p>  The term &ldquo;protected animal&rdquo; is applied to animals under the protection i.e. ownership of humans. The difference between &ldquo;protected animals&rdquo; and those living in the wild lies in the specific obligations placed upon their owners or keepers. Wild animals, including feral cats, are defined as having no owner or keeper. It would not be sensible to apply the same provisions to these animals because it is not possible to impose an obligation on any owner to care for them. In my view, to remove the distinction between domesticated and feral animals would significantly weaken the protection given to those animals with an identifiable owner, while not serving to increase the protection for those animals living in the wild. </p></reply>

No. 532 of 2012, which provides the legal basis for requiring herd owners to take tissue samples and to forward these samples to a designated approved laboratory.  The tissue tag meets the requirements of the relevant EU regulations on the identification of bovine animals.  As BVD is not subject to control at EU level, EU approval is not required for the eradication programme.  However, my Department has advised the EU Commission of the programme.  With regard to the BVD test, testing both blood and tissue (ear punch) samples are widely used diagnostic testing methods for BVD and, when combined with appropriate validated test methods, are suitable for the detection of persistently infected cattle.  Testing is carried out by laboratories designated for that purpose as listed in S.I. No. 532 of 2012.  One of the requirements for designation of a laboratory is that it performs BVD testing according to externally accredited standards.  The test methods in use in Ireland (ELISA and RTPCR) have been extensively used in similar national BVD programmes, including Switzerland and Germany.  The tests are considered to be accurate and reliable.  However, it is recognised that no biological test is 100% accurate.  A disclaimer to this effect is included on the BVD information leaflet distributed to farmers.</p><p>  With regard to the compulsory removal of animals once they give a positive reaction to the test, one of the key objectives of the BVD programme is to prevent transfer of infection between herds.  The data generated through the voluntary phase of the programme has highlighted the risks presented by the trade in animals of unknown status.  The BVD Order 2012 addresses this risk by prohibiting the movement of animals that are under suspicion of being affected with BVD, except for disposal directly to slaughter or under ministerial permit.  My Department recognises the importance of prompt removal of persistently infected animals to prevent further spread of infection within and between herds and encourages herd owners to remove persistently infected animals immediately.  I am satisfied that the BVD regulations are in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1993.</p><p>  While the Irish Cattle Breeders Federation does not have a statutory role in the BVD eradication scheme, it plays an important role in the programme in that it receives the test results from designated testing laboratories and transfers these to the AIM/AHCS system in a cost-effective and time-effective manner.  The Irish Cattle Breeders Federation also issues letters and SMS text messages relating these test results to farmers on behalf of my Department.  In addition, it provides data to the BVD implementation group in relation to the management of the programme.  Any contribution made by herd owners to the operational costs of the Irish Cattle Breeders Federation in the context of purchasing tags is voluntary.  This voluntary contribution pre-dates the introduction of the BVD eradication scheme and is completely unrelated to it.  I emphasise that my Department attaches considerable importance to the successful eradication of BVD and is making a significant contribution towards the scheme, in particular through its financial support to Animal Health Ireland.  In addition, my Department has already committed to providing, free of charge, a blood-based test to confirm the persistently infected status of those calves that give a positive result on tag testing.  It will also provide a blood test for the dams of those calves and any progeny of persistently infected cows.</p></reply>

A very small number of farmers are using it, with lime and sawdust more commonly used as bedding material for cubicle beds for Dairy and Suckler cows.  Slurry is an inherently dangerous material that produces toxic gasses, including hydrogen sulphide, particularly during agitation.  The addition of gypsum to slurry has the potential to increase the toxic gas levels, but all slurry is highly dangerous and must be handled with great caution.  My Department is examining the potential of the use of gypsum to increase the level of hydrogen sulphide production in slurry.  Other jurisdictions are evaluating the use of gypsum as a bedding material with research being carried out in the United Kingdom.  It is expected that this research will be completed by the end of the year.  My Department has been in contact with the Health and Safety Authority and Teagasc and will consider what action, if any, may be necessary.  Farm safety is a number one priority.  My Department works closely with the Health and Safety Authority on farm safety issues.  My Department is represented on the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee which includes representatives from the Health and Safety Authority, Teagasc, the IFA, the ICMSA and others.  My Department has issued guidance on the safe handling of slurry and this should be followed at all times.  Slurry should only be agitated from a point outside of the animal house, with all of the animals removed from the house, all doors and vents fully opened, and on a breezy day.  Further, for best practice, operators should also stand back from tank while the tank is being agitated as toxic gasses will be released during the agitation of any slurry.</p></reply>

I believe that this can be achieved only in the context of a significantly reformed EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) which places long term sustainability at its core. These objectives need to be balanced with the need to deliver a sustainable and ecologically sound fisheries landscape not just for the coming year but for future generations. This is at the heart of my efforts in the Irish Presidency to progress the process of CFP reform between now and the end of June. We have already made significant progress along this road with the agreement at the February Fisheries Council of a process to finally end the practice of discarding fish at sea over a phased basis.   This policy and the other elements of the Basic Common Fisheries Policy Regulation will be negotiated with the EU Parliament and the EU Commission over the coming months with a view to securing overall agreement during the Irish Presidency.</p><p>  In the current economic climate, it is necessary to have a policy that supports innovation, quality and added value in the sector.  In that regards, Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) operates a scheme that provides a framework of support for the Irish Seafood Industry intent on achieving internationally accredited, third party audited, standards for wild capture fisheries.  Accordingly, appropriate standards provide an opportunity for the Irish fishing industry to not just reassure but also demonstrate their commitment to responsible fishing practices and to thereby retain and build market share.   I am also pleased to report that BIM will shortly launch a new Fleet Modernisation Scheme co-funded by my Department and the European Fisheries Fund.  This new scheme will provide grant aid to fishing vessels for investment in on-board equipment to improve working conditions, hygiene, product quality and energy efficiency.  Grants of up to 40% will be available up to a maximum of &euro;15,000 for vessels over 24 metres.  Under the terms of the scheme, grant aided equipment must not increase the ability of the vessel to catch fish, however it may improve the value of catch through improvement of product quality. </p></reply>

Article 2(5) of the Regulation specifically exempts those species listed in Annex IV from the provisions of the Regulation, with the exceptions of articles 3 and 4.  Article 4 requires Member States to ensure that all appropriate measures are taken to avoid adverse effects to biodiversity, and especially to species, habitats and ecosystem functions which may be expected to arise, inter alia, from the spreading of these species into the wild. </p><p>  The exemption in the Regulation for the Pacific Oyster is that it has been in production for many years and has been moved from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  Based on the results of a research study the Marine Institute has confirmed that Pacific oysters (<i>Crassostrea gigas</i>) have reproduced in a number of Bays in Ireland, including Lough Swilly.  It has not, however, been demonstrated that the presence of <i>C. gigas</i>   has resulted in ecological damage to marine communities within the Lough. </p><p>  In response to the presence of Pacific oysters in the Lough, a fishery, regulated by Inland Fisheries Ireland,  has developed for feral oysters which would appear to have resulted in the removal of considerable biomass of Pacific oysters from the Lough over the last 2 years.  In addition, oyster aquaculture operations have started to use triploid Pacific oysters which are considered, for the most part, reproductively sterile and, therefore, will reduce the contribution of larvae from this source. </p><p>  The Marine Institute is in the process of finalising an &#8220;Appropriate Assessment&#8221; under Article 6 of the Habitats Directive and this will include management recommendations in respect of oyster production in the Lough.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-12a.1278.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013031200056#WRY03800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 545 to 550, inclusive, together.</p><p>  Some 11,402 horses were slaughtered in slaughter plants approved by my Department in 2012. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has advised that 12,960 horses were slaughtered in local authority approved slaughter plants in 2012. I understand that the bulk of the meat from these animals was exported for human consumption, some following further processing in approved cutting plants in Ireland. The remainder was exported as full carcasses. The main export markets are Belgium, France and Italy.</p><p>  Under EU law, responsibility for compliance with food safety and traceability requirements rests in the first instance with food business operators (FBOs). This is augmented by official controls, applied at different stages in the food supply chain. My Department implements official controls in relation to horse identification at marts and other sales venues, in abattoirs under its supervision and at points of entry to the country. </p><p>  All equines (which include horses, ponies and donkeys) are required to be identified in accordance with EU and national legislation.  Equines issued with a passport after 1 July 2009 must have a corresponding microchip implanted by a veterinarian, which is recorded in the passport and creates a link between the passport and the animal. The passport includes information on any veterinary medicines administered to equines.  An equine for slaughter for human consumption must be accompanied to the slaughterhouse by its passport and the information on the passport determines whether the animal can be slaughtered for human consumption. Horses treated with certain veterinary medicines such as phenylbutazone, known in the industry as &#8216;bute&#8217;, are permanently excluded from the human food chain in order to protect public health and the passport of the horse in question is endorsed by the prescribing veterinary practitioner to this effect. </p><p>  My Department has detailed procedures for the slaughter of horses in abattoirs under its supervision and has communicated these and the checks required both to its staff and the business operators. It has liaised with passport issuing agencies in Ireland and has developed protocols to allow abattoir operators to check the details of passports with these agencies to seek to ensure that they are valid and that only those horses eligible for slaughter are slaughtered. Where forged or tampered passports accompanying horses to slaughter are detected, it is the policy that such animals are destroyed and removed from the food chain.</p><p>  Ongoing vigilance is maintained in relation to official controls in this area. In that connection, the European Communities (Equine) (Amendment) Regulations, S.I. No. 371/2012,<b></b>  introduced recently, provide for the updating of S.I. No. 357/2011 (European Communities (Equine) Regulations 2011) to strengthen the powers of the Minister in relation to approval of an issuing body for equine passports, authorised officers and prosecutions in relation to equine identification.</p><p>  My Department is establishing a centralized equine database. The intention is that this database will be used at abattoirs to assist in verifying the authenticity of horse passports for the equine presented and to record its date of slaughter.</p><p>  I can confirm that my Department has received a number of complaints in this area, some of which have been non-specific in nature. Information received in relation to alleged illegal activities in this State is taken seriously and investigated as appropriate by my Department and in certain cases by the Gardai. There is ongoing contact in this regard between the Department and the authorities in Northern Ireland and Britain. It must also be noted however that some claims have been made in the public domain in relation to this issue which, when examined by my Department, did not stand up to close scrutiny or warrant further investigation.</p><p>  While my Department does not comment on ongoing investigations, appropriate corrective action is taken if non-compliances are detected. I can advise that during 2011-2012 the Department issued Compliance Notices to two horse slaughter plants under its supervision. This led to temporary suspension of activities while corrective measures were put in place. In addition the approvals of one organisation to maintain a stud book and issue horse passports were revoked during 2012. </p><p>  With regard specifically to the BBC Spotlight programme on 5 March, it would not be appropriate for me to comment publicly on allegations made. I was not available for interview for this particular programme because of other commitments but I can advise that my Department did comment on queries received from the programme makers. I understand that some of the allegations made in this programme relate to activities outside the State, in which case appropriate checks would be a matter for authorities in the jurisdictions concerned. I understand issues were also raised in relation to an equine slaughter plant in this jurisdiction, which at the time concerned was under the supervision of a local authority. At present there are two local authority supervised equine slaughter plants in operation &#8211; one in Co. Offaly and one in Co. Limerick. I have decided to take both these plants under the supervision of my Department.</p></reply>

While Childminding Advisory Officers were established in most county areas they were not always located with the local CCC.</p><p>  In recent years, HSE funding for the Childminding Advisory Officer posts has gradually decreased, and is no longer in place in some areas.  I asked officials in my Department to engage with the City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) on this issue and to establish the position in relation to these posts in each city and county childcare committee area.  A table which outlines the position as indicated by the CCCs is being collated and will issued directly to the Deputy in the coming days.</p><p>  The responses received do reflect the reduction in support for these post which I understand is due to pressure on HSE resource and the need to prioritise funding to other areas of front-line services.  While this is not a welcome development, I would point to the fact that the CCCs are now well-established and effective bodies at local level, and that supporting the childminding sector is an integral part of their work.  I am satisfied that childminders continue to have access to support, training and advice.</p><p>  My Department provides annual funding to each CCC to enable them to support and advise all childcare providers at local level.  In 2012, the total amount allocated to the CCCs was &euro;11.3m.  In addition, in 2012 my Department provided &euro;220,000 to the CCCs for Childminding Development Grants.  My Department also provides annual funding, totalling &euro;2.85m in 2012, to seven National Voluntary Childcare Organisations to provide support at a local level to their members.  This included &euro;358,000 for Childminding Ireland, the representative body for childminders.</p><p>  My Department has commenced work on Ireland's first Early Years Strategy.  I have received Government approval for the approach I am taking in developing this Strategy as an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of our Early Years sector, aimed at providing a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to the age of six.  One of the policy issues which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the Early Years Strategy is the development of the child minding sector as a fully-integrated component of early childhood care and education, in particular for the under-one age group.</p></reply>

This new initiative, which is expected to receive full year funding of &euro;14 million, will support parents to take up employment by providing over 6,000 quality after-school places for children attending primary school.  This initiative is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment and demonstrates how Departments are working together to deliver the Government's agenda on promoting employment and supporting children's development.   </p><p>  The after-school places, as with those funded under the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) and Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programmes, are expected to be available in both commercial and community providers.  </p><p>  Officials in both my own Department and the Department of Social Protection are currently working to finalise the details of the after-school scheme and its operational arrangements including such matters as accountability and eligibility, and responsibility for same.  As soon as this work has been completed, further information will be  made available.  </p><p>  It is intended to encourage the provision of after school services in primary school settings.  I understand that it is the policy of the Department of Education and Skills, who have responsibility for primary school education, to encourage schools to share their facilities with community groups and organisations.  My Department also favours the location of pre-school facilities and after-school facilities on or adjacent to primary school grounds where possible.  </p><p>  However, the vast majority of national schools are not owned by the State and while I understand that the Trustees and Boards of Management of these schools have been encouraged to respond positively to requests for school facilities to be shared, their right to prioritise the interests of the principal school users must be recognised.  Therefore any decision in relation to the use of school premises for an after-school or pre-school programme ultimately lies with the relevant Board or Trustees and my Department would not have a role in this matter.   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-12a.1321.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013031200056#WRZ03200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 565 and 566 together.</p><p>Some &euro;53.173m is being provided in 2013 by my Department to support the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and youth services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth work sector.  Youth work programmes and youth services are delivered to some 400,000 young people by over 1,400 youth work personnel, who in turn support a large volunteer base of some 40,000.</p><p>Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE) my Department has tried to ensure that, in the determination process for the funding allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any necessary reductions in funding.  The savings required under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in respect of this year amount to &euro;5.393m which equates to almost a 10% reduction on 2012 funding.</p><p>The reduced allocation in the youth budget in recent years has required much tighter budget management and prioritisation.  In the course of recent months I, along with officials of my Department have met with representatives of the youth sector on an ongoing basis with a view to determining how best to minimise the impact of the reduction in the 2013 budget on youth services in the challenging budgetary situation that we face at this time.</p><p>The funding is administered on behalf of my Department by some 33 bodies including Vocational Education Committees (VECs), Local Authorities, HSE and some sporting bodies.  These administering bodies were notified of the 2013 funding allocation to projects in their respective areas in recent weeks.</p><p>In order to try and maximise the use of the funding available for youth services and programmes, my Department has afforded flexibility to the bodies administering funding on behalf of my Department to propose the reconfiguration of the allocations provided having regard to the knowledge available to these bodies about the needs of young people at local level.  Any proposals or recommendations made by a body administering funding on behalf of my Department, in relation to the distribution of funding in its locality, requires the approval of my Department before they are implemented.</p><p>In this context the City of Dublin Youth Service Board (CDYSB), as the local grant administering body in the Dublin City area, submitted proposals last week to my Department requesting that percentage reductions, different to those outlined in the CRE, would be applied to the projects in the Dublin City area.  CDYSB's proposed rationale is to seek to minimise disruption to frontline youth provision and to protect smaller projects.</p><p>It should be noted that under the CDYSB proposals the majority of projects would receive a significantly lower reduction than 10 per cent.  However, as a consequence of that, CDYSB have proposed that some larger projects would receive greater reductions.</p><p>The CDYSB proposals and the final allocations which will be made to each project, are currently being considered by my Department and at my request officials of my Department met with CDYSB on Friday 1st March to discuss the proposals.  My Department will advise CDYSB of the outcome very shortly.</p><p>Details of the overall funding allocations to CDYSB for the years 2008 to 2012 for the projects administered by that body under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2, the Local Drugs Task Force scheme together with the operational central administration costs in respect of CDYSB for the years 2008 to 2012 are outlined hereunder in tabular form.</p><p>Funding Schemes</p><p><table><tr><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th></tr><tr><td>14,891,663</td><td>15,266,221</td><td>14,733,827</td><td>14,053,650</td><td>13,107,529</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th></tr><tr><td>226,126</td><td>173,099</td><td>179,990</td><td>212,037</td><td>153,180</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></p><p>Central administrative costs of the City of Dublin Youth Service Board provide for the following:</p><p>- IT and computer maintenance</p><p>- Wages for 1 cleaner</p><p>- Utilities, light and heat</p><p>- Equipment</p><p>- Maintenance of premises</p><p>- Staff travel</p><p>- Telecommunications</p><p>- Office expenses</p><p>It should be noted that under the CRE there has been no cut to the funding being provided to support local voluntary youth clubs.  This modest funding (in excess of a million euro) plays an important role in supporting volunteer-led youth groups and in promoting and leveraging valuable voluntary activity in youth work.</p><p>In addition to the current funding provided by my Department, &euro;1.5 million in capital funding is also being provided in 2013 for youth caf&eacute;s and youth projects.  My Department will be announcing further details regarding the application process for the 2013 funding programmes very shortly.  This follows on from funding of &euro;500,000 which was provided in 2012 for the development of a number of youth caf&eacute;s which had applied for previous youth caf&eacute; funding schemes</p><p>With respect to future funding provision, my Department has commenced a comprehensive Value for Money Review of youth funding and this is expected to report later this year.</p><p>My Department has also prioritised the improvement of quality provision in youth work through publication and ongoing implementation of a National Quality Standards Framework for youth work.  The Department has also developed National Quality Standards for Volunteer-led youth groups which were launched on Monday of last week.</p></reply>

In recent years, a number of changes to the pricing and reimbursement system have been successfully introduced in Ireland. These have resulted in reductions in the prices of thousands of medicines.</p><p>  The Department and the HSE have successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs. Under this Agreement, from 1 November 2012, the HSE will only reimburse generic products which have been priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine. In the event that an originator medicine is priced at less than 50% of its initial price the HSE will require a generic price to be priced below the originator price. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate. </p><p>  In addition, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is currently before the House, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing for prescribed drugs and medicines. These reforms will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for taxpayers and patients. </p></reply>

One of the recommendations of the Forum was to amend the Regulations regarding fluoridation of public water supplies to redefine the optimal level of fluoride in drinking water from 0.8 to 1.0 parts per million (ppm) to between 0.6 and 0.8 ppm. Regulations were introduced in 2007 to give legal effect to this change.  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be safe and effective in protecting the oral health of all age groups.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-12a.1349.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013031200056#WRAA01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 573, 642, 646, 647, 651 and 660 together.</p><p>Given the challenges that persist for each individual, this Government's aim is to address the health and personal social care needs of thalidomide survivors living in Ireland.  I have stated that I am willing to enter into discussions about a health care package on a non-statutory basis; an ex-gratia payment having regard to current financial circumstances; and a statement to the D&aacute;il recognising the challenges faced by survivors.  </p><p>  There are two thalidomide representative organisations.  The largest group, the Irish Thalidomide Association announced publicly in 2012 that it had ceased talks with the Government and their legal advisors have initiated personal injuries claims against the State.</p><p>  The second organisation, the Irish Thalidomide Survivors Society, has sought an independent agency and a statutory health care package including other aspects of their needs such as housing, heating, transport and clothing, which are outside the remit of the health sector.  My position remains unchanged from that outlined in my letter to the Irish Thalidomide Survivors Society in June last year in which I requested that the Society consider, in good faith, proceeding with a Health Care Protocol which envisaged appointing and training a multi-disciplinary team, arranging a multi-disciplinary health evaluation, identifying and documenting their healthcare needs/issues and developing plans to address those needs.</p><p>  On the matter of the timing of the withdrawal of the Thalidomide drug, I have been advised that no negligence or breach of duty could be established against the State on the basis of actions undertaken by the Department at the time.  With regard to the fact that the payments made by the State to the survivors of Thalidomide and their families in 1975 were not referred to the High Court, I understand that the relevant rules of Court simply did not apply to the circumstances pertaining to the ex-gratia payment made on behalf of the Government.  The payments made by the State in 1975 to the survivors of Thalidomide and their families were not made in settlement of any legal proceedings, either existing or threatened.  The payment was not made in a legal context because the State had no liability.  It was made because the State believed then that it was appropriate to make some provision for the survivors.  The payments made were substantial and were designed to augment payments made to the survivors by the German Foundation.</p><p>  There are currently 32 Irish Thalidomide survivors.  Each survivor received lump sum payments from a German Foundation and the Irish Government in the early 1970s.  In 1975 the lump-sums paid by the Irish Government ranged from &euro;6,400 to &euro;21,000.  In addition, each survivor receives on-going monthly payments from both the German Foundation and the Irish Government.  Combining the Irish and German payments, most individuals received &euro;30,386 per annum or &euro;2,572 per month, tax free.  The German and Irish monthly allowance is not reckonable for State benefits and each individual is automatically entitled to a medical card.</p><p>  In November 2012, officials in my Department forwarded to the Secretaries of both Thalidomide organisations, details regarding a scheme of support currently being provided to survivors of thalidomide worldwide, by the Contergan Foundation.  </p></reply>

Following the initial phase of the group's work, which will concentrate on issues around Mobility Allowance and the Motorised Transport Grant, a key concentration of the group will be to look at opportunities for the enhancement of the transport options provided to the relevant persons in need.  As part of the review, the Health Service Executive (HSE) will examine the circumstances of all those currently benefiting from the schemes to ensure the identified solutions will encompass their priority mobility needs.  In addition, the Minister for Health has instructed the HSE to contact each individual in receipt of the payments to notify them of this decision.</p><p>  It is important to note that, although the Government's decision ends both schemes to new applicants with immediate effect, the payment of mobility allowance to those currently in receipt of it, will continue for another four months.  It is also important to note that the decision is in no way intended to save costs and the funding involved in the two schemes (&euro;10.6 million) remains committed to meeting the priority transport needs of people with a disability.</p><p>  In advance of the establishment of the Project Group,  Department of Health officials met with representatives of the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies, the Disability Federation of Ireland and the Irish Wheelchair Association at my request.  In addition, membership of the Project Group, which is independently chaired, is drawn from both the statutory and non-statutory sectors.  The work of the Project Group is being supported by the National Disability Authority and includes representatives from the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Disability Federation of Ireland, an independent service user and advocate for people with disabilities and a retired County Council Manager with relevant experience.  Both Minister Reilly and myself have instructed the Project Group to seek solutions across the whole of Government, so that alongside representatives from the Department of Health and the HSE, membership also includes representatives from Pobal and from the Departments of Transport, Tourism &amp; Sport, Environment, Community and Local Government, Social Protection and Finance.   </p><p>  The Project Group has already met twice and their next meeting is scheduled for 25th March.  The Government decision includes a requirement that the results of the review will be presented to the Government before any final decisions are made on future arrangements.</p></reply>

Cases of active TB have been identified and are being treated. They no longer pose an infectious risk to others. </p><p>  Surveillance and Control measures have been implemented in accordance with national guidelines. Contacts of the active cases both on Inis Oirr and the mainland have been screened. As there is a lot of social contact in a small island community, screening was offered to the entire resident population of the island. A large majority of people accepted this offer. People who have evidence of exposure to TB but no active infection are also being treated and monitored as appropriate.</p><p>  The incidence of TB in the west of Ireland has been lower than in other parts of the country for the last number of years.  The risk to people in Connemara should not be any higher than in the west generally.</p><p>  BCG in the West of Ireland has historically been offered to primary school leaving age children as the incidence of TB peaked in the teenage years in the west in the past. Childhood TB has not been a feature of the outbreak linked to Inis Oirr.</p><p>  WHO describes countries with an incidence of less than 10 cases per 100,000 population as a low incidence country.  The annual notification rate of TB has declined in Ireland since 2007 when the rate was 11.3 per 100,000 (480 cases).  In 2010 and 2011, the annual TB notification rates were 9.2 per 100,000 (420 cases in 2010 and 424 cases in 2011) which is the lowest rate recorded since surveillance of TB began in the 1950s and now categorise Ireland as a low incidence country.   TB cases notified in 2013 to date, correspond to a provisional crude incidence rate of 8.1 per 100,000 population.</p><p>  The BCG vaccination programme in Ireland is under review which will inform future policy.</p></reply>

These revised Regulations, which transposed Directive 2010/63/EU on the Protection of Animals Used for Scientific Purposes, came into operation on 1 January 2013 and considerably strengthened the protection of animals still needed for research and safety testing.  They also play a significant role in terms of minimising the number of animals used and require that alternatives to animal testing be utilised whenever possible.</p><p>  The 2002 Regulations transposed Directive 86/609/EEC into Irish law. Under these Regulations, it was a requirement that where an animal was killed, it was done by a humane method. In this context "humane method" is defined as "the killing of the animal with the minimum of physical and mental suffering, depending on the species".  From 2007 onwards account was taken of Commission Recommendation (2007/526/EU) on guidelines for the accommodation and care of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes.  This Recommendation set out requirements in relation to humane killing in respect of all species and, where appropriate, more specific requirements were outlined in relation to certain species.</p><p>  Individual statistical information in relation to the specific humane methods of killing for individual projects was not a requirement under Directive 86/609/EEC and was not, therefore, included in the consequential transposing Regulations.  My Department is not aware of any method of killing done as  part of a scientific experiment which was conducted without explicit authorisation.  If the Deputy is in possession of information that might indicate that this is the case, I would urge you to provide such information to the IMB, which is the Competent Authority in this area.</p><p>  The new legislation, now in force, sets out a comprehensive range of measures that must be complied with in relation to methods of killing.  It requires that where an animal (used or intended to be used in a procedure, or bred specifically so that their organs or tissues may be used for scientific purposes) is killed, the person responsible for the killing shall ensure that the method of killing with the minimum pain, suffering and distress is used, and the animal is killed by a competent person in the establishment of the breeder, supplier or user, as appropriate.  Additionally it requires that in the case of the killing of an animal covered by Annex IV to the Directive, the breeder, supplier or user, or other person responsible, shall ensure that the appropriate method of killing as set out in that Annex is used.</p><p>  The IMB believes that it would be unlikely that newborn puppies or kittens would have been euthanised by way of the methods outlined in the Deputy's question.  Any such euthanasia would more likely have been carried out by injection of a lethal dose of barbiturate (i.e. anaesthetic overdose).  The IMB policy in relation to the euthanasia of animals used for scientific purposes in establishments that have been authorised in accordance with EU Directive 2010/63/EU is that only those methods that are set out in the Directive should be used.  In accordance with Regulation 8(1) of SI No 543 of 2012, which came into effect on 1 January 2013, the method for euthanasia of animals that is used shall be the method where the minimum pain, suffering and distress is experienced.</p></reply>

As part of this work, cognisance was taken of the findings of the comparative review carried out by the Health Research Board (HRB) of independent hospital trusts in a number of countries and the factors identified as contributing most to successful trusts.  These considerations, and  the comprehensive consultation process undertaken with stakeholders, have informed the development of recommendations on the formation of specific groups and arrangements for the management and governance of all groups.  These recommendations have been considered and endorsed by a Strategic Board composed of representatives with national and international expertise in health service delivery, governance and linkages with academic institutions.</p><p>  The formation of hospital groups is fundamentally an organisational change that of itself will not trigger immediate changes in service provision.  It will provide a platform for much better strategically planned and more effective changes in service provision to ensure that patient care is improved and certainly not compromised or less adequate in relation to any area in the Country.  Lessons learnt from other jurisdictions as well as the learning gained from the operation of the hospital groups will be taken on board in creating the legislative framework for hospital trusts here.  The intention is, of course, that the trusts and the reformed health system within which hospital trusts will operate will be designed in a way that best suits Irish requirements and this will be done in a way that seeks to avoid difficulties encountered in other jurisdictions.</p></reply>

In 2002 the Forum on Fluoridation, which was established to review this policy, concluded that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.  The effects of fluoridation on health and related matters are kept under constant review.  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects . It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population.  The opinion of the Expert Body is supported by the World Health Organisation; the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Service and the Surgeon General of the United States; the World Dental Federation; the International Association for Dental Research; the Royal College of Physicians of England and by major international scientifically validated reviews in many countries.</p><p>  The Harvard study referred to by the Deputy was a review of studies mainly from China. These studies were assessed by the Expert Body in 2011 and were found to be of no relevance to Ireland given our regulated fluoridation levels.  The view is that the overall design of the studies is poor and they do not provide evidence of any effect on children's IQ from either high or low fluoride levels.  The EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) in its 2011 Report shared this view of the studies.  Some European countries choose salt fluoridation or milk fluoridation as an alternative to water fluoridation in their public health programmes while others use fluoride mouth-rinses and/or tooth-brushing or painting of teeth with fluorides. Additionally, all European countries promote the widespread use of fluoride toothpastes.  The USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Israel, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Argentina, Chile, and Columbia  actively fluoridate water supplies. Fluoridation coverage in the USA has increased by around 24 million people between 2002 and 2012.</p></reply>

The basis of the complaint, which was upheld by the DPC was that newborn screening cards should not be retained indefinitely without consent as this breached the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003.  As the Commissioner said ..."it is important to make clear that the position that developed was unlawful and could not be allowed to continue".</p><p>  Following meetings between the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner, officials from my Department, the HSE and the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street a number of changes to the National Newborn Screening Programme were agreed including obtaining written consent from the mother to have her new born child screened, retention of the newborn screening card for ten years and the retention of information on those cards for twenty five years.  It was also agreed to destroy existing cards that are older than ten years.  It must be remembered that there is no written consent from parents for the retention or use of these newborn screening cards taken between 1984 and 2002 for research or other purposes.</p><p>  Following representations from a number of people and organisations, who pointed out the potential value of the cards for research, I requested the HSE to conduct a review of the decision to destroy these cards.  The review examined both the legal and ethical basis for retention of newborn screening cards including the potential use of the cards for research purposes.  The Review Group supported the decision to destroy the cards and following careful consideration I accepted the Group's recommendation.  I must emphasise that this decision was taken to ensure that the HSE and the Children's University Hospital meet their ethical and legal obligations under the Data Protection Acts.  However, the Review Group also explored how the cards could be made available to the research community in a way which is compatible with legal and ethical obligations.</p><p>  In line with its recommendations, the HSE has been running an information campaign offering people the opportunity to have their screening card returned to them, prior to any cards being destroyed.  This campaign is due to end on 31 March 2013, after which any remaining unclaimed cards are scheduled to be destroyed.  This will ensure that anyone who wishes to donate newborn screening cards for research will be afforded the opportunity to do so.  I am seeking information from the HSE as to the effectiveness of their campaign to ensure people have been adequately informed about their rights.</p></reply>

Through the framework of the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016, the Department of Health is working in collaboration with the relevant statutory agencies to monitor the availability of controlled drugs, including prescription medicines, through illicit channels.</p><p>  The enforcement of the law relating to the sale of drugs, including prescription drugs, continues to be a priority in the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling the issue of drug misuse in this jurisdiction.</p><p>  The supply of prescription medicines is controlled in a number of ways. Medicines which have a high potential to be misused are controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts. The Misuse of Drugs Acts and Regulations  impose restrictions on the production, supply, importation and exportation of controlled drugs, such as morphine, methadone and amphetamines. A person who has in his possession a prescription medicine containing a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs legislation for the purpose of selling or supplying it, is guilty of an offence under that legislation. </p><p>   Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, it is prohibited for a person to supply a prescription medicine except in accordance with a prescription, and the supply must be made from a registered pharmacy by or under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist.  A person who contravenes these Regulations is guilty of an offence. </p><p>  As a result of consultations with key stakeholders, draft Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Regulations are currently being prepared to introduce additional controls on certain prescription drugs being traded illicitly, including benzodiazepine medicines.  These will be published on the Department&rsquo;s website shortly and comments will be invited to be made in the subsequent two-week period.   </p><p>  Following this, it will be necessary to seek Government approval to notify the proposed regulations to the EU Commission and other Member States under the Technical Standards Directives because of the implications of the proposed regulatory changes on trade in pharmaceutical products. </p><p>  Subject to successful completion of the EU notification period, which may take up to 3 months, it is anticipated that the new regulations will be introduced in mid-2013.</p></reply>

The then registered provider consented to this cancellation. The grounds for the cancellation related to the lack of fitness shown by the then registered provider in addressing significant fire safety concerns in the centre. The HSE took charge of the centre in accordance with section 64 of the Act and made alternative arrangements for the residents. The centre closed on 13 February 2012.</p><p>  As the centre is now closed, it cannot operate again as a nursing home unless a new application for registration is made to the Chief Inspector.

These proposals cover all of the areas mentioned in the report, including legislation on minimum unit pricing and the advertising of alcohol. My Department is also working closely with the Department of Justice and Equality, which is responsible for section 16 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008; this, among other things, deals with the issue of alcohol promotions.</p><p>  The Cabinet Committee on Social Policy has considered these proposals and I intend to bring forward specific proposals for consideration by Government as soon as possible.  In the meantime, work on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation is continuing.  For example, in conjunction with Northern Ireland, a health impact assessment is being commissioned as part of the process of developing a legislative basis for minimum unit pricing. (Scotland commissioned the same sort of assessment before it drafted its legislation on minimum unit pricing.)  The health impact assessment will study the impact of different minimum prices on a range of areas such as health, crime and likely economic impact.</p></reply>

There is provision for discretion by the HSE to grant a medical card in cases of "undue hardship" where income guidelines are exceeded and this provision will not be effected.  In the case of all reviews and renewals of medical cards, the HSE offer assistances to individuals in assessing their situation underincome limit thresholds, as some may be unsure about their gross income or have concerns or difficulties in relation to self-assessment. This will continue to be case after the legislation is enacted and will be further bolstered by staff in local health offices who provide information, support and assistance to individuals in relation to their eligibility on an ongoing basis. They can also provide information on the current status of a review, being in a position to track the application on the centralised Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) office in Finglas.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this particular matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In 2002 the Forum on Fluoridation, which was established to review this policy, concluded that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.  The effects of fluoridation on health and related matters are kept under constant review.  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects.  It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population.  The opinion of the Expert Body is supported by the World Health Organisation; the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Service and the Surgeon General of the United States; the World Dental Federation; the International Association for Dental Research; the Royal College of Physicians of England and by major international scientifically validated reviews in many countries.</p></reply>

My Department administers a National Lottery Discretionary Fund from which small once-off grants are paid to community and voluntary organisations, providing a range of health related services.  If an organisation wishes to make an application for National Lottery Funding they should send in a formal application.  Detailed procedures, along with the application form are set out on the Department's website, <i>www.doh.ie</i>.  The HSE receives an annual capital allocation for the building, equipping and furnishing of health facilities.  There are always more construction projects than can be funded from the Exchequer's capital health care allocation.  The HSE is required to prioritise infrastructure projects within its overall capital envelope taking into account the existing capital commitments and costs of completion over the period.  The method and timescale for the delivery of health care infrastructure is dependent on a number of factors; it is a dynamic process constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances, including the feasibility of implementation.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that in 2010 the Department of Health published Palliative Care for Children with Life-limiting Conditions in Ireland &#8211; a National Policy (DoH 2010) which provides the foundation and sets out clear direction for the development of an integrated palliative care service for children and their families, across all care settings.  Following on from the publication of the policy, the National Development Committee for Children's Palliative Care (NDC) was established by the HSE.  The NDC is co-chaired by the HSE and the Irish Hospice Foundation.  It includes a representative from my Department.  The Committee has overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the national policy recommendations.  The committee&#8217;s emphasis on partnership is reflected in its membership comprising statutory, voluntary, professional, and parent involvement.</p><p>  On 4 March 2013, the Irish Hospice Foundation and LauraLynn, Ireland&#8217;s Children's Hospice, in partnership with the HSE published a report titled &quot;Respite Services for Children with Life-limiting Conditions and their Families in Ireland &#8211; A Needs Assessment&quot;.  The report provides a national overview of service provision and future respite requirements as part of a palliative care service for children in Ireland.  The report identifies some of the challenges involved in planning for respite care such as difficulties with definitions and terminology; determining the numbers of children who require respite care and the numbers currently availing of services; the extent and location of current service provision; the perhaps at times unnecessary distinction between disability services and palliative care.  The report provides an indication of what is currently available and what is required at a national level to provide for the respite needs of children and families.  The report acknowledges that a significant level of respite support is already being provided but access is inconsistent around the country and can be dependent on diagnosis and/or geographic location.  The report will assist the Department of Health and the National Development Committee for Children&#8217;s Palliative Care in planning for the respite needs of children with life-limiting conditions, and is a useful contribution to filling in the gaps in the understanding and knowledge of the way respite services for children are organised.  A number of the recommendations in the report are already under consideration by the National Development Committee and the Committee has undertaken to examine all of the recommendations through its on-going programme of work.</p></reply>

No. 870 of 2004 which prohibits the marketing of cosmetic products and ingredients that have been tested in animals has been in force for four years, since 11 March 2009, except for a derogation relating to three toxicity checks.  On 11 March 2013, this derogation ends, and no further testing on animals of cosmetics or ingredients can take place.  It has been the policy of the Department of Health not to licence the use of live animals for testing of cosmetics in Ireland and this is confirmed by the statistical information provided by the Department to the European Commission under Article 13 of Directive 86/609/EEC, as amended.  Furthermore, there have been no incidences of breaches of this ban detected in ongoing European cosmetic surveillance programmes brought to the attention of the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) or my Department to date.  The relevant Regulations require the manufacturer of the product, the manufacturer's agent, the person to whose order the cosmetic product is manufactured for, or the person who first supplies the cosmetic product in the European Union, to ensure that cosmetics imported, distributed or retailed in Ireland or the EU comply with the legislation.  Enforcement of the legislation is provided for in Regulation 12 of S.I. No. 870 of 2004 and the IMB is the Competent Authority responsible for ensuring that the legislation is complied with.  On 11 March 2013 the EU Commission published a Communication on the animal testing ban.  This Communication concluded that the marketing ban should enter into force, be coherently implemented throughout the EU and that the research and development of alternative testing methods for toxicity of cosmetics should be prioritised as part of the EU's trade and international cooperation agenda.</p></reply>

My Department is in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places with the aim, in so far as is possible, of providing a sufficient number of intern places for Irish/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  The recruitment process for interns is a national process governed by the Health Service Executive, National Recruitment Service. All medical students from the six medical schools in Ireland are entitled to apply for an intern post.  In managing the recruitment process the HSE is bound by European Community Preference rules whereby preference must be given to EU nationals over non-EU nationals.  It should also be noted that under EU law intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying.  The medical schools make it clear in their enrolment documentation for non-EU medical students that there is no guarantee of an intern post in Ireland upon completion of the basic medical degree.  The priority of the HSE and my Department is to ensure that, at a minimum, all EU graduates from Irish schools have the ability to undertake an internship once they meet the qualifications for same.  This is with a view to securing the State's investment in their medical education and to enable them achieve the status of a fully registered medical practitioner.  To date there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools and a number of available posts for some non-EU applicants.  The HSE remain confident that all EU graduates from the six medical schools in Ireland who have applied for an intern post and who meet the eligibility and qualifications for same will be allocated a post within the public health service as of July 2013.</p></reply>

The aim of this legislation is to ensure that the market is regulated appropriately. </p><p>The regulatory system is based on the key principles of community rating, open enrolment, lifetime cover<b></b>and minimum benefit<b></b>  and aims to ensure that private health insurance does not cost more for those who need it most. Under community rating, everybody is charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan, irrespective of age, gender and the current or likely future state of their health. </p><p>  As Minister, I have no legal power to intervene in relation to health insurance prices set by the health insurance providers. The insurance companies, operating as commercial providers with a view towards profit generation, make commercial decisions about their prices. I am not aware of any product which has increased in net premium terms by the magnitude referred to by the Deputy, but it is clear that any significant price increases will make it more difficult for customers to renew their policies. I have consistently raised the issue of costs with health insurers and am determined to address costs in the sector in the interests of consumers. I will continue to focus strongly on this issue, as part of measures to ensure the sustainability of the private health insurance market in the transition to a Universal Health Insurance system. </p><p>  In the meantime, many consumers can make large savings on their health insurance premiums by shopping around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs.  For those who have been insured on the same plan for a number of years, it is important to review the level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured. Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs.  The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits.  The HIA's website www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.</p></reply>

The key objectives of the programme, as with all the HSE's National Clinical Care Programmes, are based on the key metrics of quality, financial value, access and compliance. They include the development and implementation of national clinical guidelines, with the aim of ensuring consistency in clinical practice nationally.  To date the Programme has published 20 guidelines, four are in process and a further 20 have been commissioned including clinical guidelines on ultrasound. These guidelines, when developed, will address the way in which such services should be provided. </p></reply>

The Group, which included two members of the public (Service User Panel Representatives) was established and independently chaired by a Specialist in Public Health Medicine and work commenced in October, 2011. The Group also included a Consultant General Physician in Medicine and a Monaghan General Practitioner.  The Group committed to establish if there was a clinical need for a Medical Assessment Unit in Monaghan Hospital as well as to establish the projected cost of running this Unit.  The Report was submitted to the Minister and was referred to the Acute Medicine Programme for review. The report concluded that there was no clinical need for a medical assessment unit in Monaghan Hospital and that patient safety must remain our priority at all times when deciding where services are provided.  The extension of current non-urgent medical assessment services at Monaghan General Hospital has been considered, but the additional resourcing required is not feasible within the current budgetary allocation. </p></reply>

One of the consultants' recommendations was that the option of a 2 centre model for rescue coordination centres should be pursued.  After careful consideration of the various options available, their practicality and cost, it was concluded that the three centres should remain but that changes to the operation arrangements within and between the centres would be necessarily required.  Therefore it was decided that through the utilisation of the most modern communications and IT infrastructure across a single national Coast Guard network, the 3 centres will be more closely aligned and integrated.  My Department is currently finalising an action plan to address the deficiencies in the maritime safety and emergency response services identified in the Value for Money reviews. Increased efficiencies in the operation, watch arrangements and management of the Centres will be a significant part the proposed changes</p></reply>

The Road Safety Authority (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Act 2012 provides for the RSA to become the central driver licensing authority in Ireland.  This came into effect on 12 January 2013. </p><p>  The new system involves three outsourced elements, a card production facility, a front office for engaging with the customer, and a back office to process applications.  All three are overseen by a &lsquo;centre of excellence&rsquo; based in the RSA itself.   The card licence is standardised across the European Union and therefore there must be consistency in the quality and standard of information used.  The photograph will be digital and will not be stuck on to the card in the way it was on the old paper licence.  The capture of the photograph is included in the fee for the licence. As the system develops, the SAFE2 ID standard will be implemented, at which point the only option will be the digital photo taken at the Front Office Network.</p><p>  The operation of the tender processes for the outsourced elements was a matter for the RSA, I had no power to intervene in it, and the contractors have already been procured.</p></reply>

This is a once-off notification in the case of SPSV drivers who own their own vehicle.  Any changes such as with respect to rental agreements or change of vehicle will also need to be notified. </p><p>  I understand that the NTA has made available free IT tools to facilitate the notification process - the &quot;Taxi Industry Portal&quot; smartphone application can be downloaded onto both Apple and Android smartphones.  In addition, SPSV operators can use any PC or laptop to access the Taxi Portal over the Internet.
