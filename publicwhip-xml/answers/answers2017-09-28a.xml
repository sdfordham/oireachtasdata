I have welcomed the publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare report and in particular I have been encouraged by the level of cross party and stakeholder support that it has attracted. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to making tangible and sustainable improvements in our health services and the Sl&aacute;intecare report now provides a framework to do this.  We have a level of consensus and support for the vision and strategic direction outlined in the report that is unprecedented. I am determined to harness this and to work with colleagues across the political spectrum and with all stakeholders to move forward now on this very important agenda. </p>  <p>  The Government has already given its approval to move ahead with the establishment of a Sl&aacute;intecare programme office.  This office will be tasked with implementing a programme of reform, as agreed by Government, arising from the Sl&aacute;intecare Report. In parallel, work is underway in my Department to develop a detailed response to the report for consideration by Government in December. </p>  <p>  We all know that there will be significant challenges to overcome in what will need to be a deep and systemic change in our healthcare system.  But we don&rsquo;t have a choice.  And we need to begin this change process now.  This is one of the key priorities for the Government, and the focus now must be on ensuring that the implementation phase is properly designed and that a clear implementation plan is developed as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

These offers will be subject to the usual recruitment requirements.  Nursing and midwifery recruitment and retention is a priority for the Government and officials in my Department are liaising with the HSE on a weekly basis to review progress on the appointment of nursing graduates. </p>  <p>  These contracts are being offered as part of the 2017 Nursing and Midwifery Agreement, reached with the INMO and SIPTU.  This Agreement has a particular focus on addressing recruitment and retention of nursing and midwifery posts.  It has committed to put in place an additional 1,224 nursing and midwifery posts across the public health service by the end of December 2017.  Very extensive and detailed work has been sustained throughout 2017 to implement the Agreement.</p>  <p>  The HSE is focused on offering graduating nurses and midwives permanent posts. Each Hospital or Community Healthcare Organisation is making offers to the 2016 and 2017 nursing and midwifery graduates who undertake their clinical placement in their location. Every effort is being made to accommodate the graduate nurses and midwives in their preferred locations.  Where a Hospital or CHO area is unable to offer places to all graduates, then the remaining graduates are offered places in the respective Hospital Group or an alternative CHO location, as appropriate.  </p></reply>

At that time also documentation had been finalised for &euro;197m of the &euro;424m and this had been allocated to the 26 organisations, leaving a balance of &euro;227m  to be paid.  Since then Service Agreements have been finalised for 3 further organisations and the outstanding amount to be paid to the 23 organisations is &euro;217m .    </p>  <p>  In this regard, it should be noted that fully signed Service Agreements are now in place for approximately &euro;3.357bn of the &euro;3.574bn total, which represents approximately 94% of this funding.</p>  <p>  In some cases the documentation is not finalised because the HSE is bringing a level of scrutiny to the process so as to ensure that the quality and quantity of the services to be provided for service users are to HSE&rsquo;s satisfaction.  There are also ongoing discussions regarding proposed cost increases and agreeing terms with some service providers . These discussions are conducted in the context of the need to maintain the necessary service provision. In other cases, the process for signing Service Agreements  may not be completed because discussions are ongoing between the Providers and the HSE in relation to, for example, the amount of funding provided by the HSE in the context of restoration of pay reductions imposed on foot of the economic crisis.  </p>  <p>  The HSE is working with the Service Providers to ensure that the Service Agreement process is completed.  Service Agreements  are only one element of the oversight process.  In addition to the Service Agreements, ongoing oversight of the services received for funding allocated, is delivered through the day to day management of that funding by the Hospital Groups and the Community Healthcare Organisations and through other mechanisms such as the Annual Compliance Statement process that is in place for all Section 38 and the larger Section 39 Service Providers.  </p></reply>

This review is due to be concluded by the end of 2017 and the findings will feed into decisions regarding future capital expenditure.  </p>  <p>  My Department is pursuing a range of initiatives to address health service staffing, including the development of a national strategic framework for health workforce planning.  The recruitment and retention of medical staff is also a priority for the HSE and the number of consultants employed in the public health service continues to increase.  At the end of July 2017 there were 2,892 whole time equivalents, an increase of 105 on the corresponding month in 2016 and 700 in the past decade. There has been an increase of 722 whole time equivalent nurses and midwives in the last year.</p>  <p>  The 2017 total Health Budget of &euro;14.6 billion was the highest ever health budget and is enabling both progress towards addressing the challenge of increased demand from a growing and aging population, and the commencement of some significant new developments which will over time deliver real improvements for patients.  The increased funding and growth in staffing within our health service are allowing for expansion in service levels and optimum utilisation of facilities.</p></reply>

The Saolta Group is making every effort to progress this process and it is estimated that the process will be completed by the close of 2017. </p>  <p>  In addition, Saolta has implemented a number of local initiatives to reduce diagnostic waiting lists and ensure that the maximum number of patients receive their procedure.  The Group has introduced a 7-day a week service and an extended working day.  This has resulted in an additional 52 appointments per week, which are targeted at the longest waiters. The Hospital is also outsourcing diagnostic scans to the Merlin Park Imaging Centre, where appropriate. </p>  <p>  More broadly, there have been a number of recent and ongoing capacity initiatives at Galway University Hospitals including the completion of the new 75-bed ward block and a new acute mental health department is expected to be operational by the end of 2017.  Also, considerable progress has been made on the planning phase for a new ED at UHG. </p>  <p>  UHG is also a pilot site for the National GE Finnamore Patient Flow project and has demonstrated significant achievement in improving patient flow in the Hospital. </p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy of the continued commitment to develop the diabetes service at the Hospital. </p>  <p>  Adult diabetes services at Letterkenny  are currently provided by a consultant endocrinologist, supported by a locum consultant general physician with an interest in diabetes. In order to address waiting lists, additional clinics are provided on a monthly basis.  Further, the Saolta Healthcare Group has advised that it has made an application for approval of a second consultant endocrinologist and this is currently being considered by the HSE's Consultant Application Advisory Committee. </p>  <p>  On 28 June, I met with the Donegal Branch of Diabetes Ireland, the HSE and the Saolta Healthcare Group to discuss the current challenges and future development of diabetes services in the Northwest.  Following that meeting, officials of my Department requested the HSE to assess the scope to progress a number of action points in relation to the provision of services for paediatric and adult diabetes in County Donegal, including the progression of two Advanced Nurse Practitioners posts for Letterkenny University Hospital.  I appreciate that some actions will be dependent on funding and will need to be considered once the Budget and National Service Plan for 2018 are finalised.</p></reply>

Within this context, &euro;8 million in additional funding was provided in 2016 to expand the provision of speech and language therapy through primary care services (&euro;4 million) and to support the reorganisation and expansion of speech and language and other therapies, including occupational therapy, under the Progressing Disability Services Programme (&euro;4 million).  The key objective of the Progressing Disability Services Programme is to bring about equity of access to disabilities services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of the individual child's difficulties.  Full implementation of this Programme is expected before the end of 2017. It is anticipated that this will have a positive impact on waiting lists both for assessments and therapies.</p>  <p>  With regard to County Wicklow specifically, I am advised by the HSE that an Occupational Therapy Improvement Plan has been put in place in CHO Area 6 to improve access to Primary Care Occupational Therapy Services.  The recruitment of additional temporary staff to address long waiting times in Primary Care has been prioritised in this regard.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-09-28a.31.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800060#WRA03000"><p>The Alzheimer Society of Ireland&rsquo;s pre-budget submission recommends the appointment of dementia care coordinators and dementia advisers in each local health office area, in addition to an investment of &euro;35 million in home care services and the appointment of dementia friendly community coordinators.  I had a constructive meeting with representatives of the Alzheimer Society on 29 August where these matters were discussed. </p>  <p>  In response to the rising number of people with dementia, currently estimated at 55,000, the Irish National Dementia Strategy was launched in December 2014 with the objective of increasing awareness, ensuring early diagnosis and intervention and developing enhanced community based services.  The Strategy emphasises that most people with dementia live in their own communities and can continue to live well and to participate in those communities for far longer than many people appreciate.</p>  <p>  In parallel with the Strategy, the Department of Health and the HSE agreed a joint initiative with the Atlantic Philanthropies to implement significant elements of the Strategy over the period 2014-2017.  This Implementation Programme represents a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with the Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m and the HSE &euro;15.5m.  The Programme includes the provision of intensive home care packages for people with dementia, the upskilling of GPs and primary care teams in dementia diagnosis and management, and a public awareness and inclusion campaign.  A National Dementia Office has been established to drive implementation of the Strategy in the HSE. </p>  <p>  I am happy to be able to confirm that my Department has recently secured funding of &euro;1.23 million under the 2017 Dormant Accounts Action Plan to support a number of dementia projects.

There are a number of potential models and approaches and the NDO is currently identifying these with a view to determining a suitable approach to this action under the Strategy.</p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are working on a mid-term review of the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy which will identify the achievements so far and set out the further work that is required to implement the Strategy over the next 12 months and beyond.  The resources required for the ongoing implementation of the Strategy, including in relation to the role of key worker, can only be considered in the context of the Estimates and Budget process.  The mid-term review will assist in identifying further actions required and will be helpful in the context of budgetary considerations.</p></reply>

Many people go to their family doctor with mental health problems such as depression or anxiety and will not need the help of a psychiatrist. In other cases, the GP may decide to refer the person to members of the mental health team such as a psychiatrist, clinical psychologist or addiction counsellor. When assessing an individual's mental health, questionnaires like the PHQ-p and GAD7 may be used. </p>  <p>  The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a validated self-administered version of the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders screening questionnaire. It contains the mood (PHQ-9), anxiety, alcohol, eating and somatoform modules as covered in the original PRIME-MD.  The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale was subsequently developed as a brief scale for anxiety. It is also validated. </p>  <p>  There are many such screening tools available, and screening for mental health problems forms the basis of good clinical practice across mental health services. These screening tools are not particularly highlighted for use in mental health services (over and above other validated screening tools) by the HSE, but are likely to be used by clinicians as part of their clinical practice. </p></reply>

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE has extensive information concerning Lyme disease on its website <i>www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/lymedisease/. </i></p><p>Lyme borreliosis can be asymptomatic or have a range of clinical presentations.  Current best advice is that diagnosis should be made only after careful examination of the patient's clinical history, physical findings, laboratory evidence and exposure risk evaluation.  Exposure to ticks prior to disease manifestations is necessary for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.  Since an awareness or recollection of a tick-bite is not always present, however, this should not exclude the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.  Later stages require the use of antibody detection tests (or advanced DNA detection techniques).  Testing for Lyme Disease is provided routinely by all major, regional hospitals in Ireland.  In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient.  If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory Service of Public Health England in Porton Down facility which uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities.  This involves a screening serological test followed by a confirmatory serological test.  </p><p>Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, then management of patients can be undertaken by Infectious Disease consultants in our regional hospitals when intravenous antibiotics may be considered as a method of treatment.</p><p>There is no controlled evidence that viable <i>Borrelia burgdorferi </i>persists in patients with prolonged, subjective symptoms following confirmed Lyme disease.  Fatigue, pain and cognitive impairment are the primary complaints among patients who claim to be suffering long term effects.  However, these symptoms are very common in the general population, and the evidence does not show that they occur any more commonly in patients with a history of Lyme disease.  The diverse nature of these symptoms, which can have both physical and psychological causes, are shared by many conditions which has implications for both diagnostic and treatment services.  Misinformation concerning the long term effects of Lyme disease is causing real harm to people who seek inappropriate treatments for real conditions who are advised to seek information and advice from their family doctor.</p></reply>

Such assistance may range from contributing to the expenses incurred by that person or body to allowing them the use of an HSE premises.  Financial assistance is provided in the form of a grant and the value of such grants can vary from very high to very low value.</p>  <p>  Where the HSE provides a grant to a voluntary provider under Section 39, the HSE puts in place a Service Level Agreement with the provider.

The HSE has no role in determining the salaries or other terms and conditions applying to these staff.  It is an accepted fact that the staff of these Section 39 organisations are not public servants.  This means that they were not subject to the FEMPI legislation which imposed pay reductions or the provisions of the subsequent Public Service Agreements which provide for pay restoration.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for Section 39 organisations to negotiate salaries with their staff as part of their employment relationship and within the overall funding available for the delivery of agreed services.</p></reply>

The Inpatient/Daycase Action Plan is being delivered through a combination of normal hospital activity, as well as insourcing and outsourcing initiatives utilising NTPF funding.  Under the Inpatient/Daycase Plan, since early February, over 23,800 patients have come off the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List.</p>  <p>  The NTPF has  advised that to date 5,901 patients have been authorised for treatment in private hospitals under its Initiatives, 2,235 patients have accepted an offer of treatment in a private hospital and that 1,112 patients have received their procedure.  The NTPF has also indicated that 2,841 patients have been authorised for treatment in public hospitals under the Plan&rsquo;s insourcing initiatives, 910 offers of treatment have been accepted and 285 patients have been treated. </p></reply>

The construction contract for the building of the main children&rsquo;s hospital and the satellite centres contract were signed in August.  Confirmed dates for completion of the development of the new children's hospital and the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centres have now been agreed with the preferred contractor.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital will be completed by the middle of 2022.  The Paediatric Outpatients and Urgent Care Centre at Connolly will open in 2019 followed by the second one at Tallaght in 2020 in advance of the opening of the main hospital in 2022.  Site preparatory work has continued throughout the year and the construction phase of the project has now commenced.</p>  <p>  The Paediatric Outpatient and Urgent Care Satellite Centres at Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals will improve geographic access to urgent care for children in the Greater Dublin Area.  The two centres will support primary and community care through the provision of general community and paediatric clinics, including developmental paediatrics, multidisciplinary care for children with chronic stable conditions and other outpatient services.  The centres will help to reduce Emergency Department and outpatient attendance at the new children&rsquo;s hospital on a campus shared with St James&rsquo;s.  </p>  <p>  Each Paediatric OPD and Urgent Care Centre will provide consultant-led urgent care, with 4-6 hour observation beds, appropriate diagnostics and secondary outpatient services including rapid access general paediatric clinics as well as child sexual abuse unit examination, observation and therapy rooms.  Each centre is projected to deal with 25,000 urgent care and 15,000 outpatient attendances every year. </p>  <p>  The centres will be open during the known busiest daytime and evening hours and closed during the night when departments are at their quietest.  It is anticipated that the Paediatric OPD and Urgent Care Centres at Tallaght and Connolly will open from 08.00 to 24.00, diagnostic services from 08.00 to 20.00 and outpatient services from 08.00 to 18.00.  </p></reply>

On foot of the HPRA&rsquo;s conclusions I announced that I would establish a cannabis for medical use access programme, for patients under the care of a consultant, for the following medical conditions:</p>  <p>  - spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis resistant to all standard therapies;</p>  <p>  - intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, despite the use of standard anti-emetic regimes;</p>  <p>  - severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy. </p>  <p>  An expert group, chaired by Dr Mair&iacute;n Ryan from HIQA was established in March to develop the operational, clinical and practice guidelines for this access programme. </p>  <p>  The Expert Group conducted a targeted consultation on the draft guidelines and is due to finalise these guidelines shortly.  Officials in my Department are working on secondary legislation to underpin the programme and on the logistics of sourcing suitable cannabis-based product supplies for the Irish market place.</p>  <p>  Under the Cannabis Access Programme it will be the decision of a clinician, in consultation with their patient and the patient&rsquo;s carers, as to the appropriate course of treatment for that patient.  The Cannabis Access Programme is intended for patients who are resident in Ireland and who are under the care of an Irish-based consultant.  However, where patients move from the care of a clinician in one jurisdiction, e.g. abroad, to that of another clinician in another jurisdiction, e.g. in Ireland, clinical treatment plans for such patients should be determined and directed between clinicians through normal healthcare professional communication pathways, regardless of where those clinicians are located.  The sharing of such clinical information could help to ensure the treating consultant in Ireland has access to relevant professionally documented clinical and medication history for the patient they are treating and could assist in that consultant&rsquo;s clinical decision making process.</p>  <p>  Any consultant requiring information or clarification in relation to the Cannabis Access Programme, he or she should contact my Department directly.</p></reply>

However, all efforts are made by hospitals to limit cancellations particularly for clinically urgent procedures.</p>  <p>  Cancellation of elective procedures can occur for a variety of exceptional reasons including cancellations because a bed or the clinical team are not available, cancellations by the patient or because the patient may not be fit for surgery at the time.</p>  <p>  Based on data provided by the NTPF, collated from reports by hospitals, approximately 3,400 elective procedures, on average, are cancelled per month.

Securing affordable access to existing and new medicines in a timely manner is a key objective of the Irish Health Service.  However, the challenge is delivering on this objective in an affordable and sustainable way in line with the resources allocated by the D&aacute;il and the relevant legislative provisions.  Expenditure on medicines represents one of the largest areas of expenditure across the health service and will continue to grow in the years ahead as our health service continues to meet the needs of our citizens.</p>  <p>Under the community pharmacy schemes over 70 million prescription items will be dispensed in 2017 at an estimated cost of approximately &euro;1.7 billion - taking account of fees and ingredient cost.  In addition, the HSE will spend in excess of &euro;0.5 billion on medicines in our hospitals, nursing homes and other settings.  Expenditure on the high tech scheme, the scheme through which the majority of new medicines are funded, has increased by over 80% since 2012, and will continue to increase significantly in 2018 as demand for existing treatments grows and new drugs are approved by the HSE.  Since 1 August 2016, the HSE advise that 36 new treatments have been made available to Irish patients.</p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are engaging in a number of initiatives which have lead and will continue to lead to better access to medicines for patients, value for the taxpayer and the cost- effective provision of medicines in Ireland.  Key initiatives include reference and generic substitution, under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the four year Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines with IPHA, the Medicines Management Programme and National Drugs Management Programme within the HSE, and the development of a National Biosimilar Medicines Policy.  Ireland is also participating in a number of voluntary EU forums to explore possible areas for collaboration including price negotiations and joint procurement.</p>  <p>  However, access to medicines is not solely a funding issue.  A significant barrier to accessing new medicines is the price being sought by some manufacturers for their products.  The solution to increased access is multi-facetted and is not simply a matter of allocating more funding for medicines at the expense of other health or public services.  The health service must continue to seek better value and lower costs for both existing and new treatments.</p>  <p>  The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  This Act gives full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decision on the reimbursement of medicines, taking account of expert opinion as appropriate.  There is also an increased level of engagement and commercial negotiations between the HSE and manufacturers in an effort to reduce the price to affordable levels.  So while this process is resource intensive, it is clear that as a result of such a robust and scientific process, Ireland is paying significantly less for medicines and the ability to invest is enhanced.</p></reply>

This occurs where the medical team in the referring maternity unit consider that an anomaly scan is clinically indicated. </p>  <p>  The National Maternity Strategy is very clear that all women must have equal access to standardised ultrasound services.  The Strategy will be implemented on a phased basis and this work will be led by the HSE National Women and Infants Health Programme. Indeed, the issue of anomaly scanning is a priority issue for the Programme and, accordingly, it will develop clinical guidance regarding routine detailed scans at 20 weeks.  In the meantime, the Programme will continue to work with the six Hospital Groups to assist in increasing access to anomaly scans for those units with limited availability. </p>  <p>  One of the current challenges to increase access to anomaly scans is the recruitment of ultrasonographers.

As set out in its <i>Statement of Strategy 2016-2019,</i>my Department has committed to developing a national strategic framework for health workforce planning, in collaboration with Government Departments and agencies.  During 2016, my Department convened a Cross-sectoral Steering Group to develop a national strategic framework for health workforce planning.  A consultation draft of the framework was completed in mid-2017 and was subject to a stakeholder consultation process over the summer.  Submissions received as part of this consultation process have been considered by the Steering Group and the draft Framework  has been updated accordingly.  I expect to receive the final version of the Framework shortly, accompanied by a high-level implementation plan. </p><p>It is Government policy to move to a consultant delivered service.  While there are difficulties in filling posts in certain specialties and locations,  the number of consultants employed in the public health system continues to increase year on year.  At the end of July 2017 there were 2,892 whole time equivalents, an increase of 105 compared with the end July 2016 number and an increase of over 700 in the past decade.  The HSE has been focused on addressing issues associated with the creation and approval of consultant posts and successful recruitment.  It is now giving effect to the report 'Towards Successful Consultant Recruitment, Appointment and Retention', completed in December 2016.  The number of NCHDs has also increased significantly given service demands and the need to progress compliance with the provisions of the European Working Time Directive. Similar to consultants, recruitment to certain specialties, e.g. surgery and paediatrics, is challenging.  At the end of July 2017 there were 5,962 whole time equivalent NCHDs, an increase of 178 compared with the end of July 2016 number and an increase of over 1,100 in the past decade. </p><p>Recruitment of nurses and midwives is a key priority this year.  The HSE has been focused on increasing nursing numbers over the past two years as the budgetary position has improved.  The number of nursing and midwifery staff stood at 36,278 in August 2017; this is an increase of 739 whole time equivalents in the past 12 months, notwithstanding intense global competition for our nurses and midwives.  The HSE has developed a fully funded workforce plan for an additional 1,224 nursing/midwifery posts in 2017 as provided for in the agreement reached with the nursing unions last February on recruitment and retention.  These posts are being filled through a broad range of initiatives including the conversion of agency employed staff into HSE direct employees, national recruitment campaigns and offering all graduating nurses and midwives full time contracts.  Key measures to retain nursing and midwifery staff include the creation of new development specialist posts, a unified approach to recruitment across hospitals and offering nurses and midwives improved educational opportunities and career pathways. </p><p>The Report of the Public Service Pay Commission identified problems in recruitment and retention in specific and specialist groups that are internationally in demand particularly in the health sector Following the ratification of the Public Service Stability Agreement, the Commission will now carry out a more comprehensive examination of underlying difficulties in recruitment and retention in those sectors and employment streams where difficulties are clearly evident.  The Commission is committed to reporting on medical and nursing grades in 2018. The outcome of its assessment will be subject to discussions between the relevant parties.</p></reply>

One of these goals is to empower carers to participate as fully as possible in economic and social life and an objective under this goal is to enable carers to have access to respite breaks.  The Department of Health collates an annual report on the progress made by all Government Departments and their Agencies in implementing the Strategy, which is to be implemented on a cost neutral basis. The fourth progress report, for the period September 2015 to December 2016, was published earlier this year.</p>  <p>  In relation to respite, the report notes that &ldquo;Respite service needs are addressed on an individualised case by case basis and can include planned and emergency respite care options in the home, community and residential settings including services provided by non-statutory organisations.  The respite service is not a demand led scheme and the HSE must deliver services within budget.&rdquo;  The HSE has established a respite review group to establish the levels of respite services provided and to consider future performance indicators for the services.</p>  <p>  The National Carers Strategy Monitoring Group, established by Family Carers Ireland publishes an annual scorecard on the impact that implementation of the 42 actions in the Strategy is having on family carers&rsquo; lives.  Its most recently published Scorecard and, in relation to respite, it continues to report the situation as regressive.  The report points out that the 2016 HSE Annual Report confirms a reduction of over 4,000 respite overnights delivered. </p>  <p>  In the context of disability services, there are a number of factors impacting on capacity.  A significant number of respite beds have to be utilised where admission is unplanned leading to the number of available respite nights being down against planned activity.  In addition, within the regulatory and policy context, the manner in which residential and respite services is provided has also changed, as Agencies comply with regulatory standards.  Capacity has generally decreased with requirements for personal and appropriate space. In some situations beds are no longer available.  For instance, they may be vacated by residents who go home at weekends or for holidays and can no longer be used for respite.  Implementation of the national policy on congregated settings is also affecting available capacity.  </p>  <p>  In the HSE's Social Care Operational Plan for 2017, 6,320 people with a Disability are expected to avail of centre based respite services totalling 182,506 overnights.  Based on existing levels of service and in addition to the centre-based respite service, it&rsquo;s planned that between 2,000 and 2,500 persons will avail of respite services such as holiday respite or occasional respite with a host family.  It is also planned that based on existing levels of service, a further 41,100 day only respite sessions will be accessed by people with a disability.</p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE has been funded to provide 185 new emergency residential placements and new home support and in-home respite for 210 additional people who require emergency supports has been allocated.  This marks a significant change in the way that respite services are delivered.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to work with agencies to explore various ways of responding to this need in line with the budget available.  As the Deputy's question concerning services in Co Wexford are a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to him.</p></reply>

Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  These recommendations include examining the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  The programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms.  It is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation  and changes to the NHSS will require legislative implementation.</p>  <p>  On this basis, I have requested legal advice from the office of the Attorney General regarding potential changes to the legislation that will address this matter.  I have met with representatives from the I.F.A. yesterday evening to discuss various strategies that may assist with addressing their members concerns and have apprised them of the current progress.  We agreed to meet again in the near future for further discussions.  I am committed to this review of the position with regard to family farms and small businesses for the purposes of the financial assessment of the scheme.</p></reply>

The review is examining key elements of primary and community care capacity in addition to hospital capacity. As part of the review process, the Department has commissioned independent external consultants to provide technical, analytical and engagement expertise.  A Steering Group is overseeing the project and an independent international peer review group is involved in ongoing review and validation of the methodology and approach.  My Department has also undertaken a public consultation process to ensure that stakeholder views feed into the process and work is now underway in relation to analysing the submissions received.</p>  <p>  The findings from the review will provide a basis for determining both the extent of capacity requirements over the next 15 years and the type of capacity that is needed at a national and regional level. It is expected that the review will be advanced sufficiently to inform the mid-term review of the capital programme and the development of a new 10 year capital plan later this year . A final report will be published before the end of the year. An interim report is not expected. </p></reply>

Reducing waiting times for the longest waiting patients is one of this Government's key priorities. Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  </p><p>In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, I asked the HSE to develop Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient/Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services.  The Inpatient/Daycase Action Plan is being delivered through a combination of normal hospital activity, as well as insourcing and outsourcing initiatives utilising NTPF funding.  Under the Inpatient/Daycase Plan, since early February, over 23,800 patients have come off the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List, including at Cork University Maternity Hospital.  </p><p>The NTPF has advised that to date 5,901 patients have been authorised for treatment in private hospitals under its Initiatives, 2,235 patients have accepted an offer of treatment in a private hospital and that 1,112 patients have received their procedure.  The NTPF has also indicated that 2,841 patients have been authorised for treatment in public hospitals under the Plan&rsquo;s insourcing initiatives, 910 offers of treatment have been accepted and 285 patients have been treated.  Under the Outpatient Plan, since early February, more than 84,200 patients have come off the Outpatient Waiting List  <font color="#FF0000">.</font></p><p>In relation to Cork University Maternity Hospital specifically, the South/South West Hospital Group (SSWHG) has developed a phased approach to improve waiting times for gynaecology services there.  This includes the establishment of the SSWHG Women and Children Services Directorate earlier this year, which, I expect, will ensure better coordination and utilisation of maternity gynaecological resources across the group.</p></reply>

If it is, the FSO writes to the financial services provider and requests confirmation of the status of the mortgage loan account by reference to the Examination.  Where it is confirmed by the financial services provider that a mortgage loan account is considered to be within the scope of the Examination, the FSO is of the view that the best way of ensuring that he has all of the necessary information to deal with such complaints is to await the outcome of the Examination.  For this reason, the FSO considers it necessary to place these complaints on hold pending confirmation of the impact, if any, of the Examination on those mortgage loan accounts.  </p>  <p>  The FSO does not have any oversight function with respect to the manner in which the financial services providers are conducting their Tracker Mortgage Examinations.  The Central Bank of Ireland has laid down the Framework for the Tracker Mortgage Examination and the phases for a Bank to complete including Central Bank assurances that must be completed as part of that process.</p>  <p>  I understand from the Central Bank that it invoked its powers under Section 22 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act to set specific timelines for lenders to complete Phase 2 (the &ldquo;Review Phase&rdquo;) of the Examination and in line with those timelines, the Bank expect the vast majority of impacted customers to be identified by lenders by end September 2017.  As the lenders&rsquo; reviews are subject to assurance work by the Central Bank, it is possible that additional impacted accounts may be identified after this date.  The Central Bank has and continues to challenge lenders through a combination of bilateral engagements and on-site assurance work to ensure that this Review Phase is completed as quickly and accurately as possible.   </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has clearly articulated its expectations of lenders to provide appropriate redress and compensation to all impacted customers in line with prescribed principles for redress developed by the Central Bank.  The timeframes for progression of the redress and compensation programmes vary from lender to lender, however, the Central Bank remains focussed on challenging lenders to ensure that they are progressing redress and compensation and that impacted customers are treated fairly.  Some lenders have already commenced redress and compensation programmes and these programmes, along with the Central Bank&rsquo;s assurance work, will continue beyond September 2017 for some lenders. </p>  <p>  Lenders are also required to establish a dedicated unit to deal with any queries, complaints, and/or concerns that customers may have during the course of the Examination.  The unit must continue to be available to deal with such queries, complaints and/or concerns for at least 6 months after the four phases of the Examination have been completed and until all complaints have been adjudicated on.  The Central Bank will continue to engage with lenders in respect of the conduct of the Examination and will consider appropriate supervisory action, up to and including enforcement action, where necessary.

I understand that there have occasionally been minor technical issues; the Financial Service Ombudsman confirms that these would be a low in number (less than 1% of complaint forms submitted) and when they were identified, these issues were resolved usually within the same day.  The Financial Services Ombudsman is not aware of any complaint forms lost as a result of the online system; once a complaint form is submitted, it is retrievable in the system.</p></reply>

My Department is currently developing projections for 2018 wage growth that will be contained in Budget documentation to be published on 10 October, but this work is still ongoing and, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, all such macro-economic forecasts are subject to scrutiny by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council before publication.</p><p>Accordingly it is not yet possible to provide a costing for index-linking the income tax bands to expected wage growth to 2018.  However, I am advised by Revenue that the pre-Budget 2018 Reckoner Ready, available at , shows on page 10 the cost to the Exchequer of a 1% indexation of a number of credits and bands in 2018. Further changes can be estimated on a pro-rata basis from the information shown.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, in the Programme for Partnership Government there is a commitment to continue a medium-term process of income tax reform, to reduce excessive tax rates for low and middle-income earners while maintaining the breadth of the tax base. The Programme for Government therefore includes a commitment not to index-link tax credits or rate bands. While elements of the income tax system have traditionally been adjusted in each Budget this has always been done in a targeted manner to concentrate available resources at particular areas of need, rather than as a more generalised pro-rata increase to all elements of the system.  It is my intention to continue this targeted approach in future Budgets. There is also the point that indexation of income tax bands, if undertaken on an automatic basis, would limit the budgetary flexibility of the Minister for Finance and the Government by effectively earmarking in advance resources for such a measure. </p></reply>

The bank does this through its Local Markets network and through its Real Estate Finance Team.</p><p>&quot;AIB has supported developers across the spectrum in terms of scale and the Bank just this year established a new dedicated team to address small and medium sized developer requirements.

The Bank has allocated funding of &euro;1bn for construction and development lending, the majority of which is allocated to support construction projects in Ireland.  In Ireland, the Bank is currently supporting &amp;gt;100 sites which are capable of delivering c.2,500 Single Family Homes, and c.1,300 apartments for rent/Purpose Built Student Accommodation beds.</p><p>&quot;The Bank does not fund stand-alone land-bank and land can only be funded as part of an active development project.  The Bank assesses each funding opportunity on its own merits and in the context of a number of policy points and guidelines.  The appropriate level of funding is one of these and while in part the level of funding ultimately provided by the Bank varies by project, in general our policy stipulates that for 'Single Family Homes' housing developments (distinct from apartments or build to rent developments) the Bank may provide up to a maximum of 50% of land costs and up to a maximum of 70% of development costs.  The Bank can also provide Mezzanine debt which, in certain circumstances, can increase the level of funding available by a further 10%.</p><p>&quot;When assessing each transaction the Bank works with the housebuilder to agree a bespoke structure to meet both their needs and the bank&rsquo;s requirements, in some cases this has included working alongside Private Equity houses to deliver debt solutions for housebuilders.  From a review of the Bank&rsquo;s active construction and development loan book the average &lsquo;Loan To Cost&rsquo; ratio for new residential developments is c.65% (excl Mezz).&quot; </p><p><b>PTSB:</b></p><p>Permanent TSB have confirmed to my officials that they do not engage in lending to residential construction projects. </p></reply>

Although a significant portion of the lenders&rsquo; failures occurred prior to the introduction of the Central Bank&rsquo;s customer redress powers in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013, the Central Bank has stated that it expects lenders to provide redress and compensation to all impacted customers. </p>  <p>  As part of the Examination framework, where customer detriment is identified, the Central Bank has clearly articulated its expectations of lenders to provide appropriate redress and compensation to impacted customers in line with its prescribed Principles for Redress.  Key elements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s expectations in respect of redress and compensation for impacted customers include: </p>  <p>  - any harm is stopped at the earliest possible time after each group of impacted customers is identified; </p>  <p>  - the interest rates applied to impacted customers&rsquo; accounts revert to the appropriate tracker interest rate or impacted customers are given the opportunity to revert to such a rate where relevant; </p>  <p>  - redress will be provided to impacted customers to return them to the position they would have been in had lenders&rsquo; failures not occurred; </p>  <p>  - reasonable compensation, that reflects the detriment suffered by individual customers, is provided; </p>  <p>  - redress and compensation is to be paid to impacted customers up front at the point of offer and compensation cannot be reduced by virtue of a customer lodging an appeal; </p>  <p>  - an additional payment is to be provided to impacted customers at the point of offer to enable them to take independent professional advice regarding the redress and compensation offers made to them - it can be noted that this payment is to be made up-front and is not conditional on the customer obtaining financial advice; </p>  <p>  - an independent appeals process is to be established to address complaints from customers who are dissatisfied with any aspect of the redress and compensation package that they receive from lenders; and </p>  <p>  - lenders will undertake not to raise any time limit defences that may otherwise apply if impacted customers make complaints to the Financial Services Ombudsman (the &ldquo;FSO&rdquo;) or initiate proceedings before the courts. </p>  <p>  The appeals element of the Principles for Redress ensures that customers have an option to challenge any aspect of the redress and compensation package, which is additional to the options of bringing a complaint to the FSO or initiating court proceedings.</p>  <p>  Each lender is responsible for designing and executing their individual redress and compensation programmes in line with the Principles for Redress.  The Central Bank advises that, as far as possible, it is challenging lenders' compensation proposals to ensure that customers receive appropriate compensation.  However, as it would constitute specific supervisory information, the Central Bank is not in a position to comment on redress and compensation programmes put in place by individual lenders due to the confidentiality requirements of Central Bank legislation.</p></reply>

As it was a Maltese incorporated company, the liquidation is being carried out under Maltese law.</p>  <p>  As you are aware, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment on 25 May 2017 and overturned the previous decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal that the Motor Insurers&rsquo; Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) is liable in respect of third party motor insurance claims made against the policyholders of Setanta Insurance.  The consequence of this is that the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) has been deemed responsible for the payment of such third party claims.</p>  <p>  As the judgment has been delivered, the process of making payments in accordance with the provisions of the Insurance Act, 1964, as amended, has commenced.  Payments can only be made out of the ICF, with the approval of the High Court and only if it appears to the High Court that it is unlikely that the claim can be met otherwise than from the ICF.  If satisfied, the High Court can order payments out of the ICF up to 65% (or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser) due to relevant claimants. </p>  <p>  In this regard, an Order was granted in the High Court on Monday 24 July 2017 in relation to 324 claims which were subsequently paid by the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice.  The total value paid out of the ICF in relation to those claimants was &euro;6.5 million being 65% of the total value of the settled claims in accordance with the legislation.</p>  <p>  The liquidator for Setanta Insurance has informed me that as of 31 August 2017, there are 1,576 active claims, of these 573 claimants have been paid compensation from the ICF subject to the 65%/&euro;825,000 limits.  The liquidator continues to work through claims to be included in the next application to the High Court scheduled to be made in February 2018 in accordance with the legislation. </p>  <p>  The Liquidator commissioned actuarial consultants, Willis Towers Watson, to carry out an analysis of Setanta Insurance's claims reserves as at 30 June 2017 and this has now been completed.  The report estimates the claims reserves at between &euro;105.9 million and &euro;112.9 million.  This is an increase from the first report in 2014, which estimated the claims reserves at between &euro;87.7 million and &euro;95.2 million.</p>  <p>  A consequence of this is that based on this actuarial report, the liquidator now estimates that he will not be in a position to meet more than 22% of the claims out of the assets of the liquidation once all matters in the liquidation have been concluded, rather than the not more  than 30% of claims figure previously indicated. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently considering the implications of this actuarial report. In addition, you should note as previously indicated that there is also a legal concern that any Government intervention could undermine the priority status of claimants in the liquidation.  The Department of Finance is therefore seeking legal advice on the impact on the State's ability to recover from the liquidated company if it were to compensate third party claimants.</p></reply>

In identifying the requirement for additional school places, my Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide. </p>  <p>  When it is decided that a new school is required to meet demographic needs in a school planning area, a patronage process is conducted to decide who will operate the school. Parental preferences for each patron from parents of children who reside in the school planning area are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process. </p>  <p>  All new schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required to enrol children from within the designated school planning area which the school was established to serve.  This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area, rather it reflects the need to accommodate in the first instance the demographic for which the school was established.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  In schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to prioritise enrolment of children from particular areas or particular age groups or on the basis of some other criterion. For example, some schools give priority to applicants who have attended a particular primary school (known as a feeder school).  The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, it may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s priority is ensuring all pupils have access to a school place which unfortunately may not always result in a school place that is their first choice.  A range of other factors including parental choice, school location and ease of access and commuting patterns can contribute to oversubscription of certain schools within an area.</p></reply>

In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.  <b></b></p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that as of the 31 August 2017, the latest date for which figures are available, the Garda strength of Rathcoole Station and the Garda Reserve strength of Clondalkin, Lucan, Ronanstown and Rathcoole Stations from January 2012 up to 2017 are as set out in the following tables:</p><p><b>Rathcoole Garda Station 2012-2017</b><table><tr><th>2012</th><th>27</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>2017*</td><td>1</td></tr></table></p><p>*As of 31 August 2017</p><p><b>Garda Reserve Strength 2012 - 2017*</b><table><tr><th>Station</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>Clondalkin</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Lucan</td><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>14</td><td>15</td><td>13</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Ronanstown</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Rathcoole</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>28</td><td>30</td><td>22</td><td>15</td></tr></table></p><p>*As of 31 August 2017</p></reply>

All staff in the prison system were instructed to co-operate with her and she remains independent of the Department and the Irish Prison Service as far as investigations are concerned and the content of any report produced.  Further, she was authorised to complete any outstanding reports and submit them to me as Minister for Justice and Equality on a non-statutory basis and these are being published in the normal way. </p>  <p>  Plainly, this arrangement will end when the new Inspector is appointed through the competition described above.</p></reply>

The CSO official recorded crime statistics for Q4 of 2016 show a<b></b>30% decrease in burglary for the twelve months of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015 - which parallels the implementation of Operation Thor. </p><p>The Government made it a particular priority to strengthen our legislative provisions through the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b></b>2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary. I am very pleased that this new legislation is now available to support the work which is being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Operation Thor. </p><p>Underpinning all of these measures is the Government's commitment to Garda recruitment, ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  The Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities and this is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will also be aware that as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders, including the farming organisations.  There are a range of partnership initiatives which have been established between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and important rural-based organisations such as the Irish Farmers Association, Muintir na Tire and other rural community organisations, including the well established Community Alert Programme, the ongoing work of the Metal Theft Forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the Theft of Livestock, the Theftstop initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-09-28a.372.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800065#WRF03800"><p>All services for protection applicants (either those in State provided accommodation or those who live in the community) are delivered under the Government policies of direct provision and dispersal.  </p>  <p>  This system of direct provision is the system whereby State services are delivered directly to protection applicants through the relevant Government Department or Agency &ndash; for example the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills delivers education services through the established school system; the HSE delivers medical services through the established GP and hospital systems.  </p>  <p>  In the case of the Department of Justice and Equality, full board accommodation and related services are offered to residents while their application for protection is being processed . Not every person who seeks international protection in Ireland chooses to accept the offer of full board accommodation and of course many choose to live with colleagues, family or friends in communities across the country, as they are entitled to do. </p>  <p>  Those who accept the offer of accommodation are in turn offered a health screening check on arrival at the initial Reception Centre in Balseskin.  These services are provided by the HSE and assessments as to individual vulnerabilities are made at this stage by the HSE team.  This service is, by definition, made available by the HSE on a voluntary and strictly confidential basis.  Screening covers Hepatitis, TB, HIV, immunisation status and any other ailments or conditions that the medical officers feel require further investigation and/or treatment.  In addition, arrangements are in place in various parts of the country to offer this service to those who do not avail of it in Dublin.   Figures supplied by the HSE show that approximately 84% of asylum seekers availed of health screening in 2015 while residing in the reception centre in Dublin.  No figures are available in relation to those who subsequently availed of screening after being dispersed from the Reception Centre.</p>  <p>  While the Health Unit in RIA assists in the coordination of the provision of health services and communications with various stakeholders, RIA has no role in the provision of health services as this remains the sole responsibility of the HSE.</p>  <p>  Following on from this initial health screening, access to health services in Ireland thereafter for asylum seekers residing in State provided accommodation is 'mainstreamed' i.e. it is provided on the same basis as the general population.  Asylum seekers in State provided accommodation will also generally qualify for a medical card and an exemption from prescription charges.  They are then eligible to avail of a wide range of health services free of charge including GP services. They also have access to the Public Health Nursing System, social work services and Community Welfare services.  A dedicated asylum seeker psychological service operates in Balseskin Health Centre and the North Strand Health Centre. North Strand Road, Dublin 1.</p>  <p>  Tusla and the HSE link in with accommodation centres to provide on-site services and monitoring of children and families through Public Health Nurse and GP services, social work teams, mental health specialists and through the positive engagement of accommodation centre management teams.  </p>  <p>  The Community Welfare Service of the Department of Social Protection holds clinics in many centres to assist families with needs which may fall to be assisted under the Exceptional Needs Payments. </p>  <p>  Children are linked in by local management to mainstream primary and post-primary schools in a like manner to the general population.  Younger children may also avail of the free ECCE pre-school placements.  Homework clubs are provided at certain family centres.  The Department of Education has also made changes to allow children who are 5 years in the system and who have attended a minimum of five years in the Irish school system to avail of third level education.</p>  <p>  RIA has a dedicated Child and Family Services Unit, whose role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers residing in State provided accommodation.  It also acts as a conduit between RIA and Tusla, the latter having statutory functions in this area.  The Unit is headed up by an official seconded from Tusla who has clinical expertise in the area of child welfare and protection.  </p>  <p>  The Child Protection  and Welfare Policy and Practice Document in force in all accommodation centres is based on the HSE's &ldquo;Children First - National Guidelines for the protection and welfare of children.  The HSE and Tusla have provided 'Keeping Safe' child protection training and Designate Liaison Person Training (DLP) to each centre's Designated Liaison Persons and other staff members.  RIA has recently updated its Child Protection Policy to include a Practice Document. Briefing sessions were held in family centres around the country for centre staff members and all other relevant personnel.  All staff of centres under contract to RIA are Garda vetted.</p>  <p>  In summary, those in the protection process have access to the same set of assessments as other persons resident in communities across the country and have the same rights to appeal decisions or make complaints through the relevant Departmental channels and through the relevant Ombudsmen where appropriate and necessary.  Any vulnerabilities that are identified at any assessment are identified and addressed by the relevant Government Department or Agency.  </p></reply>

This report is, under the terms of the Act, to be provided to the Minister for Justice and Equality by the Legal Services Regulatory Authority within two years of its establishment day, 1 October 2016.  The Government will, therefore, take account of any specific findings and recommendations that are made on these matters by the Authority in its report including in deciding the appropriate policy responses to be made. Similarly, account will also be taken of any interim report provided under the terms of section 34(6) of the 2015 Act.  It is expected that the Authority will commence its work on these matters in due course. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also wish to note that the Regulatory Authority has been deeply engaged in the conduct of public consultations and in the making of reports on a whole series of issues which it remains obliged to deal with under the 2015 Act within set deadlines.  For example, on 31 March 2017, the Authority presented its report under section 118 (Legal Partnerships) which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 28 April 2017.  The Authority then submitted a further short report on Legal Partnerships on 31 July 2017 which is in the process of being laid before the Houses.  At present, the Authority is finalising two more reports which it is to submit by 30 September 2017.  The first follows commissioned research and a public consultation on the establishment, regulation, monitoring, operation and impact of Multi-Disciplinary Practices conducted under section 119 of the 2015 Act while the second follows public consultations on certain issues relating to barristers conducted under section 120 of the Act. </p>  <p>  The Regulatory Authority also submitted its first Annual Report on 26 April 2017 which, under the terms of the Act, covers its activities for the quarter since establishment on 1 October 2016 to the end of that year.  That report was laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 18 May 2017.  It should be noted that in addition to such reports being laid before the Houses, the Regulatory Authority also makes them available, as may be appropriate, on its website www.LSRA.ie along with other useful information.</p></reply>

This scheme is open to all persons, irrespective of their age and assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses.  The qualifying income thresholds under this scheme are lower than over-70s gross income thresholds.  In setting the assessment guidelines, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has regard to Government policy as outlined by the Minister for Health, changes in the consumer price index and other issues which may be relevant. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, persons, including those aged over 70 years, may be deemed eligible for a medical card on a discretionary basis, if they are judged to face undue hardship in arranging GP services as a result of medical or social circumstances.

The only statutory scheme in place at present to support older people is the Nursing Home Support Scheme, commonly known as &lsquo;A Fair Deal&rsquo;, and there have been calls to extend this scheme to cover home care services.  However, the Government is committed to establishing a new separate statutory home care scheme along with a system of regulation for home care services.  The Department of Health is currently engaged in a detailed process to progress this. </p>  <p>  The statutory scheme for home care will introduce clear rules in relation to what services individuals are eligible for and how decisions are made on allocating services.  For that reason, developing a new statutory scheme will be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner for all those who need home care services.  It will also help to improve access to the home care services that people need, in an affordable and sustainable way.  The system of regulation for home care will help to ensure that the public can be confident that the services provided are of a high standard.     </p>  <p>  As an initial step, the Department commissioned the Health Research Board to undertake an evidence review of the home care systems that are in place in four other European countries.  This review, which was published on 11 April, will help us to learn from the experiences of other jurisdictions and will inform the debate and future consideration of approaches to formal home care financing and regulation here in Ireland. </p>  <p>  I, along with Minister Harris, also launched a public consultation on home care on 6 July.  The purpose of this consultation is to allow all those who have views on this topic to have their say, including home care users, their families, and healthcare workers.  It will also allow us to find out what people think about current home care services as well as the public&rsquo;s views on what the future scheme should look like.  The deadline for submissions is 2 October, 2017.  A report of the findings of this consultation process will be published and the findings will be used by the Department in the development of the new home care scheme. </p>  <p>  The development of a regulatory and funding model for home care services is a complex undertaking.  While the public consultation and evidence review are important steps in the process of developing the new scheme, a significant amount of additional preparation needs to be carried out before final decisions are taken on the form of home care scheme and system of regulation.  This is required if the reforms are to be successful, affordable and sustainable.  Every effort will be made to progress this matter as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.   This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  These recommendations include examining the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  The programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination  against small businesses and family farms.  It is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation  and changes to the NHSS will require legislative implementation.</p>  <p>   On this basis, I have requested legal advice from the office of the Attorney General regarding potential changes to the legislation that will address this matter.  I have met with representatives from the I.F.A to discuss this matter and have apprised them of the current progress.  I am committed to this review of the position with regard to family farms and small businesses for the purposes of the financial assessment of the scheme. </p></reply>

While there is no obligation on GPs to participate in GP out of hours cooperatives as a means of meeting this contractual requirement, such services have been developed and expanded over time and are now an essential part of our primary care services helping to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, urgent care needs are met in the primary care setting.</p>  <p>  The geographic area of North Wicklow, which covers Bray, Greystones and Enniskerry, is not currently serviced by a GP out of hours co-operative.  The current out of hours service for the area is provided through a GP deputising service covering night time and weekend periods.  The HSE has advised that the current service is unable to meet demand and is not sustainable long term.</p>  <p>  I recognise the need for an improved out of hours service for North Wicklow which can provide the appropriate level of cover for the population of the area.  The development of such a service would allow GPs to participate fully in the provision of an integrated healthcare system providing medical services that are appropriate, timely and effective, easily accessible and responsive to the needs of patients.</p>  <p>  The HSE remains committed to the development of GP out of hours services in North Wicklow, and a proposal to provide a structured out of hours service for the area which would ensure 24/7 GP cover is being pursued.  I expect to be in a position to provide further news on this in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The HSE's National Primary Care Division has also undertaken a national review of current GP out of hours services and a final report  is expected to be completed shortly.  This report will make recommendations regarding the future provision of GP out of hours services and will have particular relevance to the currents gaps in service, in areas such as North Wicklow. </p></reply>

The Report of the Review was published in July 2015. Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  These recommendations include</p>  <p>  - Improvements to the administration of the Scheme, including an examination of the treatment of farm and business assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme;</p>  <p>  - A review of how prices for private  and voluntary  nursing homes are set by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF);</p>  <p>  - A Value for Money and Policy Review of the cost differentials in public and private/voluntary residential facilities, due to commence in 2017.</p>  <p>  Funding for the implementation of certain recommendations, where required, will be considered on a case by case basis.  I have also asked this group to consider the issue of additional charges in nursing homes.  On foot of this, a Department led project team will identify and examine the key issues and considerations in relation to additional charges, explore options to respond to those issues and analyse the implications and consequences of those options.  The Interdepartmental Group will then consider the issues identified and once they have completed this consideration they will decide what steps to propose next and report back to Minister Daly.</p>  <p>  In light of this work I have not requested HIQA to invigilate the additional charges by nursing homes.  HIQA is the independent authority established under the Health Act 2007 to drive continuous improvement and to monitor safety and quality in Ireland&rsquo;s health and personal social care services.  Since 2009 all nursing homes - public, voluntary and private have been registered and inspected by HIQA.</p></reply>

We have a level of consensus and support for the vision and strategic direction outlined in the report that is unprecedented.  I am determined to harness this and to work with colleagues across the political spectrum and with all stakeholders to move forward now on this very important agenda.  This is one of the key priorities for the Government, and the focus now must be on ensuring that the implementation phase is properly designed and that a clear implementation plan is developed as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  Reducing waiting times for the longest waiting patients is one of this Government's key priorities. Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  </p>  <p>  In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, I asked the HSE to develop Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient/Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services.  These Plans have commenced and their implementation is ongoing.  These Plans are utilising both the capacity within the private hospital system through outsourcing, whilst maximising existing capacity in our public hospital system through insourcing within hospital groups.</p>  <p>  In relation to unscheduled care, Hospital Groups, Community Health Organisations and hospitals are all currently in the process of planning for winter Emergency Department demand through developing integrated winter plans to cover the period October 2017 to March 2018.  These plans will be submitted to the HSE for approval in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The construction contract for the building of the main children&rsquo;s hospital and the satellite centres contract were signed in August.  Confirmed dates for completion of the development of the new children's hospital and the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centres have now been agreed with the preferred contractor.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital will be completed by the middle of 2022.  The Paediatric Outpatients and Urgent Care Centre at Connolly will open in 2019 followed by the second one at Tallaght in 2020 in advance of the opening of the main hospital in 2022.  Site preparatory work has continued throughout the year and the construction phase of the project has now commenced.</p><p>On 29 August, the Minister for Health published the General Scheme for the Children&rsquo;s Health Bill on the Department of Health&rsquo;s website.  The General Scheme was referred to the Chair of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health on 31 August for pre legislative scrutiny, requesting the Committee to note the priority for the Department of progressing this work.  <font color="#2F2F2F">This legislation will create a single statutory entity to run the new children&rsquo;s hospital. The new body will take over the services of the existing three Dublin children&rsquo;s hospitals and run the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  The Bill provides for the establishment of a single body to govern and manage paediatric services, as well as to facilitate planning for the transition of staff and services to the outpatient and urgent care centres which will open several years ahead of the new children&rsquo;s hospital opening.  It will also support the organisation of the clinical and non-clinical services in an integrated manner across the existing sites before the move to the new facilities.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">This new hospital is an extraordinary opportunity to transform paediatric services in Ireland by bringing together patients and staff from across the three existing children&rsquo;s hospitals into a single organisation as the national tertiary paediatric service with the facilities and necessary status to take on a leadership role nationally in relation to paediatric healthcare and as an international player in paediatric research and innovation.</font></p></reply>

The standard of care delivered to residents in these units is generally very high, but we recognise that many of our public units are housed in buildings that are less than ideal in the modern context.

The Framework sets out  how the HSE including the national divisions, the hospital groups and individual managers will be held to account for their performance. </p>  <p>  It makes explicit the responsibilities of health service managers in the four equally important domains of performance which are: access to services; the quality and safety of those services; doing this within the financial resources available; and effectively harnessing the efforts of the workforce.  The emphasis of the Framework is on recognising good performance, improving performance at all levels of the health service and ensuring that individual managers are held to account for their performance.</p>  <p>  My Department oversees and monitors the HSE's implementation of its performance accountability framework and monitors implementation of the HSE corporate plan and annual national service plans.</p>  <p>  A Capacity Review is currently being undertaken by my Department and will examine both current capacity across the health system including in acute hospitals, primary care and social care, and the drivers of future demand moving to 2030.  This review is due to be concluded by the end of 2017 and the findings will feed into decisions regarding future capital expenditure.  </p>  <p>  My Department is pursuing a range of initiatives to address health service staffing, including the development of a national strategic framework for health workforce planning.  The recruitment and retention of medical staff is also a priority for the HSE and the number of consultants employed in the public health service continues to increase.  At the end of July 2017 there were 2,892 whole time equivalents, an increase of 105 on the corresponding month in 2016 and 700 in the past decade.  There has been an increase of 722 whole time equivalent nurses and midwives in the last year.</p>  <p>  The 2017 total Health Budget of &euro;14.6 billion was the highest ever health budget and is enabling both progress towards addressing the challenge of increased demand from a growing and aging population, and the commencement of some significant new developments which will over time deliver real improvements for patients.  The increased funding and growth in staffing within our health service are allowing for expansion in service levels and optimum utilisation of facilities.</p></reply>

A number of sources provide data on GPs working in Ireland at present.  The Medical Council collects and analyses data from the general, specialist and trainee specialist registers to produce valuable data on the GP workforce.  The HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service collects data on the number of GMS contract-holders and those GPs delivering state-funded primary care services.  The Irish College of General Practitioners also collects and analyses data on the GP workforce, including the number of doctors registered for professional competence and those holding membership of the ICGP.</p><p>As of 19 September 2017, there are 3,556 doctors on the Medical Council's Specialist Register in the Speciality of General Practice.  Holding registration does not, however, necessarily mean that a medical practitioner is active in general practice at the time.  In the last ten years, the number of GPs contracted by the HSE to provide services to medical card holders and GP visit card holders under the GMS scheme has increased. At the end of 2007 there were 2,129 GPs who held GMS contracts.  As of 1 September 2017, there are 2,496 GPs who hold GMS contracts.  Many GPs also hold contracts with the HSE to provide services under other state schemes, e.g. the Primary Childhood Immunisation Programme.  There are a further 437 GPs at 1 September 2017 without GMS contracts who hold other such contracts with the HSE, bringing the total number of GPs contracted by the HSE at present to 2,993.</p><p>The Government is committed to the continued development of GP capacity to ensure that patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.  Several efforts to increase the number of practising GPs have been undertaken in recent years.  These include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible/shared GMS/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of enhanced supports for rural GP practices.  These steps should help to address the future demand for GPs by enticing GPs who may have ceased practicing for family or other reasons back into the workforce, facilitating GPs to work past the standard retirement age and encouraging more GPs to work in rural areas.  Separately, the State is seeking to train more GPs to provide GP services to the population. In 2009, there were 120 GP training places and in 2017 there were 170 training places filled.  The Government is committed to further increasing this number to 259 places annually in future years.</p><p>In September 2015, the HSE published a medical workforce planning report entitled<i>Medical Workforce Planning - Future Demand for General Practitioners 2015 - 2025. </i>The report identified a current unmet service demand of around 500 GPs, and estimatedthat there will be a shortage of around 493 GPs in Ireland by 2025 if the impact of population ageing on GP consultation rates alone is considered.  This estimate was based on the assumption that there would be no inward migration of GPs and that the GP training intake would remain at the 2015 level of 157 training places annually.  As I have indicated, the Government is committed to increasing GP trainee places on a phased basis.</p></reply>

This includes, for example, on-going reviews of both the Mental  Health Act 2001, and <i>A Vision for Change</i>.  We will increase also the HSE Mental Health budget annually, as resources allow over future years.  In the region of  &euro;140m additional funding has been provided for mental health since 2012, involving the approval of around 1,500 new posts to delivery the change necessary to achieve a modern, high quality service.  The overall HSE funding provision for mental health in 2017 is significant at around &euro;853m.</p><p>Key priorities being addressed in this context include youth mental health, further improvement to child &amp;amp; adolescent (CAMHS) and adult services, older people's services and enhanced Out-of-Hours response for those in need of urgent services.  Other new initiatives, such as those arising from the <i>National Task Force on Youth Mental Health </i>are also being progressed.  While this sector is experiencing difficulties in staff recruitment and retention, similar to other areas of the health sector, this is being addressed by the HSE, and funding is not an issue in that specific regard.  However, as I have indicated, further investment will be required in the future to develop mental health services on all fronts, including progressing improved supports and continuing structural change.</p><p>I am satisfied that, bearing in mind all the circumstances, adequate financial provision exists at present to underpin this year development of mental health services, and that the Government is fully committed to improving this in the future.</p></reply>

The HSE is currently focused on offering graduating nurses and midwives permanent posts and replacing agency staff with permanent staff. Recruitment of additional nurses is also the subject of considerable ongoing activity by the HSE and voluntary hospitals with campaigns in train in Ireland and abroad.  As part of the 2017 Nursing and Midwifery Recruitment and Retention Agreement, reached with the INMO and SIPTU earlier this year, it committed to put in place an additional 1,224 nursing and midwifery posts across the public health service by the end of December 2017.  Very extensive and detailed work has been sustained throughout 2017 to implement the Agreement.</p>  <p>  As part of the Agreement there was a commitment to increase the number of nursing and midwifery undergraduate places. Since 2010, the four year undergraduate nursing programme had an annual intake of 1,570 nurses which includes 140 midwifery students. In 2016, an additional 60 places were made available for Psychiatric nursing.  In 2016, 1,428 Irish trained nurses and midwives undertook the internship programme.  This programme is a requirement for first time registration with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI).  In 2017, there are 1,421 nurses currently undertaking the internship programme.  As already mentioned, the nursing agreement also allows for permanent contracts to be offered to all student nurse graduates.  A nursing and midwifery workforce plan for 2018 and 2019 to meet service need with relevant engagement to be undertaken with stakeholder is also provided for in this agreement.  These measures should help provide a good supply of nurses to the public health sector in the years to come.  </p></reply>

Planting figures for 2015 and 2016 combined actually exceed the targets set out in the Forestry Programme 2014 -2020.  My Department is currently involved in a detailed midterm review of the Forestry Programme and is engaging with stakeholders in its development.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that my Department each year has provided  sufficient budget to fund afforestation stated targets.  However it is quite clear  that there is intense competition for planting land driven by a number of different factors not least expansion in other agricultural sectors and  this is affecting demand. </p>  <p>  I am convinced that forestry remains an extremely attractive option for landowners and can serve as a complementary income stream for farmers.  This is because the Department funds 100% of the cost of establishing the new forest and guarantees an annual premium of up to &euro;249 per acre (&euro;615 per hectare)  payable each year for 15 years.  Forestry is also compatible with other agriculture schemes and farmers can continue to receive their Basic Payment on land which is also planted.</p>  <p>  It is important now that the benefits of the schemes are clearly communicated and well understood by landowners.  Minister of State Andrew Doyle has established a group jointly with industry to specifically examine the marketing and promotion of the schemes and this group has met once already and will meet again next week.  This group will come forward with a series of initiatives in the very near future on communicating the benefits of forestry to farmers to ensure that landowners are considering forestry as a viable land use option. </p></reply>

However, given that the Irish agrifood sector is particularly sensitive to the ongoing currency fluctuations between the euro and sterling, this is something that both I and my Department officials are continually monitoring.  I also continue to draw the attention of the Commission, Commissioner Hogan and my counterparts in other Member States to the very real risks that Brexit and the resulting currency fluctuations have on the Irish Agrifood sector. </p></reply>

In that regard, the Government has introduced a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy and deliver energy efficiency. However, oil and natural gas will remain significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply in the transition period.</p><p>Ireland currently sources all its oil from abroad and sources its gas supply from a combination of the Kinsale field, the Corrib field and the gas pipeline from Moffat in Scotland.  Corrib and Kinsale are not in a position to meet all of Ireland&rsquo;s annual gas demand and so Ireland will continue to rely on gas via Great Britain for the foreseeable future.  The Kinsale fields are expected to cease production by 2021, while Corrib production is projected to decrease to 50 per cent of its initial levels by 2025. </p><p>Taking the above into account, successful exploration in Ireland&rsquo;s offshore has the potential to deliver benefits to Irish society and the economy, particularly in terms of enhanced security of supply and reduced fossil fuel imports.  However, any such exploration must be conducted in an environmentally sensitive manner.</p><p>In 2015, my Department completed the Irish Offshore Strategic Environmental Study 5 (IOSEA5) process with the adoption of the Plan underpinning IOSEA5 and publication of the IOSEA5 Statement.  The objectives of IOSEA5 were to inform my Department of specific environmental considerations in future petroleum activities under licensing rounds in the Atlantic Margin Basins, as well as the award of licences in the Celtic and Irish Seas; and to provide exploration companies working offshore with an operational baseline against which they can conduct their work and ensure the protection of the marine environment. </p><p>On 11 July 2017, approval to drill an exploratory well within Block 53/6-A in the southern Porcupine Basin off the south west coast of Ireland was granted to Providence Resources Plc. </p><p>Prior to granting approval, the application to drill from Providence Resources was considered against a range of technical, environmental, and financial requirements.  In addition, the company had to obtain a safety permit from the Commission for Energy Regulation and approval by the Irish Coast Guard for the company&rsquo;s Oil Spill Contingency Plan and Well Emergency Response Plan  <b>.</b></p><p>In respect of environmental requirements, the company was required to submit an Environmental Risk Assessment and a Natura Impact Screening (Appropriate Assessment) Statement in support of its application to commence drilling activities and these were considered in the context of the likely effects on the environment of the proposed drilling.</p><p>A review was undertaken for my Department by Bec Consultants, an independent consultancy appointed for their expertise in ecological and conservation marine biology to <i>inter alia</i>:</p><p>-  examine the submitted Environmental Statement and assess whether or not it met the scope and quality of requirements set out or implied by the specific European and Irish Environmental Impact Assessment legislation and guidelines;</p><p>-  appraise the Environmental Statement, highlighting any deficiencies in respect of the statutory requirements of the Statement and detailing the outcome and resolution of any such deficiencies; and</p><p>-  ensure that the requirements of the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations, 2011, for an assessment to be carried out on any plan or project likely to have a significant effect on a protected site or species were met by the Appropriate Assessment Screening Report. </p><p>In addition, the National Parks and Wildlife Service was requested to provide its observations in terms of Natura 2000 sites, where relevant, and Annex IV species (Cetaceans) in accordance with the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC). </p><p>The documentation associated with this environmental assessment is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>During the course of offshore exploration operations, the Department audits environmental compliance by reviewing daily environmental reporting, as well as daily operational reports for both geophysical survey and drilling operations.  Additionally, in the case of drilling operations, a rig inspection visit takes place during operations in order to audit compliance with the conditions associated with the use and discharge of added chemicals, in accordance with the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment in the North-East Atlantic.</p></reply>

The public consultation process was launched with the publication of a Rail Review 2016 Report, which examined the funding required to support the heavy rail network now and into the future, together with a consultation document "The Role of Rail in Ireland and Funding its Delivery".  The report provided an analysis of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's financial situation, some funding solutions and proposals to grow passenger numbers.</p>  <p>  Over 300 submissions were received by the NTA in response to that consultation process which have now all been examined and the NTA is preparing a report of those submissions, which I expect to receive shortly.</p>  <p>  As noted within the Rail Review Report, its analysis predates the finalisation of the National Planning Framework which is being developed at present under the leadership of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Once agreed by Government, the approach which that Framework adopts toward land-use planning and settlement patterns for the country will have significant impacts on the potential of rail and other transport infrastructure and services into the future.

For example, if a SUSI grant-recipient also has a Medical Card or a GP Visit Card, then the SUSI grant-recipient may be eligible for childcare subsidised through the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) scheme.  In addition, the ECCE free pre-school programme is a universal programme that provides 15 hours of free early care and education for 38 weeks per year for children aged between 3 and school entry, regardless of parental income.</p>  <p>  A new universal subsidy for childcare was introduced by my Department in September for children aged between 6 months and 36 months, or until qualification for the ECCE free pre-school programme if that is later than 36 months.  As this new subsidy is universal, it is available to SUSI grant recipients who are not already in receipt of a CCS childcare subsidy.  Provided the child is within the specified age-range, a subsidy of up &euro;20 per week is available in any Tusla-registered childcare provider, for up to 52 weeks per year.</p>  <p>  In addition, at the earliest possible date the existing targeted childcare schemes will be replaced by the Affordable Childcare Scheme.  When it is introduced, the Affordable Childcare Scheme will change the basis of eligibility for subsidised childcare.  Rather than eligibility being based on possession of a Medical Card (or GP Visit Card) or receipt of a relevant social welfare payment or participation in a designated training course, eligibility will then be based on family income.</p></reply>

There are currently fewer than 3,000 in receipt of the diet supplement of diet supplement at a cost of &euro;4.6 million in 2017.</p>  <p>  Following the outcome of a review of the costs of healthy eating and specialised diets by the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute commissioned by the Department during 2013, the scheme has been closed to new applicants from 1 February 2014.  This independent research showed that the average costs across all of the retail outlets of the diets supplemented under the scheme can be met from within one third of the minimum personal rate of social welfare payment, i.e. the SWA rate which was then paid at &euro;186 per week.  The weekly rate of SWA has recently increased to &euro;191 further to Budget 2017.  The diet supplement scheme was discontinued for new applicants on the basis of this evidence.  </p>  <p>  Existing recipients continue to receive the diet supplement at the current rate of payment for as long as they continue to have an entitlement to the scheme or until their circumstances change. This measure ensured that nobody was immediately worse off by the closure of the scheme. An increase in weekly means affects the rate of diet supplement payable.</p>  <p>  The weekly increase provided in Budget 2017 delivers on the commitments as outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government &ndash; to increase the State Pension and to support an increase for people with disabilities.  For this reason arrangements were put in place so that the effect of the Budget 2017 increase on weekly social welfare payments will not impact on the payment of diet supplement to existing customers.  </p>  <p>  In cases of particular hardship, officials continue to have the legislative power to award a SWA payment in cases of exceptional need.  Any person who considers that they may have an entitlement to financial support should contact their local Community Welfare Service who may be able to offer assistance.   </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These amendments were introduced with particular regard to the vital service provided by this group, particularly in rural communities where the fire service is almost exclusively staffed by retained personnel.  </p>  <p>  This legislation provided that when a retained fire fighter is on call this will not result in a disallowance for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment on grounds of availability. It also provides that retained fire fighters are exempt from suffering a loss of a day of jobseeker&rsquo;s payment for any day of firefighting employment. Finally, the legislation also provides an exemption for retained fire fighters from having to satisfy the substantial loss of employment condition under jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</p>  <p>  The legislation and associated regulations allow retained fire-fighters a reasonable and fair level of access to the jobseeker schemes given the unique circumstances of the service they provide their communities.  </p></reply>

The service is delivered by two companies, Seetec Ltd and Turas Nua Ltd.</p>  <p>  For the purposes of the JobPath service all long-term unemployed jobseekers on the Live Register are categorised into groups based on their duration of unemployment (e.g. 1- 2 years, 2 &ndash; 3 years etc.).  Selection for referral to the JobPath provider is by means of stratified random sampling using these groupings; the objective being to ensure equity in selection and also that people referred to JobPath are a representative of the long-term cohort on the Live Register.  The duration of a person's jobseeker claim is recorded in terms of days of unemployment.  Jobseeker Allowance claims are made up of continuous periods of unemployment.  Any two such periods not separated by more than 52 weeks is considered to be the same continuous period of unemployment.  Long-term jobseekers that may have left the live register to go into employment are still considered to be long-term if they reopen their claim within the 52 weeks.  They retain certain entitlements (for example no waiting days and other supplemental benefits) and are eligible for selection for activation services including JobPath. </p>  <p>  Customers who have not been in full-time employment but are returning to Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments from other departmental employment schemes, for example community employment and T&Uacute;S are also eligible for selection for JobPath.</p>  <p>  To date some 9,000 part time workers have engaged with the JobPath service, this figure represents approximately 8% of the total number of clients who have engaged with JobPath.</p>  <p>  There were approximately 72,000 people with JobPath in August 2017.  There was no data on a level of education for 18% of this cohort.  Of the remaining 82%, some 0.8% have informed the Department that they are teaching professionals. This group includes self-described teachers / tutors / instructors of all disciplines and levels.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

If he has suffered a loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of this occupational accident, he may have an entitlement to disablement benefit which is one of the benefits under my Department&rsquo;s occupational injuries benefit scheme.  Part of the application process for disablement benefit involves an in-person assessment by one of the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors to determine if he suffered any loss of faculty.  If he is deemed to have lost half of his physical or mental faculty and needs someone to help him daily at home to attend to his personal needs, he could be entitled to a constant attendance allowance.  This is payable at the same rate as CARB. </p><p>I have arranged for an application form for disablement benefit to issue to him.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This commercial sensitivity is in relation to the release of the information having the potential to both influence the management of the contracts currently in place and any future procurement that may be undertaken and thus putting the State at a disadvantage.</p><p>The JobPath service is being delivered through a payment by results model and the initial set up costs and the ongoing running costs are borne by the companies.  Fees comprise an initial registration fee and thereafter job sustainment fees are payable for each 13-week period of sustained employment, up to a maximum of 52 weeks.  </p><p>The jobs must be full-time, that is, employment for more than 30 hours a week.This means JobPath companies are incentivised financially to assist people to find full-time jobs that they are likely to hold down and are therefore suited to.  My Department verifies each individual job sustainment fee claim before payment, confirming that the customer is in employment and no longer on the Live Register.</p><p>In relation to the number of participants to find full-time employment, it is important to note that jobseekers may be supported through the service for up to 30 months - under the service jobseekers have access to a personal adviser (PA) who works with them over two phases.  During the first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  In addition to the two phases jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service for up to a further 6 months.</p><p>It will therefore take time to accumulate a sufficient number of clients (who have completed their engagement period with the service) for complete and robust outcome data to be available.  With this in mind, it is intended that an econometric evaluation of the service will commence at the end of 2017.  The Department has however commenced publishing initial cohort reports on the performance of the service, with the most recent report, which provides details of the performance outcomes for three jobseeker cohorts - Q3 and Q4 2015, and Q1 2016 having been published on the Department&rsquo;s website recently. </p><p>The report is available at: </p><p><i></i></p><p>JobPath providers provide the JobPath service under contract to my Department.  The providers are responsible for compliance with all the statutory requirements to be satisfied by an employer with regards to its own employees.  The JobPath contract specifies the duration of the contract, as a period of six (6) years.  Following completion of the contract duration, any decisions in relation to redeployment or redundancy arrangements for employees are entirely a matter for the JobPath provider.</p></reply>

The objective of the Regulations is to protect ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources, primarily through the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers. </p>  <p>  Good agricultural practice involves the land spreading of organic fertilisers such as slurry as early as practicable in the growing season in order to maximise the uptake of nutrients by crops and to minimise pollution risks to water courses and groundwaters.  In accordance with the requirements of the Nitrates Directive, the Regulations include provisions regarding periods when the land application of certain types of fertilisers is prohibited.  In addition, the Regulations prohibit such application at any time of the year when the ground is frozen, waterlogged or heavy rain is forecast. </p>  <p>  Specified closed periods for the spreading of fertilisers, including slurry, are a key aspect of the Nitrates Regulations.  They are a requirement of the Nitrates Directive and are mandatory in every Member State.  The closed periods in Ireland were decided following extensive consultation and were discussed with farming bodies and the European Commission when Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme was being introduced.  The provisions of the Regulations are underpinned by scientific research and good agricultural practice and a key message from that research is that a disproportionate level of nutrient loss from agriculture to water occurs during the closed period, when grass growth is limited.</p>  <p>  I have no plans at present to extend the spreading periods for any fertilisers in 2017. </p></reply>

The review has incorporated analysis of comprehensive data received from local authorities regarding the operation of the scheme during 2016 and a wide-ranging public consultation process which saw submissions received from individuals, elected representatives and organisations.</p>  <p>  The review is now complete and a full report setting out findings and recommendations has been prepared.  Following consultation with relevant Departments on implementation arrangements, I expect that definitive proposals will be submitted to me very shortly.</p></reply>

Exchequer funding of &euro;134m has been allocated to RAS in 2017, which is expected to be expended in full.  The most recent data regarding the number of tenancies funded under the RAS and HAP schemes, broken down by local authority is available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>The Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) supports the delivery of social housing by providing financial support to local authorities for the leasing of houses and apartments.  Units under the scheme come from a number of different sources including private owners, Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), Part V and the NAMA Special Purpose Vehicle (NARPS). </p><p>The table below sets out the source of units under the SHCEP scheme in 2016. By end 2016, a total number of 8,366 units were supported and operational under SHCEP, with 1,358 units becoming operational in 2016.  Using the total number of units operational at year end and the full cost of the scheme in 2016, the average annual cost per unit would be &euro;6,454 per unit.  The annualised cost of the average monthly cost per unit under SHCEP in 2016 is estimated at &euro;7,551 per unit.  Data recorded in relation to units under the SHCEP scheme is on a cumulative basis allowing for fluctuation of units coming in and out of the scheme.</p><p>It is anticipated that the Exchequer funding for 2017 of almost &euro;84 million will be fully expended on the operation of the scheme at year end.  It is not possible at this point in the year to determine what proportion of that funding will be expended on properties leased from private owners. <table><tr><th>Source category</th><th>No. of units end 2016</th><th>Annual cost end 2016 at &euro;6,454 per unit</th><th>Annual cost Q4 2016 at &euro;7,551 per unit</th></tr><tr><td>AHB   Build including Turn-Key</td><td>353</td><td>&euro;2,278,382</td><td>&euro;2,665,630</td></tr><tr><td>AHB   Acquisition</td><td>1,175</td><td>&euro;7,583,850</td><td>&euro;8,872,848</td></tr><tr><td>AHB   MTR (Acquisition but recorded as lease)</td><td>178</td><td>&euro;1,148,873</td><td>&euro;1,344,142</td></tr><tr><td>AHB   Lease from private owner</td><td>457</td><td>&euro;2,949,633</td><td>&euro;3,450,972</td></tr><tr><td>LA   lease from private owner (incl.

The submission identified two areas of concern, the proximity of the incinerator stack to Haulbowline and the possible difficulties in the evacuation of the island if necessitated by an incident at the incinerator facility. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces advised that the proximity of the stack of the waste-to-energy facility to the helicopter approach paths of Haulbowline Naval Base and Spike Island is a matter of concern due to the fact that this stack will be emitting significant amounts of exhaust gases and is seen by the Department as a potential hazard as it may in certain conditions render approaches by Air Corps helicopters into and out of Haulbowline Island as unsafe.</p>  <p>  The second area of concern is due to the fact that Haulbowline Island is accessed by a bridge which is connected to the Ringaskiddy Road.  The proposed incinerator is to be built adjacent to this road, before Haulbowline.  Therefore, in the event of any accident at the incinerator, road access to and from Haulbowline is threatened.  This could in some instances hinder the operation of the Naval Base or in the event of a major incident necessitating local area evacuation, the evacuation of Haulbowline would be denied.</p>  <p>  The planning application on the building of an incinerator in Ringaskiddy remains under consideration by An Bord Plean&aacute;la. Accordingly, it would be inappropriate to comment further on the matter at this time.   </p></reply>

The attendance of L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett at the event, which ran from Tuesday 12 September 2017 to Friday 15 September 2017, was an opportunity to portray, to a wide audience, the considerable level of commitment and investment made in recent years towards protecting and safeguarding Irish territorial waters, by showcasing the success of the Offshore Patrol Vessel design and build capabilities.</p>  <p>  L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett departed the Naval Base in Haulbowline on 8 September, and carried out fishery protection and maritime surveillance duties while in the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) en route to the UK.  The vessel was berthed alongside the DSEI exhibition centre from 10 September until 16 September, when she departed London for Haulbowline, carrying out further fishery protection and maritime surveillance duties within the EEZ while en route to Cork.  The estimated fuel costs for the duration are &euro;56,600.</p>  <p>  L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett had a crew complement of 49 personnel comprising officers and other ranks while berthed alongside the exhibition centre.  The estimated pay and allowances associated with these crew numbers in respect of the visit are &euro;57,000 calculated on a pro-rata basis.  The Deputy should note that these pay and allowances do not represent an additional cost arising from the attendance of the ship at the DSEI, as this cost would have arisen regardless.   </p></reply>
