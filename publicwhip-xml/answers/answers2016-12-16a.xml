This will lead to an overall increase in the Justice Group expenditure ceiling for 2017 compared with Budget Day.  The remaining cost of circa &euro;25 million will be met from within the Justice Sector.  This represents less than 1% of the overall Justice Group allocation of &euro;2.572 billion for 2017.</p><p>In identifying the necessary savings within the Vote Group, I am of course very conscious of the need to ensure that the resources necessary for the delivery of the front line services in all areas of the Justice Sector are protected.  By its nature prudent management of budgets will require careful and ongoing assessment throughout the year; as such the exact nature of the savings to be made will emerge during the course of the year. </p><p>This process has commenced in the Revised Estimates in that a reallocation of &euro;4.35 million to Garda Pay from the Justice and Equality Vote has been made.  In addition, part of the additional cost is met from reallocating funding from superannuation to payroll within the Garda Vote.</p><p>The sources of the remaining adjustment within the Justice Vote Group will be fully determined based on budgetary and expenditure trends across the Group during 2017.  It will take into account any under spends in areas such as administrative  and legal expenses and any surplus receipts which are generated across the sector.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-16a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016121600068#WRA00375"><p>This Government is committed to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing throughout the country in order to strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and prevent crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. </p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 members will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that have been recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. So far 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide, including 23 to the Limerick Division.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that another 900 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest in 2017 which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,500 mark by year end.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  While it is the case, as advised by the Commissioner, that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises and, in that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the number of dedicated Community Garda&iacute; throughout the state.  We are now rebuilding the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Community Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including Limerick, in the coming years.</p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-16a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016121600068#WRA00396"><p>My Department has implemented significant reform through a Programme for Change following the report of the Independent Review Group which recommended a range of organisational and cultural changes.  Some actions involve strengthening structural and governance processes while others focused on changing organisational behaviour.  It should be noted that many of the changes overlap with the actions set out in the Civil Service Renewal Plan. </p><p>Much work has been done to address the recommendations regarding relationship management and oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The most significant is the establishment last January of the Policing Authority which represented a very far-reaching reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This is a major element of the comprehensive programme of justice reform that the Government is delivering.  In particular, the Authority brings a new and dedicated layer of public accountability to the administration of policing services and it also provides an engine to drive necessary changes in the policing system and its practices.  The goal is to ensure that the Garda organisation will be fully fit to meet the ongoing and emerging challenges of 21st century policing. </p><p>In addition to the policing area and running alongside the implementation of the major change programme, enormous progress has been made over the past 2 years on the Department's business agenda across very significant areas of public life.  Major issues addressed in this context include Child and Family Relationship Legislation, Marriage Equality Legislation, International Protection legislation and a single applications procedure, progressing the implementation of the EU Victims Directive, establishment of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) to meet Ireland&rsquo;s international humanitarian obligations, amongst many others.</p><p>Particular changes made in my Department include the following: </p><p>-  In the light of an extensive consultation process with staff, agencies and stakeholders, a new Culture and Values Charter was developed and published earlier this year with the objective of fostering a more outward facing, listening organisational culture.  These values are fed into all induction and leadership training and inform the way in which the Department communicates with staff and stakeholders.  A cross grade Change Team, led by the Secretary General, is working to ensure that the values are embedded in the organisation; </p><p>-  The Department&rsquo;s Management Advisory Committee has been reconstituted as a Management Board, new personnel have been appointed, both from within the Department and externally, and lateral mobility put into effect.  Following a competition, a Secretary General was permanently appointed in October last.  Robust supporting processes have been put in place to enhance leadership and oversight of the Department and wider sector and to facilitate more effective management and governance of the strategic objectives.  A Corporate Governance Framework for the Department was published last April;</p><p>-  Agency performance and governance arrangements have been formalised and strengthened through formal Performance/Service Delivery Agreements and Frameworks<b></b>agreed with 24 key agencies including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na</p><p>-  Since March 2014, the Department has put in place revised systems and procedures to ensure that<b></b>all correspondence is handled appropriately which specifies that high priority correspondence is brought to the attention of the Minister and relevant officials and followed up in a timely manner; </p><p>-  An annual Strategic Plan was published in 2015 and again this year which draws together in one single plan all the strategic priorities across the Department.  Progress is monitored monthly and twice yearly progress reports are published;</p><p>-  Risk management processes have been significantly strengthened and the Department's Audit Committee which has a majority of external members has reviewed its processes.</p><p>The Department appointed a Head of Strategic Human Resources from an open competition in June 2016.  Following her appointment a process of workforce planning has been initiated with a view to identifying the resources required to effectively deliver on the Department's business objectives.  Training programmes were also initiated with a view to ensuring that both existing and new resources have the capacity and capability to meet the business needs.  Further work in the area of learning and development is planned for 2017, informed by the workforce planning process and Civil Service Renewal including developing leadership capacity and ensuring future needs at senior levels can be met through proactive knowledge management and development of expertise in specific areas. There will be a focus on developing the capacity of HR itself to meet the needs of the Organisation and developing a business partner model in 2017.</p><p>I am satisfied that these reforms have made a significant difference to the way in which my Department goes about its business and engages with stakeholders.  The focus through 2017 will be on ensuring that the organisation continues to focus on continuous improvement and that the change outlined above is embedded, sustained and further developed in the context of the wider process of Civil Service Renewal.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-16a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016121600068#WRA00624"><p>I understand that the Deputy is referring to detection rates highlighted in the 'Garda Recorded Crime Statistics 2010-2014', which was published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) last week.  The first thing that needs to be said is that this publication provides an analysis of data up to the end of 2014 only, and it would be entirely incorrect to suggest that it represents an assessment of the current situation in relation to burglary or any other crime category.</p><p>In relation to the general issue of detection rates, it must be recognised that detection rates do vary according to the nature of the crime and that this is in line with international experience.  Detection rates are often found to be lower for certain offences, such as burglaries and some other property crimes, as these generally only come to light after the event and the offender has left the scene.  These offences are inherently more difficult to investigate than others such as possession of drugs, for example, where the offender is observed while committing the offence.  While our statistical system is not directly comparable with that of other countries, in the UK, for example, similar difficulties exist in detecting burglaries.  This is illustrated by Home Office figures which show that over 80% of burglary investigations in 2014/2015 were concluded without a suspect being identified.  </p><p>I do of course share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern that we do everything we can to protect communities from burglary and other crimes against householders.  Long before the publication of the recent CSO analysis, I initiated a broad ranging review of our response to burglary crime. </p><p>Operation Thor launched in November 2015 has led to a sharp decline in the rate of burglary crime. Indeed, the most current CSO crime figures, which are for the second quarter of 2016, indicate that in the first six months of this year there were 36%<b></b>less burglaries than in the first six months of 2015, underlining the impact of Operation Thor.  It is also worth noting that the CSO Quarter 2 figures for the Mayo Garda Division show a reduction in Burglary of 22%.  We have also seen the enactment of specific legislation targeting prolific burglars in the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b></b>2015.  These provisions are now available to Garda&iacute; in relation to prosecutions arising from the concentrated drive against crime which is being implemented under Operation Thor, which is supported by very significant investments in Garda resources.  The reduction in burglaries as a result of Operation Thor will not of course be indicated in the detection rate statistics  when they become available for the relevant period but the prevention of crime is always preferable to crimes having been committed which must then be detected.</p><p>If I might illustrate the scale of Garda activity against burglary and property crime &ndash; under Operation Thor we have seen 30,000 crime prevention patrols and in the order of 38,500 targeted checkpoints nationwide. There have also been in the region of 2,500 arrests and 2,900 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.</p><p>The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act was commenced a year ago and introduced the DNA database, which provides Garda&iacute; with investigative links (&rsquo;hits&rsquo;) between people and unsolved crimes; in particular burglaries.  It is anticipated that this should significantly assist in improving detection rates for burglary over the coming years.  So far, approximately 532 investigative links between people and unsolved crimes have already been uncovered, including 359 burglary cases.  In addition, the database links crime scene samples to each other and so far, 95 crime scene samples have been linked to other crime scene samples, demonstrating a link between two crimes or clusters of crimes committed by the same person in a particular area or locality.</p><p>I understand that the CSO will publish the next Quarterly Recorded Crime Statistics release before the end of this month.  I can assure the Deputy that I will be monitoring crime trends very carefully and will remain in close contact with the Garda Commissioner to ensure that we continue to provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary legislative and financial supports needed to tackle crime and protect people in their own homes.</p><p>And finally, underpinning the Government&rsquo;s approach is our commitment to increase Garda numbers to 15,000 and we are pressing ahead with our plans for accelerated Garda recruitment so that we can provide more visible front line policing and bring greater reassurance to people in their local communities.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-16a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016121600068#WRA00900"><p>Ireland signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007 and since then, successive Governments have emphasised Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to proceed to ratification as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are met.  This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention. </p>  <p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland.  Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  This Road map sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification.</p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 completed Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on 7 December. When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial. </p>  <p>  Work is under way on drawing up the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to progress miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification. The Bill will address issues such as the Convention's requirements in relation to reasonable accommodation and deprivation of liberty. The General Scheme of the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is available on the Department of Justice and Equality website. The Bill is at the final stages of drafting and I expect the Bill to be published very shortly so as to facilitate ratification of the Convention as early as possible.</p></reply>

In fact, over the first six months of this year there were 36%<b></b>less burglaries than in the first six months of 2015, underlining the impact of Operation Thor.  The reduction in burglaries as a result of Operation Thor will not of course be indicated in the detection rate statistics  when they become available for the relevant period but the prevention of crime is always preferable to crimes having been committed which must then be detected.</p><p>The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act was commenced a year ago and introduced the DNA database, which provides Garda&iacute; with investigative links (&rsquo;hits&rsquo;) between people and unsolved crimes; in particular burglaries.  It is anticipated that this should significantly assist in improving detection rates for burglary over the coming years.  So far, approximately 532 investigative links between people and unsolved crimes have already been uncovered, including 359 burglary cases.  In addition, the database links crime scene samples to each other and so far, 95 crime scene samples have been linked to other crime scene samples, demonstrating a link between two crimes or clusters of crimes committed by the same person in a particular area or locality.</p><p>The Government remains committed to tackling all forms of crime and has dedicated very significant resources to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in providing the best possible policing service. In this regard I would draw particular attention to the resources allocated to support strategically targeted policing operations, including Operation Thor and operations targeting violent gang-related crime.  An additional &euro;55 million has been provided in 2016 resulting in a more than doubling of the overtime allocation for 2016, bringing the total to over &euro;90 million.  For 2017, I was pleased to be able to secure a further &euro;71.5 million for Garda overtime which will facilitate the continuation of large scale policing operations, including those targeting burglary, gangland crime and terrorist activities.</p><p>The investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet is continuing will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.  There are further investments in Garda airborne surveillance and enhanced technology and ICT systems with &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime.  All of these investments underline the commitment in the Programme for Government to resource and equip An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide enhanced policing and support local communities in all areas of the country.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  Plans are in place to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p><p>I understand that the CSO will publish the next Quarterly Recorded Crime Statistics release before the end of this month.  I can assure the Deputy that I will be monitoring crime trends very carefully and will remain in close contact with the Garda Commissioner to ensure that we continue to provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary legislative and financial supports to tackle crime and protect local communities.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p>  <p>  The Dublin Region is served by members assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) which consists of 6 Garda Division.  The number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the DMR area on the 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 3,473 of which 214 were Detectives.  When appropriate, the work of the DMR is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  At the request of the Garda Commissioner earlier this year, the Government moved decisively to strengthen Garda resources to deal with gang-related crime in the Dublin area.  In particular funding was approved for the establishment of a dedicated Armed Support Unit for the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) in order to enhance armed support capability in Dublin and to free up the resources of the ERU.  Following a selection and training process, the Armed Support Unit for the DMR is now fully operational and providing armed cover on a 24 hour basis.  </p>  <p>  I am further informed that Operation Hybrid has been established to coordinate the response to violent crime in Dublin and address public concerns about community safety.   As of 20 October 2016, there have been 38 arrests and 5 charges brought in connection with the recent shootings. In addition 23 firearms have been seized and over 9,000 lines of enquiry conducted.  In excess of 14,350 high visibility checkpoints have been implemented with significant support from Armed Support Units and a significant amount of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic, and forensic evidence is also being examined.  I understand Operation Hybrid is reviewed on a weekly basis to maintain optimal impact.</p>  <p>  Underpinning all of these measures is the Government&rsquo;s commitment to increasing the overall Garda workforce to 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This process will involve the recruitment of some 3,200 new Garda members on a phased basis over the next four years, to ensure that the service is renewed and has the capacity to provide visible, responsive and effective policing to every community throughout the country.</p>  <p>  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, including 319 to DMR Divisions.  I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will benefit the Detective strength across the Garda Regions including the DMR.</p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services countrywide including  in the Dublin region. </p></reply>

The first thing that needs to be said is that this publication provides an analysis of data up to the end of 2014 only, and it would be entirely incorrect to suggest that it represents an assessment of the current situation in relation to burglary or any other crime category.</p><p>In relation to the general issue of detection rates, it must be recognised that detection rates do vary according to the nature of the crime and that this is in line with international experience.  Detection rates are often found to be lower for certain offences, such as burglaries and some other property crimes, as these generally only come to light after the event and the offender has left the scene.  These offences are inherently more difficult to investigate than others such as possession of drugs, for example, where the offender is observed while committing the offence.  While our statistical system is not directly comparable with that of other countries, in the UK, for example, similar difficulties exist in detecting burglaries.  This is illustrated by Home Office figures which show that over 80% of burglary investigations in 2014/2015 were concluded without a suspect being identified.</p><p>I do of course share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern that we do everything we can to protect communities from burglary and other crimes against householders.  Long before the publication of the recent CSO analysis, I initiated a broad ranging review of our response to burglary crime.</p><p>Operation Thor launched in November 2015 has led to a sharp decline in the rate of burglary crime. Indeed, the most current CSO crime figures, which are for the second quarter of 2016, indicate that in the first six months of this year there were 36%<b></b>less burglaries than in the first six months of 2015, underlining the impact of Operation Thor.  It is also worth noting that the CSO Quarter 2 figures for the Kildare Garda Division show a reduction in Burglary of 34%. We have also seen the enactment of specific legislation targeting prolific burglars in the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b></b>2015.  These provisions are now available to Garda&iacute; in relation to prosecutions arising from the concentrated drive against crime which is being implemented under Operation Thor, which is supported by very significant investments in Garda resources.  The reduction in burglaries as a result of Operation Thor will not of course be indicated in the detection rate statistics  when they become available for the relevant period but the prevention of crime is always preferable to crimes having been committed which must then be detected.</p><p>If I might illustrate the scale of Garda activity against burglary and property crime &ndash; under Operation Thor we have seen 30,000 crime prevention patrols and in the order of 38,500 targeted checkpoints nationwide.  There have also been in the region of 2,500 arrests and<b></b>2,900 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.</p><p>The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act was commenced a year ago and introduced the DNA database, which provides Garda&iacute; with investigative links (&rsquo;hits&rsquo;) between people and unsolved crimes; in particular burglaries.  It is anticipated that this should significantly assist in improving detection rates for burglary over the coming years.  So far, approximately 532 investigative links between people and unsolved crimes have already been uncovered, including 359 burglary cases. In addition, the database links crime scene samples to each other and so far, 95 crime scene samples have been linked to other crime scene samples, demonstrating a link between two crimes or clusters of crimes committed by the same person in a particular area or locality.</p><p>I understand that the CSO will publish the next Quarterly Recorded Crime Statistics release before the end of this month.  I can assure the Deputy that I will be monitoring crime trends very carefully and will remain in close contact with the Garda Commissioner to ensure that we continue to provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary legislative and financial supports needed to tackle crime and protect people in their own homes.</p><p>And finally, underpinning the Government&rsquo;s approach is our commitment to increase Garda numbers to 15,000 and we are pressing ahead with our plans for accelerated Garda recruitment so that we can provide more visible front line policing and bring greater reassurance to people in their local communities.</p></reply>

In essence, Judge O&rsquo;Neill was asked to review allegations of wrongdoing contained in the disclosures; to make whatever inquiries he considered appropriate in relation to the review and to report on the conclusion of his review, including any recommendations which he considered necessary in relation to any further action which may be appropriate and warranted to address the allegations.</p>  <p>  Judge O'Neill was initially due to report by 23 November.  However, he subsequently sought two short extensions, which I granted.  He delivered his report on 7 December 2016. </p>  <p>  The report sets out in detail the allegations contained in the protected disclosures and his recommendations.  The House will appreciate, notwithstanding receipt of the Report of Mr Justice O'Neill, that we are still dealing with protected disclosures and as such I must be very careful to protect the identity of the persons who made those disclosures.  This fact, and the fact that the report specifies the nature of the allegations and refers to third parties, means that I must be very careful to respect the rights of those who made the disclosures and of those third parties.  Having read the Report, I have sought the advice of the Attorney General on how to proceed in relation to it.  When that advice is received, I will bring forward proposals to Government on the next steps.</p>  <p>  I know that Deputies want to know immediately what the Report contains and I am most anxious to facilitate informed comment on it.

I have no doubt that should any further inquiry be established that all parties will cooperate fully with it.</p>  <p>  No question of suspension of the kind suggested by the Deputy arises.</p>  <p>   Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Justice O'Neill for carrying out this work and presenting his Report so promptly to me.  </p></reply>

This includes mainstream access to health, education and social protection services.  While the operation of this system is kept under continual review, there are no plans to replace it with any other system at present.   I am satisfied that this system is in compliance with human rights obligations placed on the State by domestic and international law.  The State provided accommodation system is one of the central features of the State's asylum system.  I am also satisfied that the treatment of asylum seekers in this country is at least on a par with any other country and that the State provided accommodation system delivers a high standard of service and value for money to the taxpayer through coordinated service delivery to asylum seekers.</p>  <p>  The principal issue with Direct Provision is of course the length of time asylum applicants are residing in it - invariably as a result of the multi-layered processes arising from the Refugee Act which will shortly be replaced when the new International Protection Act comes into force.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that no person in the protection process is left without services or shelter at Christmas time or indeed at any other time.</p>  <p>  This is a system which facilitates the State in providing the essential and necessary accommodation and related services to all in the protection process who require it and which has provided accommodation to more than 56,000 people since its establishment.  It allows the State to provide such accommodation in a manner that facilitates resources being used in the most economic means possible while also delivering services (such as education and health) directly to those within the system.  That is not to say that there is not room for improvement.  The focus of my Department is not to end the State provided accommodation system which would leave protection applicants without the safety net of a comprehensive reception system but instead to improve and adjust the system to ensure it continues to respect the dignity of those who reside within it.  Having said that, I do not want to see any person residing in State provided accommodation for any longer than is necessary and significant efforts have been made by my Department in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Report of the Working Group on Improvements to the protection process including Direct Provision and Supports to Asylum Seekers provides a template for the development and improvement of a wide range of services being delivered to those seeking international protection. </p>  <p>  One of the key recommendations of the Report was the introduction of a single application procedure in the protection process.  The International Protection Act 2015, which will be commenced on 31 December 2016, provides for such a procedure.  My Department is currently preparing all of the steps necessary to commence the Act which responds to some 26 of the Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations and can be expected to positively address the crucial issue of the length of time that applicants spend in the protection process and by extension in State provided accommodation.</p>  <p>  On this particular point, significant efforts have been made to deal with those who are longest in the system and at this stage the vast majority of those who are over 5 years in the system and who do not have any impediments to progress, such as pending judicial challenges, have now had their cases processed to completion.  This has been a key achievement that has had a real impact on many people and families in the protection process. </p>  <p>  A transition Task Force was established in 2015 and put in place important supports to facilitate people with status moving into and integrating with the community.  The Task Force reported that 87% of people granted status had moved into the wider community within six months.</p>  <p>  Tangible progress in improving the daily lives of asylum seekers living in State provided accommodation while their application is being processed is also being made.  In January last, the former T&aacute;naiste announced an increase to the Direct Provision Allowance for children, the first such increase since the introduction of the payment some sixteen years ago. Prescription fees for all those in receipt of the Direct Provision allowance, including children, have also been waived.  The Minister for Education and Skills has also announced a second year of their pilot support scheme for students in the protection system for the academic year 2016/2017.</p>  <p>  The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department, which is responsible for the management and administration of accommodation and ancillary services to protection applicants in State provided accommodation, is actively progressing the implementation of other recommendations in the Report around access to cooking facilities and the increase in living space for those who avail of State provided accommodation.  Pilot projects are being established and undertaken in a number of centres to realise these objectives and ensuring that those residing in the State provided accommodation continue to be treated with respect and dignity.</p>  <p>  RIA are also working on the development of standards for the provision and maintenance of services in accommodation centres, enhancing the complaints mechanisms for residents of those centres and the provision of ongoing diversity and equality training and awareness programmes across all centres.</p></reply>

This legislation is being replaced by the International Protection Act 2015, which is expected to be commenced on 31 December, 2016.  There has been no change in the policy in this respect in the new Act.</p>  <p>  There is an effective visa and immigration system in place for those who wish to lawfully migrate to the State for employment purposes.  The key concern in this regard is that both the asylum process and the wider immigration system would be undermined by giving people who secure entry to the State, on foot of claims to asylum yet to be determined, the same access to employment as legal immigrants who follow the lawful route to employment.</p>  <p>  The McMahon Working Group which included representatives of the HSE considered this matter in detail and did not recommend a right to work as a remedy to the experiences of people remaining for long periods in a cumbersome and sequential applications process.  The Report instead sought to tackle the causes of delay.  The International Protection Act 2015 provides for the introduction of a single application procedure for international protection, which is specifically aimed at addressing the length of time persons spend in the protection process.  The new procedure will streamline and speed up the processing of protection applications, allowing all relevant matters to be submitted at the time of application for consideration.  This will significantly reduce the length of time that persons spend awaiting a decision on their protection application.  This will bring certainty of status at a much earlier stage to qualified applicants.  Any applicant subsequently granted refugee status is entitled to enter the labour market.  This significant reform addresses directly the situation raised by the Deputy. </p></reply>

It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p>  <p>  I have also spoken to the Garda Commissioner in relation to the delivery of the commitment to double the Reserve to 2,000 and what steps might be taken to ensure that the expanded Reserve is used to best effect in support of visible policing.  In this regard I am informed that the Garda Reserve Management Office is undertaking an audit of the experience and skills of Reserves which, when completed, will assist Garda management in considering the future role to be played by the Reserve.  Work is also underway on the development of a recruitment plan with the objective of recruiting and training 300 new Reserves annually starting next year, to bring the strength of the Reserve up from its current strength of 737 members to 2,000 by 2021.  As part of the planning process, I understand that the Office is examining the possibility of recruitment at the regional or divisional level, rather than centrally, and also the manner in which the training is delivered. </p></reply>

As stated already, a significant percentage of cases are struck out for non-service.  Where a summons is struck out, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may apply to the appropriate court office for the reissue of the summons. </p>  <p>  Following enquiries by my Department, I am informed by the Courts Service that it does not record the reason why a summons has the order 'strike out' applied.  The Courts Service has indicated that the reasons for 'strike out' can be varied and could include the Judge not being satisfied that the summons was properly issued, or properly served on the accused. </p>  <p>  The Deputy is already aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na established a working group to monitor the level of summons service throughout the country and to examine how the rate of summons service can be improved.  I will be in contact with the Deputy directly as soon I have received a report from this working group. </p>  <p>  The Deputy is also aware that an amendment has been brought forward at Committee Stage to the Road Traffic Bill 2016 by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, to amend section 22 of the Road Traffic Act 2002 to create a revised procedure for the production of a driving licence in court and a process to record whether it was so produced.  On conviction, the Judge will ask the person to produce their licence. The court will then record the details of the driving licence. Failure to produce the driving licence will be recorded and will constitute an offence.  The Judge will, of course, still retain the discretion, which already exists, to adjourn the case to a later date and allow the person to produce their driving licence or learner permit at that point.  In tandem with the new arrangements, it is intended that the wording of the summons will be changed to indicate that a person is required to bring their driving licence or learner permit with them to court and that failure to produce it to the court, if required under section 22, is an offence.</p>  <p>  I strongly support this amendment to road traffic legislation, as it will provide the necessary consistency in the courts to enforce road traffic legislation more effectively.  The issues surrounding the application of Court-awarded penalty points to driving licences remain a priority for the multi-agency Criminal Justice (Fixed Charge Processing System) Working Group; chief of which involves the facilitation of the development of the Master Licence Record (MLR) project.  This Working Group is jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and will report to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I at the end of this year on the MLR project progress and other key matters.  The significance of the MLR project is such that when the project is implemented, the linking of vehicle and driving licence databases will facilitate the consistent application of penalty points to driving licences, thereby improving the effectiveness of road traffic enforcement measures.</p></reply>

The first thing that needs to be said is that this publication provides an analysis of data up to the end of 2014 only, and it would be entirely incorrect to suggest that it represents an assessment of the current situation in relation to burglary or any other crime category.</p><p>In relation to the general issue of detection rates, it must be recognised that detection rates do vary according to the nature of the crime and that this is in line with international experience. Detection rates are often found to be lower for certain offences, such as burglaries and some other property crimes, as these generally only come to light after the event and the offender has left the scene.  These offences are inherently more difficult to investigate than others such as possession of drugs, for example, where the offender is observed while committing the offence.  While our statistical system is not directly comparable with that of other countries, in the UK, for example, similar difficulties exist in detecting burglaries.  This is illustrated by Home Office figures which show that over 80% of burglary investigations in 2014/2015 were concluded without a suspect being identified.</p><p>I do of course share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern that we do everything we can to protect communities from burglary and other crimes against householders.  Long before the publication of the recent CSO analysis, I initiated a broad ranging review of our response to burglary crime.</p><p>Operation Thor launched in November 2015 has led to a sharp decline in the rate of burglary crime. Indeed, the most current CSO crime figures, which are for the second quarter of 2016, indicate that in the first six months of this year there were 36%<b></b>less burglaries than in the first six months of 2015, underlining the impact of Operation Thor.  It is also worth noting that the CSO Quarter 2 figures for the Wicklow Garda Division show a reduction in Burglary of 33%.  We have also seen the enactment of specific legislation targeting prolific burglars in the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b></b>2015.  These provisions are now available to Garda&iacute; in relation to prosecutions arising from the concentrated drive against crime which is being implemented under Operation Thor, which is supported by very significant investments in Garda resources.

The current assessment of the threat is that while an international terrorist attack on Ireland is possible, it is not considered likely.  Nor is there at present any specific information that an attack on Ireland is planned.  The level of threat from this source is kept under constant review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly in the light of ongoing developments and the current international situation.</p>  <p>  While there are a number of persons here whose activities in support of extremism give rise to concern they will continue to be monitored closely by the Garda authorities and all appropriate measures will be taken in this regard.  Indeed, the Garda authorities will continue to take all necessary security measures proportionate to the level of terrorist threat and all the relevant agencies here co-operate closely in respect of any threats identified.  The Deputy will understand that the detail of such security measures should not be disclosed publicly.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has developed considerable operational capacities in countering terrorism and in responding to critical incidents.  There is, in particular, a highly-trained and well-equipped special intervention capability in the Emergency Response Unit that is supported by the regional Armed Support Units and the range of other resources across the Garda organisation.  In addition, the considerable skills and resources of the Defence Forces are also available in support where needed.</p>  <p>  I secured additional funding of &euro;55 million for the Garda Vote this year which included additional sums specifically to support the force's capabilities and actions to counter international terrorism, including equipment and training.</p>  <p>  Of course, this is an international problem and the Garda Authorities will continue to work closely with their EU and other international security and intelligence counterparts in responding to this shared threat.  The gathering and sharing of relevant information is an important aspect of this international co-operation.  The Government is committed to providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary resources to enhance their connectivity to a range of EU and other international resources and significant work is ongoing in this regard.  This includes connecting to the Schengen Information System and, indeed, to other EU and Interpol information-sharing resources relevant to countering the terrorist threat.  A series of measures is being rolled out to build on the current EU framework for information-sharing, combating terrorism and controlling illegal firearms, and Ireland is fully engaged in pursuing these developments.</p></reply>

The continued lethal intent of these groups was sadly evidenced by the murder in Belfast earlier this year of Northern Ireland Prison Officer Adrian Ismay.  Combatting the persistent threat from these groups is an absolute and shared priority.  The Secretary of State and I are at one in our support for the close co-operation and the ongoing work of the police and security services North and South in bearing down on these groups and bringing them to justice.</p>  <p>  We also had the opportunity to discuss issues in respect of security co-operation and the Common Travel Area on the island of Ireland arising from the decision of the UK to exit the European Union.

It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. </p><p>The Dublin Region is served by members assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) which consists of 6 Garda Division including the DMR North and North Central Divisions.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the DMR on the 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 3,473 of which 214 were Detectives.  The number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the DMR North and North Central Divisions on the 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 1,274 of which 67 were Detectives.  When appropriate, the work of the Garda Divisions within the DMR is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>At the request of the Garda Commissioner earlier this year, the Government moved decisively to strengthen Garda resources to deal with gang-related crime in the Dublin area.  In particular funding was approved for the establishment of a dedicated Armed Support Unit for the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) in order to enhance armed support capability in Dublin and to free up the resources of the ERU. Following a selection and training process, the Armed Support Unit for the DMR is now fully operational and providing armed cover on a 24 hour basis.  </p><p>I am further informed that Operation Hybrid has been established to coordinate the response to violent crime in Dublin and address public concerns about community safety.  As of 20 October 2016, there have been 38 arrests and 5 charges brought in connection with the recent shootings.  In addition, 23 firearms have been seized and over 9,000 lines of enquiry conducted. In excess of 14,350 high visibility checkpoints have been implemented with significant support from Armed Support Units and a significant amount of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic, and forensic evidence is also being examined.  I understand Operation Hybrid is reviewed on a weekly basis to maintain optimal impact.</p><p>Underpinning all of these measures is the Government&rsquo;s commitment to increasing the overall Garda workforce to 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This process will involve the recruitment of some 3,200 new Garda members on a phased basis over the next four years, to ensure that the service is renewed and has the capacity to provide visible, responsive and effective policing to every community throughout the country. <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, including 319 to DMR Divisions.  I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will benefit the Detective strength across all Garda regions. </p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services countrywide including in the DMR.</p></reply>

Detection rates are often found to be lower for certain offences, such as burglaries and some other property crimes, as these generally only come to light after the event and the offender has left the scene.  These offences are inherently more difficult to investigate than others such as possession of drugs, for example, where the offender is observed while committing the offence.  While our statistical system is not directly comparable with that of other countries, in the UK, for example, similar difficulties exist in detecting burglaries.

Under the Road Traffic Acts, any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may stop a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place and demand production of a driver licence or learner permit.  In addition, Garda&iacute; may inspect the vehicle for compliance with vehicle standards legislation, which makes it an offence to drive without reasonable consideration, drive carelessly, or drive dangerously.  The Garda authorities also have powers of seizure, detention, storage and disposal of vehicles under road traffic legislation. </p>  <p>  I also understand that the use of quad bikes and scramblers in public parks and open spaces may be prohibited under local authority bye-laws. </p>  <p>  Despite the legislative provisions in this area, the Garda authorities have indicated that the use of quad bikes and scramblers by minors and youths in public parks has proven difficult to deal with from an enforcement perspective . Garda members are instructed not to pursue youths on quad bikes, scramblers, etc. owing to the inherent safety issues involved and the risk of serious injury or death.  Therefore the opportunity to actually bring these vehicles to a stop is rare. </p>  <p>  The Garda authorities have advised that the issue may be best addressed through a multi-agency approach.  In this regard, Garda&iacute; are working with local authorities, including park authorities, to examine other solutions, such as engineering solutions.  Enhanced fencing and bike gates are examples of engineering measures taken to restrict access to parks.  </p>  <p>  I do of course share the Deputy's concerns in relation to the public safety and anti-social issues associated with the misuse of such vehicles.  While I am happy to engage as necessary with the Minister for Transport in relating to the legislative issues, it is clear that all aspects of this matter cannot be addressed by legislation alone. In this regard, the Road Safety Authority may have a role in developing further responses in this area, in addition to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities. </p></reply>

In essence, Judge O&rsquo;Neill was asked to review allegations of wrongdoing contained in the disclosures; to make whatever inquiries he considered appropriate in relation to the review and to report on the conclusion of his review, including any recommendations which he considered necessary in relation to any further action which may be appropriate and warranted to address the allegations.</p><p>Judge O'Neill was initially due to report by 23 November.

When that advice is received, I will bring forward proposals to Government on the next steps.</p><p>I will not be in a position to make any decisions about the report until I have received the advice of the Attorney General and, accordingly, no decisions have been taken yet in relation to what actions might be taken arising from it.  It may be helpful to inform the Deputy that I did receive requests to extend Mr Justice O'Neill's review to cover the cases of other persons who had been involved in making protected disclosures.  I indicated that Mr. Justice O'Neill had been asked to look at two very specific disclosures and the review was not intended to look at general issues relating to whistleblowers.  In the circumstances, the question of including those cases in the review did not arise. In considering the action to be taken in response to the report, obviously I will have to be guided by the findings and recommendations in relation to what further action might be necessary.</p></reply>

I am informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that 'Operation Egg Shell' was carried out as part of the North Atlantic Maritime Project of the Santa Marta Group.  The Santa Marta Group is a global alliance of international Police Chiefs and Bishops working together with Civil Society to eradicate human trafficking and modern day slavery.  Within this Group, Ireland has agreed to lead in the North Atlantic Fisheries Project with the United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal, to prevent human trafficking and labour exploitation in the fisheries industry in the North Atlantic.</p><p>The Day of Action was coordinated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners, the Workplace Relations Commission Inspectorate, the Irish Navy and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority. Specially trained officers from the Human Trafficking Investigation and Coordination Unit of the Garda National Protective Services Bureau were involved in operations at both Castletownbere and Howth.  These officers focused on finding people who demonstrated any indicators of human trafficking, particularly crew members of fishing vessels.  Further objectives included:</p><p>- Identifying offences under the Atypical Work Permit Scheme for non-EEA crew in the Irish fishing fleet,</p><p>- Breaches of employment legislation,</p><p>- Immigration offences,</p><p>- Breaches of tax/revenue and customs offences,</p><p>- To apprehend suspects in the commission and/or the attempted commission of offences above and fully investigate, detect and prosecute (where possible) any offences outstanding against these suspects and groups, and </p><p>- Identify and support any suspected victims of human trafficking that might be found. </p><p>I am further informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that inspections were carried out on 41 fishing vessels, 22 in Castletownbere, 16 in Howth, and three offshore inspections.  Inspections at port were led by the Workplace Relations Commission Inspectorate, under Section 27 of the Workplace Relations Act 2015, accompanied and assisted by Garda&iacute; and Revenue and Customs officials.  The naval service carried out the offshore inspections.  </p><p>No evidence of human trafficking or labour exploitation was found in any location. A number of suspected breaches of the atypical work permit scheme for non-EEA crew, were detected, as well as other suspected breaches of employment law, immigration law and tax offences.  Both the Workplace Relations Commission and the Garda National Immigration Bureau are following up in relation to these suspected breaches.</p><p>The prevention and detection of human trafficking in all its forms and the protection of its victims has been a policing priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the past number of years and it remains a priority in 2016.Ireland's approach to the issue of Human Trafficking is set out in the Second National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Human Trafficking in Ireland which was published in October 2016 and sets out 65 Actions to be undertaken to address this issue.  The Government recognises that trafficking in human beings undermines the principles of human rights and dignity of the person, it will not tolerate persons who engage in any part of trafficking.  </p></reply>

The first thing that needs to be said is that this publication provides an analysis of data up to the end of 2014 only, and it would be incorrect to suggest that it represents an assessment of the current situation in relation to sexual offences or any other crime category.</p>  <p>  In relation to the general issue of detection rates, it must be recognised that detection rates do vary according to the nature of the crime and that this is in line with international experience. Some categories of offences, including sexual offences, are inherently more difficult to investigate than others such as possession of drugs, for example, where the offender is observed while committing the offence. </p>  <p>  As regards our overall approach to sexual offences, the Deputy will be aware that the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill was published in September 2015.  It has completed passage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and is awaiting Report Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It is expected to be enacted in early 2017.  </p>  <p>  This Bill includes wide ranging provisions to enhance the protection of children from sexual abuse and exploitation.  When enacted, the Bill will facilitate full compliance with the criminal law provisions of a number of international legal instruments.  The Bill will also implement the recommendations of a number of Oireachtas committees, reform the law on incest and provide enhanced protections for victims of sexual offences in the criminal process and for vulnerable persons.  In addition, the Bill will provide for new offences of purchasing, in the context of prostitution, sexual services.</p>  <p>  In January 2016, I launched the Second  National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021.  The Strategy envisages a range of actions to be implemented by State, voluntary and community sector organisations aimed at preventing and responding to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  An important recent initiative under the Strategy is the &ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo; campaign on domestic violence, which focuses on prevention, empowerment and support.  It is intended that the campaign will run for a period of 6 years up to 2021.  The first 3 years will focus on domestic violence, to be followed by 3 years dealing with sexual violence, but elements of each type of violence will feature in each phase of the campaign.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to fully implement actions for which it is responsible under the National Strategy.  In 2015, a number of Garda units were brought together to leverage their experience and expertise in investigating serious crimes against the person including sexual offences.  The Garda National Protective Services Bureau (GNPSB) is a specialist team dedicated to making sure each and every complaint relating to child protection, human trafficking and domestic and sexual violence is thoroughly investigated and handled correctly.  In addition, the GNPSB is are responsible for working with other agencies to manage sex offenders in the interest of community safety.  As part of the Garda Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016 -2021 Protective Services Units (PSUs) will be set up around the country with specially trained staff.  The PSUs will work with the Garda Victim Service Offices in their area to ensure that the needs of victims are adequately catered for.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government is making very significant investments in Garda resources, including the expansion of the Garda fleet, upgrading of IT systems and a commitment to increase overall Garda numbers to 15,000 through a programme of accelerated recruitment.  I am confident that all these measures will support enhanced responses to all forms of crime and support the implementation of the strategic approach to dealing with sexual offences which I have outlined.</p></reply>

The issue of fines warrants for unpaid fines, in respect of fines imposed in 2015, commenced from mid-2015 and continued on a monthly basis as fines became due for payment.  Once a warrant has issued for the non-payment of a fine, enforcement then becomes a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>In relation to these pre-2014 Act fines, where a warrant for the enforcement of fines due is issued to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the fine may be collected by the Garda Warrant Officer and paid to the Courts Service. In some instances the fined person may have been lodged in prison in default of payment of fine or the fines warrant may have been cancelled following an application to the court.</p><p>In relation to persons lodged in prison in default of payment of fines, the Prison Service provides on a monthly basis details of the fines in respect of which fined persons have been lodged in prison in default of payment. The details are updated to the CCTS.  Currently a total of 15,285  warrants with a total value of over &euro;5 million await update to the CCTS. On completion of this update, the total value of fines due will reduce to circa &euro;30.5m. </p><p>In relation to fines imposed in 2016, the vast majority of these fall for enforcement under the Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014.  The Courts Service has undertaken an extensive ICT development programme to enhance the CCTS to provide for the payment of fines by instalment and additionally to provide for the enforcement provisions provided for in the Act.  This enhancement of the CCTS is now in the final stages of testing and subject to satisfactory completion of testing, it is anticipated that the Courts Service will be in a position to commence issuing notices to fined persons to attend Court in default of recovery of payment of fine in the first Quarter of 2017. </p></reply>

It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that the Garda strength of the Clare Garda Division, on 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 293.  There are also 7 Garda Reserves and 31 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing throughout the country in order to strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and prevent crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. </p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, including 15 to the Clare Division.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that another 900 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest in 2017 which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,500 mark by year end. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including Clare, in the coming years.</p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p></reply>

A working group, chaired by an Assistant Secretary, was set up in the Department in April 2016 to examine these issues, and weekly progress updates are provided to the Department's Management Board on the analysis and preparations under way. </p>  <p>  The Department is also represented by an Assistant Secretary on the Interdepartmental Group on EU/UK Affairs which is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.  The Interdepartmental Committee is engaged with the identification of key strategic, operational and policy issues arising from Brexit.  </p>  <p>  Insofar as border matters are concerned, both the Irish and British Governments have made it clear that it is their wish to maintain the Common Travel Area arrangements after the UK leaves the European Union, and that neither Government wishes to see a hard border between both parts of the Island.  This policy priority is central to the above preparations and analysis, and retaining the Common Travel Area will be a key issue for Ireland in the context of negotiating new terms and conditions for the EU&rsquo;s relationship with the UK, and in engagement with all relevant parties in this regard.  </p></reply>

It allows the State to provide such accommodation in a manner that facilitates resources being used in the most economic means possible while also delivering services (such as education and health) directly to those within the system.  </p>  <p>  Accommodation is offered to all those seeking asylum in Ireland and approximately 50% of applicants accept that offer. Residents are free to leave that accommodation at any time and many chose to do so.</p>  <p>  One of the key recommendations of the Report of the Working Group on Improvements to the protection process including Direct Provision and Supports to Asylum Seekers was the introduction of a single application procedure in the protection process.  The International Protection Act 2015 provides for such a procedure.  My Department is currently preparing all of the steps necessary to commence the Act which responds to some 26 of the Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations and can be expected to positively address the crucial issue of the length of time that applicants spend in the protection process and by extension in State provided accommodation.  </p></reply>

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention. </p>  <p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland.  Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to actually protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification.</p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 completed Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on 7 December.  When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial. </p>  <p>  Work is under way on drawing up the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to progress miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification.  The Bill will address issues such as the Convention's requirements in relation to reasonable accommodation and deprivation of liberty.  The General Scheme of the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is available on the Department of Justice and Equality website.  The Bill is at the final stages of drafting and I expect the Bill to be published very shortly so as to facilitate ratification of the Convention as early as possible.</p></reply>

Under this programme, the Government pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State by the end of 2017, through a combination of the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, and the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focused on resettling refugees from camps in Jordan and Lebanon. </p><p>Under the resettlement strand of the IRPP, 519 persons out of the original quota of 520 persons displaced by the Syrian conflict have arrived in Ireland to date, well ahead of the EU Commission deadline for this programme.In addition, the Government recently announced that it is extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 520 refugees from Lebanon in  2017. Sufficient refugees to fill 260 places on this quota have already been selected during a selection mission to Lebanon in October 2016 and these refugees are expected to arrive in Spring 2017. A further selection mission to Lebanon will be arranged in coming months to select the balance of the 2017 quota. Ireland will therefore have accepted 1,040 refugees under this strand by the end of 2017.</p><p>Under the relocation strand of the IRPP Ireland was allocated a total of 2,622 persons by two Council decisions and these were apportioned between Italy and Greece.  1,089 of this quota is to come from Greece and 623 from Italy.  The balance of 910 has yet to be assigned by the Commission to either country but it is anticipated that the Commissions may take a decision in this regard in the New Year.  </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware the relocation strand of the IRPP was slow to become active largely because of serious operational difficulties in Italy and Greece in establishing camps and hot spots and registering asylum seekers under the EU Programme.  In the case of Greece the programme is now fully operational and Ireland will deliver on its commitment by the deadline.  In the case of Italy, serious difficulties persist as the Italian authorities have taken a position that they will not allow security assessments on Italian soil by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of applicants for relocation.  There have been several attempts to resolve this issue including a bi-lateral intervention by me with my Italian counterpart.  Efforts continue to try to resolve the matter and I remain hopeful that a solution can be found.  </p><p>Ireland has, to-date, taken in 109 asylum seekers from Greece, mostly families, and a further 130 asylum seekers are to arrive in Dublin Airport tomorrow, Friday 16 December, 2016.A further 84 people have been assessed in Athens by the IRPP team and cleared for arrival and arrangements for their travel to the State are currently being made.  The IRPP team includes members of the Department of Justice and Equality, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC), an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, as necessary, representatives of other Departments and Agencies, such as Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  This week, IRPP officials are interviewing a group of approximately 80 people in Athens who, subject to Garda security assessments, are expected to be approved for arrival early in the New Year.  In all, this means that over 400 persons, mostly families with young children, will have either arrived in Ireland or been assessed for arrival by the end of 2016.  The intention is to sustain the pace of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meets its current commitment of 1,089 within the timeframe envisaged by the Council decisions.  A summary of arrivals to date is attached in Table A below. </p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that the T&aacute;naiste returned on Tuesday evening from an official visit to Greece where she was accompanied for part of the visit by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Dr Katherine Zappone, T.D.  The purpose of the visit was to see at first hand the consequences of the migrant crisis, to hear about the issues from those directly involved and to discuss Ireland's role. The T&aacute;naiste met with the Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, the Minister for Migration, Ioannis Mouzalas, the Minister of Interior, <font color="#2A2A2A">Panos Skourletis</font><b>, </b>senior Greek officials, UNHCR, UNICEF, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), MSF, Oxfam and a range of Greek NGO bodies involved in the migration crisis.

The thresholds applying under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 are also to be reduced from &euro;13,000 to &euro;5,000.  </p>  <p>  I have also made new regulations to reduce the prescribed amount of cash suspected of being the proceeds of crime which can be seized, from &euro;6,500 to &euro;1,000. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2016, brought forward by the Minister for Health, has new provisions to counteract the illegal sale of prescription drugs.</p>  <p>  On 5 July 2016, I received approval from Government in relation to enhancing and updating legislation for the lawful interception of communications and for covert electronic surveillance, and work in this regard is ongoing.  My Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are also considering if there are any other legislative measures which might strengthen the response to the activities of organised crime groups.</p>  <p>  I have also signed the rules of court to complete the establishment of a second Special Criminal Court, so that it can deal with the backlog of cases on hand.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware of the substantial investments which have been made in policing resources, including an additional &euro;55 million provided in 2016, which more than doubled the overtime allocation for this year, bringing the total to over &euro;90 million.  For 2017, I was pleased to be able to secure a further &euro;88.5 million for Garda overtime which will facilitate the continuation of large scale policing operations, including those targeting gangland crime, burglary and terrorist activities.</p>  <p>  Garda operational responses to gang-related crime in Dublin are coordinated under Operation Hybrid.  As of 6 December 2016, there have been 44 arrests in relation to gang-related killings, with 5 persons charged in connection with those murders and a further 3 persons charged with related offences.  In addition, 22 firearms have been seized and over 8,000 lines of enquiry conducted. In excess of 11,520 high visibility checkpoints have been implemented with significant support from Armed Support Units and a significant amount of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic, and forensic evidence is also being examined.  Operation Hybrid is reviewed on a weekly basis to maintain optimal impact.</p>  <p>  In addition we have seen unprecedented co-operation with the Spanish authorities with Garda&iacute; and officers from La Guardia Civil taking part in joint operations in Spain and Ireland which have led to important seizures and arrests.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, I was present at the launch of the new dedicated Armed Support Unit (ASU) for Dublin.  The new Unit has been established following completion of the necessary specialised training and preparation of equipment.  While full armed support was already being provided on an overtime basis, I am very pleased that the new ASU is now fully operational.  </p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner is overseeing the operation of a Garda Special Crime Task Force, operating under the Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau in the Dublin Metropolitan Region. The Special Crime Task Force will be sustained for as long as is necessary and is adaptable to the prevailing organised crime situation at local level.  I am advised that there will be in the region of 50 persons contributing to the work of Task Force, with a dedicated core of officers, including members of the CAB and Divisional Asset Profilers. Inter-Agency information sharing will be achieved through the CAB&rsquo;s well established procedures.  The Task Force leverages existing local connections to target the proceeds of crime, including local community Garda&iacute;, the CAB and Divisional Asset Profilers.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the response to gang-related violence and crime is ongoing and must remain adaptable to changing circumstances.  I remain in close contact with the Commissioner and I will continue to provide every support possible to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na face down the threat posed by violent criminal gangs.</p></reply>

In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility  in our communities.</p></reply>

These specialist units also work closely with the Criminal Assets Bureau in targeting persons involved in such criminality.</p>  <p>  All of these units operate under the umbrella of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Special Crimes Operations Unit and are continuing to achieve commendable successes in targeting criminal groups as well as the ongoing drugs and firearms seized.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the very significant measures which have been introduced in response to the appalling gangland feuding activity which has manifested itself both here and abroad.  These measures include the provision of significant additional resources to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, strengthened legislative measures targeting the proceeds of crime, the establishment of a dedicated Garda Armed Support Unit in Dublin and the establishment of a new Garda Special Crime Task Force. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the significant investment of some &euro;46 million in the Garda Fleet under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  This investment will continue to provide the Garda&iacute; with additional high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, and motorcycles to ensure that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.  There are further investments in Garda airborne surveillance and enhanced technology and ICT systems with &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime.</p>  <p>  In addition, plans are in place to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p>  <p>  We are already seeing significant results being achieved on foot of these measures including those of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Operation Hybrid.  Activity as of 9 October 2016 includes 38 arrests, 5 charges (related to shootings), 23 firearms seized and over 9,000 lines of enquiry being followed.  In excess of 14,300 high visibility checkpoints have been implemented with significant support from Armed Support Units and a significant amount of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic, and forensic evidence is also being examined.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that tackling organised crime is a priority for the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

It is of course essential that anyone with information in relation to hate crimes provides full details to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The Garda Racial Intercultural and Diversity Office (GRIDO) has responsibility for co-ordinating, monitoring and advising on all aspects of policing Ireland's diverse communities. GRIDO monitors the reporting and recording of hate and racist crime on a continual basis. Garda Ethnic Liaison Officers (ELOs) are appointed to work with minority communities at local level throughout the country.  These officers combined with GRIDO play a fundamental role in liaising with minority groups and work in partnership to encourage tolerance, respect and understanding within communities in the pursuit of preventing the commission of hate and racist crime. GRIDO and ELOs provide advice and assistance to victims of hate or racist crime where required or deemed necessary. </p>  <p>  Where a criminal offence such as assault, criminal damage or a public order offence is committed against a person based on their race, religion, colour, ethnicity or some other ground, the offence is prosecuted through the wider criminal law.  It is also accepted that such an offence is more serious on account of the hate or prejudice motivating the crime and Irish courts do consider evidence of a crime being motivated by hate or prejudice as an aggravating factor at sentencing.  </p>  <p>  That said, I have requested that this area of the criminal law be examined with a view to considering whether further legislative proposals are needed to strengthen the law. </p>  <p>  I would also like to inform the Deputy that the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration, an office of my Department, is the focal point for the Government's commitment on anti-racism as a key aspect of integration, diversity management and broader national social policy. The Office continues to work with all the relevant sectors to further progress the integration and diversity management agenda. </p>  <p>  A review of our approach to the integration of migrants has almost neared completion. This review will provide the basis for a new and updated migrant integration strategy. Work on the Integration Strategy is very advanced and is expected to be published early in the New Year. I expect that the Integration Strategy, when published, will include a strong anti-racism component.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing throughout the country in order to strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and prevent crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. </p>  <p>  The  reduction in the strength of the Garda Reserve since 2013  arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways - firstly over 160 serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointment Service have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last two years. </p>  <p>  I have also spoken to the Garda Commissioner in relation to the delivery of the commitment to double the Reserve to 2,000 and what steps might be taken to ensure that the expanded Reserve is used to best effect in support of visible policing.  In this regard, the Garda Reserve Management Office is currently undertaking an audit of the experience and skills of Reserves which, when completed, will assist Garda management in considering the future role to be played by the Reserve.  That office has also started work on the development of a recruitment plan with the objective of recruiting and training 300 new Reserves annually starting next year, to bring the strength of the Reserve up to 2,000.  As part of the planning process, I understand that the Office is examining the possibility of recruitment at the regional or divisional level, rather than centrally, and also the manner in which the training is delivered. </p></reply>

This funding which is administered by the Victims of Crime office of my Department, is allocated to organisations working with victims.  A significant part of the monies allocated  relate to court accompaniment - including for  victims of domestic violence.  Decisions on that funding for 2017 are currently being finalised. </p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts, including the provision of accommodation for court sittings, is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions.  I understand that the Courts Service is developing plans for a dedicated and integrated Family Law and Children&rsquo;s Court building on a site at Church Street and Hammond Lane, adjacent to the Four Courts.  I have been informed that to alleviate pressure in the short and medium term, the Courts Service has reorganised sittings in Dublin to support more family law courts.  Since the start of October, the three courtrooms at the courthouse in Chancery Street have been sitting daily to hear childcare matters.  The five courtrooms in Dolphin House have been available to hear private family law matters since 3 October 2016 and in the intervening period the President of the District Court has assigned judges to sit in all five courts, when they are available.  The net impact of this is that waiting times have been brought back for all courts users, including those people applying for protection and barring orders, and it has been possible to get a date 3 weeks in advance for such hearings. </p>  <p>  I am informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in preparation for and in support of the campaign Divisional and District Officers and all Inspectors responsible for monitoring domestic abuse calls were briefed.  Instructions regarding the campaign and the response to it have been published on the Garda Portal (their internal computer system) for all members.  The Garda National Protective Services Bureau is actively involved in the campaign and is monitoring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na response.</p>  <p>  The primary funders of the domestic violence victim services and refuges is Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  The national budget for domestic and sexual violence services increased in 2016 to &euro;20.6m and is being further increased in 2017 arising from the provision of increased overall funding of &euro;37m to Tusla.  The precise level of increase in funding to the domestic and sexual violence sector will be set out by Tusla in its 2017 Business Plan, which is expected to be completed later this month.</p></reply>

The statutory basis and functions of the Authority are derived from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 which amended the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</p><p>The Authority has powers to:</p><p>-  Hold the Garda&iacute; to account, with senior Garda management reporting to the Authority, including via public meetings;</p><p>-  Determine Garda priorities in relation to policing services;</p><p>-  Nominate persons for appointment by the Government to the posts of Garda Commissioner and Deputy Garda Commissioner;</p><p>-  Appoint persons to the ranks of Garda Superintendent, Chief Superintendent and Assistant Commissioner (and remove them for reasons related to policing services);</p><p>-  Appoint persons to senior positions within the Garda civilian staff.</p><p>Since its inception, the Policing Authority has been focussing, as a matter of priority, on its functions which have statutory deadlines and reform significance.  I am aware that the Policing Authority has met on several occasions with the Commissioner and her senior team, as a follow up on its consideration of the O&rsquo;Higgins Report and related matters . A number of these meetings have been held in public to reassure the community about the performance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Areas that have been highlighted in the discussions include:</p><p>-  Implementation of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;</p><p>-  Review of the Garda Protected Disclosure policy;</p><p>-  Plans to conduct a culture audit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;</p><p>-  Corporate governance arrangements and management structures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and</p><p>-  Arrangements for training and the professional development of members.</p><p>In addition, the Authority has approved a three-year Strategy for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It has also determined the policing priorities for 2017 which will inform the content of the 2017 Policing Plan to be published before the end of the year.  It has reviewed and issued recommendations on the Garda Protected Disclosure policy and will also establish a Code of Ethics that includes standards of conduct and practice for Garda members.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that Section 62(O)(2) of the  Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  Act 2005, as amended, requires the Policing Authority, within two years from its establishment, to submit to the Minister a report on the effectiveness of the Authority and the adequacy of the functions assigned to it.  In addition, under Section 61(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015, the Minister must, in consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, not later than five years after the establishment of the Authority, review the operation of the legislation.</p><p>The sections of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 which remain to be commenced contain provisions concerning the Policing Authority's functions in relation to appointment and removal of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The commencement of these sections is dependent on the regulations governing promotion and discipline in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being amended to reflect the envisaged role for the Authority.  My intention is to bring the Regulations to Government for approval next week and that the Authority will take over the appointment function by 1 January 2017.  Once this is done it will be a matter for the Authority to undertake its own selection competitions for appointments to these ranks.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

In essence, Judge O&rsquo;Neill was asked to review allegations of wrongdoing contained in the disclosures; to make whatever inquiries he considered appropriate in relation to the review and to report on the conclusion of his review, including any recommendations which he considered necessary in relation to any further action which may be appropriate and warranted to address the allegations.</p>  <p>  Judge O'Neill was initially due to report by 23 November.  However, he subsequently sought two short extensions, which I granted.  He delivered his report on 7 December 2016. </p>  <p>  The report sets out in detail the allegations contained in the protected disclosures and his recommendations.  The House will appreciate, notwithstanding receipt of the Report of Mr Justice O'Neill, that we are still dealing with protected disclosures and as such I must be very careful in relation to the identity of the persons who made those disclosures.  This fact, and the fact that the report specifies the nature of the allegations and refers to third parties, means that I must be very careful to respect the rights of those who made the disclosures and of those third parties.  Having read the Report, I have sought the advice of the Attorney General on how to proceed in relation to it, including the question of what material might be put in the public domain about it.  When that advice is received, I will bring forward proposals to Government on the next steps.</p>  <p>  I will not be in a position to make any decisions about the report until I have received the advice of the Attorney General and, accordingly, no decisions have been taken yet in relation to what actions might be taken arising from it.  It may be helpful to inform the Deputy that I did receive requests to extend Mr Justice O'Neill's review to cover the cases of other persons who had been involved in making protected disclosures.  I indicated that Mr. Justice O'Neill had been asked to look at two very specific disclosures and the review was not intended to look at general issues relating to whistleblowers.  In the circumstances, the question of including those cases in the review did not arise.

The Bill, as proposed, will update all existing laws on the regulation of gambling, including betting and gaming but excluding the National Lottery. </p>  <p>  The new legislation will have consumer protection generally as one of its core principles, and it is envisaged that it will include several measures aimed at assisting and protecting vulnerable persons, including young persons.</p>  <p>  It will include prohibitions on the employment of young persons, they will not be permitted to participate in gambling and there will be arrangements for age verification checks by licence holders.  It is envisaged that the regulatory body proposed in the legislation will include a dedicated inspectorate whose main task will be to monitor compliance by licence holders with the terms of their licence and with the new legislation generally.</p>  <p>  It is intended to proceed with this legislation at the earliest feasible opportunity. In support of these efforts, the Government has delegated the powers of the Minister for Justice and Equality under the gaming and lotteries legislation to me as Minister of State.  I have requested departmental officials to commission a review of the Scheme published in 2013 by way of taking account of intervening developments and technologies in the gaming sector.  This review will help to update policy in this area.  The review process is ongoing and scheduled for completion by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  Pending the bringing forward of the main Bill, which is a major undertaking, my Department is examining whether there are any individual pressing areas of concern, intended to be dealt with in the Bill, which could be dealt with sooner in the new year by separate legislative measures and this is being actively considered.  This will be augmented by the completion of the more complex work on the main Bill for Government approval and publication later during 2017.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with the overall policing arrangements and operational strategies are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of resources and the best possible policing service is provided to the general public.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates. I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the </p><p>Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. </p><p>I am further informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. I expect that the Traffic Corps, like all Garda Divisions and policing activities will benefit from this accelerated recruitment which is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This investment will support the delivery of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 which sets key strategic objectives for Roads Policing and will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s road policing plans over the next 5 years. </p><p>Insofar as road traffic enforcement is concerned generally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Roads Policing Operations Plan 2016 incorporates a programme of high visibility road safety and enforcement operations, carried out in partnership with other state agencies, and is being implemented by each Regional Traffic Superintendent. The focus of the Plan is on the most vulnerable road user categories of motor cyclists, pedal cyclists, pedestrians and learner permit holders.  Garda operations specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions, including speeding, driving while intoxicated, and use of a mobile phone.</p><p>Road traffic legislation is also enforced as part of the day to day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both targeted and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b><b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

In regard to sentencing, the approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in law a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient. </p><p>The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Committee website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  This system is being developed as a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned with the needs of victims and their families, and I very much support the initiative led by the judiciary through the Judicial Research Office in undertaking the detailed work of gathering and providing information on sentencing via the website.</p><p>The report of the Working Group on the Strategic Review of Penal Policy, published in July 2014, considered the issue of developing sentencing guidelines.  However, the majority of the Review Group took the view that the primary role of developing sentencing guidelines is the responsibility of the judiciary and does not lie in bringing forward detailed statutory based guidelines.  It might also be noted that a Sentencing Council was not advocated by the Law Reform Commission in its Report on Mandatory Sentencing which was published in June 2013.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that in 2014, the Court of Criminal Appeal issued a number of judgments which addressed the question of sentencing and which acknowledged the many factors that can be considered in individual cases which undermine the usefulness of direct comparisons between one case and another.  Nonetheless, every effort to promote consistency should be made and in this respect it is appropriate for the courts to provide guidance on sentencing matters. </p><p>A Judicial Council Bill is included in the current legislative programme which provides for a range of matters including matters relating to developing schemes for judicial education and training.  It is also envisaged that the Bill will contain mechanisms designed to assist in the collation and dissemination of sentencing information<font color="#0000FF">.  </font>Easy accessibility to such information would clearly be of benefit to courts when it comes to achieving consistency in imposing sentences.  </p></reply>

This includes responsibility for the formulation of proposals in relation to the opening and closing of Garda Stations, taking into account crime trends and policing priorities, so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.  Indeed, this was the basis on which the Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme 2012-2013 was developed and implemented.  The specific information requested by the Deputy is set out in the table attached.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Government, in its Programme for a Partnership Government, identified community policing as the embodiment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Community policing provides a means of recognising that every community, both urban and rural, has its own concerns and expectations.  The Programme commits the Government to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing in every community, including the most minimal response times possible. In accordance with the Programme commitment, I have requested the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions in relation to the distribution of Garda resources in the State, to identify 6 stations for reopening on a pilot basis. This pilot scheme is intended to feed into the wider review being overseen by the Policing Authority.</p><p>In that context, I have asked the Policing Authority to oversee a review of, among other things, the dispersal of Garda stations in rural areas.  I understand that the Authority has, in accordance with section 117(2) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, formally requested the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to examine the dispersal and use of resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities and to make recommendations to provide a more effective, visible and responsive policing service. The Authority has informed the Inspectorate that the review should take account of:</p><p>- the changing environments in rural, developing urban and suburban areas;</p><p>- the views of local communities;</p><p>- the allocation to and deployment of Garda resources at the local policing level, including the use of the Garda Reserve, Garda facilities and Garda equipment; and</p><p>- relevant recommendations made in previous Inspectorate reports.<table><tr><th colspan="3"> Stations in Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan and Donegal that were closed under the Rationalisation Programme 2012 - 2013</th></tr><tr><td>Year Closed</td><td>Division</td><td>Station</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>Sligo / Leitrim</td><td>Bunnanadden</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>Sligo / Leitrim</td><td>Drumkerrin</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>Sligo / Leitrim</td><td>Kiltyclogher</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>Cavan / Monaghan</td><td>Tullyvin</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>Donegal</td><td>An Duchoraidh</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>Donegal</td><td>Culdaff</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>Donegal</td><td>Dunkineely</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Sligo / Leitrim</td><td>Aclare</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Sligo / Leitrim</td><td>Ballyfarnon</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Sligo / Leitrim</td><td>Cliffoney</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Sligo / Leitrim</td><td>Cloone</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Sligo / Leitrim</td><td>Dromahair</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Sligo / Leitrim</td><td>Dromod</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Sligo / Leitrim</td><td>Easkey</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Sligo / Leitrim</td><td>Glenfarne</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Sligo / Leitrim</td><td>Keshcarrigan</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Cavan / Monaghan</td><td>Bawnboy</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Cavan / Monaghan</td><td>Redhills</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Cavan / Monaghan</td><td>Shantonagh</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Cavan / Monaghan</td><td>Stradone</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Donegal</td><td>Annagaire</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Donegal</td><td>Gleann Cholm Cille</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Donegal</td><td>Malin</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Donegal</td><td>Min an L&aacute;bain</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Donegal</td><td>Na Brocacha<br /><br /></td></tr></table></p></reply>

There are currently just over 460 persons in that position.   </p>  <p>  Statistical analysis shows that just over 220 persons moved out of State provided accommodation in November.  RIA make an offer of accommodation to persons within the protection process and it is entirely their decision whether they avail of it.  Similarly, given its voluntary nature, protection applicants can choose to move out of State provided accommodation while still in the protection process if they so wish.  For this reason, the numbers of persons leaving State provided accommodation in November will include persons who are moving out because they have received some form of status as well as persons who are exercising their right to leave the voluntary system of State provided accommodation because they have decided to live elsewhere.</p>  <p>  The number of persons with some form of status residing in State provided accommodation changes on an almost daily basis as people transition into accommodation in the community and people within the system receive a form of status.  </p>  <p>  There are measures in place to assist persons with status to transition to accommodation in the community including the 'Guide to independent living' which was developed by my Department with a view to providing such persons with practical assistance to help them move on with their lives.

The main reason Ireland did not opt-in to this Directive was the provisions relating to the right to work for asylum seekers.  The Directive provides for asylum seekers to be given access to the labour market if a decision at first instance has not been taken within one year of the making of an application for asylum, which is contrary to national law.  Section 9(4)(b) of the Refugee Act 1996, provides that applicants for international protection shall not seek or enter employment or carry on any business, trade or profession during the period before the final determination of their application.  This legislation is being replaced by the International Protection Act 2015, which is expected to be commenced on 31 December, 2016.  There has been no change in the policy in this respect in the new Act. </p>  <p>  There is an effective visa and immigration system in place for those who wish to lawfully migrate to the State for employment purposes.  The key concern in this regard is that both the asylum process and the wider immigration system would be undermined by giving people who secure entry to the State, on foot of claims to asylum yet to be determined, the same access to employment as legal immigrants who follow the lawful route to employment. </p>  <p>  The McMahon Working Group considered this matter in detail and did not recommend a right to work as a remedy to the experiences of people remaining for long periods in a cumbersome and sequential applications process.  The Report instead sought to tackle the causes of delay.  The International Protection Act 2015 provides for the introduction of a single application procedure for international protection, which is specifically aimed at addressing the length of time persons spend in the protection process.  The new procedure will streamline and speed up the processing of protection applications, allowing all relevant matters to be submitted at the time of application for consideration.  This will significantly reduce the length of time that persons spend awaiting a decision on their protection application.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-16a.194.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016121600070#WRC04500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 76 together.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter. Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. </p><p>I am further informed that the Garda strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Region South (DMR South) and Dublin Metropolitan Region South Central Divisions, on the 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 541 and 620 respectively. There are also 31 Garda Reserves and 34 civilians attached to the DMR South Division and 48 Garda Reserves and 28 civilians attached to the DMR South Central Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organise Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide including  52 and 63 to the D.M.R. South and D.M.R. South Central Divisions respectively. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that another 900 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest in 2017 which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,500 mark by year end. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the D.M.R. South and D.M.R. South Central Divisions, in the coming years.</p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p><p>The following table gives a breakdown of the detailed information requested in relation to the number of Garda stations and number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the  D.M.R. South Central and D.M.R. South Divisions on 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available:</p><p>D.M.R.

I am informed that more up to date data is not currently available however I will write further to the Deputy in this regard. </p><p>The Policing Plan of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na sets out the continued commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to pro-actively target groups and individuals engaged in organised crime activity including drug crime.  In this regard the National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau continues to lead out the policing strategy for tackling drugs by demand reduction and supply reduction strategies.  The Bureau continues its policy of working with Divisional Drug Units nationwide in tackling supply reduction at local level.</p><p>Furthermore multi-disciplinary approaches are utilised to ensure that those involved are effectively targeted including through the use of the Proceeds of Crime legislation, money laundering legislation and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  This integrated approach adopts best practice in implementing a co-ordinated use of Garda resources and in utilising available criminal law to its fullest extent in tackling all forms of organised crime, including drug trafficking.  </p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has in place a number of strategic partnerships both nationally and internationally including with the Irish Customs Service, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the Irish Naval Service, Europol, Interpol and the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre Narcotics based in Lisbon. </p><p>Finally as you may be aware, the overall response to the problem of drug misuse is set out in the National Drugs Strategy for the period 2009-2016.  The Strategy, for which Government responsibility falls under the remit of my colleague Minister of State Catherine Byrne T.D., at the Department of Health, provides a co-ordinated and comprehensive response to the issue and is very much founded on a partnership approach. </p><p>The Department of Health is currently leading the development of a new Strategy for the period after 2016 so as to continue to address the complex problem of substance misuse in a comprehensive and integrated manner and work is well advanced in this regard.</p><p><b>Table 1- Garda Seizures of diamorphine (heroin) Cork City, Cork North and Cork West Garda Divisions 2014 to 2015 end Q3 - 30 September 2015 *</b><table><tr><th><b>Year</b></th><th><b>Grams</b></th><th><b>Value</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>2014  </b></td><td>937.6</td><td>&euro;140,642</td></tr><tr><td><b>2015 (end Q 3)</b></td><td>1205.7</td><td>&euro;180,852</td></tr></table><i>* The statistics provided are based on operational data and are provisional and subject to change.

A person is liable to a fine of up to &euro;3,000 or 6 months in prison, or both for selling or supplying a &lsquo;mechanically propelled vehicles&rsquo; to a minor.  Mini-motorised motorcycles and quad bikes also come within this definition. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that these vehicles, when used in a public place, must comply with the Road Traffic Acts, including in relation to motor tax, insurance and possession of a valid driver licence or learner permit.  Under the Road Traffic Acts, any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may stop a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place and demand production of a driver licence or learner permit. In addition, Garda&iacute; may inspect the vehicle for compliance with vehicle standards legislation, which makes it an offence to drive without reasonable consideration, drive carelessly, or drive dangerously.  The Garda authorities also have powers of seizure, detention, storage and disposal of vehicles under road traffic legislation. </p>  <p>  I also understand that the use of quad bikes and scramblers in public parks and open spaces may be prohibited under local authority bye-laws. </p>  <p>  The joint statement highlights that tragically mishaps on these vehicles have resulted in the deaths of children in the UK and Ireland over recent years.  I strongly support this campaign and reiterate that road safety is a shared responsibility.  As with the 2016 Christmas &amp;amp; New Year Anti Drink Driving Campaign it is necessary to stop and consider the impact of our decisions on others and it is my sincerest hope that this campaign will help achieve this.</p></reply>

While I am, of course, aware of some of the estimates put forward by the NGO community, it is not possible to have any precision around the number of illegal immigrants in the State.  This is compounded by the fact that persons under 16 years of age are not, in any event, required to have their presence in the State registered with the authorities.  Estimating the remaining cohort, namely those of 16 to 18 years of age, suffers from the same difficulty as establishing a figure for the number of illegal immigrants generally.</p></reply>

I am advised that all incidences of assault and public disorder, including the sort of incidents referred to, which come to Garda attention are thoroughly investigated, whether in the greater Dublin area or elsewhere.</p><p>The allocation of Garda resources and the prioritising of policing matters is a matter for local Garda management who are best placed to respond to localised public disorder, street violence and anti-social behaviour.  Garda&iacute; engage closely with local communities, including Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert groups, and in more formal structures such as Joint Policing Committees. This engagement facilitates the expression of community concerns in relation to policing and public order issues and helps Garda&iacute; to respond appropriately.  In this regard there is a wide range of legislation available which may be utilised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to address incidents of anti-social behaviour and related criminal acts.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>There are also particular interventions which can be taken in relation to young persons who may have become involved, or be at risk of becoming involved, in crime. My Department has responsibility for the Community Programmes Unit of the Irish Youth Justice Service which manages the Garda Youth Diversion Project Network nationwide. There are 106 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) in place nationwide. GYDPs are community based multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which primarily seek to divert young people who have become involved in crime/anti-social behaviour. In 2016, approximately &euro;12m was allocated by the Irish Youth Justice Service to GYDPs and a number of other youth diversion community based projects around the country.  The evidence indicates that Diversion Projects are a sound investment. The GYDPs tackle behaviours such as impulsiveness which is associated with the bulk of youth crime; for example, public order offending and minor theft. The GYDPs have a critical role to play in reducing youth crime.  Their role is to prevent or 'divert' young people from the onset of repeat or serious offending, including potential future involvement in gangland crime, and they do this very effectively and efficiently.  An overview of youth crime can be found in the Annual Reports of the Committee Appointed to Monitor the Effectiveness of the Diversion Programme.</p><p>The Garda Youth Diversion programme continues to make significant inroads in targeting supports to young people in effectively diverting them towards more positive life choices.</p><p>In conclusion, I might add that the Government is making very significant investments in policing resources, including the expansion of the Garda fleet and the upgrading of Garda technology and IT systems. These investments are underpinned by the commitment to increase Garda numbers to 15,000 overall, and all of these measures will undoubtedly enhance the Garda response to the issue referred to and benefit policing services generally in all areas of the country.</p></reply>

In particular I might mention the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act,<b></b>2015, which I introduced as part of a comprehensive strategy targeting burglary and related property crime. This legislation is targeted at those repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary. The Act requires the District Court to provide for consecutive jail sentences where a burglar is being sentenced for multiple offences. It will also allow Courts to refuse bail for offenders who have a previous conviction for domestic burglary coupled with two or more pending charges.  </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Bail (Amendment) Bill 2016 was published on 8 December 2016.  This Bill will strengthen the operation of the bail system with the aim of making the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against crimes committed by persons on bail. The Bill will meet the commitment in the Programme for Government to introduce and fast-track legislation providing for stricter bail terms for repeat serious offenders which will strengthen Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail, increase the use of curfews, and introduce electronic tagging for those on bail where requested by Garda&iacute;. </p><p>The new Bill will place clear new requirements on the courts in considering bail applications, including requiring the court to have regard to persistent serious offending by an applicant for bail and the nature and seriousness of any danger presented by the grant of bail to a person charged with an offence with a penalty of 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment of more. </p><p>The Bill will also introduce some important reforms to the law, such as:</p><p>- Providing that courts must give reasons for bail decisions.</p><p>- Providing the Garda&iacute; with new powers of arrest without warrant for breach of bail conditions, where it is necessary to arrest the person immediately to prevent absconding or to prevent harm, interference or intimidation to the victim or a witness to the offence.</p><p>- Giving the courts the power to prohibit an accused person from driving, where the person has been charged with a serious road traffic offence and the court considers this necessary to prevent the commission of a serious road traffic offence. </p><p>- Providing for the imposition of curfews as a condition of bail. </p><p>In addition, there will be provision for a court, in certain cases, to hear evidence from the victim of an offence before a decision on bail is taken.</p></reply>

There are 106 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) in place nationwide. GYDPs are community based multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which primarily seek to divert young people who have become involved in crime/anti-social behaviour. In 2016, approximately &euro;12m was allocated by the Irish Youth Justice Service to GYDPs and a number of other youth diversion community based projects around the country.  The evidence indicates that Diversion Projects are a sound investment. The GYDPs tackle behaviours such as impulsiveness which is associated with the bulk of youth crime; for example, public order offending and minor theft. The GYDPs have a critical role to play in reducing youth crime.  Their role is to prevent or 'divert' young people from the onset of repeat or serious offending, including potential future involvement in gangland crime, and they do this very effectively and efficiently.  An overview of youth crime can be found in the Annual Reports of the Committee Appointed to Monitor the Effectiveness of the Diversion Programme.</p>  <p>  The Garda Youth Diversion programme continues to make significant inroads in targeting supports to young people in effectively diverting them towards more positive life choices.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the very significant measures which have been introduced in response to the appalling gang-related violence over the past year or so. These measures include the provision of significant additional resources to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, strengthened legislative measures targeting the proceeds of crime, the establishment of a new Garda Special Crime Task Force in Dublin and the establishment of a dedicated Garda Armed Support Unit in Dublin which is now fully operational on a round-the-clock basis.  </p>  <p>  We are already seeing significant results being achieved on foot of these measures which are coordinated under Operation Hybrid. As of 6 December 2016, there have been 44 arrests in relation to gang-related killings in Dublin, with 5 persons charged in connection with those murders and a further 3 persons charged with related offences.  In addition, 22 firearms have been seized and over 8,000 lines of enquiry conducted. In excess of 11,520 high visibility checkpoints have been implemented with significant support from Armed Support Units and a significant amount of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic, and forensic evidence is also being examined.  Operation Hybrid is reviewed on a weekly basis to maintain optimal impact.</p>  <p>  All of these measures are underpinned by the commitment to increase Garda numbers to 15,000 overall, and will undoubtedly enhance the Garda response to the matters referred and benefit policing services in all areas of the country. </p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. </p>  <p>  I am further informed that the Garda strength of the Kildare Garda Division, on the 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 307.  There are also 22 Garda Reserves and 29 civilians attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organise Crime Bureau. I am advised that Local Garda management in Kildare have also implemented additional policing measures in response to recent incidents in the Division, including additional Garda foot patrols, checkpoints and patrols by the Regional Support Unit. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing throughout the country in order to strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and prevent crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. </p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, including 35 to the Kildare Division. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that another 900 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest in 2017 which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,500 mark by year end. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including Kildare in the coming years.</p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p></reply>

In 2016 alone, some 520 vehicles have been deployed in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with approximately 200 additional vehicles on order. Next year, there will be funding of some &euro;4 million available to further modernise the fleet.</p>  <p>  This investment will continue to provide the Garda&iacute; with additional high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, and motorcycles to ensure that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.  I am advised by the Garda authorities there are no plans at present to introduce mopeds or quad-bikes to the fleet of vehicles available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p>  <p>  In addition, some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime and to facilitate progress on important reforms arising from the Garda Inspectorate's report on Crime Investigation.  Examples of the new systems to be developed through this investment include:</p>  <p>  -&middot;new computer-aided dispatch to ensure responsive and coordinated deployment of Garda&iacute; in the community;</p>  <p>  - mobile technology to give the Garda&iacute; secure mobile access to critical information when and where they need it;</p>  <p>  - investigations management systems to ensure enhanced management of crime investigations; and</p>  <p>  - upgrading the Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) to enhance policing of road safety and compliance.</p>  <p>  ANPR is an internationally recognised tool that was introduced into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2008 and is fitted in official Garda vehicles which are allocated in all Garda Divisions and Districts nationwide. ANPR works on the basis of an in-car camera, reading vehicle number plates using optical character recognition technology, which checks each vehicle registration number plate against PULSE to identify, for example, stolen or untaxed vehicles. It also includes a speed detection and video recording capability and is utilised for both roads policing and as an investigative and intelligence tool. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, a considerable amount of new Garda ICT solutions has been delivered over the past number of years.  These include the deployment of a secure national digital radio system (NDRS), the deployment and support of Garda and Community CCTV systems and the addition of many new functions to the PULSE system, which itself is further supported by a dedicated data entry service in Castlebar.  </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s overarching commitment is to ensure a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  In furtherance of this, the Government has approved my proposal for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel to be achieved by 2021, comprising 15,000 Garda members, 4,000 civilians and 2,000 Reserve members. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide-ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The Programme is intended to professionalise, modernise and renew An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that the organisation can meet present and future challenges.</p></reply>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has a particularly close working relationship with the Police Service of Northern Ireland in respect of policing, preventing and detecting the sale, supply, importation and distribution of drugs on the island of Ireland.  </p>  <p>  I am further advised by the Garda authorities that in addition to the considerable volume of drugs which has been seized to date in 2016, that significant successes continue to be made in the disruption of organised crime groups through the arrest and prosecution of persons involved in the illegal drugs trade in this State. </p>  <p>  Finally, further detailed information with regard to drug seizures made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is available in the Annual Reports of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which can be accessed at www.garda.ie. In addition, data on the number of controlled drug offences and their disposal is provided in the Central Statistics Office's published crime statistics (www.cso.ie) and the Annual Reports of the Courts Service (www.courts.ie).</p></reply>

I am informed by the Commissioner that in the period 1 January 2015 to 25 November 2016, 275 Garda were promoted to the rank of Garda Sergeant and 102 Sergeants were promoted to the rank of Inspector. These appointments were made in accordance with the statutory framework as set out in the 2005 Act and related regulations.  In particular, the appointees were drawn in order of merit from promotion panels formed on foot of competitions held by the Commissioner in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Promotion) Regulations 2006.  I understand that these promotion panels are now exhausted and that the Commissioner intends to announce new competitions for promotion to the rank of Sergeant and Inspector shortly. </p><p>In relation to the senior ranks, at the request of the Garda Commissioner, the Government has made 43 appointments to these ranks this year as follows: 5 to the rank of Assistant Commissioner, 13 to the rank of Chief Superintendent and 25 to the rank of Superintendent. These appointments were to fill vacancies that had arisen and were within the agreed strength of the Employment Control Framework (ECF).  As matters stand the senior ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have their full complement and I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that no further vacancies are anticipated within the ECF this year.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 contemplates the Policing Authority assuming the function of selecting and appointing persons to the senior ranks. I am absolutely committed to the Authority assuming this function and intend to bring the necessary Regulations to Government for approval next week with a view to the Authority taking on the function on 1 January 2017.  Once this is done, it will be a matter for the Authority to undertake its own selection competitions for appointments to these ranks. The establishment of the Authority represents one of the most significant and progressive reforms to the justice sector over recent years and the transfer of the appointment function is a particularly important signal of this reform.</p><p>Information in relation to the number of civilian promotions within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the period in question and the number of vacancies at the rank of Sergeant, Inspector and the civilian promotional grades has been requested from the Garda Commissioner and I will forward this information directly to the Deputy when it is to hand.  <b></b></p></reply>

Our deepest sympathies are with the families who were bereaved by this atrocity.  They, like the families of so many others killed over course of the troubles in unjustified and callous acts, bear the pain of loss to this day.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the bombing at Belturbet and the two deaths caused by it were the subject of a thorough Garda investigation at the time.  Expertise was provided by the Defence Forces.  The investigations at that time involved close liaison with the authorities in Northern Ireland. However, although every avenue of inquiry open to the investigation was pursued it was not possible to uncover evidence to sustain a prosecution for this crime.  It remains a source of deep disappointment that no one has been brought to justice for these murders.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that the investigation into these murders remains open.  Regrettably it is the case that with the passage of over 40 years and in the absence of any new evidence emerging, one must be realistic about the prospects of successful prosecutions.  Nonetheless, the Garda Authorities will pursue fully any new information or evidence that may be made available and would work with the PSNI to seek to progress the investigation in such circumstances.  Anyone who has any relevant information in respect of this atrocity should bring it to the attention of the Garda Authorities.</p></reply>

In circumstances where there is such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting &ldquo;transferability&rdquo; is very largely obviated.  This efficiency in the Garda vetting systems has been achieved by the deployment of the e-Vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations.  The e-Vetting system is available to all registered organisations and the Garda Authorities are ready to assist those organisations who are not yet using the e-Vetting system to do so.</p>  <p>  The primary purpose of the Garda National Vetting Bureau is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.  Vetting checks are conducted by the Garda vetting bureau for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.  This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Vetting Disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the Data Protection Acts, any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date.  Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process. </p>  <p>  There are certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.  Section 12(3)(A) of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that two or more relevant organisations can enter into a joint written agreement in relation to the employment, contracting, permitting or placement of an person to undertake relevant work or activities thereby providing for only one of the organisations being required to conduct vetting in respect of that person.</p></reply>

Following this review, in Budget 2017 I announced my intention to introduce a new, SME-focused, share-based incentive scheme in Budget 2018.  Such an incentive will require the approval of the European Commission and my officials will commence engagement with the Commission to ensure that the incentive will comply with State Aid rules in advance of the next Budget.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also committed to introduce a PRSI scheme for the self-employed, and in Budget 2017 the Government announced the extension of access to Invalidity Pensions to the self-employed. Invalidity Pension is a pension payment for people who cannot work because of a long-term illness or disability.  When someone develops a long-term illness it can cause serious financial repercussions. Gaining access to Invalidity Pension will provide the self-employed with a much stronger safety net to protect them in the event of injury or disablement.  The self-employed will gain access to Invalidity Pension on the same basis as employees from December 2017.</p>  <p>  Also announced in Budget 2017, is the extension of Treatment Benefits to the self-employed on the same basis as employees.  The Treatment Benefit Scheme provides partial dental, optical and aural services to those who have made the required contributions.  This extension will come into effect from March 2017.  Treatment Benefit entitlements will be extended further from October 2017, providing additional dental and optical benefits.</p>  <p>  In addition, jobseekers taking up self-employment will be able to access the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance after 9 months, down from 12 months. Minister Varadkar, the Minister for Social Protection, can provide further information in respect of the above initiatives if required.</p>  <p>  Further to a commitment in the Programme for Government, my Department published, in July this year, an Income Tax Reform Plan containing a detailed overview of various policy considerations relevant to this reform, including the necessity to maintain the breadth of our income tax base and retain appropriate levels of taxation for high earners. The taxation of the self-employed is considered in some detail in this Income Tax Reform Plan, and the issues outlined therein will be borne in mind when considering future reform of the income tax system as it relates to the self-employed.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the plan was to inform all members of the Oireachtas of the issues and options which will underpin future income tax reform, and it is my hope that all members of the Oireachtas will engage constructively in debating options for future reform in this area. In this regard the scope for change will be dependent on the level of available fiscal resources.</p></reply>

In addition the opening of the new European Investment Bank (EIB) office in Dublin on 12 December will also help steer future EIB investment activity in Ireland, including for SMEs.</p></reply>

I have already introduced a number of actions and measures in response to this challenge.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department incorporated the potential impact of Brexit into the macroeconomic forecasts that underpinned Budget 2017. My Department also published an in-depth sectoral analysis of the Irish economy and highlighted those with the greatest trade exposure to the UK. As part of this work, regional issues were also highlighted, particularly with respect to the location of employment and enterprise. In light of my Department's sectoral and regional findings I announced a number of measures in the Budget, with a view to getting Ireland "Brexit ready". The detail of these sectoral measures include;</p>  <p>-  The retention of the 9 percent VAT rate to assist the hospitality sector.</p>  <p>-  A reduced Capital Gains Tax relief to help entrepreneurs and bring the relief more in line with that in operation in the UK.</p>  <p>-  An extension of the Foreign Earnings Deduction (FED) until the end of 2020, in order to assist with the diversification of trade into non-traditional export markets for Irish goods and services. </p>  <p>-  The Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP) is also extended until the end of 2020. The extension will provide certainty for foreign direct investment in Ireland, following on from the UK vote to leave the EU. </p>  <p>-  The introduction of an income averaging "step-out" in the agriculture sector, to help with the volatility Brexit may bring. In addition to this a &euro;150 million loan fund will be provided jointly by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and EU Exceptional Adjustment Aid to enable farmers to better manage their cash flow and reduce the cost of borrowing. </p>  <p>-  At a macroeconomic level, Budget 2017 sought to build up Ireland's buffers to any fallout from Brexit. This involved setting a new domestic target of a debt to GDP ratio of 45 percent to be reached by the mid-2020s, or thereafter, depending on economic growth, as well as the establishment of a rainy day. </p>  <p>-  The measures introduced in Budget 2017 are just the start of a process of getting Ireland Brexit ready. More measures will be implemented as the EU-UK negotiations develop after Article 50 is invoked. As with Budget 2017, these measures will have a regional dimension where appropriate. Indeed, as a key priority in the Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government will shortly publish a new Action Plan for Rural Ireland. The Action Plan will be a whole of Government approach to the challenges facing regional and local communities, including those presented by Brexit.</p></reply>

Financial services is an area that is frequently identified in any discussion of Brexit.  Ireland has a successful track record of competing for, and winning, global foreign direct investment. One of the key pillars of that success is the growth of the International Financial Services (IFS) sector, in particular over the past 30 years. Ireland is now recognised internationally as a leading global centre for internationally traded financial services.</p>  <p>  In March 2015, the Government launched the lFS2020 Strategy, a whole-of-government approach to further driving the growth and development of the IFS sector in Ireland. The decision in May of this year by An Taoiseach to appoint a dedicated Minister of State with specific responsibility for financial services sends a clear and strong signal of the Government's long-established commitment to the further growth and ongoing development of the IFS industry.  Implementation of the IFS2020 Strategy and the annual Action Plans is driven by a public sector High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC). The HLIC, meeting on a quarterly basis, is chaired by Minister of State for Financial Services Eoghan Murphy TD. Minister of State Murphy also chairs quarterly meetings of the IFS2020 Joint Committee, comprising of members of the public sector HLIC and senior IFS industry representatives. Brexit is now a standing agenda item at these quarterly meetings. Furthermore, a cross-governmental financial services group (including the agencies) is also chaired by my Department and all this joined up work ultimately feeds into the Cabinet Committee on Brexit.</p>  <p>  Ireland is in a strong position to build on its successful track record and to compete for future mobile investments in the IFS sector. In a post UK EU referendum environment, the Government will continue to implement the IFS2020 Strategy to drive growth in the IFS sector.  The Government will continue to promote the attractiveness of Ireland as a location of choice for mobile international investment and for talented people.  The IFS2020 Strategy combines long-term strategic thinking with the flexible tools to react to any domestic and international developments occurring over the period. There will be opportunities for Ireland arising from the UK's decision to leave the EU. The Government is keen to maximise those opportunities where possible.  The IFS2020 Strategy, the long-term vision for international financial services, was developed and put in place long before the UK decision to leave the EU.  However, it provides a clear framework to maximise any opportunities that might arise from that decision particularly through the annual Action Plans. The annual Action Plans enable a tailored response to deal with these challenges and opportunities as they arise. The IFS2020 Action Plan for 2017 was considered by the Joint Committee in December and will be published in very early 2017, following final consultations with all key public and private sector stakeholders and noting by the Government.</p>  <p>  The Governor of the Central Bank has previously indicated that where further resources are necessary due to an expanded universe of regulated and supervised firms, the Bank has the ability to effectively re-prioritise where it needs to meet the increased level of demand and also to increase staff numbers as necessary. </p>  <p>  As part of the promotion of Ireland as a location for financial services, a key IFS2020 milestone is the hosting of the second annual European Financial Forum in Dublin Castle on 24th January 2017. Given the result of the UK referendum and the potential implications for the financial services industry, the Forum is an opportune time to bring more than 600 financial services executives and policy makers from around the world to Dublin.  The themes of EFF 2017 will focus on the challenges and opportunities for the European financial system as both a source and a provider of capital.  The keynotes and panel sessions will have a focus on Europe relative to the North American and Asian financial systems.  </p>  <p>  Over the last number of months, Minister of State Murphy has undertaken two significant visits to Asia and North America, as well as IFS engagements in London. The main purpose of these visits was to promote Ireland as a destination for financial services investment and to launch the IFS Ireland brand in the Asian and North American markets. Minister of State Murphy will continue to promote Ireland overseas as the perfect European location for financial services investment as the IFS2020 Strategy moves into 2017, including during upcoming visits to Beijing and Hong Kong in January 2017.</p>  <p>  There is also a IFS2020 Communications sub-group consisting of relevant departments and agencies who develop and promote plans and messaging on Ireland as a location for financial services.  This Comms sub-group will work both with private and public stakeholders to ensure that there is consistent messaging. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, Budget 2017 is the latest step to make Ireland "Brexit ready". The measures announced in Budget 2017 help protect Irish businesses from Brexit volatility, enable them to compete internationally, and make Ireland increasingly attractive for investment. Budget 2017 included a number of measures to respond to the challenges of Brexit, to mitigate future risks, and to maximise any opportunities that might arise. These include the reduced capital gains tax to help entrepreneurs, the Foreign Earnings Deduction (FED) extension and amendment, and the extension of the Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP). More information on these measures is available in the Budget documentation.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 also provides for additional funding for the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Enterprise Agencies to help them address the challenges and opportunities arising from Brexit. This will help support the enterprise agencies achieve their growth targets across all sectors of the economy, including the IFS2020 target to create 10,000 net new IFS jobs.</p>  <p>  Input from all public sector and industry stakeholders in relation to financial services will continue to form a key part of the Brexit contingency planning joined up process.</p></reply>

Brexit is likely to involve complex discussion on the Multiannual Financial Framework, particularly as the UK is an important net contributor to the EU Budget. Therefore, Brexit will have a significant impact on EU Budget funding and expenditure and may need to be mitigated by either increased contributions from other Member States, reductions in EU funding programmes, or a combination of both.</p>  <p>  While my Department has undertaken some broad modelling work to estimate the potential impact of Brexit on our EU budget calculations, this analysis will need to be developed in more detail in the coming period, when the parameters of the budget negotiations are better defined.

Portfolio sales are considered as part of normal supervisory engagement where they are sufficiently material.</p>  <p>  However, the Deputy will be aware that legislation and regulations have been implemented by the Oireachtas and Central Bank to protect SMEs when dealing with regulated and unregulated firms.</p>  <p>  The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 was enacted on 8 July 2015.  It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.

Rather, NAMA has an established initiative of identifying properties, owned by its debtors and receivers, which may be suitable for social housing requirements.  However, confirmation of demand and suitability is a matter for local authorities and is not something in which NAMA has a role.</p><p>I am advised that all relevant parties are committed to the maximum possible delivery of residential units under this important initiative.  Once demand for a property has been confirmed by a local authority, NAMA facilitates contact and negotiation between its debtor or receiver and the local authority or Approved Housing Body ( AHB ) to acquire the property.  Contractual arrangements can take the form of a lease or purchase. In general, purchases are completed by AHBs and the properties acquired are then made available to local authorities under a payment and availability agreement.  I am advised that, as of end-September 2016, NAMA had identified 6,893 residential properties as potentially suitable for social housing. Of these, demand has been confirmed by local authorities for over 2,700 properties, of which 2,291 have been delivered for social housing use.</p><p>A detailed county by county breakdown is available on the NAMA website: .</p><p>Though NAMA is consistently mindful of identifying properties which may be suitable for social housing, the Deputy will appreciate that the pool of such properties is reducing in line with its wider portfolio.</p></reply>

I have been informed by the Central Bank of Ireland that it does not publish a regular series of data on mortgages in negative equity.  Neither do officials in my own Department collect such data. The Central Bank's latest Household Credit Market Report, at www.centralbank.ie/publications/Documents/Household%20Credit%20Market%20Report%202016H2.pdf, presents the percentage of loans in negative equity split by default status (Table 7, HCMR H2 2016). These data are for 2015 and do not reflect changes to loan balances and house prices since December 2015.  The Central Bank estimates that 15 per cent of PDH loans and 26 per cent of BTL loans were in negative equity at end December 2015 of which 10 per cent of PDH and 14 per cent of BTL loans in negative equity were deemed to be performing.  This represents a decline of 5 per cent in respect of PDH loans and 9 per cent in respect of BTL loans in negative equity since December 2014.</p>  <p>  The numbers in negative equity have been reducing and this has important implications for the wider economy such as improving mobility amongst those affected, potential greater spend on home improvements and maintenance, and increased consumption via the wealth effect.</p></reply>

The IIF's objective is to provide long-term investors with a stable return from a combination of income yield as well as capital growth deriving from investments in a substantial portfolio of assets. </p>  <p>  The IIF has thus far completed three investments, including:</p>  <p>-  acquisition of a controlling stake in a portfolio of wind farms from Viridian Group in 2012. </p>  <p>-  acquisition, in 2013, of Towercom, Ireland's largest independent wireless telecoms infrastructure company. </p>  <p>-  the July 2015 acquisition of the concession contract to operate and maintain the Convention Centre Dublin with the investment also including a license to build and operate an approximately 330-bed hotel on a site adjacent to The Convention Centre.</p>  <p>  The IIF is actively working towards the completion of its next investment.  The IIF has continued to strengthen its investment team and now has two members permanently based in Dublin, who are supported by AMP Capital's European infrastructure business in London.</p>  <p>  Information on the economic impact of ISIF's investments, including employment, is published on a bi-annual basis.  Due to commercial sensitivities the ISIF does not report on economic impact at individual transaction level, but instead at the aggregate portfolio level.  Updated economic impact figures, which are available on the ISIF website, show that as at 30 June 2016, ISIF, through its investment activities, was supporting 18,984 jobs in the Irish economy.</p></reply>

Since the application of duty to the remote sector from 1st August 2015, licensed remote bookmakers are now liable for duty at 1% on the amount of a bet from customers in the State, and licensed remote betting intermediaries are now liable for duty of 15% on the commission charged to customers in the State.  The new regulatory regime has been in place since August 2015 and receipts for the first 10 months of this year from the remote sector have yielded &euro;22.6m.  </p>  <p>  During the Finance Bill committee stage debates in both the Da&iacute;l and the Seanad, my colleague, Minister of State, Eoghan Murphy TD, gave a commitment that betting duty would be examined as part of the Tax Strategy Group process in 2017.   </p></reply>

For example, it has asked the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to work with the Central Bank to set out options for Government in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending and to improve the degree of competition and consumer protection.  Also the Government considers that measures to encourage and promote a greater level of switching in the mortgage market would help boost the level of competition in the market for existing mortgages.  In particular, the Programme for Government considers that the development of a code of conduct for switching mortgage provider would be a useful and practical initiative which would have the potential to deliver savings to many existing mortgage holders.  As the Deputy will be aware, research carried out by the Central Bank last year indicated that a significant number of borrowers could make savings by switching mortgages.  Therefore, in order to promote the option of switching mortgages, I have also asked the Central Bank to consider and formulate a code in this area and in response the Central Bank has indicated that it has commenced a programme of research on this topic to inform its consideration of this matter.</p>  <p>  The Government is of the opinion that real competition among lenders is the best way to ensure that retail mortgage lending rates are reduced in a sustainable way for the market as a whole but without giving rise to potentially undesirable consequences for new mortgage lending.  This is a policy area that the Government will keep under active review in its ongoing engagement with mortgage lenders and in implementing the Programme for Government.  </p></reply>

Ireland is fully compliant with all international best practices in the areas of tax transparency and exchange of information.  We only have and want real substantive FDI, the kind that brings real jobs and investment into Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Oxfam report includes Ireland's 12.5% rate as one of the factors in calling Ireland a tax haven.  I strongly reject this characterisation of our tax rate.  Interestingly, the report also recognises the benefits of the 12.5% and does not seek for the rate to change, while it appears to ignore that beside the 12.5 % rate, Ireland applies a 25% rate on passive income and 33% on capital gains.  The 12.5% rate is fully in line with OECD and international best practice of having a low rate and applying it to a very wide tax base.  The 12.5% rate is only available on trading profits where there is substantial activity in Ireland. Ireland's corporate tax policies are designed to attract real and substantive operations to Ireland.  Ireland has not been and will never will be a brass-plate location.</p>  <p>  The Oxfam report also lists Ireland's tax incentives as being a feature of a tax haven.  This is simply incorrect. Ireland has a very limited number of targeted tax incentives that are fully in line with agreed international best practice.  The Knowledge Development Box, which is singled out in the report, was the first such measure in the world to be deemed fully compliant with OECD rules by the Forum on Harmful Tax Practices.  While a number of countries not included on the Oxfam list have boxes which failed these rules and were considered harmful, Ireland's box was fully approved. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Oxfam report mentions Ireland in the context of profit shifting activities.  I have been clear that aggressive tax planning can best be countered by international tax reform.  Profit shifting can only be carried out where global rules applied in all countries are ineffective or misaligned.  This is why the BEPS project was needed and why the BEPS recommendations now need to be implemented globally.  For this reason, Ireland is an active participant in global work to reform the international corporate tax system.  We have implemented Country by Country Reporting, agreed the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and are working towards the implementation of the remaining OECD BEPS recommendations both domestically and internationally.  On Budget Day, I published an Update on Ireland's International Tax Strategy which highlights our continuing efforts in this regard.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  NEPS provides a valuable service to the school community and one which I view as a priority.  The service has, over the course of recent economic difficulties, not only maintained psychologist staffing levels within NEPS, but has increased them by some 10% since late 2008, to 162 whole time equivalent psychologists currently employed.  </p>  <p>  Additionally the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the further expansion in the National Educational Psychological Service to ensure earlier intervention and access for young children and teenagers and to offer immediate support to schools in cases of critical incidents.  The Programme commits to bring the total number of NEPS psychologists to 238 from the current sanctioned limit of 173.</p>  <p>  NEPS psychologists are recruited via regional panels formed from national recruitment competitions administered by the Public Appointments Service (PAS).  The panel which had existed in this regard had reached the end of its useful life and proved unable to answer the recruitment needs from the viewpoint of ongoing staffing losses due to resignation or retirement or to bring the NEPS staffing complement up to its current limit of 173 w.t.e.  It has now been closed.</p>  <p>  A new national recruitment competition has been put in place by PAS to fill vacancies within all NEPS Regions.  The closing date for applications is now passed and work is currently ongoing in relation to the examination of applications and short-listing of candidates for interview.

Schools with the highest concentration of disadvantage were selected for participation in the DEIS programme.  Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the programme.</p><p>At Primary level the identification for participation in DEIS was based on analysis of a survey, carried out by the Educational Research Centre (ERC), of all primary schools.  This analysis identified the socio-economic variables that collectively best predict achievement, and these variables were then used to identify schools for participation in the School Support Programme.  The variables involved were:</p><p>% unemployment</p><p>% local authority accommodation</p><p>% lone parenthood</p><p>% Travellers</p><p>% large families (5 or more children)</p><p>% pupils eligible for free books.</p><p>At Post Primary level the identification process was based on centrally held data on pupils from the Post Primary Database and the State Examinations Commission database, using the following criteria:</p><p>Medical card data for Junior Cert candidates;</p><p>Junior Cert retention rates;</p><p>Junior Cert exam results aggregated to school level;</p><p>Leaving Cert retention rates by school;</p><p>The identification process for DEIS was in line with international best practice and had regard to, and employed, the existing and most appropriate data sources available.</p><p>The Educational Research Centre (ERC) conducted surveys of new and amalgamated schools that were established up to September 2008.  These surveys sought the same information as the original DEIS survey and the same variables were used to calculate the schools relative level of disadvantage.  With the exception of two or more DEIS schools amalgamating to form a new school, no newly established school has been admitted to the DEIS programme since 2009.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, a process to review the DEIS Programme, which began last year is nearing completion and it is my intention to publish a new Action Plan for Educational Inclusion in the coming weeks.</p><p>Further information on the DEIS Review process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at .</p></reply>

It is my Department's intention to progress these projects, including those listed for County Kildare, though the various stages of the architectural planning, tender and construction process.</p>  <p>  The Programme aims to prioritise new building projects and major extensions, including for special schools, in areas where significant demographic need has been established.  School projects that were announced under my Department's 5 Year Plan (2012-2016) will also be advanced in the Capital Programme.  The Deputy will also be aware that in addition, the Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for smaller scale projects for schools, where an immediate accommodation need has been identified, such as the appointment of an additional teacher.</p>  <p>  A range of areas nationwide, including many of the school planning areas in Kildare, are experiencing increased demographic pressure and these are being kept under review by my Department.  This review takes account of updated enrolment and child benefit data and also the impact of existing and planned capacity increases to schools in these areas.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government reflects the Government's objective of strengthening parental choice and further expanding diversity in our school system.  The desire of parents for diversity in education is primarily being pursued by increasing the number of non-denominational and multi-denominational schools with a view to reaching 400 by 2030.  The Government is committed to working with all stakeholders to facilitate this process and I am progressing these matters as a priority.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-16a.455.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016121600074#WRG02800"><p>My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides an educational psychological service to all primary and post primary schools through an assigned NEPS psychologist and in some cases through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are in the NEPS section of my Department's website.  Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.</p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  If there are concerns in relation to the educational development of the child, the subject of the Deputy's question, I would advise, in the first instance, that the child's parents/guardians bring the matter to the attention of the Principal of the school concerned with a view to his/her raising the matter with the assigned NEPS psychologist.</p></reply>

This decision was communicated to the student on 12 May 2016.</p>  <p>  I understand that the student was in receipt of a Disability Allowance.  Under the terms of the scheme, this is treated as an income disregard and was not included in the calculation of reckonable income.  Therefore, the assessment was based on her parent&rsquo;s income only.</p>  <p>  While is it open to all applicants to appeal the initial decision to an appeals officer in SUSI, I understand in this instance that the student did not appeal this decision and is now outside of the statutory 30 day timeline for doing so.</p></reply>

It is my Department's intention to progress these projects, including those listed for County Kildare, though the various stages of the architectural planning, tender and construction process.</p>  <p>  The Programme aims to prioritise new building projects and major extensions, including for special schools, in areas where significant demographic need has been established.  School projects that were announced under my Department's 5 Year Plan (2012-2016) will also be advanced in the Capital Programme.  The Deputy will also be aware that in addition, the Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for smaller scale projects for schools, where an immediate accommodation need has been identified, such as the appointment of an additional teacher.</p></reply>

Where schools encounter such costs, it is a matter for them to bring this to my Department's attention and to apply  for a funding uplift.  My Department does not intend to issue a blanket uplift as not all schools will encounter this issue.  Ultimately, the tender process will dictate the cost of a project and schools are obliged to revert to my Department with the outcome of a tender process where the lowest tender exceeds the grant approval.</p></reply>

The Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship was launched in September and the Industrial Electrical Engineering Apprenticeship in November.</p>  <p>  The new Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship, developed jointly by the Insurance Institute of Ireland and Institute of Technology Sligo, will see apprentices work and receive practical on-the-job training 4 days each week and will study online from their place of work one day a week.  The three year programme is at level 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications and leads to an honours degree in Insurance Practice.</p>  <p>  A total of 67 apprentices have started the programme, 38 male and 29 female.</p>  <p>  The Industrial Electrical Engineering Apprenticeship was launched on 21 November 2016 with 12 registered apprentices, all of whom are male.  The 2-year programme is at Level 7 on the National Framework of Qualifications and leads to a Bachelor of Engineering in Industrial Electrical Engineering.  The programme is targeted at qualified electricians who wish to progress further in their learning and their careers.  The programme is &lsquo;block-release&rsquo; with five stages, three of which comprise 21 weeks each on the job with two further periods of 15 weeks spent in formal training in the Institute of Technology Limerick.</p>  <p>The 13 further apprenticeships are expected to be implemented, subject to further development and validation, in 2017.</p></reply>

This improvement took effect from September 2016. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 provides for 2,400 additional teaching posts by the end of 2017.  This includes 100 posts arising from enhancements to guidance.  These posts will come on stream in September 2017.</p>  <p>  The allocation of a whole time equivalent of an additional 100 teachers to second level schools is a restoration of a further 16% of the teaching resources that were removed when the allocation of guidance posts was brought within quota.  </p>  <p>  The delivery of this 16% restoration in addition to the 50% restoration in Budget 2016, means that two thirds of the Guidance allocation that was withdrawn in Budget 2012 will be restored in our schools with effect from September 2017.</p>  <p>  As a result of this decision to further enhance the guidance allocation to schools and provide schools with a separate allocation for guidance outside of the quota, the pupil teacher ratio (PTR) will revert to 19:1 with effect from September 2017.  This will mean that 400 posts will be provided in respect of Guidance as a separate allocation from outside of the quota.  The guidance allocation will be shown separately on the staffing schedules and will represent 0.4 of the PTR for each school.  DEIS schools will have a guidance allocation of 1.15 of the PTR which represents the total guidance allocation that was restored to these schools.</p></reply>

The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.  The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.</p><p>I am satisfied that the current income limits generally provide for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households unable to provide accommodation from their own resources.  These limits will continue to be kept under review by my Department, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda set out in the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.  I have no function in relation to the operational matters of the Board.  The Act provides that landlords in the sector must apply to register the tenancy of a dwelling with the RTB within one month of the commencement of the tenancy.  There are currently over 325,500 tenancies registered with the RTB, comprising over 174,500 landlords and over 516,500 tenants. </p><p>Security of tenure under the 2004 Act is based on rolling four-year tenancy cycles.  Where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months and no notice of termination has been served in respect of that tenancy before the expiry of the period of 6 months, the tenancy is established for the remainder of the four-year period.  This is referred to in the Act as a &lsquo;Part 4&rsquo; tenancy.  Landlords and tenants may not contract out of any of the provisions of Part 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act and no lease, tenancy agreement, contract or other agreement may operate to vary or modify the provisions of Part 4 of the Act. </p><p>The entitlement to a four-year tenancy is a minimum entitlement for tenants after 6 months.  This does not prevent landlords providing for longer fixed-term tenancies should they wish to do so and there is nothing in the Act to prevent a landlord providing a tenant with more beneficial rights generally than those that are provided for in the Act. Where a fixed-term tenancy continues for more than 6 months then, subject to limited exceptions, the tenant acquires the right to a Part 4 tenancy in addition to any rights they have under their fixed tenancy agreement. </p><p>My Department does not hold or collate the data in relation to the number of tenancies that are subject to fixed-term agreements, Part 4 agreements or both.  The Clerk of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has requested that arrangements be put in place to facilitate the provision of information by State Bodies to members of the Oireachtas.  Following the issue of Circular LG (P) 05/16 on 20 September from my Department, the RTB have set up a dedicated email address for this purpose at .</p></reply>

Part V units are excluded from the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme to ensure that units delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time.

Together, these two local authorities have a target to deliver 445 social housing units for the period out to 2017, supported by an allocation of &euro;24 million, to be invested in a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes.</p><p>My Department has approved proposals for the delivery of 135 new units of accommodation in respect of Cavan and Monaghan under the local authorities&rsquo; own social housing construction programme and the Capital Assistance Scheme.  The details of these projects are set out in announcements made in May 2015, July 2015 and January 2016, for which details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the links below, and in projects approved subsequently, listed in the table below.</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Local Authority</b></th><th><b>Location</b></th><th><b>Delivery</b> <b>Method</b></th><th><b>No. of</b> <b>Units</b></th></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>Rosehill, Mullagh (Phase 6) </td><td>LA Construction</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>Liseggerton, Clones by <br /><br />Oaklee Housing Trust</td><td>AHB Construction</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>Monaghan Town</td><td>3 Turnkey developments</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>Smithborough</td><td>Turnkey   development</td><td>5</td></tr></table></p><p>I am keen that these projects are advanced as soon as possible and funding to be provided to the Cavan and Monaghan Councils in 2017 will be directly linked to this delivery.</p><p>My Department will also continue to support Cavan and Monaghan Councils in 2017 in respect of work to return vacant social housing units to productive use and for certain targeted acquisitions.  The precise numbers of social houses supported under these programmes will again depend on the numbers undertaken by the local authorities. </p><p>Local authorities also use a variety of current-funded mechanisms to secure social housing including the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) programmes, which my Department will continue to support in 2017 and beyond.</p><p>The SHCEP is currently funding 36 social housing units in Cavan and Monaghan.  An additional 51 units approved for leasing by two approved housing bodies (AHBs) are anticipated to become operational by the end of 2016, bringing the total number of operational units to 87.  These units will continue to be funded through SHCEP in 2017 in addition to any additional new units sourced by the local authorities or AHBs. </p><p>My Department also supports AHBs to deliver new social housing under the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) and this is supporting the acquisition and construction of 55 additional units by three AHBs in Cavan and Monaghan.  Delivery is contingent on AHBs securing the balance of funding required from private finance or other borrowings.  If successful, it is anticipated that these 55 units will be delivered by the end of 2017.  Locations include Kingscourt (16 units), Clones (6 units) and Carrickmacross (33 units).</p><p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme is currently available in 28 local authority areas, including Cavan and Monaghan County Councils.  Since Monaghan County Council&rsquo;s commencement of the HAP statutory pilot scheme on 1 October 2014, almost 350 households have been supported to date and HAP support will continue into 2017 and beyond.  The scheme became statutorily operational in the administrative area of Cavan County Council on 1 December 2016.  There are currently more than 16,000 households being supported by the scheme and just over 11,600 of these tenancies have been set-up in 2016 to date. </p><p>In relation to RAS, Cavan County Council&rsquo;s end of year 2015 activity report indicated that there were 562 tenancies supported by the scheme.  At the end of 2015, Monaghan County Council reported that there were 256 tenancies supported by RAS.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities.  However, the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century.  I have asked my Department to develop proposals for the preparation of a consolidated Rates Bill to modernise and consolidate the legislation in this area.  This would include addressing the enforcement powers available to local authorities to address non-compliance with the payment of rates, which would not increase the compliance costs to business currently paying rates.  I hope to bring proposals in this area to Government shortly.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner for Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters except appeals of valuation procedures set out under the Valuation Act 2001, as amended, which comes under the remit of an independent Valuation Tribunal.

To date, revaluations have been completed in South Dublin County Council, Fingal County Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Dublin City Council, Waterford City and County Council and Limerick City and County Council.

During the period of suspension, no Irish Water customers will receive bills for domestic water charges.  This period is to allow for an extensive deliberative process to be undertaken on the enduring funding model for domestic public water services which will culminate in an Oireachtas vote on the matter by the end of March 2017.  The &ldquo;Arrangement&rdquo; clearly states that those who have paid their water bills to date will be treated no less favourably than those who have not and people remain liable for unpaid domestic water charges and arrears of water charges incurred by households remain to be discharged.  Pending the outcome of the Oireachtas decision on the funding of domestic water services, it is not possible to determine what financial implications may arise for Irish Water post March 2017; the financial implications arising from the suspension of water charges up to March 2017 have already been addressed by the Government.</p></reply>

The first is a standard annuity mortgage available from all local authorities.  A first-time buyer unable to get a loan from a building society or a bank, may be eligible for a mortgage from the local authority concerned to purchase a new or second hand property or build their own home.The loan can be up to 97% of the price of the house subject to a maximum loan of &euro;200,000.A local authority mortgage is an annuity mortgage with variable interest rates, so repayments will go up and down in line with interest rate changes.The relevant terms and conditions applying to local authority housing loans are set out in the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012.  Key eligibility criteria provide that a loan applicant must be a first-time buyer and must be able to show their local authority that they cannot get a loan from a bank or building society.  Also, the gross income (before tax) of a single-income household in the previous year must be &euro;50,000 or less and the combined gross income (before tax) of a two-income household in the previous year must be &euro;75,000 or less.  Prospective applicants should contact their relevant local authority for further information.</p><p>The second option is the Home Choice Loan which is available for first-time buyers to purchase a new or second-hand property or build their own home.  The relevant terms and conditions applying to the Home Choice Loan are set out in the Housing (Home Choice Loan) Regulations 2009.  Home Choice Loan provides up to 92% of the market value of a property purchased, subject to a maximum loan amount of &euro;285,000.The loan is a normal capital and interest bearing mortgage which is repaid on a monthly basis.  Home Choice Loan offers one variable interest rate.  The rate is currently set at 3.25% variable, APR 3.30%.  Further information is available at .</p><p>To support local authorities in operating their housing loan schemes in a consistent and efficient manner, the Housing Agency provides a central underwriting service to local authorities.  The credit underwriting process considers the impact that family circumstances may have on the loan applicant&rsquo;s capacity to make loan repayments.  The final decision on loan approval is a matter for the relevant local authority and its credit committee on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with the relevant statutory Credit Policy that underpins the scheme and aims to ensure prudent lending.</p><p>The total number of new loans issued by local authorities under both schemes in the years 2010 to 2015 is set out in the table. </p><p>I will continue to keep the operation of both schemes under review.</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Year</b></th><th><b>No. of annuity loans issued</b> </th><th><b>&euro;m</b> </th><th><b>No. of Home Choice Loans issued</b> </th><th><b>&euro;m</b> </th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>69 </td><td>7.4 </td><td>6 </td><td>1.206 </td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>106 </td><td>11.0 </td><td>3 </td><td>0.554 </td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>149 </td><td>14.7 </td><td>5 </td><td>0.776 </td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>143 </td><td>11.4 </td><td>1 </td><td>0.276 </td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>171 </td><td>13.1 </td><td>2 </td><td>0.318 </td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>248 </td><td>22.8 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td><b>886</b> </td><td><b>80.4</b> </td><td><b>17</b> </td><td><b>3.13</b> </td></tr></table></p></reply>

JobPath supplements the internal case management capacity of the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service and the Local Employment Service. Over the past year this additional capacity has enabled the Department to provide an intensive employment support and advisory service to over 60,000 long term unemployed jobseekers who would otherwise not have received such a service.  The JobPath service is provided by two companies, Seetec and Turas Nua, who have put in place a network of over 80 offices nationwide and who employ nearly 600 staff of whom some 400 are caseworkers. The JobPath companies will continue to engage with long-term unemployed jobseekers in 2017.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s online job vacancy service www.jobsireland.ie enables employers and jobseekers to search for prospective employees and jobs using skillsets and competencies as well as the traditional job type classifications.  Jobseekers can also search jobs by location. Once a jobseeker is registered, the service automatically matches candidates to job specifications and can notify both the jobseeker and the employer when a match is found.  </p>  <p>  During 2017, all jobseekers will be required to register on www.jobsireland.ie.  It is planned to integrate JobsIreland with my Department&rsquo;s Activation Case-Management system to enable activation teams to offer enhanced supports to jobseekers and monitor their job search activity.</p>  <p>  My Department has progressively rolled out its Intreo service to people with disabilities who wish to avail of the service on a voluntary basis.  People with disabilities who present at INTREO Centres will be offered an interview by a case officer who will agree a personal plan with the individual.  Officers in INTREO Centres have received additional training to assist them in supporting people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  My Department will spend more than &euro;1 billion in 2016 on work, training and education places in support of jobseekers.  Expenditure and the number of schemes and participants increased significantly in recent years in a response to the high levels of unemployment which peaked at 15%. </p>  <p>  Schemes such as Community Employment (CE), T&uacute;s and RSS play an important role in helping jobseekers maintain work skills.  Erosion of jobseeker confidence and work skills, including soft skills related to team-working, communication, planning etc., is a significant issue over long periods of unemployment.  </p>  <p>  With the ongoing welcome reductions in the Live Register, issues such as the appropriate level of expenditure, the number of places and the criteria for participation on employment schemes are all being considered. I hope to be in a position to bring a Memorandum to Government on these matters in the coming weeks. If there are any changes to be made, consultations with stakeholders will be facilitated. </p>  <p>  Finally, with regard to rural communities, the Farm Assist scheme provides support for farmers on low incomes and is similar to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance. As part of Budget 2017, farm income and other income from off-farm self-employment is to be assessed at 70%, down from 100%, for Farm Assist, with additional annual disregard of &euro;254 for each of the first two children and &euro;381 for the third and other children. There is also a &euro;5 increase in maximum weekly rate of Farm Assist and &euro;3.30 increase for adult dependants.  Invalidity Pension is being extended to the self-employed including farmers.  In addition entitlement to Dental and Optical Benefits is also being extended to this cohort.  It is also worth noting that 500 additional places under the Rural Social Scheme were announced which will increase the overall number to 3,100.  My Department intends allocating these places as early as possible in 2017 taking into account a number of factors. These include the number of places already allocated, the demand for new places in particular areas, work opportunities available in local areas and the numbers of farmers and fishermen and women in receipt of income support.  In allocating the additional places, the Government recognises the benefits the RSS provides for participants and their families, as well as the valuable contribution the scheme is making to the provision of services in communities across Ireland. </p></reply>

This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory) and Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Pension (contributory), Guardian&rsquo;s Payment (contributory), Maternity Benefit and Adoptive Benefit and, since September 2016, the newly introduced Paternity Benefit.  </p>  <p>  Core to the Programme for Government is improving the position of the self-employed generally, including the commitment to introduce an enhanced PRSI scheme for the self-employed.</p>  <p>  Making progress on this commitment has been one of my key priorities since becoming Minister in this Department.  On Budget Day, I was pleased to announce a number of important measures which will benefit the self-employed. </p>  <p>  From March 2017, the self-employed will have access to the treatment benefit scheme which includes free eye and dental exams, and contributions towards the cost of hearings aids.  As you will be aware, these treatments are already available to Class P contributors; however, the Treatment benefit entitlements will also be extended from October 2017 providing further dental and optical benefits.</p>  <p>  More significantly, self-employed contributors will be eligible for the Invalidity Pension from December 2017.  For the first time, this will give the self-employed access to the safety-net of State income supports if they have a serious illness or injury that prevents them from working without having to go through a means test.  This is a real advance in the level of cover available to the self-employed.</p>  <p>  The self-employed will also benefit from the further increase in Earned Income Tax Credit announced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, as well as the extension of entrepreneurship supports.  These measures are all part of the Government&rsquo;s policy of making work pay and encouraging self-employment and entrepreneurship</p>  <p>  It is estimated that around 205,000 self-employed workers paying Class S PRSI are solely dependent on their self-employed contributions to access social insurance benefits.  These contributors will now have access to the wider range of benefits outlined above as well as the new paternity benefit introduced last September. It will not be possible to obtain cover for the wider range of benefits on a voluntary basis.  The self-employed will continue to pay PRSI at the 4% rate in 2017.</p>  <p>  I plan to continue extending cover for the self-employed to other benefits on a phased basis in future Budgets.  In this regard, in 2017, my Department will carry out detailed work to establish how to provide a better safety net for self-employed including, for example, access to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</p></reply>

This approach is in line with the principle of &lsquo;rights and responsibilities&rsquo; whereby an unemployed jobseeker has a right to receive income and employment supports from the State but also has a responsibility to engage with those State services if requested to do so. All jobseekers acknowledge this responsibility in writing when they claim a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.</p><p>Failure of a jobseeker to engage, without good cause, with the Department&rsquo;s employment services can have consequences for the jobseeker&rsquo;s payments.  Legislation provides that a Department deciding officer can apply a reduced payment in such circumstances.  It is important to note that the decision rules and process for application of a reduced rate of payment are the same across all of the Department&rsquo;s employment services whether they are delivered directly by the Department&rsquo;s own Intreo service or through its contracted services i.e. the Local Employment Service and JobPath.  It should also be noted that the contracted providers cannot apply a reduced rate of payment.  They can only refer a case for consideration by a Department deciding officer who will apply the standard rules and decisions process.  This process includes written and verbal warnings and an opportunity for the jobseeker to re-engage with the services prior to the application of a reduced payment rate.</p><p>In the period from their inception in 2011 to 17 November 2016, a total of 27,769 penalty rates have been applied (see table below).  The increase in the number of jobseekers referred to activation over this period (including Intreo, LES and JobPath) has given rise to an increase in the total number of jobseekers under activation. In this context, as the numbers selected for activation increased, so too has the number of penalty rates applied but the rates remain low relative to the overall number of people signing-on the Live Register.</p><p>YearNumber </p><p>2011:359</p><p>2012:  1,519</p><p>2013:  3,395</p><p>2014:  5,325</p><p>2015:  6,743</p><p>2016:10,428 (To end November)</p><p>Total: 27,769</p><p>Departmental records show that there are at present some 500 JobPath clients on a reduced penalty rate of payment and that overall 2,593 people, who were referred to the JobPath service since its inception in July 2015, have had a penalty rate applied to them.

A breakdown of rent supplement recipients by county is provided in the attached tabular statement. In recognition of the ongoing supply difficulties, my Department continues to implement a targeted case-by-case policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits. To date, approximately 10,600 persons at imminent risk of homelessness have been supported through increased rent supplement payments. There has been a significant reduction in these cases following the introduction of the increased rent limits from 1 July this year.  A county breakdown of these payments is provided in the tabular statement.The implementation of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a key Government priority and a major pillar of the Social Housing Strategy 2020 and the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness &ndash; Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; which has committed to an accelerated target of 12,000 HAP tenancies in 2016.  Under HAP, responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to those with a long-term housing need transfers to local authorities, under the auspices of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.</p><p>From 1st December 2016, the HAP scheme is now operational in 28 of the 31 local authority areas. It is expected that HAP will be fully rolled out to the remaining Dublin administrative areas from 1st March 2017. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that HAP was first piloted in the Limerick area in early 2014 and there are now over 1,500 HAP supported tenancies in Limerick City and County. The number of HAP recipients in Limerick has exceeded the number of rent supplement recipients (973). In addition to the ongoing transfer of tenancies from rent supplement to HAP, the majority of new applicants in Limerick seeking State support towards their rent are being processed under HAP rather than rent supplement. This activity is reflected in the low number of increased payments provided under rent supplement in this area. </p><p>In tandem with the revised rental limits introduced in July 2016 and on-going transfers to HAP, my Department continues to implement a targeted, flexible, case-by-case approach where rents may exceed the appropriate maximum limit ensuring where possible the threat of homelessness for tenants can be avoided. </p><p><b>Tabular Statement </b></p><p><b>Table 1: Rent Supplement Recipients by County as at end November 2016</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Recipients</th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td>624</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>375</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>438</td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>5,032</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>445</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>20,619</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td>2,564</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>1,555</td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>2,631</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>329</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td>872</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td>283</td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td>973</td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td>403</td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH</td><td>902</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td>1,102</td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td>1,023</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>197</td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td>582</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>570</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td>297</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>947</td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td>615</td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td>1,308</td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td>1,973</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td>1,940</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>48,599</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2: Total Cumulative Increased Rental Payments by County as at 12th December 2016</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Awards under National Tenancy Sustainment Framework</th><th>Awards under protocol with Threshold</th><th>Total no. of increased payments by County</th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td>72</td><td></td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>57</td><td></td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>60</td><td></td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>446</td><td>102</td><td>548</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>-</td><td></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>4,000</td><td>2,484</td><td>6,484</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td>204</td><td>2</td><td>206</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>181</td><td></td><td>181</td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>531</td><td>3</td><td>534</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>135</td><td></td><td>135</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td>119</td><td></td><td>119</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td>97</td><td></td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td>8</td><td></td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td>307</td><td></td><td>307</td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH</td><td>152</td><td></td><td>152</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td>3</td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td>423</td><td></td><td>423</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td>64</td><td></td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>51</td><td></td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>283</td><td></td><td>283</td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td>62</td><td></td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td>355</td><td></td><td>355</td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td>20</td><td></td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td>359</td><td>3</td><td>362</td></tr><tr><td>Overall Total</td><td>7,991</td><td>2,581</td><td>10,572</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The peak unemployment rate during the recession was 9.9% for women aged over 25; 16.1% for men aged over 25; 25.0% for women aged under 25; and 37.5% for men aged under 25. </p>  <p>  Inevitably, the recovery has seen the greatest falls in unemployment in those groups that were hardest hit in the recession.  Despite this, unemployment remains lower among women aged over 25 than in other groups.  The most recent available unemployment rate (November 2016) is 5.4% for women aged over 25; 7.4% for men aged over 25; 13.1% for women aged under 25; and 17.6% for men aged under 25.</p>  <p>  In general, trends in the number of people on the Live Register in any given gender/age group depend on a number of other factors in addition to the unemployment rate.  These include: movements in the size of the population in the group; movements in labour-force participation in the group; and the extent to which unemployed people in the group are receiving jobseekers payments rather than other welfare payments.  In recent years, these factors have tended to increase the number of women aged over 25 on the Live Register relative to other groups, even as the underlying unemployment rate for such women has remained relatively low. </p>  <p>  Government policy allocates activation resources to persons on the Live Register, and thus takes account of relative movements in the number of people on the Live Register in various age/gender groups.</p></reply>

The Department of Social Protection has responsibility for maternity and paternity benefit payments provided for in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended). </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware the maternity leave legislation provides a 26 week period of statutory maternity leave. Subject to the provisions of social welfare legislation, the 26-week period of core statutory maternity leave attracts a social insurance payment of maternity benefit.  A mother can take a further 16 weeks unpaid maternity leave which must be taken immediately after the end of her 26 weeks paid maternity benefit. This period is not covered by maternity benefit but a mother is entitled to a credited social insurance contribution for each week of unpaid leave that is taken (up to the maximum of 16). </p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question maternity leave and maternity benefit can be postponed for up to six months at the discretion of the mother in cases where the child is hospitalised. In these cases entitlement to maternity leave and benefit continues after the period of postponement for a maximum of twelve weeks. </p><p>Eligible parents can also avail of paid paternity leave at any time within the first 26 weeks following the birth or date of placement of the child. Paternity benefit is available for employed and self-employed people who are on from work and covered by contributions. Paternity leave and paternity benefit can also be postponed for up to six months in cases where the child is hospitalised. </p><p>A recipient of the one parent family payment can keep their main social welfare payment and receive a half-rate maternity benefit as well. A carer who was in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance payment and subsequently has an entitlement to maternity benefit is entitled to keep a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance payment along with their maternity benefit. Parents are also entitled to child benefit which is paid from the date of birth of the child.</p><p>Where an individual has insufficient social insurance contributions to qualify for maternity benefit, they may be eligible for another social welfare payment provided they meet the relevant contingency conditions.  For instance, new mothers who do not qualify for maternity benefit may be eligible for a payment under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme.  This scheme is considered a &quot;safety net&quot; within the overall social welfare system for eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. </p><p>These measures facilitate parental choice by allowing parents decide what options are best suited to their circumstances.</p><p>I hope this information is useful. </p></reply>

However, as previously advised in earlier replies, he is free to present any additional or new evidence in relation to the decision to the decision of the Appeals Office whereupon the Department may consider a revised decision or referring the matter for the attention of the Appeals Office.

This remains the most efficient and cost-effective way to apply and applications can be submitted at some seventy post offices in Northern Ireland and at over one thousand post offices in the state.</p>  <p>  To accommodate a relatively small number of people with urgent or sudden travel needs, an appointment service is in operation in the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork.  This on-line service provides flexibility in allowing customers to book guaranteed time slots, Monday to Friday.  It removes the necessity for the small number of citizens who need their passports for urgent travel reasons to queue and ensures that waiting times at public counters are minimised.  The passport reform programme, which is well underway, will deliver further significant customer service improvements in the coming years. </p>  <p>  Overall, I am satisfied that the range of service options meets the current needs of passport applicants and that the service improvements on the way will allow the Passport Service to cope with future challenges.  </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to keep service levels under careful review and adjustments will be made to the deployment of current resources as needed.</p>  <p>  In advance of the Christmas break I would ask all Members to join me in promoting public awareness of the need to apply for passports well in advance of travel.  This will assist in avoiding having applicants visit a passport office in person given the partnership between the post office network throughout the island and the Passport Service.</p></reply>

In addition, there is also an intra-Departmental senior management group on issues relating to the UK exit, chaired by the Secretary General and comprising senior officials from across all relevant business units of the Department.  </p>  <p>  In terms of Irish offices focused on work relating to the UK exit, additional posts have been approved for our Embassies in London, Berlin, and Paris and the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union in Brussels.  Several of these posts have been filled already while the selection and assignment process to fill other key positions is at an advanced stage.  The Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union in Brussels now has a unit dedicated to managing our response to this issue and there has already been some reassignment of roles in order to fill key positions in this unit.  </p>  <p>  I would stress that these measures comprise the first phase of our response to the UK decision to leave the EU and matters remain under review as the Government continues its detailed analysis of the implications of the UK referendum decision.  I expect that our allocation of roles and responsibilities in key missions across the network will be revised further once the UK triggers Article 50, which is expected by the end of March 2017, and that the resources dedicated to this issue by my Department will be enhanced further to meet the particular challenges of the negotiation phase.</p>  <p>  In general terms, all of our diplomatic Missions across the EU and further afield are working on this issue.</p>  <p>  I would also add that a number of officers of my Department are seconded to the Department of the Taoiseach and working on EU matters, while two officers are seconded to the International and EU Relations Division of the Department of Finance. </p>  <p>  As regards our global diplomatic footprint, a range of factors are taken into account in considering our diplomatic representation overseas: our national political, economic and trade priorities - including the response to the result of the UK&rsquo;s referendum on EU membership - and maintaining our influence within the EU and with other EU Member States.  EU issues are the sole focus of the Permanent Representation in Brussels, our largest diplomatic mission, and a major part of the work of our Embassies in all twenty-seven other EU Member States.  </p>  <p>  The configuration and scale of the State&rsquo;s diplomatic and consular network is kept under ongoing review by the Government.</p></reply>

It remains a cornerstone for our planning and for the delivery of Government objectives and it is not intended to update the document at this time.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s new Statement of Strategy 2016-2019, which articulates the Government&rsquo;s priorities for external engagement for the next three years, including objectives from the Programme for a Partnership Government, was agreed by Government on 13 December.  It will be translated and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the New Year, and will be published online thereafter.  The Statement of Strategy provides us with specific goals and outputs, designed to structure our response to the challenges of the day.  Foremost among those challenges is undoubtedly the United Kingdom&rsquo;s vote to leave the European Union.  The Statement of Strategy sets out our priority actions in this area and how the staff of the Department at home and in our network of Missions abroad will contribute to protecting Irish interests during Brexit negotiations and beyond.  It also underlines the importance of the whole of Government approach and how we will work with our partners in Government to ensure the best possible outcomes for Irish citizens across the full breadth of our work.</p></reply>

Growth in trade and investment resulting from trade missions supports jobs in Ireland and is a vital element of the Government&rsquo;s trade, tourism and investment promotion efforts.  The Trade Mission schedule is the subject of discussion at the Export Trade Council, which I chair.  This Forum helps ensure a coordinated approach to trade policy across government.  As Trade Minister, I meet frequently with entrepreneurs when overseas on official business for discussions about investing in Ireland and partnering with Irish companies in overseas markets.

On 28 June, the European Council agreed that delivering rapid results in preventing illegal migration and returning irregular migrants requires an effective Partnership Framework of cooperation with individual countries of origin or transit. Draft &lsquo;Migration Compacts&rsquo; have now been drawn up for the first five priority countries identified.  These are all in Africa: Niger, Nigeria, Mali, Senegal and Ethiopia.  The objective of a Migration Compact is to improve cooperation on readmission and return of those not entitled to reside in the EU; to prevent irregular migration and counter smuggling and trafficking in human beings; to reinforce the current international protection system for refugees in the partner countries; and to address the root causes of irregular migration.  Human rights and humanitarian imperatives are at the core of the EU and Member States&rsquo; approach under the Partnership Framework.  The EU and its Member States are committed to enhancing human rights safeguards in all migration and mobility dialogues and cooperation frameworks with third countries and in migration-related agreements, processes and programmes.</p>  <p>  Discussions within the EU and with the identified countries are continuing.  However, progress has been made, notably with Niger, where the fight against people-smugglers has stepped up, a dedicated agency to combat human trafficking has been established and the outgoing flow of migrants has decreased.  Negotiations with Nigeria are also moving forward, with a further round expected in December. </p>  <p>  We are supportive of the progress towards Migration Compacts to develop a comprehensive partnership between the EU and third countries, particularly in Africa, and we are working in particular with our EU colleagues on the new partnership framework for Ethiopia, one of the key partner countries for the Irish Aid programme.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Irish Government is continuing proactively to use all the means that are available to us to ensure that the Egyptian authorities at the highest levels fully understand the importance that the Irish Government attaches to the resolution of this case.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to bring all of our influence to bear on this young man&rsquo;s behalf through all effective channels.  The Government is giving its full support to an appeal for this citizen&rsquo;s return to Ireland under Egyptian Law/Decree 140, and is applying maximum pressure on the Egyptian authorities in support of that initiative.</p>  <p>  Both the Taoiseach and I have been in direct contact with our Egyptian counterparts, President el-Sisi and Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, to underline the Irish Government&rsquo;s serious concerns about this case in recent weeks.  The Taoiseach has raised the case directly and personally with Egyptian President el-Sisi on a number of occasions, including in face-to-face meetings, by phone and in writing.  Following the adjournment of the trial in November, the Taoiseach again contacted the Egyptian President and urged him to return this citizen to Ireland without delay.   </p>  <p>  I am also in regular contact with my Egyptian counterpart, Minister Sameh Shoukry, making clear the Irish Government&rsquo;s concerns and objectives in this case.  I spoke with Minister Shoukry on Tuesday 1 November, again restating very clearly the Irish Government&rsquo;s support for the Decree 140 application.  I also met my counterpart in New York during the UN General Assembly in September, having also raised the case during a visit to Cairo in June.    </p>  <p>  As well as pursuing the Law/Decree 140 application, the Government also continues to explore each and every other possible avenue that might assist in securing this citizen&rsquo;s return to Ireland.  The Government, through our Embassy in Cairo, has been closely following the reports from Egypt about a new &lsquo;youth amnesty scheme&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  In this context, on foot of a request from the citizen&rsquo;s family, the Government has formally requested that the Egyptian Government consider him for immediate release.  </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach specifically made this request in a letter to the Egyptian President on 17 November.  I raised this matter and request also with the Egyptian Ambassador in Dublin on the same day.</p>  <p>  However, the details of this amnesty scheme remain very opaque and there are contradictory media reports about who might be eligible to avail of the scheme.  Our Embassy in Cairo is seeking further information and clarification about how it operates. </p>  <p>  In addition to engagement with the Egyptian authorities, the Government has also been engaging on an ongoing basis with other states who have had citizens in similar situations, with our European and international partners, and with the European Union.  I have engaged extensively with the EU High Representative, Ms. Federica Mogherini, who &ndash; at my request - has personally raised the case with the Egyptian Government. </p>  <p>  The Irish Government has been represented at every hearing in the case to date and our Ambassador was again in court to observe the proceedings at the most recent hearing, on 13 December.  Officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, both in Dublin and in Cairo, remain in ongoing contact with the citizen&rsquo;s family. </p>  <p>  His welfare while he remains in detention is also a high priority for the Government.  Diplomats from the Irish embassy in Cairo make regular consular visits to him in prison to monitor his wellbeing and to address any issues that arise in relation to his treatment or conditions of detention.  The most recent of these took place on 30 November 2016.</p></reply>

We agreed that the EU must press Russia and Iran to use their influence on the Assad regime to ensure that the illegal siege of the civilian population in eastern Aleppo ends and that humanitarian agencies are allowed into Aleppo as a matter of urgency.  The continued denial of essential food, shelter and medical supplies to a civilian population under military attack is intolerable.  I also made the point that the EU needs to support practical steps to ensure the effectiveness of future accountability for war crimes committed in Syria.  Ministers agreed on the continued need for the EU to work to ensure that those committing these crimes do not enjoy impunity for their actions.</p>  <p>  We also discussed the conditions for EU support for a post-conflict Syria.  It was agreed that EU will not support the reconstruction of a Syria if a political resolution to the conflict has not been achieved.  Ireland is working to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Syria and today I informed my colleagues that we are again increasing our humanitarian support to the victims of the Syrian conflict with immediate effect, raising our support by a further &euro;5M to &euro;25M in 2016.  We have contributed over &euro;67M in humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people since 2012.</p>  <p>   This unprecedented level of sustained humanitarian need reflects the deliberate and systematic violation of the rights of Syria&rsquo;s civilian population by all sides throughout this horrific conflict. The Assad regime, in particular, bears responsibility for these crimes.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s priorities will remain central in our contribution to the EU&rsquo;s Syria policy.  In particular, we will continued to work for an immediate end to the violence across Syria and in Aleppo in particular; a lifting of all sieges and the systematic denial of humanitarian access; the renewal of a UN-led political process to achieve a negotiated end to the conflict and a political transition; and accountability for the crimes inflicted on millions of Syrian civilians.</p></reply>

However we are concerned about the recent violence in Rakhine State, which began when attacks were carried out against Border Guard Police posts on 9 October 2016.  Security operations led by the Myanmar Armed Forces in response to those attacks.  Both civilians and security personnel have been killed with thousands of people displaced or losing their livelihoods.  Regular humanitarian assistance has been severely disrupted for many weeks and there are reports of a significant deterioration in the human rights situation in northern Rakhine State, including allegations of disproportionate action by the Myanmar Armed Forces.</p>  <p>  On December 9, Ireland through its Embassy in Bangkok, which is accredited to Myanmar/Burma, joined a number of likeminded diplomatic missions there in a statement which expressed serious concerns about humanitarian aid access to the region.  The statement also addressed the recent attacks against security personnel in Rakhine State and allegations of abuse in the subsequent security operations.  We urged the security forces in Myanmar/Burma to ensure protection of all civilians.  The creation of an Investigation Commission offers an important opportunity to investigate these incidents and allegations objectively and transparently, as well as expose acts of violence and abuse.</p>  <p>  The Government regularly highlights its concerns regarding conflict in Rakhine State and the minority Rohingya people at bilateral level and in the context of our membership of the EU and the UN. </p>  <p>  The third EU-Myanmar Human Rights Dialogue took place in Myanmar/Burma on November 22.  At the meeting, the EU similarly expressed concerns about the recent security and human rights situation in northern Rakhine state, reiterating calls for an independent, credible investigation into both initial attacks and subsequent actions, as well as for the urgent re-opening of humanitarian access to the populations in need.  These messages were also reiterated in bilateral meetings undertaken by EU Special Representative for Human Rights Stavros Lambrinidis with State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and Min Aung Hlaing, Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Armed Forces, during Mr Lambrinidis&rsquo; visit to Myanmar/Burma.</p>  <p>  The Government is of the view that the underlying root causes of tensions in Rakhine State must be addressed with long-term solutions led by the Government of Myanmar/Burma.  The need to guarantee respect for human rights and the rule of law for all people in Myanmar/Burma remains central to achieving this.  Ireland has also called for more investment in early recovery and support for livelihood opportunities for both the Rohingya and Buddhist communities in Rakhine State.</p></reply>

My officials in the Belfast Secretariat monitor this and other cases as part of their ongoing work around prison issues generally in Northern Ireland.  The particular personal circumstances of the individual in question, including issues relating to access to Maghaberry for family members, has been raised with the Northern Ireland Office.</p>  <p>  The person concerned was detained in March 2016 when the release licence granted to him under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement was revoked by the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers.</p>  <p>  I am informed that as part of the revocation process, the independent Northern Ireland Parole Commissioners carry out a full review of the case.  The Parole Commissioners are charged with taking into account the obligations on the State of the European Convention on Human Rights in making their recommendation.  This includes assessing the risk to the public should the person remain at liberty.  Those whose licence is revoked under this process are provided with a copy of the independent Parole Commissioners recommendation, which sets out the reasons the licence was revoked.  </p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware of my concern about prison conditions generally in Northern Ireland.  I had a useful exchange on this issue with Claire Sugden MLA, the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice when she visited Dublin recently.</p></reply>

Boko Haram is a serious threat to the safety, stability and prosperity of Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad.  Some progress has been made by the Nigerian armed forces through joint efforts with neighbouring countries and assistance is being provided to large numbers of internally displaced people.</p>  <p>  The EU and UN have continued to provide assistance to the Nigerian Government to create a safe and secure environment for its people.  In August 2016, the EU pledged support of up to &euro;50 million in support of the Multinational Joint Taskforce, which supports 8,700 troops from Nigeria and neighbouring countries to promote regional security.  The EU has also contributed over &euro;74 million in humanitarian assistance since 2014 to Nigeria. </p>  <p>  The UN has estimated that thousands of people have been abducted or taken hostage by Boko Haram since 2012.  More than 1,000 child abductees have escaped or been rescued.  We have called consistently on all parties to work together to finalise the release of those taken hostage or abducted. </p>  <p>  Ireland is engaging with the Nigerian authorities in conjunction with our EU partners.  In addition, Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador to Nigeria recently visited Borno State and subsequently briefed the United Nations Special Representative for West Africa and the Sahel on his assessment of the political and humanitarian situation in north-eastern Nigeria. </p>  <p>  The UN continues to play an active role in leading the response to the grave humanitarian situation in north-eastern Nigeria as a result of the conflict with Boko Haram.  Earlier this month, together with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the Nigerian Government launched a Humanitarian Response Plan for 2017, which seeks more than $1 billion to address the humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable in north-eastern Nigeria. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s contribution of &euro;3 million in 2016 includes an airlift of 110 tonnes of emergency relief supplies to north-eastern Nigeria and Niger to provide assistance for the large numbers of people displaced by the conflict.  We have also deployed six personnel to various UN partners under the Irish Aid Rapid Response Initiative. </p>  <p>  We are following the situation in the region closely, through our Embassy in Abuja, which remains in close contact with the Nigerian authorities on issues relating to the humanitarian emergency and the continued threat posed by Boko Haram.</p></reply>

Over 65 million people are now displaced from their homes across the world, most of them living in situations of conflict.  Humanitarian assistance is a key foreign policy priority for Ireland. In 2015, Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian funding amounted to more than &euro;142 million globally.  This level of funding is being maintained in 2016 and includes Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the European Commission&rsquo;s humanitarian action outside the EU, which has an annual budget of approximately &euro;1 billion.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian response focuses on the most severe crises, often protracted over many years, including those which do not receive attention in the media.  The core objective of our assistance is to save and protect lives, alleviate suffering and maintain human dignity, before, during and in the aftermath of such crises.  Our assistance is focused on where needs are greatest, providing support to the most vulnerable and hard to reach populations, and places key emphasis on gender equality and protection, including from gender-based violence. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Humanitarian Assistance Policy recognises the particular needs and vulnerabilities of women and girls in emergencies, noting that attention to gender equality must be an essential part of every humanitarian operation.  Ireland consistently prioritises the protection of women and girls in our humanitarian programming and advocacy work, including in our commitments at this year&rsquo;s World Humanitarian Summit, and through strategic partnerships with organisations such as the International Rescue Committee, which enable us to support dedicated gender-based violence prevention and response efforts in emergencies.  At the World Humanitarian Summit, which was convened in May by the UN Secretary General, President Higgins co-chaired a roundtable discussion on Women and Girls and delivered Ireland&rsquo;s national commitments to the protection and empowerment of women and girls in emergency settings. </p>  <p>  Ireland is strongly committed to responding to the humanitarian needs of the Syrian people and those affected by ongoing conflict in the Middle East and in sub-Saharan Africa.  Since 2012, we have provided more than &euro;67 million in humanitarian assistance to Syria and the region.  We have provided over &euro;100 million for victims of crises across the Horn of Africa since 2012, including &euro;30 million for the South Sudan crisis alone.  In addition, Ireland continues to provide support to people affected by major crisis situations in Iraq, Yemen, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Central African Republic. </p>  <p>  We continue to monitor each major crisis situation closely to ensure that our assistance is reaching those most in need.</p></reply>

EU membership has been central to Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social progress of recent years.  Now, more than ever, our membership of the EU must remain at the heart of our engagement with the wider world.  Continued EU membership guarantees access to a Single Market of 500 million consumers and is vital to the economic well-being of the Irish people.</p>  <p>  In facing the challenges of the UK withdrawal from the EU, the priority areas for the Government also remain unchanged &ndash; this is about our citizens, our economy, Northern Ireland, our Common Travel Area and the future of the EU itself.  We continue to outline these priority issues at all of our meetings with EU counterparts &ndash; at both official and political level.  From an EU perspective, the Taoiseach, the Minister of State for European Affairs and I remain actively engaged with our European counterparts, as do other Ministers and senior officials.  At this critical phase, building on the round of contacts I have had since 23 June with each one of my EU counterparts, efforts are intensifying to ensure that an understanding of our priority issues is reinforced and factored into negotiations with the UK when these formally commence.  In the last few weeks, I have met with the Foreign Ministers of Poland, France and Belgium and I plan to meet more of my colleagues in the period ahead.  My officials have also had a range of engagements in recent weeks with their colleagues in other EU Member States and with the EU institutions, and these will continue in the weeks and months to come.</p>  <p>  In parallel, the Government continues to engage closely with the UK government and with devolved administrations across Britain and of course Northern Ireland.  In addition to the Taoiseach's meeting with Prime Minister May in July, I have met with the UK Secretary of State for Exiting the EU and his Parliamentary Under Secretary, as well as the UK Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  There have also been very constructive discussions at political and official level within the framework of the British Irish Council, while the First Minister of the Scottish Government, Nicola Sturgeon, visited Dublin recently and met with me in Iveagh House.</p>  <p>  Our planning ahead of the negotiations &ndash; both for the risks and opportunities for Ireland &ndash; is currently intensifying and Departments are deepening and refining their understanding of the key issues.  This work is still challenging as it is still not known what kind of relationship the UK will seek to have with the EU post-departure.  On this, we await further clarification from Prime Minister May in due course, but it is the Government&rsquo;s hope that the future EU-UK relationship will be close and positive.</p></reply>

Monthly profiles of projected expenditure are established at the beginning of each year and expenditure against profile is monitored and reported on monthly to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and is published as part of the Monthly Exchequer Statement.

This is mainly due to payments to international organisations being ahead of profile to the end of November 2016.  Capital is behind by &euro;0.845m but a full spend is expected to year end. Expenditure by the end of the year is expected to be within profile and budget.</p><p>International Co-operation Vote 27 figures at the end of November are outlined below:</p><p><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Profile to 30 November <br /><br />&euro; million</th><th>Expenditure to 30 November <br /><br />&euro; million</th><th>Variance 30 November<br /><br /> &euro; million</th></tr><tr><td>Pay</td><td>13,473</td><td>12,237</td><td>(  1,236)</td></tr><tr><td>Non-pay</td><td>456,634</td><td>410,127</td><td>(46,507)</td></tr><tr><td>Capital</td><td>470</td><td>529</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>Total Expenditure </td><td>470,577</td><td>422,893</td><td>(47,684)</td></tr></table></p><p>Under Vote 27, expenditure is running 10% behind profile at the end of November.  The variance is primarily due to the timing of disbursements and a full spend is forecast across the programme subheads for 2016.

The Government continues to work closely with all relevant stakeholders in this regard. </p><p>Progress on implementing the provisions of both the Fresh Start and Stormont House Agreements are considered at periodic review meetings. These are co convened by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I, who attend then along with the First and deputy First Ministers and, where relevant to her portfolio, the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice.  </p><p>These review meetings are important in providing political direction and momentum for the full implementation of the Agreements. At the most recent review meeting, held yesterday, I am glad to report that is was clear that there has been sustained progress with the implementation of the Fresh Start Agreement over the last year, with each administration actively pursuing the necessary work to fulfil the respective commitments. </p><p>For instance the Joint Agency Task Force on cross border crime, launched in Dublin last year, has quickly become fully operational and is progressing its work to tackle cross-jurisdictional organised crime and bring to justice those involved in it. The Task Force builds on existing operational arrangements to tackle organised crime, including that linked to paramilitarism, on a cross-border basis. The Task Force reports on its work to the two Justice Ministers within the framework of their regular meetings under the Inter-Governmental Agreement on Criminal Justice Co-operation, as provided for in the Fresh Start Agreement.</p><p>The Government is also meeting its commitments as regards infrastructure projects<font color="#004080"> </font>under the Fresh Start Agreement. This includes a contribution of &euro;25 million from the Irish Government in 2019 for the upgrading of the A5 Western Transport Corridor road project, which is in addition to the &euro;50 million previously committed. The Government&rsquo;s committed funding of &euro;2.5 million to the North West Development Fund has been provided and is to be matched by the NI Executive. Discussions are continuing at senior official level with the Northern Ireland Executive regarding co-operation on other infrastructure projects, including the Narrow Water Bridge project and the Ulster Canal and exploring financing options for future border infrastructure projects.</p><p>A key provision on the Fresh Start Agreement relates to the ending of the legacy of paramilitarism and there have been significant developments on this since the last Review Meeting in June. </p><p>Following on from a report by an Expert Panel, the Northern Ireland Executive published its Action Plan on Tackling Paramilitary Activity, Criminality and Organised Crime in July. </p><p>On 13 September, I signed an international agreement with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to establish the Independent Reporting Commission (IRC).  The IRC will report annually on progress towards ending continuing paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland.  These reports will inform future Northern Ireland Executive Programme for Government commitments through to 2021. The Government will shortly bring forward legislative proposals before the Oireachtas to establish the IRC in law, with the aim of getting the IRC established and beginning its work as soon as possible.</p><p>Following yesterday&rsquo;s review meeting both Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive announced the appointees to the Independent Reporting Commission. These Commissioners bring a wealth of experience and the broad range of skills necessary to allow as holistic an assessment of progress as possible. </p><p>The Government has appointed Mr. Tim O&rsquo;Connor a former Secretary General to the President and former senior official of my Department. Mr. O&rsquo;Connor is extremely well qualified to contribute to the work of the IRC and I am delighted that he has accepted this appointment. The other three appointees also bring a wealth of experience to the Commission. They are Mitchell Reiss - former US Special Envoy to Northern Ireland - and Monica McWilliams and John McBurney, both of whom served on the Expert Panel referenced above.  </p><p>The NI Executive and the British Government are also proceeding with implementation of their respective commitments under the Fresh Start Agreement. The Executive signed off on the 2016-17 Budget last December and the Welfare Bill implementing the relevant provisions in the Agreement passed into UK law on 25 November 2015. The UK Treasury has also approved the release of monies from the Stormont House Agreement funding to support integrated education. </p><p>The institutional reforms provided for under the Fresh Start Agreement have also been implemented, including the reduction in the number of Executive Ministries from 12 to 9 and the option for parties entitled to a place in the Executive to instead designate as part of the formal opposition in the Assembly.  This option was taken up by both the UUP and SDLP following the Assembly election last May. </p><p>In June, the Co-Chairs and members of the Flags, Identity, Culture and Tradition Commission were appointed by the Northern Ireland Executive and the Commission is now progressing its work, as foreseen in the Stormont House Agreement and reiterated in Fresh Start. </p><p>On 6 December, the First and deputy First Minister announced the formation of a civic advisory panel, which was provided for under the Stormont House and Fresh Start Agreements.  The 6-person panel will consider specific issues relevant to the Executive&rsquo;s Programme for Government and engage with civic society stakeholders. Reporting to the Executive, the panel may also propose subjects it wishes to consider.  </p><p>With regard to the establishment of a framework for dealing with the legacy of the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement but on which final agreement could not be reached during the Fresh Start Agreement talks, the Government remains committed to the full implementation of these commitments.</p><p>I am continuing to engage with the Secretary of State and with the Northern Ireland Executive and other parties in Northern Ireland, to see how we can to find a route to a final agreement on legacy issues. While there remain a number of outstanding issues, there is an urgent need to achieve progress - so that the institutions can be established and start working to meet the needs of victims and survivors and support broader societal healing and reconciliation. I am therefore working to secure the necessary political agreement to get the legacy bodies established and up and running as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This remains the most efficient and cost-effective way to apply and applications can be submitted at some seventy post offices in Northern Ireland and at over one thousand post offices in the state.</p>  <p>  To accommodate a relatively small number of people with urgent or sudden travel needs, an appointment service is in operation in the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork.  This on-line service provides flexibility in allowing customers to book guaranteed time slots, Monday to Friday.  It removes the necessity for the small number of citizens who need their passports for urgent travel reasons to queue and ensures that waiting times at public counters are minimised.</p>  <p>  The passport reform programme, which is well underway, will deliver further significant customer service improvements in the coming years. From early next year an on-line option for passport renewal for adults will be offered to citizens, whether they are based on the island of Ireland or abroad.  I expect that the efficiencies generated by the online passport application system will result in lower turnaround times, fewer demands on the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork and an increase in customer satisfaction.</p>  <p>  Overall, I am satisfied that the range of service options meets the current needs of passport applicants and that the service improvements on the way will allow the Passport Service to cope with future challenges.  This includes further increases in the number of applications from Northern Ireland.  </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to keep service levels under careful review and adjustments will be made to the deployment of current resources as needed.</p></reply>

I have secured a commitment from the industry to consider the risk it currently associates with demountable defences and the OPW will in the coming weeks be providing the detailed information sought by the industry to that end.</p>  <p>  The OPW and the Department of Finance are continuing to engage, now on a quarterly basis, with Insurance Ireland through the Memorandum of Understanding between Insurance Ireland and the Office of Public Works that was signed on 24 March 2014.</p>  <p>  At the most recent meeting on 8 December 2016, it was decided that a sub group would be created to focus and accelerate the exchange of data and information with the aim of increasing levels of flood cover in areas where demountable defences are in use.</p>  <p>  I am happy with the work of the Group thus far and am confident that it will continue to progress the issue of flood insurance.</p></reply>

The Blackpool Scheme was formally exhibited under the Arterial Drainage Acts in November and December 2015 and has since undergone detailed design. The Scheme will be submitted shortly for Confirmation, as required under the Arterial Drainage Acts, to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform while a tender process for a civil works contractor will take place at the same time. It is hoped that construction will commence in mid 2017.</p><p>The main Lower Lee flood relief scheme for Cork City and the Ballincollig area has now been advanced to outline design and the proposals have this week been placed on formal Public Exhibition. The Exhibition will last for six weeks after which all submissions will be considered before the full detailed design is completed. It is hoped to complete the detailed design and submit the Scheme to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the second half of 2017 with a tender process for a civil works contractor taking place for the first phase of the Scheme at the same time. This would allow a contractor to be appointed early in 2018. The Scheme is being advanced on a phased basis due to its size and the need to minimise disruption to the City and will be implemented over the following 5-6 years.</p><p>The OPW and Cork City Council have sought ways to advance early implementation of the Scheme and the first flood defence elements will be incorporated into a public realm project which is being advanced by the City Council. This element involves the Morrison's Island area and will go a long way to dealing with the regular tidal flooding which affects the City. The public realm project incorporating the flood defence elements is expected to be advanced through planning by the City Council shortly with the expectation that works will be commenced in the second half of 2017.</p><p>Since the commencement of the design process in 2013, a total of &euro;2.55m has been spent so far on both these Schemes.  The following table provides a breakdown of the costs incurred:</p><p><table><tr><th>-</th><th>&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Design and Environmental Consultants</td><td>&euro;1.61m</td></tr><tr><td>Surveys, Geotechnical Investigations</td><td>&euro;0.91m</td></tr><tr><td>Statutory advertising</td><td>&euro;30k</td></tr></table></p><p>Both these Schemes, when completed, will provide the standard 100 year fluvial and, where applicable, 200 tidal level of protection to approximately 2,400 properties around the City. The overall total project cost of the Lower Lee scheme is approximately &euro;140m in current prices while the project cost of the Blackpool Scheme is &euro;16m.

Within this overall total the allocation for flood relief scheme works is &euro;45.561 million.  An additional capital amount of &euro;7 million in Deferred Surrender was also applied to the Flood Risk Management Programme budget allocation in 2016 bringing the total allocation for flood relief works in 2016 to &euro;52.561 million. This allows primarily for costs related to the design, planning and construction of major flood relief schemes and the funding of minor flood relief and coastal erosion works undertaken by local authorities. Provision is also included for the progression of certain strategic studies and programmes including the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) programme, Flood Studies Update and Flood Risk Data Management. </p>  <p>  There are 35 major flood relief schemes currently at various stages of advancement and seven major schemes have commenced construction this year bringing to twelve the total number of schemes at construction stage currently.  It is hoped to commence construction of at least five further schemes over the next 12 months.</p>  <p>  The nature of expenditure on flood relief projects in common with many other capital projects often means that significant payments fall to be met late in the year.  I am advised however that the OPW is on target to spend its full allocation for flood relief works in 2016.</p>  <p>  The allocation for 2017 for flood relief scheme works is &euro;45.019 million.  As part of the Government's commitment to Flood Risk Management in its Capital Investment Plan 2016 to 2021 this allocation is projected to increase incrementally to &euro;100m per year by 2021.  I am satisfied that the overall allocation over this period will allow all of the major schemes currently being designed to commence construction during this time and for work to commence also on some of the structural measures included in the Flood Risk Management Plans under the CFRAM Programme due to be finalised in Spring 2017.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform I have consistently reiterated the need to consider the totality of government spending when examining expenditure priorities. Spending reviews previously played an important role in our successful efforts to reverse unsustainable expenditure growth that was a major contributor to the fiscal crisis.</p><p>The proposed spending review to be undertaken next year is an integral part of the reformed public expenditure architecture drawing on the lessons learned from previous spending reviews. The purpose of future spending reviews will be to ensure that all expenditure is examined when Government is deciding on its spending priorities for the Estimates. Better information and stronger evaluations should also guide and inform those decisions examining the effectiveness of spending in terms of its objectives and the efficiency with which these objectives are secured. </p><p>I have also previously indicated that my Department would also examine proposals on the options available for reinforcing the role of three-year expenditure ceilings in restoring stability to Ireland's public finances and for sustaining this stability over the medium-term period. It is appropriate to review this design of the medium-term expenditure framework in parallel to the spending review process to assess its continued appropriateness in the <font color="#2F2F2F">changed fiscal, economic and political context. As such, the approach to setting medium-term ceilings remains under consideration and will continue to be examined in parallel to the spending review process.</font></p></reply>

The meetings, in accordance with the Programme for Government, are chaired by Minister of State Eoghan Murphy.  Other government bodies which attend this are the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, Enterprise Ireland, InterTradeIreland and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  </p><p>The OGP also works with industry representative bodies in relation to supporting &quot;Meet the Buyer&quot; events.  These events attract significant interest from suppliers and buyers from across the public sector, North and South, and focus on the opportunities for SMEs with major public sector buyers across the island.  In 2016 there were two events, one in Belfast and one in Cork, which were attended by over 900 businesses and buyers from across the public sector, North and South, which focused on the opportunities for SMEs with major public sector buyers across the island.</p><p>It should also be pointed out that the OGP transposed the EU Public Sector Procurement Directive which amongst other things is aimed at opening up opportunities for small businesses, including micro business, that want to tender for public contracts by, for example, encouraging more on-line open tendering, reducing bidders' turnover requirements, promoting the use of proportional and reasonable insurance requirements, breaking larger contracts into lots.

Given the &euro;12bn quantum of annual spend, it is essential that a strategic approach is adopted and value for money is achieved. Since of OGP commenced operations in 2014, it has engaged with stakeholders both nationally and internationally to seek and implement new and innovative approaches to procurement. Most recently these reforms would include:</p><p>-  the transposition and implementation of a revised suite of EU Procurement Directives;</p><p>-  informed consideration of SME issues through the establishment of the SME Higher Level Group and Advisory Groups;</p><p>-  Progress Report of the High Level Group on SME Access to Public Procurement;</p><p>-  Commitments in the Action Plan for Jobs in relation to SME access to procurement and developing further strategies to improve SMEs access and innovation;</p><p>-  Improving how SMEs can access public procurement opportunities via the OGP Published Schedule, the national portal, eTenders and OGP's Helpdesk;</p><p>-  Participation in training opportunities to assist SMEs in developing the necessary tendering skills and where necessary to build consortia.</p><p>-  The introduction of the Tender Advisory Service;</p><p>The published by the OGP and launched by Minister of State Murphy in September, indicates that 95% of the analysed expenditure is with firms with a base in the State and the majority of the spend analysed is with SMEs.

But the Irish Government has been clear about its commitment to the successful implementation of the programmes and its ambition to see successor programmes post-2020.</p><p>As part of the Government's contingency planning for Brexit, my Department identified the implications for the two programmes as an issue that would have to be addressed in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Executive and the European Commission, and that process commenced immediately following the referendum result.  </p><p>On 27 October 2016 I was pleased to be able to announce that agreement had been reached between my officials and their Northern Ireland counterparts on the terms of Letters of Offer to programme beneficiaries.  My objective was to Brexit-proof Letters of Offer to the greatest extent possible and to give programme beneficiaries assurance as to the legal and financial commitments they are entering into so they can plan for the future with confidence.  I believe that we have achieved that, and that it will be possible to proceed with the full implementation of the programmes on a firmer basis than would otherwise have been the case.</p><p>My objective now is to see the current programmes implemented fully and to secure agreement from the EU and the UK for successor programmes post-2020.</p></reply>

Some of these recommendations had a direct associated programme cost, while others related to policy initiatives that could be taken to support rural economic development.</p>  <p>  The priority recommendation made by CEDRA was the need for a co-ordinated approach to rural development across Government.  The assignment of responsibility to my Department for regional and rural development addresses this key recommendation.  The forthcoming Action Plan for Rural Development will, furthermore, provide an overarching structure for the implementation of initiatives across Government which will benefit rural Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Other policy measures across Government that support the recommendations in the CEDRA report include the creation of the Local Enterprise Office network as a &ldquo;first-stop-shop&rdquo; for micro-enterprises, the preparation for the rollout of high speed broadband, and the provision of loans for small businesses through the Microfinance Loan Fund. </p>  <p>  Programmes under my own Department&rsquo;s remit that can be directly related to the recommendations in the CEDRA report include the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the Rural Economic Development Zones (REDZ) pilot initiative in 2015, and the 2016 REDZ programme. </p>  <p>In 2016, I approved funding of &euro;9.865 million to 172 projects under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme.  I also approved funding of &euro;5.3 million for 41 REDZ projects.

The report also recommended that An Post should, following appropriate consultation with postmasters and others, review and amend the five-year strategy for the post office network.</p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>commits to acting on the recommendations in the report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group.  A number of Working Groups have been established to progress the recommendations, including through the establishment of a Network Renewal Implementation Group, which is being independently chaired by Mr Bobby Kerr.  This Group is examining the number and spatial distribution of post offices, branch modernisation, the streamlining of products and services, postmaster payments and contracts, and training and qualifications for post office employees.  I anticipate that this work will conclude shortly.</p><p>I separately established the Post Office Hub Working Group to identify potential models under which the post offices could act as community hubs, especially in rural areas. I chaired a number of meetings of this Group, which has now concluded its deliberations and is currently finalising its report.</p><p>My officials have also been examining the potential for the post offices to deliver other services, including options for the renewal of motor tax. A number of potential options for this service have been identified and proposals are currently being finalised in consultation with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. </p></reply>

The 2014-2020 LEADER programme has become operational this year, with Funding Agreements signed for the delivery of 28 Local Development Strategies. </p><p>Funding under the 2014-2020 LEADER programme is allocated on the basis of sub-regional areas, rather than on a county administrative basis.  Table 1 below shows details of the allocations for the sub-regional areas that were made in 2016 to cover the full duration of the programme.  These allocations are not annualised to allow greater flexibility over the course of the programming period to the Local Action Groups which manage the programme in each area.  In addition to the &euro;220 million in allocations detailed on the table, a further &euro;30 million in competitive funding is available over the lifetime of the programme for Cooperation projects, Artisan Food projects and Rural Economic Development Zones. An initial call for Cooperation projects was announced on 23<sup>rd</sup>November 2016. </p><p>The total amount of funding paid out by my Department this year related to LEADER, as of 30th November 2016, was approximately &euro;8.6 million.  This figure, which is provisional, includes payments made in respect of the 2007-2013 LEADER programme as well as the 2014-2020 programme.  Further payments were processed in December and the final expenditure figure for 2016 will be published in 2017 as part of my Department's Appropriation Account. </p><p>Expenditure under LEADER is expected to increase in 2017 as the programme becomes fully operational. A sum of &euro;40 million has been allocated for LEADER payments in 2017 as part of the Estimates process. The Government is committed to ensuring that there is appropriate funding available to the LEADER programme over its lifetime and funding requirements will be reviewed on a year-by-year basis as part of the annual Estimates process. </p><p>Table 1: Disbursements for LEADER 2014-2020 allocations by sub-regional area<table><tr><th>Sub- Regional Area </th><th>Programme Allocation </th></tr><tr><td>Rural Dublin </td><td>&euro;6,370,438.43 </td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td>&euro;5,261,600.01 </td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>&euro;6,903,123.57 </td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow </td><td>&euro;6,336,549.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Carlow </td><td>&euro;6,416,803.43 </td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny </td><td>&euro;7,791,572.91 </td></tr><tr><td>Wexford </td><td>&euro;9,840,140.56 </td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary </td><td>&euro;10,103,443.28 </td></tr><tr><td>County Waterford </td><td>&euro;7,522,796.18 </td></tr><tr><td>County Cork </td><td>&euro;13,938,823.22 </td></tr><tr><td>Kerry </td><td>&euro;10,219,868.29 </td></tr><tr><td>Clare </td><td>&euro;8,920,224.65 </td></tr><tr><td>County Limerick </td><td>&euro;9,276,593.96 </td></tr><tr><td>County Galway </td><td>&euro;12,195,883.61 </td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>&euro;11,121,431.88 </td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon </td><td>&euro;8,852,659.22 </td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>&euro;6,101,862.01 </td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>&euro;5,998,474.74 </td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>&euro;7,655,647.81 </td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>&euro;8,522,285.84 </td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>&euro;12,913,877.86 </td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>&euro;7,592,719.51 </td></tr><tr><td>Laois </td><td>&euro;7,124,586.86 </td></tr><tr><td>Longford </td><td>&euro;7,597,623.07 </td></tr><tr><td>Offaly </td><td>&euro;8,036,763.90 </td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>&euro;7,384,206.22 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>&euro;220,000,000.00 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

As required by the Mental Health Act, 2001, the Inspector is a Consultant Psychiatrist.  </p>  <p>  The functions of the Inspector include the inspection of every approved centre at least once in each year.  In 2015, a total of 61 approved centres were inspected by the Inspector of Mental Health Services and inspection team.  Of these, six were compliant with all applicable regulations and rules.  Each of the other centres were non-compliant in at least one area, these non-compliances ranging from low-risk to critical-risk, with very few in the latter category.  A copy of each inspection report is available on the website of the Mental Health Commission, with details of the relevant non-compliances, where applicable.</p>  <p>  In each case of non-compliance, the approved centre was requested to produce a schedule of Corrective and Preventative Actions to deal with the existing non-compliance and to ensure that it did not recur. Each centre produced such a schedule. The Mental Health Commission monitors enforcement actions and with cases of critical-or high-risk non-compliance, the Inspector may conduct a  report inspection or a Focused Inspection to ensure that the corrective action has taken place.</p></reply>

This shortage is repeated worldwide.  A number of developed countries have significant nursing shortage at present, and are in direct competition with Ireland for nurses in the international labour market.  I and my officials recognise the importance of recruiting and retaining nurses within the public health system as does the HSE.</p>  <p>  The HSE has been focused on increasing nursing numbers over the past two years as the budgetary position has improved and is committed to ongoing recruitment of nurses and midwives.  The number of nurses and midwives employed in the public health system stood at 35,693 (WTE's) at the end of October 2016,  an increase of 159 on the end September 2016 figure; 530 more than the end October 2015 figure, and 1,289 more than the end October 2014 figure.</p>  <p>  In September 2016 the HSE set up a Project Group  to review nursing workforce planning, recruitment and retention.  The main objectives of this Project Group include identifying current recruitment black spots in a coordinated way and developing measures to incentivise and attract people to these essential posts, identifying potential for agency conversion and identifying employment opportunities for 2017 nurse graduates.</p>  <p>  The HSE has continuously open recruitment campaigns in place (i.e. no closing date) to ensure that all eligible applicants for nursing posts can apply at any time to work in hospitals throughout the country.  It is running an open recruitment event from 28 to 30 December in Dr Steevens&rsquo; Hospital for nurses and midwives from all disciplines who are interested in working in the Irish Public Health Service.  Attendees can apply and interview for jobs on the day and get information on Nursing and Midwifery Board (NMBI) registration and Garda vetting requirements.  This will be followed by a series of careers events for nurses throughout 2017.</p>  <p>  Retention of the nursing staff employed by the HSE also needs to be addressed and this is recognised.  The HSE are in the process of analysing the data from exit interviews from nursing and midwifery disciplines to identify trends.  In addition to this the HSE will survey new starters to identify areas of improvement in orientation.  Providing a full induction can ease transition when taking up a new post and enable the new nurse/midwife to get up to speed with the work environment, thereby supporting retention in the long run.</p></reply>

The new proposal will re-commit to the core principles of the Strategy, and will inform how the State approaches older persons services into the future.  The new proposals will see the introduction of an annual forum for stakeholders and Departments/Agencies, with the first such forum taking place in early 2017.  Structures will be implemented for engagement between relevant Government Departments and State Agencies and relevant stakeholders on how the Strategy&rsquo;s principles are being applied.  The revised arrangements were approved by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy on 27 October 2016.  These new arrangements will now be communicated to stakeholders and arrangements made to commence implementation. </p>  <p>  As part of the NPAS implementation process, a Healthy and Positive Ageing Initiative has been established in collaboration with the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies to measure the impact of the Strategy and establish an ongoing system for measuring and reporting on Positive Ageing.  The Initiative aims to monitor changes in older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing linked to the goals and objectives of the NPAS.  This will be done primarily through the development of positive ageing indicators to be published every two years.  The Initiative is intended to provide evidence of the factors contributing to healthy ageing, including at local level and ultimately inform policy responses to population ageing in Ireland.  The first National Positive Ageing Indicators report was published in November 2016 and highlights many of the positive and negative aspects of growing old in Ireland.</p></reply>

All employees including medical staff are required to disclose and report incidents in line with the HSE's Safety Incident Management Policy.  Creating a culture of open disclosure and learning from the things that go wrong is the bedrock of making systems safer.  Open Disclosure is defined as 'an open consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in healthcare.  This includes expressing regret for what has happened, keeping the patient informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the adverse event'.</p>  <p>  In  November 2015 the Government gave its approval to the drafting of provisions to support open disclosure of patient safety incidents.  This will be included in the Department of Justice and Equality&rsquo;s Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill which is due to be published before the end of the year.  Provisions to support open disclosure are to be included at Committee Stage and I have asked my officials to keep in close contact with the Department of Justice and Equality on this matter.  The legislation is part of a broader package of reforms aimed at improving the experience of those who are affected by adverse events.</p>  <p>  The background to the proposed legislation lies in the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance which recommended that legislation be enacted to provide legal protection/privilege for open disclosure of adverse events to patients.  The provisions are therefore designed to give legal protection/privilege for the information and apology made to a patient when made in line with the legislation.  The apology cannot be interpreted as an admission of liability and cannot be used in litigation against the provider.  This approach is intended to create a positive voluntary climate for open disclosure and will support the National Policy on Open Disclosure which was developed jointly by the HSE and the State Claims Agency in November 2013.</p>  <p>  This legislation builds on the joint development by the HSE and State Claims Agency of the National Policy on Open Disclosure (2013).  The HSE is progressing the implementation of the Policy across all health and social care services.  We all know that when error or harm is experienced by a patient, the trust and confidence of that patient and their family are compromised.  That is why honest, open disclosure and communication, which demonstrate empathy and sensitivity, are so essential.  The intent of this legislation is to provide certain legal protections for healthcare staff for open disclosure.  This will give further support to those staff in their communications with patients and family members if an adverse event occurs.  The Ethical Code of Practice set out by the Medical Council also makes clear the responsibilities of doctors in relation to open disclosure.</p>  <p>  The open disclosure provisions form part of a number of initiatives to improve the management of patient safety incidents.  HIQA and the Mental Health Commission are at an advanced stage of development of Standards on the Conduct of Reviews of Patient Safety Incidents which expand on the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare.  This set of standards along with the mandatory reporting of serious reportable events provided for in the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill and the provisions intended for open disclosure will provide a comprehensive patient-centred approach to preventing, managing and learning from incidents.</p></reply>

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria: </p><p>1. the health needs of the public; </p><p>2. the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p><p>3. the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement; </p><p>4. the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p><p>5. the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;</p><p>6. the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p><p>7. the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p><p>8. the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and </p><p>9. the resources available to the HSE. </p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Respreeza for maintenance treatment of emphysema in adults with documented severe alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency.</p><p>In June of this year the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a health technology assessment on the cost effectiveness of this treatment. The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation on 9 December 2016. The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug and did not recommend it for reimbursement.</p><p>A summary of the health technology assessment has been published on the NCPE website and is available at:<i></i><i></i>.</p><p>The HSE will consider the NCPE assessment, and other expert advice, as part of its decision-making process for reimbursement. This decision will be made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>I understand  that the NCPE is arranging to meet the patient representative group, the Alpha One Foundation,  as soon as possible to provide them with an update in relation to the recommendation of the NCPE.</p><p>In relation to compassionate access schemes, I have previously asked manufacturers to show compassion and to maintain compassionate access schemes for patients during the assessment process by the HSE and this remains the position. However, the operation of these schemes is at the discretion of manufacturers. The manufacturer has informed the NCPE that there are 17 patients in the compassionate programme receiving Respreeza. The manufacturer has also confirmed to the NCPE that the programme will be extended until the end of January 2017.</p></reply>

With regard to elective procedures, my Department has been assured that, in order to address the current waiting times, the hospital will maximise the use of of existing theatre and other gynaecology resources within the hospital, including rostering, as well as those in other hospitals across the South/South West Hospital Group. </p>  <p>  In relation to this particular query, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly. </p></reply>

While recognising that demand for acute hospital services has increased this year with a 4% increase in inpatient and day case activity nationally to end October compared with the same period last year, the important issue for patients is how long they wait.</p>  <p>  In August, I asked the HSE to develop a Waiting List Action Plan for 2016 to reduce by year end the number of patients waiting over 18 months on the Inpatient Daycase Waiting List.  Since then, approximately 8,000 patients have come off the waiting list nationally.  Additional funding of &euro;11.25m has been allocated under the Winter Initiative in order to support patient treatment under this Action Plan.  Of this, &euro;7 million has been allocated to a targeted waiting list programme for Orthopaedics and Scoliosis with over 600 patients benefiting.  Already 570 orthopaedic and scoliosis patients have been treated or are scheduled for treatment through this initiative.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 provides for the treatment of our longest-waiting patients.  &euro;20m is being allocated to the NTPF in 2017, rising to &euro;55m in 2018. </p>  <p>  Approval has been granted to the NTPF on the basis of a proposal which outlines the use of the first tranche of funding, in the region of &euro;5m, for an initiative focusing on daycase procedures.  The NTPF and HSE are currently engaging regarding a proposal for the use of the remaining &euro;10m.  Certain specialties will be considered in this context, including orthopaedics.</p></reply>

Supporting infrastructure, procured through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of  multi-disciplinary primary health care. However, while the Government's objective is to deliver a high quality, integrated and cost effective health care service the mechanism and timescale for delivery of primary care centres is dependent on a number of factors.  Some of these factors are outside the control of the Health Service Executive. Regardless of the delivery mechanism, all potential primary care infrastructure is subject to suitable locations being offered / provided / available, to successful planning processes and GP commitment to sharing accommodation and delivering health care services with HSE staff. In addition the operational lease mechanism is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to adequate financing. </p><p>Delivery of primary care infrastructure is a dynamic process, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances including the feasibility of implementation. The current status of the projects is set out in the table below.  However, it should be noted that 54 primary care centres have been opened since 2011.  In addition, to the primary care centres shown in the table below as scheduled shown in 2017, a further 16 primary care centres are planned to open in 2017 or early 2018.</p><p><b>Primary Care Centres:  July 2012 announcement - 35 locations</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>Count</b></th><th><b>HSE Region</b></th><th><b>County</b></th><th><b>Location / PCT Name</b></th><th><b>Delivery Mechanism</b></th><th><b>Project Status - Q3 2016                                             PQ40955/16:   answer date 13/12/2016</b></th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Rowlagh / North Clondalkin</td><td>Direct build</td><td>Stage 2a design team report completed.

However, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is not complacent in this regard; we continue to seek improvements and opportunities to implement the latest innovative sustainability research and practices.</p>  <p>  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 provides the statutory basis for Government policy on climate change.  As required by the Act, the development of a National Mitigation Plan (NMP) is being led by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment and represents a whole-of-Government approach, involving this Department, which is responsible for inputs in relation to the agriculture and forest sector.</p>  <p>  In addition, a range of actions are currently being undertaken to make Irish farming more environmentally sustainable, including measures under the Rural Development Programme (RDP) which is worth almost &euro;4 billion over 7 years.  The RDP is strongly targeted towards environmental benefits, including the Beef Data and Genomics Programme which is directly targeted at the climate emissions of 30,000 beef farmers.  The objective is to lower the intensity of GHG emissions by improving the quality and efficiency of the national beef herd.</p>  <p>  The Pasture Profit Index, the Carbon Navigator Tool and the Agricultural Catchments Programme also help to reduce carbon emissions per unit of output produced and help protect our rivers.</p>  <p>  We are a world leader in areas such as sustainable auditing and carbon foot-printing under the Origin Green programme.  Origin Green is a strategic priority in Food Wise 2025, the ten year strategy for the agri-food industry which includes a strong commitment to measure and monitor the sustainability credentials of the sector.  As part of the implementation of Food Wise, an Environmental Sustainability Committee has been established.  The implementation process will include evaluation and assessment of the delivery of sustainability and mitigation actions.</p>  <p>  We will continue to pursue our ambition to move towards carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.</p></reply>

Changes to fisheries policy involving access or restriction to fishing opportunities or fishing areas come within the sole competency of the EU.  Only the EU Commission may propose changes and any such proposal must be adopted under the co-decision process by the EU Parliament and EU Council.  Member States, in consultation with the Commission, Member States affected and stakeholders are permitted to introduce non-discriminatory measures for the conservation and management of fish stocks within the 12 mile zone subject to compliance with policy and procedures set down in CFP Regulation.</p>  <p>  The fishing opportunities available to vessels are set out on a stock by stock basis in the Fisheries Council TAC and quota Regulation each year.  Member States may engage in swapping of quota with other Member States, and it appears Lithuania has done this to secure increased Mackerel and Horse Mackerel quota in ICES Zones VI, VII, VIII and associated areas (north western waters) with other member states.</p>  <p>  For 2016, according to the latest update on the EU FIDES database, Lithuania has a quota of 2,140 tonnes of mackerel in North western waters of which 140 tonnes was the initial allocation, the balance was achieved through swaps.  It has a quota for Horse Mackerel in the same area of 2,535 tonnes fully achieved through swaps.  None of these swaps took place with Ireland.</p>  <p>  Operational issues in relation to sea fisheries control are a matter for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA).  The SFPA have advised that the vessel to which the deputy refers was recently operating within the Irish exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and has since left.  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA), was aware of its presence and monitored it continuously once it entered IRL waters.  While the vessel was in Irish waters, the Naval Service Ellen carried out a full routine inspection of the vessel while on maritime security and defence patrol.</p>  <p>  The SFPA continuously monitors the activity of all vessels operating in Irish waters, in keeping with standard practice, throughout their fishing operations within Irish EEZ through satellite Vessel Monitoring, Automatic Identification System (AIS) and by review and assessment of their declared catches received via ERS.  Additional monitoring at sea is conducted by the Naval Service and Air Corps, both of which operate under service level agreements with SFPA for the delivery of &lsquo;at-sea&rsquo; monitoring, surveillance and inspection.</p></reply>

I am informed by them that an entitlement under the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) is a chargeable asset for capital gains tax (CGT) purposes.  All entitlements held by farmers under the SPS expired on the 31 December 2014, when it was replaced by the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS).  Accordingly, any gains or losses arising on the disposal of entitlements prior to the abolition of the SPS fall within the scope of CGT in the same manner as chargeable gains or allowable losses made on the disposal of any other chargeable assets.</p>  <p>  I am also informed that a claim for CGT relief may arise under section 538 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of losses incurred by farmers as a result of the abolition of SPS entitlements where the entitlements were purchased by the farmers concerned.  The allowable loss is the capital loss equivalent to the amount incurred by the person when the entitlement was acquired.  Where a claim for relief for an allowable loss is made, the amount of the loss can only be set off against other chargeable gains made by the farmer in that year or in any subsequent year.  As with all capital losses, those incurred as a result of the abolition of SPS entitlements are not allowable against income.  Furthermore, there is no time limit within which the loss may be carried forward and set off against future chargeable gains.</p>  <p>  Apart from the taxation question, it should also be noted that farmers who were eligible to receive a direct payment greater than &euro;100 in 2013 (e.g. under the SPS Scheme) and who submitted a valid Basic Payment Scheme application in 2015, were eligible to receive an automatic allocation of entitlements under the 2015 Basic Payment Scheme.</p></reply>

The agreed text refers in particular to the need to tackle unfair trading practices.  Council took note of the fact that a regulatory approach at EU level could complement existing voluntary initiatives, and called on the Commission to undertake an impact assessment with a view to possibly proposing an EU legislative framework.</p>  <p>  In broad terms I welcome the provisions in the draft conclusions. The Presidency has reflected Member States&rsquo; concerns in relation to tackling unfair trading practices, where the need for an EU legislative framework proved to be one of the more contentious items during the discussions.  I welcome the call in the Conclusions for the Commission to provide legal clarity in relation to exemptions from competition law for producer organisations and co-operatives, and note the inclusion of references to the development of futures markets, which is something that is being actively pursued in Ireland.  I look forward to the Commission now acting on these Conclusions in the context of its future efforts to strengthen the position of the farmer in the food supply chain.</p>  <p>  One of the key elements in protecting the producer&rsquo;s position in the food supply chain is providing a means by which primary producers can strengthen their position when negotiating the sale of their produce.  The European Union (Beef Producer Organisations) Regulations 2016 S.I. No 49 of 2016 implement Commission Regulation No. 1308/2013, which provides the basis for the recognition of producer organisations in the beef sector. The Regulation allows inter alia primary producers to collectively negotiate contracts for the supply of cattle for slaughter. In order to assist groups of primary producers who wish to become recognised Producer Organisations an application to the European Commission as part of the second amendment to Ireland&rsquo;s RDP has been submitted, which provides for the funding of start-up activities for Producer Organisations in the Beef Sector.  Funding will be provided for prospective POs to engage a facilitator to help with recruitment and start-up activities. Facilitators might be advisors, business planners, legal advisors, accountants etc. Advisors will fall into one of two categories; giving advice on setup of the PO&rsquo;s statues, fulfilling Department requirements etc, or advice on business planning and membership recruitment. Payment for advice in each of these areas will be capped at &euro;1,500 in accordance with the provisions of the RDP regulation. However, the PO is free to engage further advice at their own cost. Total expenditure will be capped at &euro;300,000.</p>  <p>  It is expected to have approval of Ireland&rsquo;s second amendment to the RDP in early 2017 and once this is received, funding will be made available to recognised Producer Organisations in the beef sector and arrangements for applications for recognition of Producer Organisations will follow.</p>  <p>  At major wholesale and retail level, the Consumer Protection Act 2007 (Grocery Goods Undertakings) Regulations  2016 which were signed by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, entered into force on 30 April 2016.  The Regulations are enforced by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC). Since that date, all major retailers and wholesalers have nominated liaison persons for the purposes of the Regulations. The CCPC has engaged with key stakeholders and has held both bilaterals and a seminar with the main retailers and wholesalers  to raise awareness of the requirements of the Regulations. Annual compliance reports for the period 30 April - 31 December 2016 have to be submitted to the CCPC by the relevant retailers and wholesalers by 31 March 2017. Ireland&rsquo;s legislation is one of the more advanced among member States, some of whom rely on voluntary codes of practice.</p></reply>

The regulation also provides that priority under the National Reserve is given to &lsquo;young farmers&rsquo; and to &lsquo;new entrants to farming&rsquo;. A new entrant is defined as a farmer who commenced their agricultural activity during the previous two years.  The Regulations governing the operation of the National Reserve also include an optional provision whereby Member States may use the National Reserve to allocate new entitlements or give a top-up on the value of existing entitlements for persons who suffer from a &lsquo;Specific Disadvantage&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Following my Department&rsquo;s consultation with the EU Commission, the then Minister announced in March 2015 that the group commonly known as &ldquo;Old Young Farmers&rdquo;, who established their holding between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2009, and who, due to the timeframe of setting up their holding did not benefit from either the Installation Aid or the Young Farmer category of the National Reserve, can be considered as a &lsquo;group suffering from specific disadvantage&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  The group of farmers commonly referred to as &lsquo;forgotten farmers&rsquo; comprises farmers aged under 40, who established their holdings prior to 2008, and who hold low value entitlements.  Preliminary analysis carried out by my Department shows there are some 3,900 farmers in this category.  An estimation of the cost of increasing the value of existing entitlements to the National Average for these 3,900 farmers stands at over &euro;12 million.</p>  <p>  There was no National Reserve in 2016 as all available funding had been utilised under the 2015 scheme.  In order to provide for a National Reserve in 2017 funding is required to replenish the Reserve.  EU Regulations governing the scheme provide that funding for the replenishment of the National Reserve may be obtained by means of surrender of entitlements that remain unused by farmers for two consecutive years and by clawback derived following the sale of entitlements without land. It is envisaged that funding derived from these two sources in 2017 will be very limited. The Regulations also provide for the application of a linear cut to the value of all farmers&rsquo; entitlements to replenish the National Reserve.</p>  <p>  Under the National Reserve priority access must be given to the two mandatory categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo;.  Support for other categories such as those that may be regarded as suffering from &lsquo;specific disadvantage&rsquo; can only be considered once the two mandatory categories have been catered for.</p>  <p>  Consultation between Department officials and the Direct Payments Advisory Committee comprising members of the main farming organisations, agricultural education and farm advisory bodies takes place annually as part of the decision making process for the National Reserve. This meeting in relation to the 2017 National Reserve will take place early in 2017.</p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to the National Reserve for 2017, including decisions regarding categories which fall outside of the two priority categories of &lsquo;young farmers&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrants to farming&rsquo; that require EU Commission approval, will be considered once the position on potential funding has been established.</p></reply>

The Plan targets a 30% increase in production derived from onshore close containment recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS).  Considerable international developmental effort is being put into land based RAS systems.  A number of technological challenges need to be overcome to make RAS economically viable.  The National Strategic Plan identified the need for additional applied research and development to improve the performance of RAS in terms of reduced water usage, more effective treatment of return water in terms of key enrichment parameters, reduction of energy usage in water pumping and treatment, improvement of system reliability to avoid stock losses and animal welfare and disease management issues.</p>  <p>  BIM funded a 2015 study by the Irish Salmon Growers Association &lsquo;Potential for Land Based Salmon Growout in Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) in Ireland&rsquo;.  The report describes in detail all technical aspects of RAS production and system design and operations. It also covers important biological aspects of land based salmon production. The Report states that its main aim is to assess the viability of land based salmon production in RAS under Irish conditions. This includes detailed information of capital expenditure and operational costs as well as the market situation for salmon. The report concludes that the capital cost of setting up a large scale RAS unit is very high and that there are still technical difficulties to be overcome to achieve reliability in land based facilities.</p>  <p>  As part of my Department&rsquo;s &euro;240 million European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme, a new Aquaculture &lsquo;Knowledge Gateway Scheme&rsquo; was launched in 2016.  I have provided BIM with a budget of &euro;8.2 million for that Scheme over the course of the Programme.  In close collaboration with aquaculture enterprises and researchers, the Scheme aims to develop knowledge, innovation and technology in the aquaculture sector to ensure its sustainable development.  An important part of the focus of the Scheme will be the applied research and development on RAS identified in the National Strategic Plan.  This may take the form of applied research undertaken by BIM on behalf of the sector or initiatives from industry operators or research institutions.</p>  <p>  To further incentivise RAS developments, I recently increased grants rates under the EMFF Sustainable Aquaculture Scheme for RAS developments to the maximum possible 50% for 2017 applications.</p></reply>

My primary aim from the outset was to achieve an outcome that protected the overall interests of the Irish fishing industry while respecting the most up-to-date scientific advice for stocks of critical importance to our fleets. I am pleased that we have secured a good deal for Irish fishermen at the EU Fisheries Council that will support our fishing industry over the coming year and which is sustainable in terms of the fish stocks on which we are dependant.</p>  <p>  In order to inform negotiations at the December Fisheries Council, I had an assessment of the impacts of the Commission proposal for Total Allowable Catches and quotas for 2017 undertaken.  To facilitate and inform these deliberations, an open consultation process was put in place, whereby stakeholders were asked to submit their comments and observations on the Commission proposal for fishing opportunities for 2017.</p>  <p>  In the run up to Council I had separate bilateral meetings with my French and Northern Ireland counterparts as the key players concerning stocks of interest to the Irish fleets. There were also meetings at official level with France, UK, Netherlands, Belgium and Spain in advance of December Council.  In particular, I worked closely with Michelle McIlveen of Northern Ireland and we submitted a joint proposal concerning our most important demersal fishery, prawns.  This joint paper was, I believe, instrumental in overturning the original commission proposal and producing a 9% increase in this very valuable stock.</p>  <p>  At the Council itself I had a series of meetings with a range of relevant Minsters and, of course, Commissioner Vella and the Slovakian Presidency.  With regard to the latter, I was able to explain the history and huge importance of the Hague preferences and to ensure their support in resisting any attempts to dilute the application of the preferences.</p>  <p>  In the end, I secured 233,500 tonnes of quotas worth &euro;280 million for Irish fishermen for 2017. This represents an increase of 17,390 tonnes over 2016 and a 6% increase by value.  I am satisfied that I have managed to turn an extremely worrying set of proposals from the Commission into a much improved outcome for the Irish fishing industry.</p></reply>

The scheme is fully funded by the European Union and the relevant Competent Authorities in each Member State are obliged to ensure that the requirements of the governing EU Regulations are observed and that only valid applications that fully comply with the requirements are paid. The administration of the scheme in each Member State is subjected to close scrutiny by officials of the EU Commission and the EU Court of Auditors to ensure that the regulatory requirements are met and that the Schemes are applied in a uniform manner across the European Union.</p>  <p>  In particular my Department is bound, under EU Regulations, to maintain the accuracy the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), which underpins the processing of applications under the BPS and Direct Payment Schemes. Given the importance of the LPIS database in underpinning these payments, worth in excess of &euro;1.5billion annually, my Department is obliged under EU Regulations to ensure its accuracy. All applications under the BPS are subject to administrative checks including ongoing reviews of updated imagery, with a further 5% also subject to land eligibility inspections in compliance with EU legislation.</p>  <p>  Where issues preventing payment are identified contact is immediately made with the applicant concerned in order to resolve the query. Work is well underway in resolving the queries that have arisen following these checks and farmers are being contacted as necessary.  Many of these issues are not LPIS related and may relate to dual claims, probate, late application, etc.  To date payments in excess of &euro;1.15 billion have issued to over 121,600 applicants. Approximately another 5,000 applicants have entitlements under the BPS or have an application in to receive entitlements. Regular payment runs are being made in respect of all applicants whose applications are fully processed and who have no outstanding errors.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-16a.1320.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016121600088#WRV00500"><p>I am keenly aware of the challenges that the mushroom sector is experiencing in the aftermath of the UK Referendum decision to exit the EU, particularly in light of recent fluctuations in currency.  I am focused on working with the industry to meet these difficulties in the months and years ahead.  I have also established in my own Department a dedicated unit to consider the direct impact of Brexit on our industry.  Although it is still a serious situation, there has been a modest reversal in the decreasing Sterling exchange rate in the last two weeks, with Sterling now holding at around 84p to the Euro.   </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 underpins my Department&rsquo;s efforts through strategic investment in key areas, such as in its agencies and in the agrifood sector. As part of Budget 2017 I have secured an additional &euro;700,000 in funding for capital investments in the Commercial Horticulture sector.  This will increase the budget for this scheme to &euro;5 million in 2017.  In addition, the Horticulture sector will have access to the &euro;150 million low interest cash flow support loan fund announced in Budget 2017, providing access to highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000, at an interest rate of 2.95%. </p>  <p>  My Department, along with the various State agencies, in particular Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland, is working closely with the industry to provide the necessary support and assistance.  Bord Bia is actively supporting the sector in the areas of Market Intelligence, UK consumer research and Quality Assurance.  They recently held a currency and negotiation workshop specifically targeted at the sector which I understand was very well received by the mushroom industry.  In recent weeks, the CEO of Bord Bia and I have held a series of meetings with senior executives from the UK retailers, to highlight the obstacles that our producers are facing.  I understand that in recent weeks, representatives of mushroom growers have met with a more positive reaction from their UK Multiple customers, to their need for fair and reasonable returns for their produce from the marketplace. </p>  <p>  Funding for a pilot programme on LEAN processes has been provided through Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland.  The programme is commencing with 6 mushroom growers, to assess efficiency across all aspects of the business, including supply chain, innovation, marketing and logistics.  It is hoped that a template could be developed through this programme that will enable growers to optimise their production costs further. </p>  <p>  I would also draw attention to support being provided to the industry through National and EU Schemes. </p>  <p>  Under the National Development Plan (NDP) 2007 &ndash; 2013 my Department implemented the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector.  During this period my Department paid out over &euro;4 million in grant payments to mushroom growers which supported &euro;10.1 million in investment.   </p>  <p>  To ensure ongoing support for the sector, my Department extended, under EU sanction, the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector to run until 31 December 2019.  In 2014 and 2015 a total of &euro;1.64 million in grant aid was paid to mushroom growers.  The grant aid paid supported some &euro;4.1 million in investment by these growers. </p>  <p>  Under the 2016 Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector, my Department issued approvals in the amount of &euro;1.33 million in aid to growers in the mushroom sector, supporting &euro;3.3 million in proposed investment.  I have also  provided a commitment to ensure that payments under this scheme are made as early as possible, so as to try to alleviate any financial pressure that growers are currently facing.</p>  <p>  In October, I arranged the payment of just under &euro;1.57 million to one of our mushroom producer organisations.</p></reply>

Economic growth there is expected to intensify following the recent easing of economic sanctions and so it could potentially be an important destination for Irish beef and sheepmeat in the future. </p>  <p>  My Department is constantly working in close collaboration with the industry, Bord Bia and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in gaining access to third country markets for Irish meats.  The importance of market access is recognised by Food Wise 2025 and has been given an added impetus by the results of the UK referendum on Brexit.  It is  important to have as many alternative markets available to our exporters as possible.</p></reply>

A total of 24 landowners who classified themselves as non-farmers planted forests in Co Cavan so far during 2016; it&rsquo;s worth noting that 17 of these had addresses in Co. Cavan itself.  So far in 2016 there were no private institutional investors approved for payment under the afforestation scheme in the county.  The total area planted by non farmers represented 53% of all new planting during the year which is above the national average.  It is difficult to determine however if the 24 non-farmer individuals already owned the land or if they had bought the land specifically to plant. It is worth noting that farmers are entitled to sell their land to the highest bidder and if forestry is improving the price that farmers can receive for their land then these landowners stand to benefit.</p>  <p>  According to the CSO Census of Agriculture 2010, the average farm size in Co Cavan is 26.4 hectares while the average forest established by non-farmers in Co Cavan since the launch of the new forestry programme is just 7.2 hectares.  This suggests that in situations where non-farmers are buying land for forestry they are not buying entire farms for this purpose.</p>  <p>  In 2016 alone, forestry payments worth over &euro;2.6m were paid by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to just under 430 landowners with Cavan addresses.  These payments are an important source of income not just for people in direct receipt of these payments but also for local shops, petrol stations and other local businesses which are a vital part of a rural community.  According to the latest national forest inventory total forest cover in the county is just 8.7% which is well below the national average which stands at 10.5%.  The Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine therefore plan to continue to offer forestry as a land use option for farmers and non-farmers throughout the country.</p></reply>

The aim of the RHI is to build on the progress already made in the renewable heating sector and to help reach Ireland&rsquo;s 12% target by 2020. In 2015, 6.5% of heat was derived from renewable sources in Ireland.</p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  The proposed RHI scheme is </font>aimed at supporting larger industrial and commercial installations outside of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources.</p><p>Before a final decision is taken on the renewable heat technologies to be supported, there will be an additional public consultation phase on the design of the new support scheme.  The next consultation will be published shortly, and details will be posted to the Department&rsquo;s website  .  The overall costs and technologies to be supported  including the rates to be paid per kilowatt hour relative to boiler size will be subject to Government approval and State aid clearance from the European Commission.  I hope to be in a position to announce the introduction of the new scheme in the latter half of 2017.</p></reply>

To date, 1.4 million premises in the BLUE area can get access to high Speed Broadband.</p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, the subject of the current procurement process.</p><p>My Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network to over 750,000 premises currently within  the State Intervention Area covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area; including over 24,000 premises in Co. Cavan and 19,000 premises in Co Monaghan. </p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  </p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services. </p><p>These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country, including County Cavan and County Monaghan.</p><p>Currently there is  no universal service obligation (USO) for high speed broadband provision or mobile voice services.  The current EU and national regulatory framework for telecommunications relates solely to voice telephony and Functional Internet Access (28.8 kilobits per second) and is provided for under the current EU regulatory framework governing telecoms.  </p><p>The National Broadband Plan will deliver high speed broadband networks, to connect all premises but there might be some instances, for technical or other reasons, where some premises might not be able to readily obtain those services.</p><p>I am in discussion with ComReg as to whether a universal service obligation (USO) may be a viable instrument in such instances, e.g. in areas where a high speed network is available but individual premises cannot access such services at an affordable price.  This is similar to the arrangements which are already in place for fixed voice.  </p><p>I have also raised the issue of a USO for high speed broadband at EU level.  In September, the European Commission published an ambitious proposal for the regulation of the European telecoms sector, which aims to incentivise and encourage increased investment in high speed broadband networks.  I have asked the Commission to consider a specific provision in the new framework that will allow Member States to apply a USO for high speed broadband, where such networks are available.</p></reply>

The scheme seeks to demonstrate the positive effects that making their homes warmer and more energy efficient can have on the health and wellbeing of people in energy poverty who are living with a chronic respiratory condition.</p><p>As it is a pilot scheme, eligibility is limited.  The operational area for the scheme was selected as Community Health Area (CHO) 7, following consultation with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive (HSE).  This CHO encompasses Kildare/West Wicklow, Dublin West, Dublin South City and Dublin South West.  Within CHO 7 the need to build capacity in the local public health and SEAI teams, and establish communications on the pilot with the local community, meant that a further localisation was necessary and Dublin 12 and 24 were selected as the initial operational areas. </p><p>Within these areas the scheme was limited to people who:</p><p>- are aged over 55;</p><p>- suffering from a chronic respiratory condition;</p><p>- living in an owner-occupied or local authority home; &amp;amp;</p><p>- a member of the household is in receipt of the Fuel Allowance.</p><p>A dedicated HSE delivery team is in place and is working with Local Authorities and local health care professionals (from physiotherapists to general practitioners, consultants &amp;amp; public health nurses) to identify participants.  Once referrals are received, the HSE team visits each eligible participant individually to guide them through the process.  Each participant in the pilot scheme is eligible for an extensive energy efficiency upgrade.  In each case the actual upgrade provided depends on an SEAI assessment of the home but is intended to make it much easier for the participant to heat their home adequately.  The value of these upgrades could be up to &euro;20k per home depending on the works to be carried out. </p><p>To date the HSE have had 339 applicants who meet the eligibility criteria across Dublin 12 (135) and 24 (204).  These applicants are at various stages of their application and referral process.  To date, 147 have already had their homes assessed by SEAI and upgrade works are in various stages of delivery.  Chronic respiratory conditions the HSE are seeing in the referrals include COPD, asthma, emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis and cystic fibrosis.  These conditions can all benefit from improved indoor air temperature and air quality.</p><p>With the additional resources I have made available to the scheme in 2017, the steering committee for the scheme, made up of representatives from my Department, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), the Department of Health and the HSE, determined that the area covered by the scheme could be expanded to cover Dublin 8, 10 and 22 and that eligibility could be expanded to cover families with young children.  By including families with young children it is hoped that the scheme can also show a positive impact on school attendance and social inclusion. </p><p>The scheme is intended to run for a further two years (2017-2018).  In parallel with the scheme&rsquo;s delivery, an independent research project will be commissioned by my Department, which will assess the impact the scheme is having.  At the conclusion of the scheme and with independent evidence on its effectiveness, the potential for a wider rollout will be considered.</p><p>I would finally note that the Warmer Homes scheme is available on a nationwide basis to low income households who are at risk of energy poverty.  More information on this scheme is available on SEAI&rsquo;s website at: </p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment has not been demonstrated.

Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids.  In addition, bidders need adequate time to get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process. It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further on timelines at this juncture, given that discussions are on-going in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. </p><p>During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.

More vehicles were grant aided in 2015 under the Electric Vehicle Grant Scheme, which provides grants towards the purchase of new EVs, than in the previous four years of the scheme combined.  The figure of 555 EVs supported in 2015 has already been surpassed this year with 615 vehicles grant aided to date in 2016.</p>  <p>  In 2015, transport represented the largest sectoral share of energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at 37% of the overall Energy-related total with private cars accounting for 43% of this figure.  I believe that EVs, along with the increased deployment of biofuels, have a vital part to play in reducing GHG emissions in the transport sector.  The Electric Vehicles Grant Scheme, which will continue in 2017, provides grant aid of up to &euro;5,000 towards the purchase of a new EV.</p>  <p>  These grants are in addition to the VRT reliefs of up to &euro;5,000 that also apply to EVs. Budget 2017 extended  VRT reliefs on Battery Electric Vehicles for a further 5 year period and on Plugin Hybrid Electric Vehicles for 2 years.</p>  <p>  Additionally, in accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government, my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport have established and are Co-Chairing a Low Emissions Vehicles Task Force involving relevant Government Departments and agencies.  A key task will be to examine as a matter of priority what further actions are necessary to further stimulate EV sales and other low emission vehicles to 2020 and beyond.</p></reply>

ComReg monitors compliance in this regard by means of biannual drive tests and customers can refer any complaints to ComReg who will investigate the service provider&rsquo;s compliance with its contractual obligations. </p>  <p>  Mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.  The rate of demand for data services has however increased by 500% in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for mobile operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally. </p>  <p>  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government, a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  In July, I established the Taskforce, together with Minister Humphreys, which aims to unlock barriers to investment in mobile and broadband services.  The Terms of Reference of the Taskforce state that it will identify and recommend practical actions that can be taken to improve mobile reception and broadband access.  The Taskforce has already met approximately twenty times, with a number of helpful initiatives emerging in the areas of planning, local authority engagement, and consumer information and engagement. </p>  <p>  The Taskforce involves Government Departments and agencies, as well as engagement with ComReg and telecoms operators.  The report of the taskforce and accompanying action plan will be concluded this month and will set out specific timelines for the delivery of the recommendations and actions, including a key role for Local Authorities in supporting the rollout of telecoms infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Under the Programme for Government, Minister Humphreys has also established two regional action groups to work with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies in helping accelerate the rollout of broadband and mobile services at local level. </p>  <p>  In addition, I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band.  This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. </p>  <p>  In my Department's estimates for 2017 I have secured an &euro;8m provision for RT&Eacute; to allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum, to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.  </p>  <p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland, and particularly in rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  In parallel, the National Broadband Plan aims to deliver high speed broadband services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland, through private investment and a State intervention in areas where commercial investment have not been fully demonstrated. </p>  <p>  The procurement process is underway and the three bidders in the process have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution for rural Ireland.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is ongoing, with a view to putting in place contract(s) that will deliver the NBP network and put Ireland to the forefront internationally in terms of connectivity.</p></reply>

The PSO levy consists of a set of support schemes designed to facilitate national electricity policy objectives for renewables, indigenous fuels and security of supply.</p>  <p>  The PSO has supported the connection of over 2,000 MW of renewable energy to the electricity grid and it will continue to support the development of renewable energy so that we can meet our target of increasing renewable electricity penetration to 40% by 2020. </p>  <p>  International studies have shown that Ireland has had one of the lowest per unit supports for renewable energy in the European Union.</p>  <p>  The calculation of the level of the PSO is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation.  The total PSO Levy for 2016-2017 is &euro;392.4 million.  This equates to less than &euro;6 per month for domestic consumers and represents an increase of less than &euro;1 per month.  The biggest drivers for the proposed levy increase are the lower predicted wholesale market electricity price and the increased deployment of renewables. </p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the impacts of energy costs on industry and households alike.  As the wholesale electricity price is falling, this should be passed onto domestic electricity customers and more than outweigh the levy increase.  In this regard I am pleased to see that most electricity suppliers have reduced their standard prices. </p>  <p>  Customers can also avail of discounts available, either by contacting their supplier directly or by using the price comparison websites accredited by CER, such as bonkers.ie or switcher.ie to switch to discounted tariffs.  A customer consuming the average amount of electricity could save over &euro;200 by switching suppliers.</p></reply>

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005.  This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD, and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.  The 2013 target is based on the average of emissions for the years 2008 -2010.  The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020, and surpluses in one year can be used to cover deficits in any subsequent year.  The average incidence of these targets is a 12% reduction relative to 2005.</p>  <p>  In March 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published projected emissions for 2020 which indicate that Ireland&rsquo;s emissions at that stage could be in the range of 6 - 11% below 2005 levels, depending on whether additional policies or measures beyond those already in place by the end of 2014 are implemented.  On a cumulative basis over the period 2013 - 2020, Ireland is projected to have a deficit of between 3 and 12 Megatonnes Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MtCO2eq).  According to the latest inventory published by the EPA in November 2016, GHG emissions for 2015 are estimated to be 59.84 MtCO2eq.  This is 3.7% higher than emissions in 2014. </p>  <p>  As I indicated in both Houses of the Oireachtas last week, the shortfall to 2020 projected by the EPA reflects our constrained investment capacity over the decade between 2008 and 2019 due to the economic crisis, including the impact of the troika programme and the EU fiscal governance requirements.  It now represents a significant challenge to be addressed.  It will be necessary therefore to pursue other available options, in addition to the introduction of further policies and measures planned as part of the development of the National Mitigation Plan, if Ireland is to comply fully with its obligations under the ESD. </p>  <p>  In the first place, this will include the retirement of Annual Emissions Allocations and units from the Kyoto Protocol Flexibility Mechanisms carried forward from 2008-2012 which can be offset against the deficit. If this does not fully address any potential deficit, further carbon units could be purchased.  It is not possible to accurately quantify the cost to purchase  notional carbon units at this stage as the cost is dependent on both the quantum and price of carbon units to be purchased at the time.  </p></reply>

The NEEAP target is not binding on EU member states but the more successful we are at meeting the target, the less effort will be required to meet Irelands 16% Renewable Energy Target which is a binding target.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to make good progress towards the 20% target.  Monitoring by the Sustainable Energy Authority (SEAI) indicates that at end 2015 Ireland had achieved 19,204 of the 31,925 GWh target i.e. 60% of the target achieved.  </p>  <p>  It is likely that an intensification of efforts will be required for Ireland to meet its Energy Efficiency target by 2020. Budget 2017 will provide over &euro;100m for investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy projects next year, an increase of over 40% on the provisions for 2016.  This will save over 116,000 tonnes in carbon emissions every year, reducing overall dependence on imported fossil fuels, and supporting around 3,000 jobs.  My Department has developed proposals for new and pilot measures next year as well as expansions to existing measures using the additional funding provided.   </p>  <p>  Recognising the potential for the public sector to make a significant contribution to national energy efficiency efforts my Department has developed a new Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy which will be considered by Government this month and published in January.</p>  <p>  SEAI estimated the cost to Ireland of meeting our overall renewable energy targets other than through domestic measures may be in the range of &euro;100 million to &euro;150 million for each percentage point Ireland falls short of the overall 16% renewable energy target.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Authority's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  The Capital Plan published in September 2015 outlined proposed transport investment priorities to 2022.  The transport element of the plan was framed by the conclusions reached in my Department's Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport.  This report highlighted the importance of maintenance and renewal of transport infrastructure together with targeted investments to address particular bottlenecks and critical safety issues.  The Capital Plan provides &euro;6 billion for investment in the roads network in the period to 2022, with &euro;4.4 billion earmarked for the maintenance and strengthening of the existing extensive network throughout the country and &euro;1.6 billion for new projects.   </p>  <p>  As Minister I have to work within the annual allocations set out in the Plan and in this context the Capital Plan provides for a gradual build up in capital funding towards the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement works.  While there will be a modest increase in funding for regional and local roads in 2017, it will take some years yet under the Capital Plan to restore "steady state" funding levels for land transport.  The primary focus will have to continue to be on the maintenance and renewal of public roads.  I do, however, expect that local authorities will continue to be able to use a proportion of their Discretionary Grant for the local improvement scheme in 2017.</p>  <p>  The regional and local road grant allocations for next year have yet to be decided but I expect to announce the details early next year.  Given funding constraints, my objective has to be to allocate funding to local authorities on as equitable basis as possible taking into account the road lengths in each local authority's area of responsibility. </p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that State grants are intended to supplement local authorities' own resources.  In this context, I am emphasising to Councils that the commitment of local authorities to contribute significantly from their own resources, towards the cost of improving and maintaining the regional and local roads network is essential.</p>  <p>  As regards the possibility of additional funding within the Plan period, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform indicated in his budget speech that he is bringing forward the Capital Plan review.   There is a strong case for additional funding for the transport sector which I will make robustly.  However, the parameters for the review and the final decisions on allocations are matters for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and Government as a whole.</p></reply>

My Department is currently developing a new strategy to set out a cohesive and forward looking approach to the development, funding and promotion of greenways and intends to consult with stakeholders in the coming months.  The outcome of this consultation and the resulting strategy will inform my Department's approach in relation to the allocation of available greenway funding in 2017 and beyond.</p></reply>

Exchange rate fluctuations will pose real challenges for low margin exporting sectors reliant on the UK market. The volatility of exchange rates is clearly evident from developments over the last few months. </p>  <p>  Given Brexit is likely to represent a structural shift in the UK trading relations with partners, short medium and long term responses are needed. These include market diversification, cost reduction, value-add, innovation and price repositioning. My Department and agencies are putting in place measures to address these issues for client companies.</p>  <p>  My Department has also initiated engagement with senior officials from the DG Competition to ensure Ireland can deliver the necessary supports to Irish enterprises within the EU State Aid rules. These discussions are by no means over and will continue, if and when, the need arises to discuss initiatives or proposed schemes.</p>  <p>  The temporary framework introduced by the Commission during the economic crisis was an extraordinary measure, effective across the Union, but as a short-term instrument it was subsequently phased out.</p>  <p>  While sympathetic to Ireland&rsquo;s concerns, DG Competition sees limited scope to introduce a revised temporary State Aid framework. The Commission has confirmed that the uncertain nature of the ongoing discussions on Brexit would diminish the effectiveness of such a measure. DG Competition has committed to working with the relevant Departments and agencies in Ireland to identify potential solutions under the existing State Aid framework to address the negative implications of Brexit. </p>  <p>  My Department has examined the options available within the State Aid framework and is currently consulting with the development agencies and stakeholders to assess the short, medium and long term requirements for State intervention. This process will provide a clear indication of the needs of SMEs and will inform the design and delivery of a suite of supports under the existing State Aid framework. These interventions will be tailored and targeted to ensure Irish enterprises hampered by Brexit can access the necessary supports to diversify, restructure and maintain competitiveness and jobs.</p></reply>

On foot of 2015 export figures, there is immediate opportunity and potential for strengthening our foothold in existing established markets and for diversified export growth.  In 2015, sales to North American grew by 27%, Northern Europe by 8% and Asia-PAC by 11%. The focus on the Americas and Asian markets as is set out in the &lsquo;Programme for a Partnership Government&rsquo; and where Enterprise Ireland and its client companies see strategic opportunities.</p>  <p>  Extra staff will be placed in EI&rsquo;s overseas offices with sectoral knowledge and expertise such as in engineering, food, life sciences and construction. This will drive export growth to other international markets where there are known opportunities and reduce reliance on the UK.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the UK will continue to be a priority market due to Ireland&rsquo;s size, geographic proximity and cultural ties. In the UK market, EI is particularly working with companies who are most exposed in areas such as engineering, food, construction and timber. EI will focus on increasing international sales with existing buyers while also supporting companies to develop new strategic relationships and avail of emerging opportunities, particularly in the engineering and construction sectors. </p>  <p>  EI&rsquo;s Irish based team will be enhanced with additional staff to provide various targeted supports and programmes to assist companies before they enter the market. Clients who are more prepared before entering the market and engage with in-market Enterprise Ireland teams, have a greater chance of sustained export success. Training and supports in terms of management capability, leadership, marketing/sales skills, innovation and R&amp;D will help companies to build market share and create new market opportunities. EI will also deliver a suite of supports that help clients reduce supply-chain costs and drive efficiencies and cost reductions as a means of improving operating margins, thereby increasing competitiveness,.</p>  <p>  Other key elements of the 2017 drive for expanding our global export footprint include an enhanced programme of trade and investment missions and other trade promotional events.  These are all at the planning stage at the moment, but will cover various sector specific markets in the USA, Canada, United Arab Emirates, Spain, China, Australia, France, Germany, Nordics, to name but a few. There are also numerous Market Study Visits planned for 2017. These visits will enable client companies to experience the dynamics of a market, and provide more information to help with the decision on whether to progress to that market.  </p>  <p>  In 2017, EI will also rollout the &lsquo;Global Ambition Campaign&rsquo; which is a communications campaign to promote Irish companies and their products and services to international buyers. </p></reply>

Where a seller fails to deliver goods in accordance with section 29 of the Act, the buyer may treat the failure as a breach of a condition of the contract which entitles the buyer to repudiate the contract. As the seller in this case appears to have terminated the contract and given the buyer a refund, I appreciate that this remedy is of no benefit to the buyer.</p>  <p>  Though the Deputy will appreciate that it is not my function to assess whether there has been a breach of consumer law in any given case, the details provided suggest that that there may be a question regarding the trader&rsquo;s compliance with the information requirements for on-premises contracts under Regulation 5 of the European Union (Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulations. The Regulation requires that, before a consumer is bound by an on-premises contract, the trader shall provide the consumer, among other things, with information on the arrangements for delivery of the goods in a clear and comprehensible manner if that information is not already apparent from the context.  A trader who contravenes the Regulation commits an offence. </p>  <p>  I have referred the details provided by the Deputy to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission for consideration. As the Commission is fully independent in the exercise of its investigative and enforcement functions, it will be for it to determine whether any further action is warranted in the matter.    </p></reply>

The most up-to-date CSO figures available show that 3,700 jobs were created across the Mid East region (Kildare, Meath and Wicklow) from end 2015 to end September 2016 and the unemployment rate within the region, at 6.9% at end September 2016, was also significantly below the State average of 8%.</p>  <p>  In addition, the number of persons on the Live Register in November in County Kildare has fallen by 2,358 since January 2016  and now stands at 11,456.</p>  <p>  The Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative is working to stimulate job creation across the country, including in the Mid East, by facilitating collaborative initiatives between the public and private sector, and through the provision of new competitive funds, awarded through Enterprise Ireland to support the best regional enterprise projects.  Since the start of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs process in 2015, 4,900 jobs have been created in the Mid East region.</p>  <p>  IDA, Enterprise Ireland, and the Local Enterprise Offices are also making a significant contribution to employment in all counties.  However, official employment figures in respect of Agency supported jobs are drawn from employment surveys, conducted on an annual basis.  It is therefore not possible to provide job numbers for 2016 until early 2017 when these surveys have been completed.</p>  <p>  In 2015, a total of 222 new jobs were created by micro-enterprises that had been supported by the Local Enterprise Office (LEO) in Kildare. 679 jobs were also created by IDA Ireland clients in Kildare.  Of the three counties in the Mid East, Kildare has the largest number of people working in IDA client companies; comprising 22 companies employing 9,998 people . Enterprise Ireland clients created 724 jobs; meaning a total of 8,308 people were employed in Enterprise Ireland client companies in Kildare in 2015.</p>  <p>  These figures are all collected for Kildare as a whole and do not distinguish between the North and South of the county. </p></reply>

Increasing and sustaining foreign direct investment (FDI) for areas such as County Kildare forms a vital part of this.</p>  <p>  This Government&rsquo;s commitment to regional development is reflected in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2015-2019, which targets an increase of 30-40% in FDI in every region outside of Dublin.  Site visit statistics indicate that progress is being made towards this goal, with 58% of site visits this year made outside of the capital.</p>  <p>  These site visit statistics are only maintained by IDA Ireland on a county by county and quarterly basis.  As of the end of quarter three, there have been seven site visits by potential investors to County Kildare this year.  It is important to note, however, that site visits are not necessarily an accurate measure of the level of FDI activity in a region or county.  This is partly because approximately 70% of all investment won by IDA Ireland comes from its existing client base, rather than new companies.</p>  <p>  It should also be emphasised that, while IDA Ireland actively encourages its clients to locate or expand in regional locations, ultimately the final decision always rests with the company concerned. </p></reply>

No. 27 of 1995).  Gift vouchers that are not financial services products are covered also by the provisions of the European Union (Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 484 of 2013).  Gift cards that come within the definition of &ldquo;electronic money&rdquo; in the European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2011 are subject to the provisions of these Regulations unless the card can be used only to acquire goods or services in the premises of the card issuer or within a limited network of service providers or for a limited range of goods and services.  The issuer of a gift card which comes within the definition of electronic money must, at the request of the electronic money holder, redeem the monetary value of the electronic money at par value at any time.  Redemption may be subject to a fee in specified circumstances and any such fee must be proportionate and commensurate with the costs actually incurred by the issuer of the electronic money.</p>  <p>  My Department published the draft Scheme of a comprehensive Consumer Rights Bill for public consultation on 25 May 2015.  In addition to Parts dealing with the consolidation and updating of the law on the supply of goods, digital content and services and on unfair contract terms, the draft Scheme contains a number of provisions for the regulation of gift vouchers, including a proposed ban on expiry dates in contracts for the supply of gift vouchers.  The responses to the gift card provisions raised a substantial number of issues, including concerns expressed by businesses about the impact of a complete prohibition on expiry dates and the need for  clarity and certainty in respect of the regulation of gift cards that come within the scope of the European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2011.  While the present proposal is for a ban on expiry dates for gift cards that do not come within the scope of the Electronic Money Regulations, I am willing to listen to other views and possible approaches, such as a requirement that gift cards remain valid for a set period such as five years.</p>  <p>  While I am anxious to progress the Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill, I have to take account of current European Union legislative proposals for Directives on consumer contracts for the supply of digital content and consumer contracts for the online and other distance sale of goods.  These proposals which were announced in May 2015 and published in December 2015 overlap very substantially with two of the main parts of the draft Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill.  Discussions on the digital content proposal at working party level have proceeded rapidly with a first reading of the proposal completed by April 2016 and agreement reached at the June Justice and Home Affairs Council on the basic principles of the proposal and on political guidelines for future work on it.  The principles and guidelines endorsed by the Council provided the basis for a revised text of the proposal prepared by the Dutch and Slovak Presidencies.  Working Party discussions over 12 meeting days during the Slovak Presidency have examined the revised text in detail.   In the view of the Presidency, these discussions made good progress and provided the basis for a policy debate on a number of aspects of the proposal at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 8-9 December.   </p>  <p>  The incoming Maltese Presidency has indicated that it aims to achieve agreement on a general approach to the digital content proposal in the first half of 2017.  In this situation, I have to consider the advisability of bringing forward a legislative proposal to the Oireachtas when a directly related and fully harmonised legislative proposal may be at an advanced stage of the European Union legislative process.  The wisdom of introducing legislation in the Oireachtas in 2017 if large parts of that legislation would have to be repealed or substantially amended within a relatively short space of time is obviously open to question . I will continue to review the progress of the two European Union proposals in the new year with a view to deciding the best course of action to take with regard to the Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill.      </p></reply>

The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s response went on to inform you that the same person was informed of their options in January 2013 and in February 2015.</p>  <p>  I understand the individual has also been informed of the legal consequences of residing in the state without the permission of the Minister for Justice and Equality. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate, that employment permits are normally applied for in relation to non-EEA nationals that are not resident in the State.  Employment Permits applications can be considered for non-EEA nationals who are already lawfully resident in the State and hold a valid Certificate of Registration (GNIB card) with Stamps 1, 1A, 2, 2A and 3 immigration permissions.  This policy is also available on the Irish National Immigration Service website.  I expect the individual will be able to determine from the decision letter from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service issued on 16 February 2016 if they comply with this requirement.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Employment Permits Act 2006, as amended and supporting regulations are the legislation under which the Employment Permit process is governed. </p>  <p>  The Irish State&rsquo;s general policy is to promote the sourcing of labour and skills needs from within the workforce of the European Union and other EEA states.  Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the EEA, an employment permit, which falls under the remit of my Department, may be sought by an employer to hire a non-EEA national.  A non-EEA national, unless exempted, requires an employment permit to work in Ireland. </p>  <p>  In terms of the process, applications for Employment Permits can be made online via the Department&rsquo;s website and applicants can track progress of their application via the Online Status Query webpage.</p>  <p>  For the avoidance of doubt, applicants would need to regularise their position in the State by receiving immigration permission from the Minister for Justice and Equality that would entitle them to apply for an Employment Permit within the State.</p>  <p>  Again, for the avoidance of doubt, an Employment Permit is not valid permission to reside in the State and immigration is a matter for the offices of both the Irish National Immigration Service (INIS) and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  As previously stated, it appears a decision letter from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service issued to the person mentioned on 16 February 2016.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle long-term unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery through effective policies.  In doing so it is hoped to promote competitiveness and productivity.  I am working closely with the Minister for Social Protection to ensure we can provide every opportunity for those unemployed to secure a job.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, long term unemployment continues to fall.  The long-term unemployment rate peaked at 9.5% in Q1 2012 before falling to 4.4% in Q2 2016.  At the latter date, the long-term unemployed accounted for 51.1% of all those unemployed, down from almost 65% in early 2012.  The number of long term unemployed in Q2 2016 was 95,900; this compares to 204,300 in Q1 2012.  Under the Programme for Government commitment to move 50,000 long-term unemployed at the start of 2016 into employment by the end of 2020, annual targets have been set.  Indications are that the 2016 target will be exceeded by year end.  </p>  <p>  A range of measures were introduced under previous Pathways to Work strategies for long-term unemployed people.  This included a structured process of engagement with long-term unemployed people being referred to the activation process (Group Engagement followed by regular one-to-one case officer contact); wage subsidies in JobsPlus; the roll-out of a payment-by-results contracted employment services in JobPath, to provide additional capacity in order to engage more systematically with long-term unemployed jobseekers; and reserved places for long-term unemployed jobseekers on a range of Further Education and Training (FET) and public employment programmes. </p>  <p>  A core focus of Pathways to Work 2016-2020 is on consolidating and improving the quality and consistency of reforms undertaken in previous strategies, with continued prioritisation of those long-term unemployed.</p></reply>

Within that context, and informed by its current three year Statement of Strategy 2016-2018, the Authority prioritises initiatives in those areas where there is greatest risk and the greatest potential to maximise its efforts to achieve a continued downward trend in workplace deaths, accidents, injuries and ill health, and to increase the safe use of chemicals.</p><p>The Authority has invested significant resources in recent years in enabling enterprises to achieve compliance in the simplest, most cost-effective manner.  The Authority&rsquo;s BeSMART.ie risk assessment and management tool for small enterprises has been developed and expanded for the construction and agri-business sectors.  The Authority also ran safety awareness campaigns relating to farming, construction, vehicle safety and fishing safety, along with promoting the BeSMART safety management tool to small businesses.</p><p>The Authority uses its non-pay allocation to cover a range of administrative ICT, accommodation, and other running costs, in addition to providing funding for information and awareness activities, including safety initiatives.  Consequently, the funding provision for particular programmes, including safety initiatives (see Table 1), fluctuates from year to year as the Authority decides how to prioritise its non-pay funding in order to implement its programme of work. </p><p>In 2015 the Authority&rsquo;s exchequer Grant was increased by &euro;250,000 during the course of the year (following re-allocations made in light of the Department&rsquo;s 2015 mid-year expenditure review) to facilitate special safety initiatives aimed at Agriculture and Construction.</p><p>In the current year the Non Pay budget decided by the Authority included a reduction in the provision for &quot;safety initiatives&quot; in 2016 in order to address other priorities in its programme of work for this year.  These included developments affecting office accommodation, a necessary business process review arising from the integration of the Irish National Accreditation Board (INAB) and the replacement of the current manual system used in the INAB accreditation process, as part of the development of a new Client Management System (a commitment in the Action Plan for Jobs, 2016). </p><p>In October 2016, I was happy to support the Authority&rsquo;s application to my Department for additional supplementary support (&euro;340,000) in the context of the Department&rsquo;s mid-year expenditure review and these additional funds were used exclusively for safety initiatives.  I also understand that in framing its budget for 2017 the Authority expects to be in a position to allocate some additional funding to safety initiatives resulting from some operational efficiencies achieved during 2016.</p><p><b>Table 1</b></p><p><b>Amount of money spent on safety initiatives, 2011 to 2016</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Estimated Spend on Safety Initiatives</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;1.567m</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;1.907m</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;1.595m</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;1.154m</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;1.776m</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>&euro;1.297 m</td></tr></table></p><p>Health and Safety Authority Inspectors carry out inspections across all work sectors and work activities that come under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 (the 2005 Act) and the Chemicals Act 2008.  Most inspections are targeted at the high risk sectors such as construction, agriculture, forestry, manufacturing, mines, quarries, transport of dangerous goods by road, or the chemical sectors.  Other inspections can be part of a particular safety awareness campaign e.g. on manual handling, on slips, trips or falls or on compliance with the REACH Regulation.  The Authority produces a Programme of Work each year setting out its plan for all areas of its work, including inspection targets. </p><p>The number of workplace inspections carried out from 2011 to 2016 (13/12/2016) is set out in the following table. </p><p><b>Table 2 </b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of workplace inspections and investigations </th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>15,340</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>13,835</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>12,244</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>10,719</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>10,880</td></tr><tr><td>2016 at 13 December </td><td>10,049</td></tr></table></p><p>While the falling inspection rates between 2011 and 2014 in Table 2 can be attributed to the loss of inspection staff, the programme of inspections continues to be targeted at the areas of highest risk.  The Authority&rsquo;s 2016 Programme of Work set a target of 11,165 inspections and investigations.  It is expected that 92% of this target will be achieved with an estimated 10,250 inspections and investigations being completed by the end of the year. </p><p>A range of administrative and organisational factors impacted on the Authority&rsquo;s ability to meet its 2016 target.  These included the retirement and resignation of inspectorate staff, and increasing demands in areas such as Freedom of Information.  Following the end of the moratorium on public service recruitment, my Department has given the Authority sanction to replace the number of inspection staff who have left the Authority in 2016.  These posts are currently in the process of being filled and I expect the additional inspectors to be recruited by the Authority early in 2017.</p></reply>

The latest data available covers the first three quarters of 2016, during which there were 489 site visits countrywide.  The breakdown by county of those visits is provided in the following table.  The table also shows, on a county-by-county basis, the total number of IDA Ireland client company supported jobs, the number of IDA Ireland client companies and the total number of site visits in 2015.</p><p>In 2015, 57% of site visits were to locations outside of the capital, up from 43% in 2014.

These include access to qualified talent, proximity to transport hubs, the ready supply of suitable property and the availability of business support services.  While IDA Ireland actively encourages its clients to locate or expand in regional locations, ultimately the final decision always rests with the company concerned. </p><p><b>IDA Ireland Jobs Statistics 2015: Site Visits 2015 and to end Quarter 3 2016 by County</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Total Jobs<br /><br />2015</th><th>Number of Companies<br /><br />2015</th><th>Site Visits 2015</th><th>Site Visits end Q3 2016</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>768</td><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>1,165</td><td>7</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>6,599</td><td>68</td><td>12</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>31,900</td><td>148</td><td>48</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>2,918</td><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>77,244</td><td>652</td><td>242</td><td>204</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>14,297</td><td>60</td><td>41</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>1,931</td><td>12</td><td>6</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>10,313</td><td>22</td><td>7</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>650</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>97</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>423</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>8,849</td><td>52</td><td>40</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>686</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>3,245</td><td>21</td><td>20</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>3,981</td><td>18</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>1,571</td><td>17</td><td>7</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>146</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>902</td><td>10</td><td>8</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>936</td><td>9</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>2,029</td><td>22</td><td>15</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>3,518</td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>5,662</td><td>33</td><td>31</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>2,529</td><td>16</td><td>28</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>2,486</td><td>17</td><td>4</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>2,211</td><td>18</td><td>7</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>187,056</td><td>1,254</td><td>565</td><td>489</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-16a.1539.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016121600091#WRY04000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 543 and 544 together. </p><p>The Health and Safety Authority initially allocated a budget of &euro;244,000 for farm safety initiatives in 2016.  These initiatives have included the organisation of, participation in, or support for a number of agriculture related events such as the Farmer of the Year Awards, Farm Safety Week, Teagasc Beef 2016, and the National Ploughing Championships. </p><p>The funding allocations that the Authority  makes for particular aspects of its annual programme of work, including farm safety initiatives, can fluctuate from year to year as the Authority decides how to prioritise its non-pay funding in order to implement its programme of work. </p><p><b>Table of Expenditure on Farm Safety Initiatives 2011 to 2015 </b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Expenditure *</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;264,481</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;589,870</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;449,669</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;327,953</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;396,251</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>&euro;384,000 (estimated outturn)</td></tr></table></p><p>*Note that annual figures for expenditure include some cross sectoral initiatives where the expenditure would also be relevant to other sectors &ndash; it is not possible to extract this so it has been included as the full figure.  In addition, some of the advertising initiatives would cross years, so the yearly figure is an estimate of the expenditure relevant to that year.</p><p>In October 2016, I was happy to support the Authority&rsquo;s application to my Department for additional supplementary support (&euro;340,000) in the context of the Department&rsquo;s mid-year expenditure review.  These additional funds have facilitated a number of farm safety initiatives to be undertaken this year.  The initial internal allocation made by the Board of the Authority was accordingly boosted by a further &euro;140,000 specifically allocated to farm safety initiatives.  This has brought the total funding available to the Authority for farm safety initiatives in 2016 to &euro;384,000.  I do not have information at this stage on any decisions made by that Authority with regard to its discretionary spending on farm safety initiatives in 2017.  </p><p><b>Farm inspections and investigations 2011 &ndash; 2016</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of farm Inspections and Investigations</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>3,058</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>3,136</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>2,784</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>2,644</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>3,056</td></tr><tr><td>2016 at 11 December</td><td>2,048</td></tr></table></p><p>Visits to farms by inspectors include routine unannounced inspections to monitor compliance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 and with other health and safety regulations and to investigate fatal and serious farm accidents.  Typically in any one year there can be between 60 &ndash; 90 investigations on farms with the rest being unannounced inspections.  Each year the HSA carry out a two week intensive farm inspection campaign in April and this year over 500 inspections were carried out during that period.  Since 2014 the HSA has redirected some of its inspection resources to engaging directly with farmers on other accident prevention initiatives.  In 2016 HSA inspectors have participated in over 24 farm safety walks and presentations to farmers, many of which are organised by the farming representative bodies.  This has enabled the HSA to direct its message to over 2,000 farmers this year. </p><p>I am very concerned at the high level of farm fatalities since it goes without saying that safety in agriculture is a high priority for the Health and Safety Authority and for the Government.  Since mid-November of this year there have been four people killed on farms, with 19 deaths in total so far this year.  Many fatalities occur when farmers are doing jobs that are not part of their normal working day, e.g. maintenance or adjustment of equipment, maintaining or working on a building.  No other sector is experiencing that level of fatal accidents and it is greatly concerning to me that so many families are losing loved ones due to work activity. </p><p>The Health and Safety Authority has sought, in consultation with the Farm Safety Partnership - an advisory committee of the Authority that includes representatives from a wide range of key farming stakeholders - to broaden the type of contact with farmers and to find the most effective means to spread the message of prevention within the farming community.  I was pleased this week to have to take part in a Farm Walk near Kilrush in County Clare involving local farmers along with the HSA and Teagas.  This is one of the farm safety initiatives developed by the Farm Safety Partnership and it provides opportunity for farmers to see first-hand the dangers and learn how to minimise the risks to themselves and their families. </p><p>The Authority&rsquo;s Programme of Work for 2016 continues the emphasis on engagement with farmers through knowledge sharing groups.  Priority tasks for the current year include:</p><p>- implementation of Year 1 of the Farm Safety Partnership Action Plan, 2016 to 2018,</p><p>- continuing awareness campaigns through the media, events and advertising targeted at agricultural sector,</p><p>- promotion of good health for farmers,</p><p>- publication of information sheets,</p><p>- reviewing and updating the Code of Practice on farm safety</p><p>- developing an e-learning tool on tractor and machinery safety,</p><p>- focusing on child safety on farms through programmes at primary and post-primary school level,</p><p>- increasing awareness of farm safety throughout the sector.</p><p>- ESRI research on farm safety.</p><p>I commend the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association and the Farm Safety Partnership on their support for the 2016 Farm Safety Week 4 to 8 July.  This is the fourth annual Farm Safety Week, an initiative launched in 2013 aiming to cut the toll of accidents which continue to give agriculture the poorest record of any occupation in Ireland.  I particularly welcome this joint initiative which brings together the farming organisations from North and South and from the United Kingdom as well as the UK Health &amp;amp; Safety Executive, the Health &amp;amp; Safety Executive for Northern Ireland and the Health &amp;amp; Safety Authority, Ireland.</p></reply>

We are aiming to ensure the unemployment rate is within the 1% of the State average. </p>  <p>  The first progress report on the implementation of the Region&rsquo;s Action Plan up to end-June 2016 will be published shortly and will show good progress being made.</p>  <p>  6,200 jobs were created in the Border region from Q1 2015 to Q2 2016, representing good progress towards the 28,000 target of 2020.</p>  <p>  While still above the State average, the unemployment rate in the region has fallen from a peak of 17.8% in Q3 2012 to the current rate of 9.2%.  In addition, the number of persons on the Live Register in November in Counties Cavan and Monaghan has fallen by 835 and 780 respectively in the past year and now stands at 4,538 for County Cavan and 3,656 for County Monaghan.</p>  <p>  IDA, Enterprise Ireland (EI), and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are making a significant contribution to employment in both counties.</p>  <p>  The Cavan and Monaghan LEOs are fully engaged in supporting the micro-enterprise and small business sectors in their areas to create and sustain jobs.  In 2015, a total of 223 new jobs were created by micro-enterprises that had been supported by LEO Cavan and 153 new jobs were created by micro-enterprises that had been supported by LEO Monaghan.</p>  <p>  In 2015 EI clients supported 4,760 jobs in Monaghan and 4,911 jobs in Cavan.  The Agency supports approximately 200 companies in Cavan and Monaghan and in 2015, payments of &euro;6,058,747 were made by EI to companies in these two counties. </p>  <p>  IDA is committed to targeting a minimum 30% to 40% increase in the number of investments for the region to 2019.  There are currently 33 multinational companies employing 4,556 on the North East (Louth, Cavan and Monaghan). </p>  <p>  I am continuing to focus on developments in the fallout from Brexit and am deeply engaged with EI and IDA Ireland regarding the impacts being felt by client companies. </p>  <p>  I have ongoing communication with these Agencies through my chairing of the High level Group of Senior Managers which includes the CEOs of the Agencies.  In addition, my officials are in daily contact with the Agencies and keep me informed of any issues arising. </p>  <p>  I am monitoring the export and trading environment on an ongoing basis and have met with companies and other stakeholders from across the country to help inform our response.  I will continue to meet with companies over the coming months.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the challenges that may be faced by companies operating in close proximity to the border.  EI is working with its clients, looking at the individual challenges faced by clients on a company by company basis in every county in Ireland and on a sectoral level as some sectors are more exposed than others. </p>  <p>  I would urge any businesses that are experiencing difficulties to visit one of their Local Enterprise Offices nationwide, or to contact Enterprise Ireland, for advice and support.</p></reply>

The programme is managed by the Centre for Effective Services and Pobal on behalf of the funders.  The aim the programme is to test and evaluate prevention and early intervention approaches in areas of disadvantage in Ireland to improve outcomes for children, in particular children and families living in poverty.  The focus of the work under the ABC Programme covers: Child Health &amp;amp; Development; Children&rsquo;s Learning; Parenting; and Integrated Service Delivery.  </p>  <p>  There are 13 sites across Ireland participating in the ABC programme.  Eight of these are based in Dublin: CDI Tallaght; Preparing for Life; Youngballymun; Clondalkin Behavioural Initiative; Better Finglas; Dublin Docklands and East Inner City; Grangegorman and Ballyfermot.  The remaining five sites are located in Cork; Louth; Bray; Limerick and the Midlands. </p>  <p>  Prior to the ABC Programme, the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) ran from 2007-2013 and it funded the following three organisations which transitioned into the ABC programme: Youngballymun, Childhood Development Initiative Tallaght, and the Preparing for Life Programme Darndale.</p>  <p>  The Centre for Effective Services is responsible for designing and managing the evaluation of the ABC Programme.  It is guided and advised in the planning and implementation of the evaluation by the Expert Advisory Group (EAG). </p>  <p>  The three strands to the evaluation are:</p>  <p>  1.

Implementation evaluation to assess the achievement of implementation outcomes and explore the processes and drivers of implementation</p>  <p>  3.  Cost analysis evaluation for each Area and suite of services and associated activities</p>  <p>  The Centre for Effective Services expects that draft outcome reports for each area will be issued for comment by the end of 2016.  It also expects to finalise the interim area-specific outcome reports by the end of February 2017 and the national outcomes report by the end of March 2017.</p>  <p>  The Government is fully committed to ensuring that learning from all sites funded under the ABC programme will inform other services and supports for children in the area of prevention and early intervention. Such an approach would offer a greater reach, in scope and depth, which will in turn enhance outcomes for children throughout the country. As there is effective work being done on a range of themes across all 13 ABC sites, a key focus over the next year will be to determine the high-impact programmes and provision across these areas so that a more strategic approach can be taken to mainstreaming such learning.</p></reply>

Sections 1 to 5 are standard provisions in relation to title, citation, regulations, definitions etc.  Section 28 relates to corporal punishment and removes the common law defence of reasonable chastisement in relation to same.</p>  <p>  (ii) Section 18 (Part III) and Sections 20-26 (Part IV)  were commenced on 1 May 2016. Section 18 of the Act is a technical amendment to ensure that the Child and Family Agency is a specified body for purposes of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012. Sections 20-26 deal with establishing the Children First Interdepartmental Implementation Group (CFIDG) on a statutory basis and expanding the Group to include all Government Departments.</p>  <p>  As the Act imposes obligations on certain individuals working with children and on relevant service providers, I think it is vital that all individuals and sectors are fully prepared and ready to implement the legislation before it is commenced. Therefore, in relation to those provisions of the Act which have not yet been commenced, I have recently signed off on a proposal for phased and structured preparations for implementation which will allow for full commencement of the Act by end December, 2017. I have brought forward this date from end February 2018, as previously stated in my response to PQ 33699-16 of 8 November 2016  . These provisions include those related to mandated reporting of child abuse, mandated assisting and the preparation of Child Safeguarding Statements by organisations providing relevant services to children. </p>  <p>  The phased implementation timetable will also allow Tusla to undertake the significant preparatory work required to enable it to fully meet its obligations under the legislation.  This will include ensuring that the appropriate internal systems are in place to deal with the intake of mandated reports by Tusla and that a suite of resources is available to support and assist all sectors in implementing the legislation. My Department is working closely with Tusla in relation to making available basic Children First training, information and resource materials.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department will continue to work closely with the Statutory Children First Inter-Departmental Implementation Group, which includes all Government Departments, Tusla, an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE, who will take a key role in ensuring that all necessary preparations and supports are in place for those who will acquire legal obligations under the Act.   </p></reply>

These discussions take place at regular meetings of Heads of State and Government, at Ministerial level meetings and through Council preparatory bodies. It is not unusual for member States in bi-lateral or multilateral formations to discuss priority areas where they would hold views in common, often resulting in joint papers that set out their priorities for consideration as part of discussions on future developments in the area of security and defence. These engagements are informal in nature and do not prejudice the formal decision making processes that exist.</p>  <p>  Within the EU, it is accepted that defence and security is a national competence and that any decisions require unanimity.

This can also enhance its strategic autonomy and its ability to act with partners&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  For many member States, the Defence sector is a significant contributor to jobs, growth and innovation.  In the EU the Defence industry makes an economic contribution of &euro;100 billion with 1.5 million direct and indirect employees.  While Ireland does not have a defence industry, we do however have particular strengths in the area of dual use technologies and civil commercial technologies which can support defence capability and contribute to the Irish economy . These are the industries that need to be positioned to avail of research funding opportunities that will arise under the Preparatory Action and under the proposed European Defence Research Programme put forward by the Commission under the European Defence Action Plan.</p>  <p>  The Preparatory Action on CSDP-related research is seen as a test mechanism for the proposed Defence Research Programme.  The objectives of the Preparatory Action are to stimulate investment in defence Research and Technology, (R&amp;T) across Europe and generate the collaborative Research and Technology that will be required to support future capabilities.  A funding budget of &euro;90m has been proposed for the period 2017-2020 with &euro;25m of this already approved by the European Parliament for 2017.  The call for proposals under the Preparatory Action is expected in early 2017 and my Department is liaising with Enterprise Ireland (EI) and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in relation to opportunities for Irish companies in this call.</p>  <p>  There is also ongoing communication with EI in relation to collaborative research opportunities that may arise for the Defence Forces with industry and research institutes. In July 2011, the Government approved arrangements whereby EI would support the Department of Defence and Defence Forces capability development through engagement with Irish-based enterprise and research institutes on the use and application of innovative civilian technologies in the military sphere.</p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence which was published in 2015, reaffirms the commitment to the Defence Enterprise Initiative.</p></reply>

In this regard, Budget 2017 secured a capital spending allocation of &euro;74 million, representing an increase of &euro;7 million on the 2017 Defence allocation contained in the 2016-21 capital investment programme.  This allocation will facilitate the investment necessary to ensure that the Defence Forces have the equipment and infrastructure to deliver on all their roles as set out in the White Paper.</p>  <p>  The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces remains a clear focus for me, and the White Paper on Defence published in 2015 recognises that there are several new and or enhanced platforms to be procured. Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered over the period of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment planning priorities planning process. </p>  <p>  As a result of the White Paper, a detailed Capability Development Plan is being developed which is building on the work completed as part of the White Paper process.  This Capability Development Plan will dovetail with the work of identifying and agreeing a new Equipment Development Plan and the required funding requirements for upgrade programmes and for new equipment projects that will be implemented for the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  The Army will continue to retain all-arms conventional military capabilities, and the principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements both at home and overseas.  There will be a focus on the essential force protection provided by armoured vehicles and the most cost effective option of upgrading or replacing the current fleet will be pursued.  A small number of armoured logistical and utility vehicles will be procured for force protection. </p>  <p>  The Air Corps will see the Cessna fleet replaced with three larger aircraft suitably equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance tasks. The aircraft specification is currently being prepared and it is expected that the tender competition will be initiated and advertised on the e-tenders website in the near future.  The two CASA 235s Maritime Patrol Aircraft are due for replacement in 2019. The CASAs will be replaced with consideration of their replacement with larger more capable aircraft to enhance maritime surveillance and to provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks.</p>  <p>  The current Naval Service Ship replacement programme has already seen the replacement of three Naval Service vessels.  The White Paper underpins the ongoing replacement of the Naval Service fleet. An agreement was recently reached for the provision of an additional ship for the Naval Service to be built to the same specifications as the three newest vessels.  Future Naval Service capabilities are being planned as part of the White Paper project planning process which will determine the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s maritime capability requirements. </p>  <p>  Overall, the Defence capital envelope for the period 2017-2021 allocated under the Capital Spending Plan is &euro;392m.  The capital funding allocated will play a vital role in ensuring that the priorities identified in the White Paper can be met.  The duration of this capital funding plan is particularly significant in allowing for strategic medium-term planning so critical in the Defence environment which will allow for significant investments in equipment over the coming years</p></reply>

Since 1974, the mandate of UNDOF has been renewed every six months, most recently renewed in June 2016 until 31 December 2016 under UNSCR 2294 (2016).  A contingent of the Permanent Defence Force has been deployed to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) on the Golan Heights since 2013. The current Irish contingent, the 54th Infantry Group, comprising 130 personnel, is based in Camp Ziouani on the Israeli side of the Area of Separation. It operates in the role of a Quick Reaction Force, which is on standby to assist with on-going operations within the UNDOF Area of Responsibility. Six (6) other Defence Forces personnel are also deployed in UNDOF Headquarters, five (5) in Camp Ziouani and one in Yafour.</p>  <p>  Since its temporary relocation from a number of positions in September 2014 and pending the time when UNDOF returns fully to the area of separation, UNDOF has, in line with its mandate from UNSCR 350 continued to maintain credible presence in the Golan and use its best efforts to implement its mandate. UNDOF continues to engage with the parties on practical arrangements to allow the Force to continue to maintain the ceasefire, monitor, verify and report on violations of the Disengagement of Forces Agreement and exercise its critical liaison functions with the parties in order to implement its mandate.  On 14 November 2016, UNDOF completed the initial phase of the incremental return of the mission to Camp Faouar on the Syrian side of the Area of Separation where Fijian and Nepalese troops are now based.</p>  <p>  The Irish 54th Infantry Group is carrying out its normal operations. As with all missions, the UNDOF mission is kept under ongoing review, taking into account the area of operation and the wider region. </p></reply>

The agenda will not be issued until closer to the date but it is anticipated that discussions will revolve around progress on recent FAC Council Conclusions on Implementing the EUGS on Security and Defence, recent Council Conclusions on Implementation of the EU/NATO Joint Declaration as well as the Commission's European Defence Action Plan (EDAP).  Discussions can also be anticipated on ongoing Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) military operations.
