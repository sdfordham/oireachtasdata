That is because we believe it is critically important for our economy and for the ongoing development of British-Irish relations.  It is also our view that the EU itself is stronger and better with the UK as a full and committed member. We must therefore do what we can to help to encourage the UK to remain within the Union.  This means, as a starting point, continuing to work closely with our British partners &ndash; as well as other like-minded States &ndash; on policy issues where we share the same interests and approach.  The British Government and other British political parties have made clear that the achievement of common aims in regard to economic policy &ndash; including the completion of the single market in services, the conclusion of trade negotiations with third countries and a more streamlined approach to EU regulation &ndash; is a high priority in itself and will strengthen the case for the UK&rsquo;s continued membership.  Depending on the outcome of their general election in May, it is possible that the next British Government will make proposals on both how the functioning of the EU could be improved and specific UK concerns addressed.  Ireland will certainly consider any reasonable proposals on their merits, if and when they are presented.  We have a clear shared interest in seeing our Union operate more effectively.  We also recognise &ndash; as the European Council has done &ndash; that the UK has some legitimate concerns that should be addressed.  At the same time, we would not support anything which we think could weaken or otherwise adversely affect the Union.</p>  <p>  The Government is monitoring developments in the EU-UK relationship very carefully.  My Department is co-operating with other Departments, especially the Department of the Taoiseach, in this regard.  Our Embassy in London naturally plays a key role in this process and we rely heavily too on the reporting and analysis we receive from our Embassies elsewhere. </p>  <p>  We are also, of course, engaging directly with our British colleagues on the question of their EU membership.  I myself had a detailed discussion with Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond when he visited Dublin in December.  The subject has arisen as well in informal contacts with other British Ministers and our officials &ndash; in this Department, the Department of the Taoiseach and elsewhere &ndash; are engaging regularly with their counterparts in the UK system.  The UK&rsquo;s place in Europe is also regularly discussed with other EU partners at both political and senior official level.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, the nature of the UK&rsquo;s relationship with the EU is primarily an issue for the British people and we must continue to respect and be sensitive to the democratic process under way there.  We will though continue to play a constructive role in that debate and to ensure that our views are heard and clearly understood.</p></reply>

Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., we continue to work closely with our high level Government contacts and with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond towards achieving some relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the United States and improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.  When the Minister for Foreign Affairs travels to New York next month, he will meet and exchange views with a range of groups and organisations supporting the undocumented Irish and immigration reform.  In addition, Taoiseach Enda Kenny T.D., will travel to Washington for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and will meet with President Obama, Vice President Biden and other senior US Administration figures as well as with key Congressional contacts.    </p>  <p>  These meetings will provide an important opportunity to reiterate our concerns in regard to the position of the undocumented Irish, to seek further information on the detail of President Obama&rsquo;s executive action and to encourage progress on a comprehensive legislative package by Congress.</p>  <p>  While the executive measures announced by President Obama clearly represent real progress, Minister Flanagan and I are well aware that some will not benefit from these new arrangements and the Deputy will also be aware that there are currently legal challenges underway. </p>  <p>  During my visit to Washington from 20-21 January, I had a number of meetings with key Republican members of the House.  It provided an opportunity to assess the intentions of the Republican majority in terms of dealing with immigration this year and to convey the Government&rsquo;s ongoing determination to achieve some relief for the undocumented and improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.</p>  <p>  Our Ambassador and her team in Washington are continuing their ongoing engagement with the US administration on this priority issue for the Government.  We also keep in close contact with the US Ambassador to Ireland and his team at the US Embassy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-26a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015022600050#WRA01100"><p>I welcome the Deputy&rsquo;s question and the opportunity to discuss this important issue.  I share the very serious concern about the situation in South Sudan, which achieved its independence in 2011 but has been in turmoil since the outbreak of conflict in December 2013.  Continuing violence and threats have forced almost two million people to flee their homes.  The country&rsquo;s warring parties signed another ceasefire agreement in February following regional talks led by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), which were supported by the African Union and the European Union.  However, the current peace remains very fragile and the humanitarian situation is extremely serious.  Reports that 89 young boys were abducted over the weekend in Upper Nile State, for use as child soldiers, are particularly worrying.   </p>  <p>  South Sudan remains on the brink of famine, due to insecurity, continuing displacement and reduced food production.  Some 2.5 million people are facing crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity.  Malnutrition rates among children have more than doubled.   The international community has been working with the United Nations to protect civilians and provide humanitarian relief.  The mandate of the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), which provides security and protection for civilians, has been extended to May 2015. </p>  <p>  The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs recently co-hosted a high-level conference on South Sudan at which donors pledged some $600 million in assistance.  Since the outbreak of the conflict at the end of 2013, Ireland has provided almost &euro;11 million for South Sudan, through UN partners and NGOs working to alleviate the suffering of the people of the country and refugees across the region.  We have pledged a further &euro;3 million so far in 2015.  We will continue to monitor the political and humanitarian situation closely, through our Embassies in the region, and in co-operation with our EU partners and the United Nations.  </p></reply>

As I have indicated before, the deaths, casualties and detentions arising from the unrest there require full, impartial investigation in accordance with due legal process.  The apparently high levels of impunity in the case of serious crimes is a matter of further concern as is, indeed, the serious economic situation affecting the people of Venezuela.  I share the concerns expressed in this regard by EU High Representative Mogherini, and those expressed previously by High Representative Ashton, concerning the detention of political figures and of students.  Human rights, including the freedom of expression, of assembly and of association must be protected and upheld.  I renew my call for all parties, including government, opposition, students and civil society, to work together to find a consensus for overcoming Venezuela&rsquo;s current difficulties.   </p>  <p>  This month is the anniversary of the protests last year which resulted in a considerable number of deaths and detentions.  We are following the situation closely and are aware of recent reports, including those to which the Deputy refers.  I remain of the view that the best hope for progress in Venezuela is for an inclusive dialogue that will address, through peaceful means alone, the legitimate concerns of all parties. </p></reply>

Since taking up this role I have visited many Irish communities and the universal reaction has been very positive.  <br/><br/>I am very aware that the question of the extension of voting rights to Irish citizens abroad is an issue of great interest to many members of our community abroad.  I, and my colleague Minister Flanagan, have had a number of meetings with members of the Irish diaspora community at which this topic has been the subject of discussion.In addition, as part of the consultation phase of the review of our Diaspora Policy the issue of voting rights was raised by many of the groups and individuals who made submissions.  <br/><br/>At a meeting in September 2013, the members of the Convention on the Constitution supported the introduction of the right to vote in Presidential elections for citizens resident outside the State.  <br/><br/>The Government has recently considered their response to the recommendation of the Convention and has decided that it is necessary to analyse the full range of practical and policy issues<font color="#FF0000"> </font>that would arise in any significant extension of the franchise, before any decision could be made on the holding of a referendum.  This analysis will be undertaken by the relevant Ministers who will report back to Government on the matter.<br/><br/>A Working Group on Seanad Reform, chaired by Dr. Maurice Manning, was established by the Taoiseach in December 2014.  This Group is exploring ways of reforming Seanad &Eacute;ireann and the manner in which it carries out its business and has been asked to report back to Government not later than the end of March 2015.  The Group is examining these issues within existing Constitutional parameters. <br/><br/>It is clear from our contacts that many of our emigrants abroad see the extension of voting rights to Irish citizens outside the State as being an important step in deepening their engagement with Ireland and allowing them to play a more active role in Irish society.  I understand and appreciate their aspirations in this regard.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-26a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/979" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015022600050#WRA01700"><p>Ireland, in common with all other EU Member States, was unable to support the UN General Assembly resolution on the modalities for the implementation of General Assembly Resolution 68/304 on the establishment of a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes.  The main focus of the  resolution was the setting up of an <i>ad hoc</i>committee to elaborate a binding debt resolution mechanism.At the time of the vote, the EU explained that:<blockquote>&ldquo;The ad-hoc committee must be limited to the elaboration of a non-binding 'set of principles' which builds upon a market-based voluntary contractual approach to sovereign debt restructuring and aims at furthering its implementation and use.  Neither the EU nor Member States will participate in discussions aiming at the establishment of a binding multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes.&rdquo;</blockquote>As the resolution did not limit the scope of the <i>ad hoc </i>committee, the EU position is that in these circumstances we will not be participating in the work of the committee.<br/><br/>Ireland, together with our EU colleagues, and with many other UN member States, is actively engaged in ongoing processes to address the issue of sovereign debt restructuring.  Ireland considers that the work being undertaken at other levels, including in the IMF and at the International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa in July, offers more appropriate and established means for dialogue on the matter.  Ireland will play our full role in working for the success of the crucially important Addis meeting, which is central to the negotiations on the Post-2015 Development Agenda.  These major UN negotiations are being co-chaired by Ireland and Kenya. <br/><br/>Ireland continues to support processes aimed at resolving global debt issues through dialogue, using the most appropriate and effective mechanisms to support the countries most seriously affected.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-26a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015022600050#WRA01900"><p>The question of outstanding commitments from the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements was considered during the Stormont House talks.  Throughout the talks, the Government maintained the view that the best way to strengthen peace and reconciliation across this island was to implement fully the commitments undertaken in these Agreements.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the Good Friday Agreement commitment on the establishment of a consultative Civic Forum in Northern Ireland, the Government advanced the position during the Stormont House talks that greater civic engagement would stimulate informed public debate in Northern Ireland in relation to key societal challenges.  I welcome that the Stormont House Agreement provides for the establishment of a civic advisory panel to meet regularly on key social, cultural and economic issues and to advise the Northern Ireland Executive.  Proposals for a civic advisory panel in Northern Ireland are currently being prepared for consideration.  The ultimate objective is for the first meeting of the panel to take place in June 2015.   </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that it was included in a paper tabled by the Government at the outset of the Stormont House talks, I was disappointed that a commitment to an Irish Language Act, either enacted in Westminster or the Northern Ireland Assembly, did not form part of the final Agreement.  I welcome, however, the explicit endorsement in the Agreement by the British Government of the principle of respect for and recognition of the Irish language in Northern Ireland.   </p>  <p>  I particularly welcome the recent public consultation announced by the Northern Ireland Executive&rsquo;s Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure on an Irish Language Bill, which will run until 5 May.  This follows the Minister&rsquo;s recent publication of a &ldquo;Strategy to Enhance and Protect the Development of the Irish Language 2015-2035&rdquo;, as well as a similar Strategy for Ulster-Scots.  The Strategies set out roadmaps for the Irish Language, and for the Ulster-Scots language, heritage and culture, over the next 20 years in a range of areas such as education, public services, the community and the media.  </p>  <p>  While the Government would have wished to see the establishment of a North South Consultative Forum and a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, the necessary enabling consensus was not forthcoming during the Stormont House talks. </p>  <p>  The Government will avail of other opportunities to secure progress on these outstanding issues.  We will also continue our broader efforts to ensure that the full potential of the Agreements is realised towards achieving effective partnership government, genuine reconciliation between divided communities and economic prosperity for all in Northern Ireland. </p></reply>

I am appalled, in particular, at the rising number of civilian casualties in recent weeks as a direct consequence of the indiscriminate shelling of residential areas in the conflict zone.   </p>  <p>  The welfare of civilians caught up in the hostilities is a major concern and I fully support EU calls on all sides to respect International Humanitarian Law.  It is vital that the protection of civilians and humanitarian workers is ensured and that unhindered humanitarian access is granted to populations in need, in line with humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. It is also essential that the OSCE Mission is permitted to freely undertake its important monitoring and verification work in all areas of the conflict region. </p>  <p>  The most effective way of ensuring the safety of the civilian population is to stop the violence.  On 12 February, an agreement was reached in Minsk on a new peace deal aimed at ending the fighting.  The declaration agreed in Minsk by Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande, President Putin and President Poroschenko and the package of measures signed by the parties to the conflict provides for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons in eastern Ukraine.  The package also contains a timetable for the implementation of key parts of the September Minsk Agreements, which provide the basis for a comprehensive resolution of the crisis.</p>  <p>  On 17 February, the UN Security Council unanimously called on all parties to immediately cease hostilities and abide by the commitments agreed in Minsk.  EU High Representative Federica Mogherini has also issued a strong statement to this effect.  I fully support the UN Security Council Resolution and the High Representative&rsquo;s call, which also underlined the need for the agreed withdrawal of heavy weapons.  It is critical that all parties honour their commitments to end the fighting and fully support a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  On 18 February, President Poroschenko raised the idea of deploying a UN-mandated peacekeeping force to eastern Ukraine.  Russia and the separatists have reportedly rejected the suggestion, claiming that it was not part of the 12 February Minsk agreement.    </p></reply>

There has been an increase in tensions in the prison in recent weeks.  This is due in part to the issuing of threats by prisoners against Prison Service officials in a context where a serving prison officer, David Black, was murdered by dissidents in November 2012.  It is also related to recent construction work in Roe House intended to increase the space available to prisoners in the separated regime for association.  However, it appears the well meaning intentions behind the works were not effectively communicated in advance to inmates.   </p>  <p>  A protest by a small number of prisoners on 2 February ended with both the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice, David Ford, and the Director General of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, Sue McAllister, reporting no injuries to staff or prisoners.  I am aware that some prisoners have said that they were injured during the protest.  Members of the independent assessment team have since met with prisoners and prison management to hear their perspectives on the protest and on how best to take things forward.</p>  <p>  Despite the increase in tension, I take some encouragement from renewed calls by both the Northern Ireland Prison Service and prisoner representatives for the full implementation of the stocktake report.  It is important that this work continue with the good will and support of all the relevant stake holders.  The Northern Ireland Prison Service has reiterated its commitment to the implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  It would certainly facilitate progress if all threats against those working in the prison administration were lifted.  All such threats are completely unacceptable, and serve only to frustrate the process of improving the atmosphere in the prison.  The independent assessment group continues with their engagement, to encourage the implementation of their recommendations, and would be open to a meeting with the Deputy to discuss on-going concerns.  I have discussed prison issues with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on a number of occasions, most recently on 11 February.  I also met in January with a member of the independent assessment group which completed the stocktake Report of September 2014.  My officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continuously monitor the situation at Maghaberry Prison, including through contact with their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Office and officials in the Northern Ireland Prison Service, as well as members of the independent assessment group, and have been keeping me closely informed of developments. </p></reply>

The international community is severely challenged by the number and the seriousness humanitarian crises, driven by conflict, chronic instability and economic and environmental shocks.  Against this backdrop, the UN Secretary-General is convening a World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 to identify ways to meet increasing humanitarian needs as effectively as possible.    </p>  <p>  The UN is at present organising a series of regional consultations in the lead up to the Global Summit next year.  These focus on four themes &ndash; humanitarian effectiveness; reducing vulnerability and managing risk; transformation and innovation and serving the needs of people in conflict. </p>  <p>  Here in Ireland, five stakeholder groups engaged in humanitarian action - civil society, academia, diaspora communities, and the public and private sectors - have come together to reflect on the four priority themes and shape Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the global process.  This unique collaboration will also offer the Irish public the opportunity to give their views through online consultation.  The process will culminate in an Irish Humanitarian Summit, to be held in Dublin in May 2015. </p>  <p>  I see this as an important opportunity to recognise Ireland&rsquo;s strong humanitarian tradition and to re-affirm our national commitment to principled and effective humanitarian action.  It offers a real opportunity to forge innovative solutions and build Irish partnerships that can add value in humanitarian response.  Above all, our deliberations should ensure that the people affected by humanitarian crises are at the centre of our considerations.  The messages from the Irish Summit will inform our participation in the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul in 2016.</p></reply>

Under international law, the economic resources of a non-self governing territory may only be exploited for the benefit of the people of the territory, on their behalf or in consultation with their representatives.

Ireland is completely opposed to the death penalty in time of peace or war and is party to various UN and European human rights treaties that have successively limited (and, in the case of the Council of Europe, completely outlawed) the practice.  Furthermore, Ireland condemns all forms of arbitrary, summary and extrajudicial executions.  <br/><br/>In November 2014 Ireland, together with the other EU Member States, co-sponsored the UN General Assembly&rsquo;s resolution on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions.  At the core of this resolution are the right to life and the fight against impunity.  Notably, by way of this resolution, the General Assembly expressed its deep concern<i></i>about acts that can amount to extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions committed against persons exercising their rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression in all regions of the world, and about killings committed by non-State actors, including terrorist groups and criminal organisations, that may amount to abuses of international human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law.<br/><br/>The strong text of this resolution includes references to killings of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities or because of their sexual orientation or gender identity; killings of persons for reasons related to their activities as human rights defenders, lawyers, journalists or demonstrators; killings of persons affected by terrorism or hostage-taking or living under foreign occupation, racially motivated killings, killings of refugees, internally displaced persons, migrants, street children or members of indigenous communities, killings committed in the name of passion or in the name of honour, and killings committed for discriminatory reasons on any basis.<br/><br/>In June 2014, during the 26<sup>th</sup>session of the UN Human Rights Council, Ireland co-sponsored the resolution which renewed the mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions.  This resolution reiterates the obligation of all States to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; to identify and to bring to justice those responsible, while ensuring the right of every person to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law; to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to bring an end to impunity and to prevent the recurrence of such executions. <br/><br/>As recognised in the above resolutions, extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions may in certain circumstances amount to genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes as defined in international law, including the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.  In circumstances where the Court has jurisdiction by virtue of such executions taking place in the territory of a state party or state that has accepted the Court&rsquo;s role, or by the national of such a state, or where the United Nations Security Council has determined that the ICC has jurisdiction, prosecutions may be brought against alleged perpetrators in appropriate circumstances. <br/><br/>Let me reassure the Deputy that Ireland is committed to upholding the respect for international law in order to prevent extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions in all circumstances and to working for the complete abolition of the death penalty.</p></reply>

My Department is committed to the success of this excellent initiative with a global reach.  ID2015 aims to create 1,800 jobs and 200 new businesses by promoting Ireland as a hub for design excellence and by encouraging investment in design as a key component of competitiveness and innovation.<br/><br/>My Department is represented on the steering group of Irish Design 2015.  ID2015 is convened by the Design &amp;amp; Crafts Council of Ireland (DCCoI), in collaboration with partner organisations, on behalf of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Enterprise Ireland.  President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins is Patron of ID2015.<br/><br/>Since work on this initiative began in early 2014, my Department has facilitated contact between the ID2015 team and the Embassy network.  At the request of the ID2015 team, my Department also facilitated and funded the display of &lsquo;Weathering&rsquo;, an exhibition of contemporary Irish craft and design in the Ullens Centre for Contemporary Art in Beijing, during President Higgins&rsquo; State visit to China in December 2014, as a means of raising awareness of Irish design in that country.<br/><br/>The programme for ID2015 will see significant flagship events in eight design capitals during 2015, viz. Chicago, Eindhoven, London, Milan, New York, Paris, Shenzhen/Hong Kong and Tokyo.  Events include Milan and Dutch Design Weeks, the London Festival of Architecture (where Ireland is the inaugural country of focus), London Fashion Week, the London Design Festival, the Chicago Architecture Biennial and the Bi-City Biennale of Urbanism/Architecture in Hong Kong/Shenzhen.  The Embassy network is working closely with the ID2015 team on these events.<br/><br/>Aside from the flagship events overseas, the ID2015 team is also working with our Embassy network to plan smaller events to celebrate Irish Design in a further 26 destinations around the globe.<br/><br/>The ID2015 team is currently finalising the production of a &lsquo;capsule exhibition&rsquo; for use by the Embassy network.  This portable exhibition will showcase the best of Irish design across the breadth of design disciplines and will link Irish Design to events in international cities globally.  My Department has advised on logistics and agreed to facilitate the transportation of this exhibition to the Embassy network.  The Embassy network will use this exhibition to raise awareness of Irish design among key players in the design and associated sectors overseas.<br/><br/>The Embassy network will also make full use of the unique opportunity afforded by St Patrick&rsquo;s Day events worldwide to deliver key messaging on Ireland as a design hub. <br/><br/>The Minister for Diaspora Affairs, Jimmy Deenihan T.D., has been very supportive of ID2015, promoting it strongly to Irish communities overseas.  <br/><br/>&ldquo;We Built this City&rdquo; is an initiative with a strong diaspora focus which will aim to tell the story of how cities are created, connecting the Irish diaspora and celebrating the contribution Irish people have made to the construction, design, and development of the built environment from historic to contemporary times.  This initiative will feature in London, New York and Chicago.<br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  My Department has also agreed to promote the &lsquo;Global Irish Design Challenge&rsquo;, to be launched next month, targeted at the Irish Diaspora worldwide.  D</font>esigners who have Irish lineage or a strong affiliation to Ireland will be invited to design a 2D or 3D object that reflects their interpretation of contemporary Ireland.  The call for entries will run from March&ndash;September 2015 and a high-profile international panel of experts will assess submitted entries, with the ambition that the top entries will form part of a touring exhibition in 2016 to coincide with the 1916 centenary celebrations.<font color="#104160"> </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  I can assure the Deputy of my Department&rsquo;s strong commitment to the success of Irish Design 2015.</font></p></reply>

The purpose of my visit was to gather information and develop a deeper understanding of the situation on the ground in the context of the Middle East Peace Process.<br/><br/>I met with a range of interlocutors, including the the Foreign Minister of Israel, Avigdor Liberman, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Prime Minister, Rami Hamdallah. I did not meet with Hamas in Gaza.<br/><br/>I also met with UN agencies and with civil society groups to develop a better understanding of the issues faced on all sides.<br/><br/>In Gaza, I was struck by the desperation of the humanitarian situation for so many people.  I met with Pierre Krahenbuhl, the Commissioner General of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).  I visited an UNRWA school and a temporary shelter for families displaced by last year&rsquo;s conflict, where I met with a number of families directly affected by the conflict. <br/><br/>In my subsequent meeting with Foreign Minister Liberman, I raised the need to make further progress in lifting the blockade, to meet humanitarian need and as an enabler of social and economic progress.<br/><br/>One of the big challenges for the reconstruction of Gaza is that much of the money committed at the Cairo Conference on Reconstruction has not yet materialised.  I was pleased to announce funding of &euro;4.7 million for UNRWA and the UN&rsquo;s Emergency Response Fund in the course of my visit.  I hope that other donors can move quickly to deliver on their commitments. <br/><br/>I also met Israelis living near the border with Gaza who live in fear of Hamas attacks.<br/><br/>In the West Bank, I saw at first-hand the impact of settlements, including on the daily life of Palestinians.  In my meeting with Minister Liberman, I raised the issue of settlements and the fact that their continued expansion is a threat to the viability of two-State solution. <br/><br/>At the end of my visit, I had an opportunity to discuss the situation with the Quartet representative on the Middle East, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.I also had a telephone conversation with the leader of Israel&rsquo;s Labour Party, Isaac Herzog, who has strong links with Ireland.<br/><br/>In all of my meetings, I emphasised the need for political leadership and risk-taking.  <br/><br/>Israel is currently in the middle of an election and I hope that we will also soon see elections to the Palestinian Authority. <br/><br/>I met last month in Dublin with the EU High Representative, Federica Mogherini and I spoke with her again from Israel last week.  She is committed to increasing the EU&rsquo;s engagement in the Middle East Peace Process.  She is proposing a reappraisal of the EU&rsquo;s approach and how it can best contribute to creating the conditions for a resumption of purposeful negotiations aimed at the achievement of a two-State solution in co-operation with other key players.  This accords with my own thinking, and my visit will enable me to contribute substantively to the discussions she will convene.<br/><br/>I also had a number of engagements not directly related to the Middle East Peace Process.  I visited the site of Teva, an Israeli pharmaceutical company that employs more than 500 people in Ireland.

Widespread violence has forced 2 million people to flee their homes; 1.5 million people have been internally displaced, and half a million people have taken refuge in neighbouring countries. </p>  <p>  I saw the devastating impact of the crisis when I accompanied President Higgins on a visit to a refugee camp in Gambella, in Ethiopia, last November.  The vast majority of South Sudanese refugees arriving in Ethiopia are women and children, often malnourished and in poor health.</p>  <p>  Since the outbreak of the conflict, Ireland has provided almost &euro;11 million to UN partners and non-governmental organisations working on the ground.  I am committed to continuing Ireland&rsquo;s support.  On 9 February, our Ambassador to Kenya participated at a high level event in Nairobi which helped to build support for the response to this severe humanitarian crisis.  We are now delivering on our pledge by providing a further &euro;3 million for humanitarian assistance in South Sudan.  This funding is being disbursed to the UN-managed Common Humanitarian Fund which provides flexible funding to UN and NGO partners to protect vulnerable women and children, and to meet food, nutrition and health needs.  In addition, I expect to provide additional direct funding to our NGO partners for their work in South Sudan through Irish Aid&rsquo;s Emergency Response Fund.  </p>  <p>  We will continue to monitor the situation closely and provide assistance, within our means and as the situation evolves.</p></reply>

Ireland is deeply concerned by the persecution of Christians.  </p>  <p>  I am deeply shocked by recent reports of the brutal killing of Coptic Christians in Libya by ISIS and the kidnapping of 150 Assyrian Christians in eastern Syria.  These are monstrous acts beyond comprehension, which must be condemned in the strongest possible terms.  They are also savage attacks on minority communities and on the values of tolerance and pluralism which underpin freedom of religion or belief.  Ireland has repeatedly recalled the duty of States to protect vulnerable minorities in the Middle East, including Christian communities. I have reiterated that call and will be raising this with my EU colleagues at the earliest opportunity. The situation is particularly difficult, of course, in areas where the authority of the state has effectively collapsed.   </p>  <p>  Ireland attaches great importance to combating all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  We firmly believe in tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.</p>  <p>  Ireland raises the issue of the safety of Christians through its official bilateral contacts with the countries in question, stressing the responsibility of the government to protect all citizens and minorities.  We consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora, including the EU and UN.  I highlighted the issue when I addressed the UN General Assembly in New York on 29 September 2014.  I also raised it during my meeting with UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon.</p>  <p>  Ireland works within and alongside the EU to address the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, notably with the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief adopted during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013.  These Guidelines provide EU officials with an overview of the legal and policy framework within which the right to freedom of religion or belief is protected.  They also elaborate an EU strategy on how to engage with third countries on the right to freedom of religion or belief, a strategy which we hope to see bear fruit as we assess the implementation of the Guidelines.</p>  <p>  The EU leads resolutions on freedom of religion or belief at both the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, and at the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva, of which Ireland is currently a member.  Ireland is an active participant in the negotiation of these resolutions.  In 2014, the EU-led resolutions on freedom of religion or belief were successfully adopted without a vote by the HRC (March 2014) and by the UN General Assembly during its 69th session (December 2014).  Ireland also raised concerns in relation to persecution on the basis of religion or belief in interactive dialogues with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion during the 69th session of the Third Committee in 2014. </p>  <p>  The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is a unique peer review mechanism whereby the human rights records of individual states are reviewed in the UN Human Rights Council.  Ireland is an active participant in the UPR. and, where applicable, raises concerns in relation to persecution on the basis of religion or belief during the dialogue with states under review.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to actively support freedom of religion or belief across our foreign policy.</p></reply>

Ireland has continually advocated that civil society actors must be free to operate in a safe and enabling environment, free from repression.  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns on such human rights issues in Bahrain have been conveyed regularly to the Bahraini authorities.  <br/><br/>At the second Universal Periodic Review of Bahrain in May 2012 at the Human Rights Council Ireland recommended that Bahrain amend any article of its Penal Code that can be used to prosecute individuals for the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly or association, and bring its laws into line with international standards established by the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights.  <br/><br/>Ireland was one of 47 member states who delivered a joint statement expressing serious concern over the human rights situation in Bahrain at the 26<sup>th</sup>Session of the UN Human Rights Council in June of 2014.  In this statement, the signatories expressed their concern regarding the protection of human rights in Bahrain and called on the government to expedite the implementation of the recommendations received from the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry in this regard. <br/><br/>At the 27<sup>th</sup>session of the Human Rights Council in September 2014, in a national statement, Ireland again expressed our serious concerns about the human rights situation, in particular condemning &lsquo;the continuing arbitrary detention of human rights defenders, detained for peacefully exercising their human rights&rsquo;.<br/><br/>The situation faced by human rights defenders in Bahrain has also been raised with the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders. <br/><br/>Human rights defenders and civil society actors, whether in Bahrain or elsewhere, should not be detained or persecuted for simply exercising their rights. <br/><br/>I am aware of reports of the revocation of citizenship referred to.  I would recall Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that, &ldquo;Everyone has the right to a nationality&rdquo; and, &ldquo;No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality.&rdquo;  Without due process, no one should be deprived of their nationality. <br/><br/>Ireland will continue to raise its concerns in relation to these matters. </p></reply>

The package also contains a timetable for the implementation of key parts of the September Minsk Agreements, which provide the basis for a comprehensive resolution of the crisis.   </p>  <p>  The ceasefire came into effect at midnight on 14 February.  The OSCE has reported that it had largely held across most parts of the conflict area, with the notable exception of Debaltseve, a strategically important transport hub linking the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk.  Despite signing the ceasefire agreement, Russian-backed separatists continued a full scale assault on Debaltseve forcing Ukrainian troops to withdraw from the town, which is now in rebel hands.  I strongly condemn the rebel assault on Debaltseve.  It is a major breach of the ceasefire and threatens to undermine the peace deal agreed in Minsk on 12 February. </p>  <p>  Having achieved their objective in Debaltseve, it remains to be seen whether the rebels may now take steps to implement the ceasefire and withdraw their heavy weapons.  Russia has a key role to play in this regard given the considerable influence it exercises over the separatists groups.      </p>  <p>  Events last weekend, particularly the release of prisoners and the commitment by both sides to begin withdrawing heavy weapons this week, are positive signs. However, there have been worrying reports about shelling near Mariupol city.   </p>  <p>  Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande, President Poroshenko, President Putin and their Foreign Ministers remain in telephone contact and have indicated that they will continue to push for implementation of the package of measures agreed in Minsk on 12 February.   </p>  <p>  On 17 February, the UN Security Council unanimously called on all parties to immediately cease hostilities and abide by the commitments agreed in Minsk, including facilitating access for the OSCE Mission to enable them to monitor the situation on the ground.  EU High Representative Federica Mogherini has also issued a strong statement to this effect. </p>  <p>  I fully support the UN Security Council Resolution and the High Representative&rsquo;s call, which also underlined the need for the agreed withdrawal of heavy weapons.  It is critical that all parties honour their commitments to end the fighting and fully support a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine. </p></reply>

We considered how the EU can best respond to the crisis in Libya.  This meeting adopted Council Conclusions on Libya which set out the EU position in detail.    </p>  <p>  The conclusions welcomed the convening of UN-facilitated dialogue process, renewed EU support to the work of the UN in Libya, condemned human rights violations and underlined EU readiness to continue supporting Libya in its transition. </p>  <p>  It is my sincere hope that the promise of a political resolution to the crisis in Libya can be fulfilled.

The detailed expenditure data for 2014 are currently being collated and verified for ODA eligibility, and when finalised will be published in the statistical annexes to the Irish Aid Annual Report available at .<br/><br/>Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is implemented in challenging, complex and indeed, inherently risky environments.  My Department has implemented a comprehensive system of internal controls to mitigate against those risks, ensure the efficient and effective use of resources and deliver value for money.  It operates rigorous systems for planning, monitoring, evaluating and auditing all funding provided for under the aid programme.  Programmes are closely monitored at mission and headquarters level to ensure they deliver on the intended results, and are meeting our overall objective of contributing to the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger in some of the poorest countries and communities in the world. <br/><br/>All expenditure is subject to audit by the Department&rsquo;s Evaluation and Audit Unit which reports directly to the Secretary General of the Department.  The work of the Evaluation and Audit Unit is overseen by the Department&rsquo;s independent Audit Committee.  All expenditure is also audited annually by the Comptroller and Auditor General.<br/><br/>While  no system can safeguard completely against the incidence of  fraud, I am satisfied that the Department has in place a comprehensive system of controls which ensures all expenditure provides value for money, and that funding provided under the aid programme is used to the greatest possible effect for the purposes intended.  </p></reply>

That is because we believe it is critically important for our economy and for the ongoing development of British-Irish relations.  It is also our view that the EU itself is stronger and better with the UK as a full and committed member. We must therefore do what we can to help to encourage the UK to remain within the Union.  This means, as a starting point, continuing to work closely with our British partners &ndash; as well as other like-minded States &ndash; on policy issues where we share the same interests and approach.  The British Government and other British political parties have made clear that the achievement of common aims in regard to economic policy &ndash; including the completion of the single market in services, the conclusion of trade negotiations with third countries and a more streamlined approach to EU regulation &ndash; is a high priority in itself and will strengthen the case for the UK&rsquo;s continued membership.  Depending on the outcome of their general election in May, it is possible that the next British Government will make proposals on both how the functioning of the EU could be improved and specific UK concerns addressed.  Ireland will certainly consider any reasonable proposals on their merits, if and when they are presented.  We have a clear shared interest in seeing our Union operate more effectively.  We also recognise &ndash; as the European Council has done &ndash; that the UK has some legitimate concerns that should be addressed.  At the same time, we would not support anything which we think could weaken or otherwise adversely affect the Union.</p>  <p>  The Government is monitoring developments in the EU-UK relationship very carefully.  My Department is co-operating with other Departments, especially the Department of the Taoiseach, in this regard.  Our Embassy in London naturally plays a key role in this process and we rely heavily too on the reporting and analysis we receive from our Embassies elsewhere. </p>  <p>  We are also, of course, engaging directly with our British colleagues on the question of their EU membership.  I myself had a detailed discussion with Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond when he visited Dublin in December.  The subject has arisen as well in informal contacts with other British Ministers and our officials &ndash; in this Department, the Department of the Taoiseach and elsewhere &ndash; are engaging regularly with their counterparts in the UK system.  The UK&rsquo;s place in Europe is also regularly discussed with other EU partners at both political and senior official level.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, the nature of the UK&rsquo;s relationship with the EU is primarily an issue for the British people and we must continue to respect and be sensitive to the democratic process under way there.  We will though continue to play a constructive role in that debate and to ensure that our views are heard and clearly understood.</p></reply>

Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., we continue to work closely with our high level Government contacts and with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond towards achieving some relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the United States and improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.  When the Minister for Foreign Affairs travels to New York next month, he will meet and exchange views with a range of groups and organisations supporting the undocumented Irish and immigration reform.  In addition, Taoiseach Enda Kenny T.D., will travel to Washington for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and will meet with President Obama, Vice President Biden and other senior US Administration figures as well as with key Congressional contacts.    </p>  <p>  These meetings will provide an important opportunity to reiterate our concerns in regard to the position of the undocumented Irish, to seek further information on the detail of President Obama&rsquo;s executive action and to encourage progress on a comprehensive legislative package by Congress.</p>  <p>  While the executive measures announced by President Obama clearly represent real progress, Minister Flanagan and I are well aware that some will not benefit from these new arrangements and the Deputy will also be aware that there are currently legal challenges underway. </p>  <p>  During my visit to Washington from 20-21 January, I had a number of meetings with key Republican members of the House.  It provided an opportunity to assess the intentions of the Republican majority in terms of dealing with immigration this year and to convey the Government&rsquo;s ongoing determination to achieve some relief for the undocumented and improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.</p>  <p>  Our Ambassador and her team in Washington are continuing their ongoing engagement with the US administration on this priority issue for the Government.

I share the very serious concern about the situation in South Sudan, which achieved its independence in 2011 but has been in turmoil since the outbreak of conflict in December 2013.  Continuing violence and threats have forced almost two million people to flee their homes.  The country&rsquo;s warring parties signed another ceasefire agreement in February following regional talks led by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), which were supported by the African Union and the European Union.  However, the current peace remains very fragile and the humanitarian situation is extremely serious.  Reports that 89 young boys were abducted over the weekend in Upper Nile State, for use as child soldiers, are particularly worrying.   </p>  <p>  South Sudan remains on the brink of famine, due to insecurity, continuing displacement and reduced food production.  Some 2.5 million people are facing crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity.  Malnutrition rates among children have more than doubled.   The international community has been working with the United Nations to protect civilians and provide humanitarian relief.  The mandate of the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), which provides security and protection for civilians, has been extended to May 2015. </p>  <p>  The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs recently co-hosted a high-level conference on South Sudan at which donors pledged some $600 million in assistance.  Since the outbreak of the conflict at the end of 2013, Ireland has provided almost &euro;11 million for South Sudan, through UN partners and NGOs working to alleviate the suffering of the people of the country and refugees across the region.  We have pledged a further &euro;3 million so far in 2015.  We will continue to monitor the political and humanitarian situation closely, through our Embassies in the region, and in co-operation with our EU partners and the United Nations.  </p></reply>

As I have indicated before, the deaths, casualties and detentions arising from the unrest there require full, impartial investigation in accordance with due legal process.  The apparently high levels of impunity in the case of serious crimes is a matter of further concern as is, indeed, the serious economic situation affecting the people of Venezuela.  I share the concerns expressed in this regard by EU High Representative Mogherini, and those expressed previously by High Representative Ashton, concerning the detention of political figures and of students.  Human rights, including the freedom of expression, of assembly and of association must be protected and upheld.  I renew my call for all parties, including government, opposition, students and civil society, to work together to find a consensus for overcoming Venezuela&rsquo;s current difficulties.   </p>  <p>  This month is the anniversary of the protests last year which resulted in a considerable number of deaths and detentions.  We are following the situation closely and are aware of recent reports, including those to which the Deputy refers.  I remain of the view that the best hope for progress in Venezuela is for an inclusive dialogue that will address, through peaceful means alone, the legitimate concerns of all parties. </p></reply>

Since taking up this role I have visited many Irish communities and the universal reaction has been very positive.  <br/><br/>I am very aware that the question of the extension of voting rights to Irish citizens abroad is an issue of great interest to many members of our community abroad.  I, and my colleague Minister Flanagan, have had a number of meetings with members of the Irish diaspora community at which this topic has been the subject of discussion.In addition, as part of the consultation phase of the review of our Diaspora Policy the issue of voting rights was raised by many of the groups and individuals who made submissions.  <br/><br/>At a meeting in September 2013, the members of the Convention on the Constitution supported the introduction of the right to vote in Presidential elections for citizens resident outside the State.  <br/><br/>The Government has recently considered their response to the recommendation of the Convention and has decided that it is necessary to analyse the full range of practical and policy issues<font color="#FF0000"> </font>that would arise in any significant extension of the franchise, before any decision could be made on the holding of a referendum.  This analysis will be undertaken by the relevant Ministers who will report back to Government on the matter.<br/><br/>A Working Group on Seanad Reform, chaired by Dr. Maurice Manning, was established by the Taoiseach in December 2014.  This Group is exploring ways of reforming Seanad &Eacute;ireann and the manner in which it carries out its business and has been asked to report back to Government not later than the end of March 2015.  The Group is examining these issues within existing Constitutional parameters. <br/><br/>It is clear from our contacts that many of our emigrants abroad see the extension of voting rights to Irish citizens outside the State as being an important step in deepening their engagement with Ireland and allowing them to play a more active role in Irish society.  I understand and appreciate their aspirations in this regard.</p></reply>

This remains an issue to the present day. There has been a change in Government in Sri Lanka following the presidential election last month, and I welcome the stated commitment of the new President, Maithripala Sirisena, to re-establish democracy, freedom, good governance and respect for human rights.  Through our Embassy in New Delhi, which is accredited to Sri Lanka, we are in regular contact with the EU Delegation in Colombo which reports that the new Government have already made some positive steps to deal with resettlement issues, including returning some military land (used for commercial purposes), nomination of a civilian governor in the Northern Province, cancelling the foreign travel restrictions in the North and welcoming Tamil refugees from India.<br/><br/><b></b>This year, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) plans to enhance its capacity to conduct refugee status determination and resettlement submissions in Sri Lanka.  I understand that they will also facilitate the voluntary return of Sri Lankan refugees and those internally displaced, in safety and dignity, and will assist them to reintegrate through community mobilization projects.<br/><br/>At the UN Human Rights Council session in March 2014 Ireland supported a resolution promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka.  One aspect of that resolution was a request for an investigation by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights into alleged serious violations of human rights in Sri Lanka.

JobsPlus is biased in favour of those who are longer term unemployed.  It provides employers with two levels of payment: &euro;7,500 over two years where a jobseeker who is 12-24 months on the live register is recruited and &euro;10,000 for each person recruited who has been unemployed for more than 24 months.  Since January 2015, eligibility for the lower level of subsidy has been broadened to include young jobseekers (aged 18-24) unemployed for four months or more and persons in a jobseekers allowance transitional arrangement.   The subsidy is paid in monthly instalments over a two year period provided the employment is maintained.  At the end of January 2015, the Department provided 3,010 employers with cash payments valued at some &euro;1.53 million in respect of 4,047 employees.  Sixty-two percent of those employees supported had previously been on the live register for at least 24 months.</p>  <p>  The proposal made by the Deputy to provide a subsidy of 70% of the minimum wage for 37.5 hours work per week for a period of 18 months for each employee would cost &euro;983.94 per month compared with the lower level of subsidy of &euro;312.50 per month and &euro;416.67 per month for the upper level of subsidy.  The cost of the proposal would be of the order of &euro;17,710 for the 18 month duration against the current costs as stated above.  Given the level of take up of the scheme to date and the positive feedback from employers, I do not consider that a rationale exists for increasing the level of payment as proposed, nor do I consider that the proposal would represents good value for money in achieving the objectives for JobsPlus.</p></reply>

It should be noted that both of these credits are no longer available for new claimants. Mortgage interest relief is not available for homes purchased on or after 1 January 2013 and rent relief has not been available for new claimants from 8 December 2010. The relief for pre-existing claimants is being be phased out with both schemes scheduled to finish at the end of 2017.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to estimate the cost to the Exchequer of providing the &euro;6,000 housing tax credit outlined by the Deputy as there is insufficient detail as to how such a credit would work. For example, is the proposed tax credit an annual allowance or a once-off lifetime credit? In addition, it is not clear how the proposed credit would interact with mortgage interest relief already claimed, for example, how would it apply where a person has already received mortgage interest relief for one year, compared to someone who has claimed it for six years. These variables would affect the estimation of cost over a period of time.</p>  <p>  I would have concerns about the introduction of such a credit in terms of the possibility of its value being absorbed by landlords, resulting in no gain for tenants. Similarly, the availablity of such a credit could act to encourage lenders to charge higher rates of interest on home loans. In addition, it should be noted that tax credits are only of value to those who are liable to income tax. In this regard, the Deputy may wish to note that it is estimated that approximately 38% of income earners will not have a liability to income tax in 2015.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy wishes to scope out the proposal in greater detail my officials in conjunction with Revenue will see if they can provide an estimate of the cost of the proposed credit.</p></reply>

The objective of the compliance program is to ensure that the purpose of any transfer of pension funds off shore is for bona fide reasons and do not contravene tax legislation or undermine pension tax policy. At this point, the question of settlements does not arise as the priority to date has been to verify the bona fides of the transfers and to establish the scale of the issues involved. </p>  <p>  For taxpayer confidentiality reasons it is not possible to give precise details of the enquiries underway. However, I am advised that from 2012 to date a total of 456 notifications to transfer pension arrangements off-shore have been received by the Revenue Commissioners and the value of the funds to be transferred amount to &euro;54,707,326. It is important to bear in mind that not all of these transfer notifications may actually have proceeded to an actual transfer. Also many would have been made for bona fide purposes and fully compliant with tax legislation and pension tax policy.  While there is a range of countries involved, 348 of the transfers were to Australia, Cyprus, Malta and the United Kingdom.</p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that moving pension funds off-shore in an effort to circumvent the requirements of Irish pension tax legislation may fall foul of the conditions under which a pension scheme was approved by the Revenue Commissioners as an exempt approved scheme or the conditions under which a Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) product received Revenue approval.  This could result in the withdrawal of the approval of an occupational pension scheme in accordance with the provisions of section 772(5) of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 or the withdrawal of the approval of the PRSA product under section 787K (3) and (4) TCA 1997. Any such withdrawal of approval could trigger significant tax liabilities on the sums moved off shore and the withdrawal or claw back of tax reliefs. Moreover, in such cases and depending on the circumstances and the motivation of the individual concerned the possibility also arises that such transactions may also fall foul of the legislation designed to counter tax avoidance transactions.</p>  <p>  In addition to Revenue s compliance program, the Department of Finance has initiated a review of the whole area of pension transfers abroad in conjunction with Revenue, the Department of Social Protection and the Pensions Authority.  Revenue s findings from the on-going compliance programme will feed into and inform that review.</p></reply>

Following review of all submissions received the Central Bank has informed me that a feedback statement outlining the information received, the Central Bank's response and the final regulations for credit unions will then be published. All submissions received will be published on the Central Bank's website.I am satisfied that the safety of members savings and the security of the credit union sector as a whole are central to any actions taken by the Registrar of Credit Unions.<br/><br/>The draft lending regulations set out in CP88 define the categories of lending a credit union can undertake but do not limit credit unions to charging interest rates based on the category of lending i.e. a credit union may charge different interest rates for loans within the same category of lending.  Under the draft lending regulations where a credit union is providing home improvement loans these may be provided as personal loans or as house loans.  Where such a loan is provided as a house loan the credit union must hold the first legal charge secured on the property. However, where such a loan is provided as a personal loan there is not a requirement to hold the first legal charge secured on the property. <br/><br/>The Commission on Credit Unions recommended the restructuring of the sector and on foot of this recommendation the Credit Union Restructuring BoardReBo was established. Restructuring is currently being carried out on a voluntary, incentivised and time-bound basis in line with the Commission recommendation. While restructuring can be used by credit unions as a means of addressing current weaknesses or as a business strategy for credit unions that wish to achieve the scale necessary to develop a more sophisticated business model, it is recognised that restructuring will not apply to all credit unions and that some credit unions will continue to operate on a stand-alone basis.<br/><br/>While the Government recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in this country, it is vital that measures implemented will ensure a viable credit union sector into the future. <br/><br/></p></reply>

Any agent acting on behalf of a regulated lender must comply with the requirements of Irish financial services law and failure to do so may result in the Central Bank imposing penalties on the regulated lender concerned.   </p>  <p>  I am also informed by the Central Bank that it has also communicated to firms its preference that the outcome of any sale of mortgage books by regulated entities would ensure continuity of borrower protections under Codes and also that the purchaser would have relevant policies and procedures, systems and control checks to appropriately manage a mortgage loan book. </p>  <p>In relation to the sale or transfer of loan books to third parties, Provision 3.11 of the 2012 Consumer Protection Code requires that regulated entities subject to that Code notify the Central Bank immediately where they intend to transfer all or part of their regulated activities to another regulated entity. In general however, the Central Bank has no role in approving the sale or transfer of loan books to third parties, and it has no data available at this time on the number and book value of such sales or transfers for the period requested.  In addition, by virtue of an exemption in Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997, an unregulated entity to whom a cash loan is transferred by a regulated entity is not currently subject to Central Bank supervision under the Consumer Protection Code and CCMA.</p>  <p>  However, I understand that most purchasers of loan books have stated they are voluntarily complying with the Codes. Of course voluntary compliance is not enforceable. In order to ensure that consumers maintain these protections, the Government committed in March 2014 to bringing forward legislation to protect consumers whose loans are sold to unregulated entities.</p>  <p>  The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2015 was published in January and second stage of the Bill was taken in the D&aacute;il on 4 February. Since then, my officials have been in contact with the Central Bank and with the Office of the Attorney General to further progress the legislation. It remains my intention to ensure that borrowers whose loans are sold by a regulated entity to a currently unregulated entity maintain the same protections as they had prior to the sale. The Bill will continue its progress through the legislative process and I look forward to further discussion of the Bill at Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  In relation to the data requested by the Deputy, I said in PQ 42363 on 5 November last that  information from company announcements in the public domain, would suggest that between 8,000 and 10,000 mortgages in total have been sold to unregulated entities in recent years. Since then, I understand that approximately 6,000 mortgages were sold by IBRC.</p></reply>

Such an issue is a matter for the Stormont and UK Governments.</p>  <p>  While a formal assessment has not been carried out in relation to the possible impact of a cut in the Northern Ireland corporation tax rate on the economy in the Republic, it is well known that Ireland is a supporter of fair tax competition and the OECD has consistently stated that low corporation tax rates combined with a broad base is the best way to encourage economic growth while still maintaining tax revenues. That is what we have being doing for many years and what we will continue to do.</p>  <p>  The 12.5% rate is a central pillar of our taxation system but it is important to remember that attracting foreign direct investment and stimulating growth is about much more than just having a competitive tax rate. As I have stated many times, the Irish system is built upon the 3 Rs and while rate is a key feature, the other two Rs of regime and reputation are equally important in shaping a competitive taxation landscape.</p>  <p>  Ireland would be fully supportive of any measures which would make the Island of Ireland, as a whole, more competitive but a low stable corporate tax rate is only one piece in the competitiveness jigsaw. A reform of the Northern Ireland corporation tax rate has the potential to generate benefits on both parts of the island.</p></reply>

As a consequence the bank has submitted a Capital Plan to the SSM, which outlines how the bank intends to meet the capital shortfall.  Much of the shortfall has been met through performance in 2014 and deleverage of assets in 2014. The remaining shortfall will require the bank to raise capital, including equity capital, from private sources before 26 July 2015, diluting the State's shareholding.  Details of the capital raise, including quantum and structure, will be finalised and publicised in due course .  </p>  <p>  I am of the view that the best way to protect the value of the State's shareholding is to ensure Permanent TSB is well prepared, that it conducts a comprehensive and competitive exercise to raise the capital with appropriate legal and financial advice, and that the State has meaningful oversight and involvement in the process. Officials from my Shareholding Management Unit and our financial advisers, JP Morgan Cazenove, are well placed to fulfil this role and are engaging with the bank on important aspects of the capital raise on a regular basis.</p></reply>

However, in the last two months there are tentative indications of a moderation in price growth in Dublin; the monthly rate of property price growth was -0.1 per cent in November and was 0.3 per cent in December. This compares to an average monthly growth rate of close to 3 per cent in the six months prior to November 2014.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises that the main driver of house price growth in Dublin is a shortage in the supply of housing to meet growing demand. Under Construction 2020 Strategy: A Strategy for A Renewed Construction Sector, the Government has set out its strategy to address the issues that are impeding a fully functioning construction and property market. My Department along with other relevant Departments and bodies, is involved in a range of actions as part of the Strategy which addresses among other issues housing supply, planning issues, sustainable development financing, sustainable mortgage lending, as well as addressing legacy issues associated with the property bubble. </p>  <p>  The recently introduced macro prudential residential mortgage lending rules by the Central Bank are one of a number of instruments at the Central Bank's disposal to strengthen the resilience of the banking system and the household sector against sudden house price changes. To extent that the new regulations contribute to sustainable mortgage credit lending and affect buyers' price expectations, this may to contribute to a lowering of the current growth rate of property prices in Dublin.</p></reply>

This is a strategic approach that recognises the need, in line with international best practice, to move to a more sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems. The CFRAM Programme is the principal vehicle for implementing national policy on flood risk management and the European Directive on the Assessment and Management of Flood Risk (2007/EC/60).  Further information is available on the Programme website www.cfram.ie.</p>  <p>  In brief, the CFRAM Programme has three principal milestones:</p>  <p>- Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (completed)</p>  <p>- Flood Maps (for finalisation 2015)</p>  <p>- Flood Risk Management Plans (for finalisation 2016)</p>  <p>  This national programme of CFRAM Studies, which is being carried out by several engineering consultancies over six regions, is focused on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (or &ldquo;AFAs&rdquo;).  The designated AFAs were selected following the Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (PFRA) phase which involved public consultation including the public exhibition of consultation documentation in Cork Co. Council (and all other City and County Councils) in Autumn 2011. Arising from the PFRA, the town of Dunmanway has been designated as one of the AFAs and is being assessed under the South Western CFRAM Study.  </p>  <p>  Predictive flood mapping has been produced by engineering consultants based on extensive survey data and watercourse modelling. A Public Consultation Day on the draft flood maps was held in Dunmanway on 10th February last. The draft flood maps for Dunmanway are currently available for inspection on the Study website www.southwestcframstudy.ie and members of the public may provide feedback on same.  A national statutory consultation is due to be held in early summer.  </p>  <p>  All feedback received during the draft flood maps consultation period will form part of the process of finalisation of the flood maps.  It is important to emphasise that flood risk areas within Dunmanway will not be formally identified by the South Western CFRAM Study until the flood maps are finalised later in 2015.</p>  <p>  Following the finalisation of the flood mapping and the assessment of appropriate flood risk management options, the final output from this important project will be integrated Flood Risk Management Plans containing specific measures to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risk identified. The CFRAM Programme will be used to determine national priorities for future State investment in flood defences. </p></reply>

The Act does not accord me as Minister any function in this regard. </p>  <p>  There are two provisions in the legislation governing the assessment of valuations which result in the issue of valuation certificates, i.e. revaluation and revision. They are dealt with under Parts 5 and 6 of the Valuation Act 2001 respectively. There has been no change in the legislative provisions during this D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  Revision of valuation is the mechanism used to maintain local authority valuations lists. It is used to add new properties to the list, to amend the valuations of altered properties and to remove demolished or defunct properties from the list. By contrast, in a revaluation the entire commercial valuation list for a local authority is brought up-to-date by reference to a specific valuation date. The entire list is published on one date (usually 31 December) and it comes into effect for rating purposes on 1 January the following year.  </p>  <p>  The revaluation of a rating authority area is commenced by the making of a Valuation Order by the Commissioner of Valuation which among other things specifies the publication date of the new valuation list. It is for the Commissioner to set the publication date which would take account of factors such as the number of items to be valued. The Act states that the publication date shall not be more than three years after the date the valuation order is made. In practice the gap between the date the valuation order was signed and the publication date is between 24 and 33 months. Prior to 2011 the gap was between 26 and 33 months. Since 2011 the gap between the order date and the publication date has been between 24 and 33 months. As can be seen from the figures below nearly 2/3 of the properties revalued have been completed on valuation orders signed in 2011 or later with 1/3 of properties revalued on valuation orders signed between 2005 and 2011. </p>  <p>  To-date, revaluations of all local authorities in Dublin, Waterford and Limerick have been completed comprising approximately 49,500 properties, representing approx. 57% of the national rateable valuation base in monetary value terms or 33% in numerical terms. In addition, 13 public utilities representing some of the largest ratepayers in the State have been valued on a national basis. </p>  <p>  Since 2011, as part of the national revaluation programme the Valuation Office has issued in excess of 32,000 proposed valuation certificates and 31,482 final valuation certificates, all within the required timelines. The latter are broken down as follows:</p>  <p>  Dublin City 20,845</p>  <p>  Waterford City &amp;amp; County 3,917</p>  <p>  Limerick City &amp;amp; County 6,720</p>  <p>  Valuations of commercial properties at revision are determined under Part 6 of the Valuation Act 2001, by reference to the net annual values of comparable properties on the same valuation list. The Act provides for applications for revision to be made to the Commissioner by an occupier, a rating authority, an interest holder in a rateable property or the occupier of another rateable property in that same rating authority area. On receipt of a revision application the Commissioner appoints a revision officer to deal with the application and the Act requires that officer to deal with that application within 6 months of his/her appointment. </p>  <p>  Revision applications are received on an ongoing basis throughout the year and, in so far as reasonably practicable, the statutory timelines provided for in the Valuation Act 2001 are adhered to. While there are always some arrears of revision casework, these are not significant. The vast majority of applications are lodged by local authorities with whom the Valuation Office maintains close liaison, to ensure that revision applications are dealt with as expeditiously as possible and to agreed timelines having regard to the local authority budgetary year. Revision applications relating to new properties and those received from the public are disposed of expeditiously; the Valuation Office aims to deal with the majority of ratepayer revision applications within 3 months of receipt of the application. </p>  <p>  During 2014, 3,467 revision applications were received, 4,204 revision applications were dealt with which resulted in 1,804 new records being created and 6,024 valuation certificates being issued in total. </p></reply>

I understand that officials in that Department have worked with a broad range of stakeholders to ensure the industry was aware of, and prepared for, the implementation of the Construction Products Regulation in Ireland. I also understand that a significant number of steel fabricators operating in the State have already established the systems necessary to comply with their obligations under the Construction Products Regulation and, more specifically, the requirements of I.S. EN 1090-1. D/ECLG remains committed to working with all stakeholders in order to continue to raise awareness and facilitate the implementation of the Construction Products Regulation in Ireland.    With regard to your specific question concerning the role of the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in providing training support for companies affected by the Construction Products Regulation, the role of the LEOs is to provide information to small and micro firms and to signpost them to relevant agencies / bodies for training and certification.</p>  <p>  The provision of the specialist technical training required to achieve certification to an International or European Standard, such as that required by steel fabricators in this instance, is outside of the remit of the LEO services. However, I understand that to date the LEOs, in conjunction with the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) have provided four general awareness / information seminars on the topic at various venues around the country. In view of the NSAI&rsquo;s final certification role, and given the roles and responsibilities of other Departments and agencies, my Department has discussed the requirements of the CPR with the relevant Departments and agencies i.e. Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Department of Education and Skills, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) network and the NSAI. </p>  <p>  I also understand that the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) in Cork, Dundalk, Galway, Shannon, Tralee and Waterford provide metal fabrication apprenticeship training, which incorporates elements of certification training. The ETBs come under the remit of the Department of Education and Skills. It may be beneficial for companies to explore what economies of scale might be achieved for companies seeking the same upskilling in the same area.</p></reply>

Records available to the Department confirm that the person named applied for a Nitrates Derogation in 2011 and 2012, which would have allowed him to farm up to 250 kgs of Nitrogen per hectare per year, subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the Derogation, which include the submission of a Fertiliser Plan, a critical element of the derogation process.  The Derogation applications for 2011 and 2012 were rejected as no Fertiliser Plan was submitted for either year. This resulted in non-compliances with the maximum limits of Nitrogen kgs per hectare requirements of the Nitrates Regulations being determined in each of these years.

The person named did not apply for a Nitrates Derogation in 2013.</p>  <p>  As similar breaches under the Nitrates Regulations had been identified within the previous three years, as detailed above, the regulatory provisions require that rules on repetition must be applied and this resulted in a 100% penalty being applied against the 2013 Direct Payment Schemes. </p>  <p>  The person named was notified of this decision on 14 October 2014, and of his right of appeal to the Agriculture Appeals Office.

These events show that all States must remain vigilant and attentive to the risks posed by international terrorism. <br/><br/>Ireland, like any other democratic country with similar values, is not immune to a threat from international terrorism.  While an attack on Ireland is possible it is not assessed as likely and there is no specific information in relation to a threat to Ireland.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are keeping the level of threat from international terrorism under continuous review in light of ongoing developments and continuing to take all appropriate measures to counteract this threat.  In this they have the full support of the Government.<br/><br/>The radicalising affect of online propaganda must also be dealt with and this is a matter which has received direct attention from EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers at our recent meetings.  Indeed, this has been a focus of actions at EU level for a number of years now, particularly in the context of the EU's Strategy for combating radicalisation and recruitment to terrorism and the EU's Internal security strategy.  The Deputy will wish to know that the recent informal meeting of EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers focused on the international terrorism and foreign fighters issues.  Ireland along with its European counterparts is seeking to work with all relevant stakeholders to develop further initiatives in this domain.<br/><br/>The Government is committed to ensuring that the necessary legislation is in place to address terrorist threats.  The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014 has already passed all stages in the Seanad.  It is expected that the Bill will come before the D&aacute;il shortly.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>The Bill, when enacted, will create the three new offences of, public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism.  These offences will carry sentences of up to 10 years imprisonment on conviction on indictment.<br/><br/>As the Deputy will appreciate, any response to this issue must be proportionate to the level of the threat and multi-faceted in approach.  In addition to conventional security measures, engagement with minority or at risk communities is an essential element of the response.  In that context, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operates a progressive programme of community engagement with minority communities.  The aim of these programmes is to build a sense of inclusiveness amongst minority communities and to address feelings of marginalisation in order to avoid providing  fertile ground for radicalisation and those seeking to radicalise others. </p></reply>

The CSO has previously indicated that it is carrying out a detailed analysis of certain issues raised by the Garda Inspectorate in relation to the recording, classification and reclassification of crime, to see whether and to what extent they may have implications for the crime statistics which that Office produces<i>.</i>This process is currently ongoing and the CSO has indicated that it has resulted in a delay in publishing the Quarter 3 statistics for 2014.  The figures published up to Quarter 2 in 2014 indicate a reduction in the overall number of offences recorded in the 12 months to that date.<br/><br/>Insofar as burglary offences are concerned, and as I indicated in my remarks as referred to by the Deputy, I am very conscious of the concerns which relate to these crimes and working closely with the Garda Commissioner and other relevant criminal justice agencies to ensure that an effective, whole of system response is in place.  I understand that the general trend is that, having fallen in 2013, there has been an increase in such offences during 2014.<br/><br/>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are pursuing a range of strategies to tackle this, including the establishment of Burglary Response Units and through operations such as Operation Fiacla and Operation Acer, which are focusing on identifying and targeting the criminal groups who have played a large part in the recent increase.  In addition to these policing responses, I am also carrying out a broader and urgent review of the criminal justice system's response to the problem of burglaries. This includes a focus on interagency measures in relation to the management of prolific offenders, visible policing, crime prevention support for communities, and an examination of legislative issues. Burglary is a persistent and highly damaging crime, and I am determined to tackle it on a number of fronts, and through a partnership approach between criminal justice agencies and the community.  <br/><br/>In relation to the closure of Garda stations, the Deputy will be aware that the decisions made in 2013 in this regard were the result of a comprehensive operational assessment carried out by the Garda Commissioner, the objective of which was to ensure that Garda resources are used in the best and most efficient way possible.  In particular, freeing up Garda&iacute; from desk duties has increased the number of Garda&iacute; available for frontline policing and confronting crime.  While the deployment of resources is kept under review at all times by the Garda Commissioner, none of the advice to me suggests that the closure of Garda stations is a significant factor in the recent increase in burglary, or that its reopening would contribute materially to a solution.  Tackling highly mobile gangs involved in burglary will not be helped by reopening Garda stations, as to do so would take Garda&iacute; away from visible front line policing and crime prevention.</p></reply>

As well as introducing an option for persons to pay fines by instalment, there are also changes in the way those who fail to pay fines are dealt with, with a range of options available to judges including recovery orders, attachment of earnings, community service and ultimately imprisonment.  <br/><br/>Work is ongoing in preparing for the implementation of the Act.  The area most directly affected by the changes is the Courts and the Courts Service is working on a number of developments which will ensure that the implementation of the legislation, and the new procedures which will operate under it, are as efficient as possible.  <br/><br/>In relation to the introduction of payment of fines by instalment, a decision was taken to outsource all aspects of the recovery of fines to an external provider.  The Courts Service is introducing new arrangements for the payment of fines which will allow payments to be made in a range of outlets across the country, and not just through Courts Service offices.  There are significant changes in information technology required to ensure that the instalment payment system operates effectively and that the necessary accounting procedures are in place for the recording of payments. Changes are also required in the way that information is transferred between the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that both organisations have fully up to date information on the cases and their current status.  <br/><br/>It is expected that all the preparations for the new system will be completed by the third quarter of 2015.  While it is desirable that the Act be commenced as soon as possible, it is important that these preparations are done correctly to ensure that the significant changes being implemented in the fines system as a result of this legislation are implemented smoothly and effectively from the start.  <br/><br/>In the case of 2014, these figures are provisional pending the publication of the Irish Prison Service Annual Report 2014.  <table><tr><th>County</th><th>Number of Persons in 2012</th><th>Number of Persons in 2013</th><th>Number of Persons in 2014 (up to and including the 16/04/2014)</th></tr><tr><td>Antrim</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Armagh</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>78</td><td>65</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>76</td><td>89</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>268</td><td>315</td><td>124</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>1,215</td><td>1,324</td><td>425</td></tr><tr><td>Derry</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>129</td><td>83</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>Down</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>1,886</td><td>1,556</td><td>499</td></tr><tr><td>Fermanagh</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>187</td><td>342</td><td>167</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>240</td><td>238</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>304</td><td>203</td><td>84</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>132</td><td>193</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>155</td><td>131</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>17</td><td>22</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>673</td><td>783</td><td>190</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>43</td><td>78</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>137</td><td>172</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>95</td><td>83</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>165</td><td>118</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>60</td><td>51</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>No Fixed Abode</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>123</td><td>213</td><td>84</td></tr><tr><td>Outside Country</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>66</td><td>55</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>91</td><td>63</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>348</td><td>319</td><td>106</td></tr><tr><td>Tyrone</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>291</td><td>253</td><td>95</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>166</td><td>133</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>239</td><td>261</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>270</td><td>207</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>7,476</td><td>7,365</td><td>2,491</td></tr></table></p></reply>

One of the main statutory functions of the PSRA is the licensing of Property Service Providers, i.e. auctioneers, letting agents and property management agents. The Authority is independent in the performance of its functions.</p>  <p>  The 2011 Act provides for the licensing of all persons engaged in the provision of property services. Applicants for a Property Service Provider's licence must meet certain "minimum qualification requirements" which are set out in paragraphs 2(a), (b), (c), and (d) of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011, (Qualifications) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 181 of 2012), before a licence can be granted, namely minimum academic qualification, lawful experience or other qualifications or experience. The appropriate experience requirement means that a person must be able to demonstrate to the Authority that they have been lawfully engaged in, and for periods amounting together to not less than 3 years of the 5 year period immediately preceding the making of the application, the provision of the property service for which they are seeking a licence. </p>  <p>  I should point out that I am advised by the Authority that employees with extensive relevant experience are not being excluded from qualifying for a licence based on this experience alone. Rather, it is the case that where a person fails to quality under paragraphs 2(a) to 2(c) of S.I. 181 of 2012 referred to above, i.e. under the minimum academic qualifications and lawful experience criteria, the Authority always exercises the discretion available to it under paragraph 2(d) relating to other qualifications and experience, and any person who can demonstrate that they have appropriate other qualifications or experience relevant to the licence being sought, may be granted a licence.</p></reply>

This is clear from the census and from our citizenship ceremonies.  </p>  <p>  At EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments "to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons".  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases.  It is open to persons in an undocumented situation to present their case on its merits, to have it considered and to abide by the decision.    </p>  <p>  I note the report to which the Deputy is referring.  I think however that it is important to recognise that in most cases a person becomes undocumented through their own actions by making the choice to remain in Ireland without immigration permission as opposed to the alternative of leaving the State, as they are supposed to do. The Department has operated a scheme to address the situation of that minority who became undocumented through no fault of their own.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to introduce a general regularisation scheme for those who are currently undocumented in the State, although I am aware of calls for something on these lines.   A proposal of this nature could give rise to very large, unpredictable and potentially very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services.  Any possible implication for the operation of the Common Travel Area would also have to be very carefully considered.</p></reply>

The Deputy may be aware that the CSO is carrying out a detailed analysis of certain issues raised by the Garda Inspectorate in relation to the recording, classification and reclassification of crime, to see whether and to what extent they may have implications for the crime statistics which that Office produces<i>.</i>This process is currently ongoing and the CSO has indicated that it has resulted in a delay in the next quarterly crime statistics publication, which will relate to Quarter 3 of 2014. <br/><br/>Insofar as policing in the areas in question are concerned, as the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the Garda Regions, Divisions, and Districts. Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.<br/><br/>I have sought to secure as high a level of resources for the Garda authorities as possible and am fully committed to supporting them in providing a strong and visible community presence across the country.  I am pleased that the increase of &euro;40 million in the Budget for Garda pay in 2015 has provided the scope for me to continue with my priority objective of recruiting new Garda&iacute;. The Deputy will be aware that the first intake of Garda Trainees since 2009 to the Garda College took place in 2014.  In September 100 recruits commenced training and a further 100 in December.  A third intake this month saw another 100 recruits begin their training in the Garda College.  I will, of course, continue to monitor Garda staffing levels this year with a view to agreeing further intakes to the Garda College as required.<br/><br/>While the  allocation of Garda&iacute; on completion of training is a matter for the Garda Commissioner, and will be fully considered in the context of therequirements of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na nationally, for the first time in some years the Garda Commissioner will have the option to deploy new recruits to replace persons retiring and to respond to emerging policing needs.</p></reply>

This information is available on the Irish Prison Service website <i>www.irishprisons.ie.</i><br/><br/>According to the snapshot of the prison population taken on 31 January, 2015 there were 3,706 prisoners in custody.  Of this 201 were aged 18-20 and 533 were aged 21-24.  A breakdown of their location is set out in table 1.<br/><br/>Information on prisoners on restricted regimes is included in the Irish Prison Service quarterly statistics report on the prison population.  Restricted regime is define by the Irish Prison Service as those prisoners whose daily out of cell time is restricted to less than 5 hours i.e. they are locked up for more than 19 hours per day. <br/><br/>I can advise that on the 14th of January 2015 there were 3,661 prisoners in custody.  Of this there were 300 prisoners had there regime/out of cell time restricted.  A detailed breakdown by institution and restriction is set out in Table 2.<br/><br/>I can advise the Deputy that of the 300 on restricted regime 23 were aged 18- 20 and 64 were aged 21-24.  A breakdown of these groups are set out in Table 3 and Table 4.<br/><br/>The restriction of a prisoner's regime can occur due to a number of factors including, the protection of vulnerable prisoners.  This is provided for under Rule 63 of the Prison Rules 2007.  A prisoner may, either at his/her own request or when the Governor considers it necessary, in so far as is practicable and subject to the maintenance and good order and safe and secure custody, be kept separate from other prisoners who are reasonably likely to cause significant harm to him/her.<br/><br/>In July 2013, the Director General of the Irish Prison Service established a high level group to look at measures which can be introduced to reduce the number of prisoners currently held on restricted regimes with a view to ensuring that all receive, as a minimum standard, out of cell time of 3 hours per day, to engage in exercise or activity.<br/><br/><b>Table 1.

Prison education includes a core element of basic education incorporating reading, writing, numeracy and IT literacy. The aim of the Education Service is to deliver a high quality, broad, flexible programme of education that helps prisoners cope with their sentence, achieve personal development, prepare for life after release and establish an appetite and capacity for life-long learning. Programmes are adapted to take account of the diversity of the prisoner population and the complex nature of prison life, including segregation requirements and high levels of prisoner turnover.</p>  <p>  Educational services are available at all institutions and are provided in partnership with the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) and a range of other educational agencies.The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of whole-time teacher equivalents to the prisons through the ETBs (220 in the academic year 2014/15).  Organisations who provide in-reach education roles include Open University, the Samaritans, the Red Cross, Grow, Toe by Toe, Writers and Artists in prison etc. Other courses run through the education centres include pre-release programmes, parenting, hairdressing, Alternatives to Violence etc.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that in November 2014, the latest month for which figures are available, 46.3% of the total prisoner population attended education classes during this time. January figures have not been collated yet and in December industrial action by teachers - combined with the holiday period - do not give an accurate representation of prisoner engagement. With regard to Wheatfield, on average 27% of the prisoner population engaged with education services on a daily basis in November 2014. A breakdown by age of those who attended is not available.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), and the Guild of Launders and Cleaners and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled us to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification.</p>  <p>  Prisoners involved in work and training activities may do so with a view to gaining accreditation in a particular area or in order to keep busy during their sentence. Engagement in vocational training can have added benefits in the form of boosting self-confidence, imparting useful practical skills and improving social skills. On any given day, prisoners work in areas such as the laundry, kitchens, horticultural or gardening, industrial cleaning, waste management and picture framing shops where the labour they provide can be of benefit to the effective running of the prison and for which they may or may not receive accreditation.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that in November 2014, the latest month for which figures are available for prisoner participation in work and training (accredited and non-accredited), 27.83% of the total prisoner population attended workshop sessions. During this time the workshops were open for approximately 82% average of scheduled opening hours. With regard to Wheatfield In November 27.60% of the prisoner population attended workshop sessions with an average attendance per session of 133.46 prisoners. A breakdown by age of those who attended is not available.</p>  <p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the new Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015.  There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning including Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.</p></reply>

Incentivised Regimes provides for a differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour.  The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to reinforce good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure environment.</p>  <p>  There are three levels of privilege - basic, standard and enhanced and each prison has developed an information booklet on how the scheme operates and specifically on the criteria and privileges associated with each level of regime.</p>  <p>  Prisoners on the enhanced regime level are significantly more likely to benefit from temporary release programmes such as Community Return &ndash; where prisoners are released early under Probation Supervision to partake of voluntary work for the benefit of the community &ndash; and/or transfer to an open centre.  These are significant motivational factors in encouraging prisoners to engage in authorised structured activities and improve general behaviour.  The hope is that these benefits are not just apparent in prisons and that the behavioural change effected will stay with the prisoner on his release.  Experience in other jurisdictions has shown that an incentivised regime structure is a hugely valuable addition to prisons in the context of good order and prisoner compliance.</p>  <p>  The standard set of core privileges provided in each prison comprises of different levels of daily gratuity ranging from &euro;0.95 to &euro;2.20, the number and length of visits a prisoner is allowed to receive and the number of telephone calls a prisoner is allowed to make.  Each prison has drawn up a list of privileges available under each regime level.  The list of available privileges is likely to vary between prisons and within different areas of a prison, depending on the operational and infrastructure requirements of each prison.  Examples of other incentives offered include improved accommodation (e.g. move from dormitory accommodation to a single room in an open centre).  In the past, access to facilities such as DVD players, games consoles have been provided.  Prisoners can also gain access to employment opportunities within the prison e.g. kitchens, laundries etc.</p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that on 24 February 2015, 18-20 year olds in custody were assigned to the following regime levels: Basic - 27; Standard - 148; and, Enhanced - 72.  On the same date, 21-24 year olds in custody were assigned to the following regime levels: Basic - 58; Standard - 353; and Enhanced - 255.</p></reply>

Library services in prisons are mainly provided by Local Authority library personnel deployed to prisons.  In some cases, libraries are managed by prison officers or prisoners, with professional librarian oversight.  While it is the case that a shortfall in staffing numbers on a particular day can impact negatively on service provision, the Irish Prison Service is actively pursuing the option of having all libraries in prisons managed by long-term, suitably trained prisoners, with professional oversight in order to maximise the service.  Prisoners have been trained up and are active in supporting library services in Arbour Hill, the Midlands Prison, Training Unit, Castlerea Prison, Limerick, Portlaoise, Mountjoy, Wheatfield and the D&oacute;chas Centre.  In Cork, Shelton Abbey and Loughan House, prisoners assist in the running of the libraries.</p></reply>

This includes a new Deputy Secretary post and this post was advertised by the Public Appointments Service in February 2015<br /><br />- the membership of the Department's Management Advisory Committee has now been extended to include the Director of the Probation Service and two Principal Officers (PO) who represent the wider PO group.  New formalised working procedures, including for meetings with the Minister, introduced following the Review, are supporting the overall governance of the Department<br /><br />- a Principal Officer Forum has been established, one of the aims of which is to engage POs in identifying how they can contribute to improving the coherence and efficiency of the Department's overall performance<br /><br />- following a successful meeting with Heads of Agencies in Farmleigh on 13 November, 2014, proposals for more structured engagement with agencies are  being implemented<br /><br />- formal Performance Agreements have been signed off with a number of agencies and this process is continuing<br /><br />- a new Strategy Statement for my Department covering the period 2015-2017 will be published shortly.  This is guided principally by the Review Group's recommendations - this Strategy will be the anchor on which the planning processes recommended in the Review will be grounded<br /><br />- an annual staff survey questionnaire has been developed and the first survey will be conducted shortly.  This will (a) baseline current attitudes and opinions (b) identify areas that require a focused approach to change with appropriate interventions and (c) enable measurement of the success of those interventions into the future<br /><br />- the comprehensive reform programme in respect of policing, which includes the establishment of an independent Policing Authority, is being implemented, overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform<br /><br />- far-reaching legislative reforms are being prioritised and developed across a whole range of public policy issues as part of the Government's legislative programme.</blockquote>While a permanent appointment to the post of Secretary General has yet to be made, Mr Noel Waters, Director General of INIS, continues as Acting Secretary General and he and the senior management team are working closely with me, the Department staff and all stakeholders to implement the recommendations of the Review.</p></reply>

However in general the legislature sets out the maximum sentence that can be imposed and it is then a matter for the judiciary to decide what is the appropriate sentence in a particular case taking into account all the circumstances.</p>  <p>  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Information on sentencing is also being developed by a steering committee established by the Courts Service Board and chaired by the Chief Justice.  This Committee, the Irish Sentencing Committee oversaw the development of a Sentencing Information website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  The website is being developed as a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers, those concerned with the needs of victims and their families and members of the public.  I am informed that this website is being re-launched shortly.</p>  <p>  The Law Reform Commission looked at the issue of mandatory sentences in detail in their report LRC 108- 2013.  They were in favour of retaining the mandatory sentence for murder.  However they were of the view that for other offences, mandatory sentencing regimes are too rigid and have not been shown to be effective in reducing offending.  They recommended that presumptive minimum  sentences should not be extended and that existing provisions should be repealed.</p>  <p>  The Strategic Review of Penal Policy report published in July 2014 made a number of recommendations about sentencing.  In particular they recommended that no further mandatory sentences or presumptive minimum sentences be introduced and existing provisions should be reviewed.</p>  <p>  I am looking at the question of sentencing legislation in the light of these two reports.</p></reply>

Approximately 67,000 children are availing of the provision in the current academic year.</p>  <p>  The free pre-school provision represents an annual investment of approximately &euro;175 million.  The standard capitation fee paid to participating childcare services is &euro;62.50 per week for each eligible child.  A higher capitation fee of &euro;73 per week is available to pre-school services with more highly qualified staff.</p>  <p>  After-school childcare support is provided under a number of childcare support programmes implemented by this Department.  Under the Childcare Education and Training Supports (CETS) programme, which supports parents on Solas and Education Training Board (ETB) training and education courses, &euro;45 per week is provided to eligible parents for after-school care with &euro;80 provided where a pick-up services is available.  The maximum to be charged to a parent for the after-school provision is &euro;15 per week.</p>  <p>  The After-school Childcare (ASCC) programme introduced to support low-income and unemployed persons to return to the workforce contributes &euro;40 per week.  The maximum charge to the parent is &euro;15 per week.  Where a pick-up service is available &euro;80 per week is provided.  This programme provides after-school care for primary school children for certain categories of working parents for a once-off period of 52 weeks.  The Department of Social Protection determines eligibility for the childcare places.  Pro-rata rate applies for parents who require support over a shorter weekly period.</p>  <p>  The Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme, which supports parents on Community Employment (CE) schemes, provides &euro;40 per week to support parents with after-school care.  The maximum charge to the parents is &euro;15 per week.</p>  <p>  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which provides support for sessional pre-school, full time, part time and after school places through community childcare facilities, is targeted at disadvantaged or low income families and eligibility for support is based on means-tested entitlements.  The funding provided depends on the category or Band that applies to the parent and the length of time of the after-school session.  A parent, for example, availing of after-school support for 1 hour and 15 minutes each day for 5 days and who is entitled to the highest category of payment, receives &euro;31.35.</p></reply>

I am not in a position to estimate what the cost would be but it seems likely that very substantial investment would be needed to provide an additional service to specific children.</p>  <p>  The introduction of a second pre-school year for all children would also require considerable additional funding which is not currently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is operating.  In addition, all of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the pre-school provision is key to good outcomes for children.  The Early Years Quality Agenda is being progressed by my Department.  This involves a range of actions in key areas aimed at improving quality within early years services and enhancing the regulatory regime.  These reforms are key building blocks for any further extension of universal childcare provision.</p>  <p>  I want to ensure a cohesive, whole-of Government approach current and future investment in child care services.  To ensure that all the benefits of childcare investments are fully realised, future public investment in childcare must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated.  With this in mind, I have established an Inter-Departmental Group to look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group which will include the provisions for children with special needs.  I have asked the Group report to me by the Summer.</p></reply>

The Bill, as introduced, makes provision for the preparation of an autism strategy and a national framework for addressing the specific needs of adults with autism.  The broad thrust of the Bill was accepted by Government and it was not opposed at Second Stage.  Although the needs of people with autism have received some recognition in recent years, the Bill is seen as contributing to a more enlightened and educated public debate.</p>  <p>  In the context of the Autism Bill, it is important to note that the Government is already committed under the National Disability Strategy (NDS) to ensuring that people with autism are empowered by policy and programmes to participate meaningfully as citizens in Irish society.  The NDS is driven by this basic but fundamentally important objective and is the most effective combination of legislation, policies, institutional arrangements and services to support and reinforce equal participation for all people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  The Cabinet Committee on Social Policy has been examining issues around autism across Government Departments in association with the National Disability Authority (NDA).  This work by the NDA, which has included consultation with families, will be of significant assistance in informing how best to address the needs of people with ASD, so that we can be sure that they are appropriately reflected and included in policies and actions.</p>  <p>  The National Disability Strategy Implementation Group has already discussed the findings of the NDA consultation and mapping of services to people with autism.  Further to the recommendations of this exercise, the NDA is now engaging bi-laterally with Departments and agencies to guide the development of actions under the umbrella of the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan.</p></reply>

There are several services at Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin that have a national remit, including outreach and shared care services with other hospitals, but which are not regarded as having an identity separate to that of the hospital.</p>  <p>  Crumlin has recently made a decision to discontinue the separate identification of the service as the National Centre for Medical Genetics. This was done in the interest of clarity on governance arrangements. As with all patient services, governance rests with the organisation that provides the service - if a patient attends Crumlin for genetic services, Crumlin is accountable and if the service is provided by another hospital, that hospital is accountable.</p>  <p>  A review of the governance structure for this service is included in the Terms of Reference for the Steering Group established to develop a plan for a National Network for Genetics and Genomic Medicine, as recommended in the 2014 report by Professors Dian Donnai and Bill Newman.  The Group will meet for the first time on 3 March and is expected to complete its work this year.</p></reply>

Zoning was appropriate for the proposed development and use.  The decision was unexpected since Dublin City Council (DCC) had issued a notification of its decision to grant planning permission. An Bord Plean&aacute;la's inspector also recommended a grant of planning permission, upholding the DCC decision.  The single reason given for the refusal by An Bord Plean&aacute;la was the loss of informal open space.  This decision will significantly delay the provision of a primary care centre for Finglas south and west.  This project has been approved for funding and the HSE will review the situation to determine what can be done.</p>  <p>However, as with all capital programmes, the primary care infrastructure programme which includes this project, must be considered within the overall capital envelope available to the health service.  There will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer.  There is limited funding available for new projects, over the next multi-annual period 2015-2019, given the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place.  Therefore the reason capital funding is not ring-fenced / committed by project is to ensure that the HSE has flexibility to manage within its voted capital allocation in the event that one or more of the hundreds of construction projects underway at any time do not progress as scheduled.  Indenting rather than ring-fencing enables the HSE, to leverage its capital allocation efficiently, so that it delivers the maximum number of priority projects for the funding available.  Nevertheless Finglas south and west remains a priority as it is one of the communities most in need of access to primary care services.    </p>  <p>  While the Mellowes Road site was purchased subject to planning, certain costs including professional fees will have been incurred.  The HSE has been asked to respond to your query in relation to the total amount spent to date on this project.   If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office who will follow up on the matter.</p></reply>

One of the principal recommendations in the Plan was the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases. This programme will be responsible for, among others:</p>  <p>  -	  Mapping, developing and implementing care pathways for rare diseases;</p>  <p>  -	  Facilitating timely access to centres of expertise - nationally and internationally;</p>  <p>  -	  Developing treatment guidelines for many rare disorders; and</p>  <p>  -	  Developing care pathways with European Reference Centres for those ultra-rare disorders where there may not be sufficient expertise in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In line with this recommendation, a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases has been established under the National Clinical Strategy and Programmes Division of the HSE. The programme is a joint initiative between the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and was established with a view to improve and standardise the quality of care for patients with rare diseases in Ireland by increasing detection and prevention, facilitating early timely diagnosis, intervention and coordination of care, and increasing awareness, information and support.</p>  <p>  This clinical programme will ultimately be a channel for advancing and implementing other recommendations in the plan, such as those on National Centres of Expertise for rare diseases. </p>  <p>  The establishment of a National Rare Disease Office featured prominently in the recommendations of the Rare Disease plan. The HSE is in the process of establishing such a national office. It will, among other functions, provide up-to-date information regarding new treatment and management options, including clinical trials. The HSE and the EU Commission plan to fund jointly a rare disease post of Information Scientist in the HSE with a number of recommendations in mind. These refer to rare disease registries and the utility of data currently captured in health information systems. The post will be located in the National Rare Disease Office.</p>  <p>  The Health Identifiers Bill - the publication of which was recommended in the plan - has now been enacted. A similar recommendation on the Health Information Bill is being advanced.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2014 was passed by the Seanad and completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il during 2014. The Bill completed Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on 17 February 2015 and Report and Final Stages are scheduled to take place today, 26 February.<br/><br/>I would remind the Deputy that tobacco consumption is today the greatest single cause of preventable illness and premature death in Ireland, killing over 5,200 people a year; that smokers die on average 10 years sooner than non-smokers; and that one in every two of smokers will die from a tobacco related disease. I am of the view that standardised packaging for tobacco products is a proportionate, evidence-based public health measure which will assist, together with the other many initiatives outlined in <i>Tobacco Free Ireland</i>, in reducing the overall prevalence of smoking in Ireland. </p></reply>

We discussed a broad range of issues including ongoing work on the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement, the justice and security situation in Northern Ireland, and a number of specific legacy cases.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Stormont House Agreement, we reviewed the good progress made at the first implementation and review meeting held in Belfast on 30 January last at which a detailed implementation timeline was agreed.  We looked forward to continuing to work together with the Northern Ireland Executive parties to ensure the effective and expeditious implementation of the Agreement.  A second review meeting will take place in March, again involving both Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive.  I re-iterated the Government&rsquo;s commitment to fully playing our part in this vital implementation phase.</p>  <p>  The Secretary of State updated me on her thinking in regard to how the impasse on the parades issue in North Belfast might be addressed. In discussing this issue, I continued to emphasise the importance of any initiative in this area enjoying the necessary cross-community support. We also discussed the recent disturbances at Maghaberry Prison, the need for the ending of all threats against prison officers and for the implementation of the constructive recommendations of the recent stocktake report.</p>  <p>  In relation to legacy issues, I again raised the issue of access by an independent international judicial figure to original documents in the possession of the British Government relating to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  The Secretary of State assured me that she continued to reflect on how the British Government could respond to this request.</p>  <p>  Regarding the case of the late Pat Finucane, I underlined the Government&rsquo;s continued support for the Finucane family&rsquo;s call on the British Government to establish an independent public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane, in line with the commitments made by both Governments at Weston Park in 2001.  The Secretary of State responded that the de Silva Report and Prime Minister Cameron&rsquo;s apology to the family constituted her Government&rsquo;s response to the case. </p></reply>

I am appalled, in particular, at the rising number of civilian casualties in recent weeks as a direct consequence of the indiscriminate shelling of residential areas in the conflict zone.</p>  <p>  The welfare of civilians caught up in the hostilities is a major concern and I fully support EU calls on all sides to respect International Humanitarian Law. It is vital that the protection of civilians and humanitarian workers is ensured and that unhindered humanitarian access is granted to populations in need, in line with humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. It is also essential that the OSCE Mission is permitted to freely undertake its important monitoring and verification work in all areas of the conflict region. </p>  <p>  The most effective way of ensuring the safety of the civilian population is to stop the violence. On 12 February, an agreement was reached in Minsk on a new peace deal aimed at ending the fighting. The declaration agreed in Minsk by Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande, President Putin and President Poroschenko and the package of measures signed by the parties to the conflict provides for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons in eastern Ukraine.  The package also contains a timetable for the implementation of key parts of the September Minsk Agreements, which provide the basis for a comprehensive resolution of the crisis.</p>  <p>  On 17 February, the UN Security Council unanimously called on all parties to immediately cease hostilities and abide by the commitments agreed in Minsk. EU High Representative Federica Mogherini has also issued a strong statement to this effect. I fully support the UN Security Council Resolution and the High Representative&rsquo;s call, which also underlined the need for the agreed withdrawal of heavy weapons. It is critical that all parties honour their commitments to end the fighting and fully support a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine.</p></reply>

These include the abduction of more than 200 young girls by Boko Haram from a school in the Nigerian town of Chibok in April 2014 and the appalling use of children as suicide-bombers, recently including a girl thought to be as young as seven. </p>  <p>  I have given my full support to the clear demands of the UN Secretary General and the EU High Representative that the girls abducted in Chibok be released and that those responsible be brought to justice.  I am deeply disappointed that hopes that the girls would be released as a part of ceasefire discussions last October were not realised.</p>  <p>  The EU as well as several individual EU Member States, the UN and the USA, continue to assist the Nigerian authorities in strengthening their ability to provide security and to combat terrorism.  On 13 February, the UN Security Council condemned in the strongest terms the continued escalation of attacks perpetrated by Boko Haram  and reiterated its determination to combat all forms of terrorism.  The EU Foreign Affairs Council, which I attended in Brussels on 9 February, noted that the responsibility to address the immediate security challenge in the region lies primarily with the countries most affected, and called upon them to urgently intensify cooperation and coordination.  We welcomed the decision of the States in the region, endorsed by the African Union, to deploy a multinational force to combat Boko Haram, and this is now being established.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been a particularly strong advocate of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 which calls for increased participation of women in peace-making and peace-building; for greater protection for women and girls in armed conflict; and for a gender perspective to be incorporated into peace-keeping and peace-building.  We will continue to encourage all UN member states, including Nigeria, to fully implement this resolution so that women and girls may be better protected from the horrific effects of armed conflicts such as the Boko Haram insurgency.</p>  <p>  On 14 January, I launched Ireland&rsquo;s second National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security (2015-2018) which renewed our commitment to tackling the dreadful impact of conflict on women and girls.  The action plan is designed to ensure that a gender perspective is incorporated into Ireland&rsquo;s engagement in overseas humanitarian and development aid, peace-keeping, governance, post-conflict activities and interventions, and to bolster Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing work on protection from and prevention of gender-based violence.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Abuja, working locally in cooperation with the EU, UN and other key partners, remains in close contact with the Nigerian authorities on all issues related to the Boko Haram insurgency, including the appalling abduction of the schoolgirls.</p></reply>

Continuing violence and threats have forced almost two million people to flee their homes.  The country&rsquo;s warring parties signed another ceasefire agreement in February following regional talks led by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), which were supported by the African Union and the European Union.  However, the current peace remains very fragile and the humanitarian situation is extremely serious.  Reports that 89 young boys were abducted over the weekend in Upper Nile State, for use as child soldiers, are particularly worrying.</p>  <p>  The European Union, through its Special Representative for the Horn of Africa and together with the international community, including Ireland, actively engages in trying to prevent the crisis escalating into a full-scale ethnic-based civil war.  In particular, the EU supports repeated warnings from IGAD and the African Union that continued violations of the ceasefire or failure to finalise a political agreement will inevitably result in further sanctions by the international community.</p>  <p>  The EU, including individual Member States, provided more than &euro;267 million in humanitarian assistance to South Sudan in 2014. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs recently co-hosted a high-level conference on South Sudan at which donors pledged some $600 million in assistance.  Since the outbreak of the conflict at the end of 2013, Ireland has provided almost &euro;11 million for South Sudan, through UN partners and NGOs working to alleviate the suffering of the people of the country and refugees across the region.  We have pledged a further &euro;3 million so far in 2015.  We will continue to monitor the political and humanitarian situation closely, through our Embassies in the region, and in cooperation with our EU partners and the United Nations.</p></reply>

Two of these, Mozambique and Sierra Leone, are key partner countries for Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme.The Government&rsquo;s approach to Africa is informed by the Africa Strategy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and <i>One World, One Future</i>, our policy for international development.Ireland pursues a strategic and comprehensive approach to countries in Africa which are facing challenging humanitarian, conflict, or human rights situations.  This approach encompasses political and diplomatic engagement, development cooperation programming, which prioritises the fight against hunger and under-nutrition, humanitarian assistance, and support for peacekeeping operations.  In an effort to support the continent to confront these far-reaching challenges, we allocate approximately 80% of Ireland&rsquo;s development assistance to sub-Saharan Africa. <br/><br/>Ireland is committed to supporting the recovery efforts and successful transition of countries emerging from conflict or significant and protracted humanitarian crises.  The announcement last year that Sierra Leone would become one of Irish Aid&rsquo;s key partner countries is testament to this commitment.<br/><br/>I participate regularly in the deliberations of the EU Foreign Affairs Council on Africa, including, most recently, on developments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Mali and the Central African Republic.  Next month, the Council is scheduled to have a discussion of the EU&rsquo;s strategic relationship with Africa.<br/><br/>Ireland has deployed, and will continue to deploy, personnel to civilian and military EU and UN missions in Africa.

At present, there are 8 members on mission in sub-Saharan Africa.<br/><br/>Human rights concerns remain central to our foreign policy.

These efforts are finally beginning to show progress as transmission rates decline.</p>  <p>  The EU and its Member States have so far committed over &euro;1.2 billion to the Ebola response.  In 2014, Ireland provided over &euro;18 million, directly and through NGOs, to the most affected countries.  This included some &euro;10 million through our annual development programmes in our partner countries - Sierra Leone and Liberia &ndash; which have a particular focus on strengthening the national health systems.  We have provided over &euro;5.6 million specifically for Ebola treatment facilities and for work on contact-tracing, community mobilisation and child nutrition programmes, among other activities.  We will maintain this strong focus in 2015.</p>  <p>  Exposure of health-care workers continues to be a feature of the outbreak, with some 830 health personnel known to have developed Ebola and 488 reported deaths.  High-quality local treatment and medical evacuation facilities are now in place and available to all EU medical staff.</p>  <p>  The wider implications of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa are also serious.  A secondary crisis is emerging due to the impact on food security, nutrition, employment and economic growth as normal agricultural and market activities have been disrupted.  I will be attending a high-level international conference on Ebola in Brussels on 3 March, which will focus both on short-term needs and on longer-term recovery and development.  Attendance will also include the EU High Representative as well as the Presidents of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-26a.586.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015022600070#WRV00400"><p>The promotion and protection of human rights is a central objective of our foreign policy. Together with our EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world. We do this on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official channels and non-governmental/civil society organisations. Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.  We do this bilaterally, through the EU or via the positions we take at the UN General Assembly and in the UN Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015.  We support the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses.  This includes support for the role of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, the Special Procedure Mandate Holders and for the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council. The EU regularly makes statements at these bodies on the human rights situations in individual countries and Ireland is fully associated with these statements. The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.   Since March 2006, when the UN Human Rights Council was formed, Ireland has engaged proactively with the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism initiated by the Council. The UPR mechanism allows for the review of the domestic human rights records of all 193 UN Member States approximately every four and a half years, based on human rights obligations under UN human rights and other instruments. Any UN Member State can take part in the interactive dialogue (i.e. the actual examination of the State under review) and submit written questions in advance. Ireland was itself examined under the UPR process on 6 October 2011. The process enables UN Member States to raise issues, some of which would have been identified by members of the public and civil society, and to make recommendations about the protection and promotion of human rights in the State concerned.  Ireland has engaged fully with the UPR process and welcomes the open and constructive dialogue associated with it. We have also made numerous interventions during the UPR examination of other states, raising issues of concern such as gender-based violence, freedom of expression, religious freedom, freedom of assembly and the protection of human rights defenders within the State under review.</p>  <p>  The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law.  In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.  In June 2012 the EU adopted a Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy.</p>  <p>  Ireland and its EU partners have been strong and consistent supporters of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. The Court&rsquo;s Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of country situations and we will continue to monitor this work closely.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also consistently taken the lead in negotiating resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly and in the Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015, on the promotion and protection of human rights defenders, as well as on the implementation of EU Guidelines in relation to human rights defenders in third countries, the aim being to ensure that the latter can operate in an environment free from hindrance and insecurity.</p>  <p>  The promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms has always been a cornerstone of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme. Ireland&rsquo;s new policy on international development, &lsquo;One World One Future&rsquo;, reaffirms the centrality of human rights to Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and aid programme, and commits to ensuring that human rights principles and standards are promoted, protected and integrated in all of our development efforts. The Government&rsquo;s development cooperation programme, Irish Aid, addresses the root causes of poverty and exclusion by focussing on the most vulnerable and promoting their participation, representation, and the means to realise their rights, including through investing in the improvement and expansion of essential services, and support to organisations that promote human rights, governance, and democracy in developing countries, including civil society and the UN office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.  Mindful that the risk of human rights violations is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak, Irish Aid promotes access to justice and supports the strengthening of government institutions, parliaments, and independent media, and national human rights institutions.    </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to avail of all the above-mentioned mechanisms and instruments with a view to highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.</p></reply>

Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., we continue to work closely with our high level Government contacts and with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond towards achieving some relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the United States and improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America. When I travel to New York next month, I will meet and exchange views with a range of groups and organisations supporting the undocumented Irish and immigration reform. In addition, Taoiseach Enda Kenny T.D. will travel to Washington for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and will meet with President Obama, Vice President Biden and other senior US Administration figures as well as with key Congressional contacts.    These meetings will provide an important opportunity to reiterate our concerns in regard to the position of the undocumented Irish, to seek further information on the detail of President Obama&rsquo;s executive action and to encourage progress on a comprehensive legislative package by Congress.</p>  <p>  While the executive measures announced by President Obama clearly represent real progress, I&rsquo;m well aware that some will not benefit from these new arrangements and the Deputy will also be aware that there are currently legal challenges underway. </p>  <p>During his visit to Washington from   20-21 January, the Minister for the Diaspora, Jimmy Deenihan T.D., had a number of meetings with key Republican members of the House.  It provided an opportunity to assess the intentions of the Republican majority in terms of dealing with immigration this year and for the Minister to convey the Government&rsquo;s ongoing determination to achieve some relief for the undocumented and improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.</p>  <p>  Our Ambassador and her team in Washington are continuing their ongoing engagement with the US administration on this priority issue for the Government. We also keep in close contact with the US Ambassador to Ireland and his team at the US Embassy.</p></reply>

More than 200,000 people have lost their lives, and there are now over 12.2 million people in Syria in need of immediate life-saving support. Due to the violence and the lack of access to aid, 3.8 million people have left Syria for assistance in neighbouring countries. Ireland is one of the most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis and has already provided over &euro;30 million in humanitarian support to Syria since 2011. Our support is delivered through UN partners and NGOs.  It has been focused both on people displaced within Syria and those across the wider region.   One of the most difficult features of this crisis is that many of those who are most in need are beyond the reach of humanitarian aid, or are able to receive it only sporadically.  Both the Syrian Government and rebel factions are using siege tactics and heavy weaponry in populated areas. The operating environment is extremely volatile and insecure, particularly in opposition-controlled areas. The targeting of humanitarian workers by the group Islamic State (ISIS) means that millions living in the areas which ISIS currently controls do not receive the help they so desperately need. Ireland has consistently advocated for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access, as well as for respect by all parties of International Humanitarian Law.</p>  <p>  Ireland welcomed the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2165 in July 2014, which authorised the delivery of humanitarian aid by the UN and its partners across the border into Syria, even without the consent of the Assad regime. Ireland has been working through a variety of channels, including our established UN partners, NGO partners and the Red Cross/Red Crescent in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan to ensure that Irish aid can be delivered across borders and conflict lines to those in most acute need.</p>  <p>  A donor Pledging Conference will take place in Kuwait at the end of March, which will be an opportunity for donors to set out how we will assist Syrians this year. Ireland will pledge significant further assistance for 2015.</p></reply>

In circumstances where children with special educational needs require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available. <br/><br/>  Special schools are classified as primary schools and are intended to cater for children with special educational needs until they reach the age of 18.  The Health Service Executive then assumes direct responsibility for young adults with special needs who are over 18. <br/><br/>  Where special schools apply to my Department to retain pupils who, prior to reaching age 18, had embarked on courses leading to accreditation at FETAC Level 3 or above, and who require an extra year to complete such a course, my Department will provide sanction for this.<br/><br/>  My Department may also provide sanction to special schools, subject to application, to retain a pupil for an additional year to facilitate the transition of a pupil to adult services. <br/><br/>  Students who transfer to adult service settings can continue to participate in educational programmes through further adult educational programmes or in adult settings which are allocated resources towards educational provision.<br/><br/>  Students can continue to participate in educational programmes through further adult educational programmes or in adult settings. <br/><br/>  While the Department of Health and Children/Health Service Executive assumes direct responsibility for young adults with special educational needs who are over 18 years, my Department may allocate funding towards an educational component of such provision. <br/><br/>  This is generally transacted through the co-operation hours scheme operated by Education and Training Boards (ETBs) where the local service provider makes application to the relevant ETB for tuition hours. Funding is also provided to the National Learning Network for this purpose. <br/><br/>  Young adults with disabilities are eligible to access SOLAS mainstream services. SOLAS also contracts Specialist Training Providers, in locations country-wide, to deliver training courses to people with disabilities who require more intensive support than would be available in non-specialist training provision.  Specialist training offers additional supports to learners which include individualised training and progression plans, literacy and numeracy support, longer training duration, adapted equipment, transport arrangements, enhanced programme content and enhanced trainer/learner ratio.<br/><br/>  The Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) scheme also provides a third level admissions scheme for school leavers who have a disability or specific learning difficulty.  Students who are considered to be DARE eligible may secure a college place on a reduced points basis. The Deputy may be aware that the NCSE is currently preparing policy advice on the education of children with autism.  Their report will identify the nature and extent of educational intervention/s, teaching practices and other supports which should be provided to enable children with autism to achieve educational outcomes appropriate to their needs and abilities and will inform future policy development.</p></reply>

The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme now receive capitation grant assistance to provide for secretarial (and/or caretaking) services.  Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs and the Department does not stipulate how secretarial services are to be obtained.  Where a school uses the grant funding to employ a secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools.  My Department therefore does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged.  These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities. <br/><br/>  Notwithstanding the above, a forum was established under the Towards 2016 Agreement involving my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, IMPACT and SIPTU to examine the factual position in schools regarding the terms and conditions of employment of secretaries (and caretakers) employed using grant funding.  However, it was not possible to progress the forum's agenda beyond the initial fact finding survey, due to the State's budgetary and financial position.  It was agreed that the forum would consider appropriate measures in relation to the rates of pay of school secretaries and caretakers in the event that a review of the Public Service Agreements recommended changes to the benefit of those public servants earning &euro;35,000 or less per annum.  This is currently the priority for the Forum and discussions are ongoing. <br/><br/>  Secretaries employed by schools using grant funding are not regarded as public servants except for the purposes of the pay reduction under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No.2) Act 2009, due to the definition of &quot;public servant&quot; used in that Act.  The fact that such staff come within the definition of &quot;public servant&quot; solely for the purposes of the Act does not alter their employment status in any other respect.</p></reply>

This was an opportunity for me to discuss the concerns that they have regarding the provision of resource teaching support for children with Down's syndrome.

To this end an ambitious target has been set for the scheme for 2015, with 8,400 households to have their housing needs met though HAP by the end of the year.  &euro;23.2 m has been made available for the scheme in 2015.<br/><br/>The delivery of the HAP Programme is being overseen by an Oversight Group co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Social Protection, which includes senior management from local authorities.  A detailed business process design exercise for HAP was undertaken in 2013, which included a preliminary examination of the organisational structure required, including change management issues that may arise. <br/><br/>The statutory pilot phase of HAP commenced in September 2014 and is now in effect in the following 7 local authority areas: Cork, Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan County Councils, Waterford City and County Council , and Limerick City and County Council.  Significant numbers of households are moving on to the scheme on a weekly basis and this rate of transfer continues to increase each week.  Over 900 households are in receipt of HAP at present across these 7 local authority areas.  Dublin City Council is also part of the statutory HAP pilot with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households, as provided for in the Action Plan to Address Homelessness. Dublin City Council is implementing the HAP pilot for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all 4 Dublin local authorities.<br/><br/>In order to provide efficiencies and to test processes in the statutory pilot phase of the scheme, Limerick City and County Council is providing a transactional shared service to the participating local authorities.  Generally, existing staff resources and financial management systems are being utilised to implement HAP in these local authorities. Training on the implementation of the scheme has been provided to the local authorities involved by Limerick City and County Council. <br/><br/>To date, the Department has recouped &euro;17,500 to Limerick City and County Council in respect of costs incurred in the utilisation of and amendments to a Customer Relationship Management system, which is used to store landlord and tenant information and manage the implementation of HAP. <br/><br/>To take account of the increasing workload being undertaken by Limerick City and County Council in providing the transactional services to the relevant local authorities, my Department has provided sanction to the Council for the public recruitment of 15 additional temporary staff at Clerical Officer level.  This recruitment is taking place on a phased basis as the number of HAP recipients increase.  Sanction has also been provided for two Acting Grade V (Staff Officer &ndash; Team Leader) posts for an initial 12 month period.  Resource requirements for the other local authorities involved in the statutory pilot phase of the scheme are being kept under on-going review by my Department , and by the Oversight Group,in the context of the continued roll-out of the programme.</p></reply>

This bridging funding in 2014/2015 will enable organisations to plan for their future, whether with or without State support, such as that provided under the SSNO. The organisation in question was allocated &euro;58,028 for the twelve month period to 30 June 2015.   </p>  <p>  The review process is underway and is being advanced in consultation with the Department of Health.

Applications for a new round of funding, which commenced on 1 July 2014, were subject to an appraisal process. 55 applications were approved for funding for the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016.  Pobal were asked to undertake the appraisal and management of the scheme and, in that context, put in place a dedicated team to deal with any inquiries from applicants and to provide detailed feedback. Furthermore, an appeals process was put in place, on foot of which Pobal submitted a report, which is currently being considered .   </p>  <p>  On 18 July 2014, it was announced that bridging funding of &euro;1.4million would be allocated for a twelve month period to a number of previously funded health, disability and other organisations that were not approved for funding under the new scheme, pending the carrying out of a review of the public funding of national organisations in the health and disability sector. This bridging funding in 2014/2015 will enable organisations to plan for their future, whether with or without State support, such as that provided under the SSNO. </p>  <p>  The review process is underway and is being advanced in consultation with the Department of Health. The Health Service Executive and Pobal are also participating in the review. All organisations in receipt of bridging funding have been contacted to make submissions as part of the review process. I intend to complete and publish the outcome of the review over the coming months. </p>  <p>32 organisations are currently in receipt of bridging funding. 19 of these organisations have submitted an appeal of the original decision in relation to their funding applications.   </p></reply>

The CAFE Directive was transposed into Irish legislation by the Air Quality Standards Regulations 201. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the competent authority for the Regulations and the CAFE Directive. These regulations require that Member States reduce exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>depending on baseline levels in ambient air, and not entailing disproportionate costs. For Ireland the national exposure reduction target (NERT) is 10%, assessed by the EPA using baseline data for the years 2009-11. The required reduction in PM<sub>2.5</sub>exposure was calculated based on air quality monitoring carried out by the EPA from 2009 - 2011.  There are multiple sources of fine particulate matter pollution and all are harmful to health. Sources include the following: residential heating&ndash; solid fuels; traffic &ndash; exhaust fumes; industry &ndash; emissions to air, Energy &ndash; emissions to air from power stations and refineries; and agriculture, forestries and fisheries &ndash; emissions to air from mobile farm machinery, fishing vessels.<br/><br/>Total emissions of PM<sub>2.5</sub>reduced in the decade up to 2011 but, without corrective action, are forecast to rise, in particular in the residential, industry and energy sectors, in the years up to 2020. Meeting the NERT will require a broad strategy across policy areas involving industry, the transport sector, the energy sector and all public authorities. <br/><br/>The first step in this process has been taken with the establishment of the NERT working group, which is a body of stakeholders, headed by the EPA, who will work to develop and implement the NERT strategy. One feature of the strategy will be an examination of Ireland&rsquo;s residential heating sources, fuel types and the efficiency of the solid fuel heating systems used in Ireland for residential heating. <br/><br/>The complex relationship between a reduction in our carbon footprint and decreasing PM<sub>2.5</sub>concentrations needs to be tackled in the plans to implement the NERT for 2020. Emissions of PM<sub>2.5</sub>from biomass are expected to increase in the residential, commercial and energy sectors. This will offset the reductions achieved from energy efficiency measures in these sectors and other policy initiatives including the extension of the ban on bituminous coal, and so will require consideration to be given to tackling other high emissions residential solid fuels. The potential for emissions abatement in these sectors will be analysed.<br/><br/>It is also important that all relevant facilities in the industry and energy sectors are using Best Available Technology to minimise emissions of PM<sub>2.5</sub>to air. Policies encouraging the use of biomass should be reviewed to ensure facilities are directed towards efficient combustion methods and towards those biofuels with the lowest emissions. Energy efficiency should continue to be promoted as the primary method to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</p></reply>

The Directive requires that certain minimum levels of monitoring are conducted for the purpose of assessment and management of air quality. The EPA has responsibility for the monitoring of air quality in Ireland, and monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants, based on data obtained from the 29 monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network. </p>  <p>  The EPA publishes an annual report on air quality, based primarily on the monitoring requirements of the CAFE Directive. The most recent report, Air Quality in Ireland 2013 &ndash; Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality, was published in October 2014 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2013, compared to the CAFE Directive standards as well as assessments in relation to more stringent World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines for the protection of human health.   </p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that downward trends have been identified for many pollutants and that Ireland currently meets all EU standards for air quality , while noting that Ireland exceeds WHO air quality guideline value s for particulate matter in some areas. Particulate matter levels are of concern, particularly during the winter heating season in areas where the sale of smoky coal is permitted. Because of this, levels of particulate matter in smaller towns are similar or higher than those in cities where smoky coal is banned. To help protect our good air quality, the Irish consumer must become more aware of their choice in home heating fuel and the potential impact that choice can have on air quality in their locality and on human health.   </p>  <p>  In August 2012, following a public consultation process, new solid fuel regulations (S.I. No. 326 of 2012) were introduced with the aim of ensuring that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of certain residential solid fuels   . The ban now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide, including all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people, bringing the ban areas broadly into line with national EPA air quality management zones. While my Department keeps the matter under regular review, I have no immediate plans at present to extend the ban to new towns. </p>  <p>  Air quality monitoring by the EPA has shown that air quality is poorer in towns where the smoky coal ban does not apply, although there is evidence that smaller smoky coal ban areas tend to be less effective. The further extension of the ban to smaller towns on an individual basis may not be the most effective solution to addressing the problem of emissions from residential solid fuel use in these areas. Similarly, the border with Northern Ireland would present enforcement challenges if a national ban on smoky coal were unilaterally introduced. However, it is recognised that having different regulations between urban and rural locations is not ideal, as it results in different levels of environmental protection and clean air benefits for citizens in different locations.   </p>  <p>  Under the auspices of the North South Ministerial Council, and in conjunction with the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, my Department has commissioned a study to inform a discussion on policy options to further address emissions from residential solid fuel use on an all-island basis. The study includes- </p>  <p>  -  an assessment of the solid fuel market and barriers to the use of cleaner fuels; </p>  <p>  -  consideration of the role and impacts of biomass (primarily wood and wood-based products) and the links to climate policy; and </p>  <p>  -  an economic analysis addressing the potential positive and negative effects on the consumer, for example, resulting from potential fuel switching, the availability of smokeless fuels to supply an all-island market and job creation opportunities in the manufacture and supply of smokeless fuels. </p>  <p>  A final report is expected to be presented to the North South Ministerial Council later this year. It should be noted that no decision has been made at this point regarding a nation-wide ban on the sale of smoky coal. </p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP) superseded the Local Development Social Inclusion and the Community Development Programmes in 2010. LCDP is the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State and is being implemented on a transitional basis until the end of March 2015, pending the roll out of the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) on 1 April 2015.  In accordance with the Public Spending Code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of services to clients, SICAP is subject to a public procurement process, which is in its final stages. The results of the tender process will be released shortly.</p>  <p>  The public procurement process is a competitive process that was open to Local Development Companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new Programme. In Stage one, joint applications were encouraged and organisations of varying sizes (for example smaller organisations working in consortia with larger organisations) were invited to submit joint applications. The closing date for receipt of tenders under stage two was noon on 19 December 2014. The tenders received are currently being evaluated by the Local Community Development Committees in each area, and tenderers will be informed of the outcome shortly.</p>  <p>  My Department is not aware of any planned partnership amalgamations. However, it should be noted that LDCs are independent companies, limited by guarantee. My Department has no role in the internal operations of LDCs and, therefore, does not have a role in relation to staff or employment matters, which are for the Board of the company, as the employer, to manage. Each funding Department is responsible for its own funding and contractual arrangements with the LDCs.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the procurement process, which is nearing completion, is in line with good practice and I look forward to the commencement and roll out of SICAP on 1 April 2015. In the meantime, all groups who received LCDP funding in 2014 are being funded through LCDP interim arrangements until 31 March next, pending the outcome of the competitive process.</p></reply>

It is a matter for them to decide the most appropriate public awareness, enforcement and clean-up actions in relation to litter and dog fouling, including the authorising of litter wardens as they see fit.  Section 16 of the Control of Dogs Act 1986 sets out the powers of dog wardens. In addition, section 28 of the Litter Pollution Act 1997, provides that a dog warden, within the meaning of the Control of Dogs Act 1986, may issue a notice or on-the-spot fine to an individual believed of committing a prescribed offence under the Act.<br/><br/>It is also open to a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a litter warden under the Litter Pollution Acts 1997-2009 to issue a notice where an offence is believed to have been committed. Local Authority Performance Indicators, including those pertaining to litter enforcement, are available at:<br/><br/>I am of the view that there are sufficient penalties in place and that adequate powers are available to appropriate personnel to deal with the issue of dog fouling when enforced under the Litter Pollution Acts and I have no plans to introduce further legislation at this time.<br/><br/>I believe that raising awareness of the litter problem and educating our young people is key to effecting a long-term change in society&rsquo;s attitudes towards litter disposal but, ultimately, it is the responsibility of each individual to ensure that they play their part in preserving the environment for others through the responsible disposal of their litter, including in relation to dog fouling.</p></reply>

Currently the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff schemes are the primary means through which electricity from renewable sources is supported in Ireland. These schemes support electricity generated from a range of renewable sources and are paid for by electricity customers through the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy.</p>  <p>  The choice of renewable energy technology is, however, ultimately a commercial decision for individual project developers and the fuel used in the plant at Moneypoint is a matter for the operator. I am advised, however, that there are a number of important issues that would demand further consideration before biomass could be used at Moneypoint. These include the following:</p>  <p>- the conversion of Moneypoint to biomass would require significant levels of capital investment by the operator;</p>  <p>- support tariffs substantially higher than those available for wind, which has been the most cost effective renewable technology in the Irish electricity market, would be required which would lead to increased electricity prices;</p>  <p>- substantially more biomass than is available domestically would be required with large amounts of the resource having to be imported leading to uncertainty in terms of security of supply. The sustainability of transporting large amounts of imported biomass would require consideration; and</p>  <p>- the commitment of substantial amounts of biomass to Moneypoint would divert scarce biomass away from the renewable heat sector, where biomass can be used more efficiently and where fewer alternative technologies exist.</p></reply>

Energy from biomass is expected to contribute up to half of the 2020 renewable energy targets, both here and in the EU as a whole.  I published a Draft Bioenergy Plan in October 2014 which will undergo Strategic Environmental and Appropriate Assessments to inform the content of the finalised Plan. These assessment processes will commence shortly. The draft Plan sets out the broader context for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s biomass sector, and the current status with regard to the range of policy areas that must be coordinated in order to create the conditions necessary to support the development of this sector.</p>  <p>  The draft Plan recommends the continuation of the REFIT schemes and the Biofuels Obligation Scheme, which currently support energy from biomass. Furthermore, the analysis underpinning the draft Plan is that an additional bioenergy focused measure in the heat sector represents the most cost effective means of meeting a number of different policy goals. Therefore, the plan also recommends the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources. The RHI scheme, once designed, will require State Aid approval from the European Commission and further Government approval. It is proposed to have the scheme in place next year.</p>  <p>  The draft Plan also contains measures to stimulate and support the supply of Irish biomass. In this regard, the key recommendations include: the continued support for the Afforestation Programme; the continuation of the Bioenergy Scheme for energy crops; and the establishment of Bioenergy Ireland, a joint venture between Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte.</p>  <p>Furthermore, in terms of developing new sources of biomass, the draft Plan provides that the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government would endeavour to optimise the availability of waste for energy and that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine would continue its support for innovative energy uses for animal by-products.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.  <br/><br/>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades. Approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.<br/><br/>A public consultation on a national high speed coverage map 2016 which was launched last November, closed on the 12th February. 27 submissions have been received to date and will be assessed over the coming weeks in terms of the overall intervention strategy. The map continues to be available at . The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 and includes parts of The Willows, Allenwood, Naas, Co Kildare. The AMBER area shows the target areas for the State intervention. All individual premises can be identified on the map to establish whether they are in the BLUE or AMBER area. <br/><br/>The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises or home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. It also provides detailed information on over 50,000 townlands throughout the entire country including Co Kildare. All individual premises can be viewed on the map.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will be also delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.<br/><br/>In tandem with the mapping consultation, intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy. The strategy will address a range of issues in relation to the intervention including the optimum procurement model, ownership model for the infrastructure and likely market impact. <br/><br/>Following a public consultation process on the draft Intervention Strategy during next summer, I hope to move to formal procurement phase towards the end of this year in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders. <br/><br/>The Department will design a tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost of the network build as low as possible. I anticipate that the first homes and businesses will be connected in 2016 and connections will continue thereafter, with the intention of having all premises connected within a 5 year period. <br/><br/>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government. It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland.</p></reply>
