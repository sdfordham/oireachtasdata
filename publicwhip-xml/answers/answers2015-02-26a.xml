That is because we believe it is critically important for our economy and for the ongoing development of British-Irish relations.  It is also our view that the EU itself is stronger and better with the UK as a full and committed member. We must therefore do what we can to help to encourage the UK to remain within the Union.  This means, as a starting point, continuing to work closely with our British partners &ndash; as well as other like-minded States &ndash; on policy issues where we share the same interests and approach.  The British Government and other British political parties have made clear that the achievement of common aims in regard to economic policy &ndash; including the completion of the single market in services, the conclusion of trade negotiations with third countries and a more streamlined approach to EU regulation &ndash; is a high priority in itself and will strengthen the case for the UK&rsquo;s continued membership.  Depending on the outcome of their general election in May, it is possible that the next British Government will make proposals on both how the functioning of the EU could be improved and specific UK concerns addressed.  Ireland will certainly consider any reasonable proposals on their merits, if and when they are presented.  We have a clear shared interest in seeing our Union operate more effectively.  We also recognise &ndash; as the European Council has done &ndash; that the UK has some legitimate concerns that should be addressed.  At the same time, we would not support anything which we think could weaken or otherwise adversely affect the Union.</p>  <p>  The Government is monitoring developments in the EU-UK relationship very carefully.  My Department is co-operating with other Departments, especially the Department of the Taoiseach, in this regard.  Our Embassy in London naturally plays a key role in this process and we rely heavily too on the reporting and analysis we receive from our Embassies elsewhere. </p>  <p>  We are also, of course, engaging directly with our British colleagues on the question of their EU membership.  I myself had a detailed discussion with Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond when he visited Dublin in December.  The subject has arisen as well in informal contacts with other British Ministers and our officials &ndash; in this Department, the Department of the Taoiseach and elsewhere &ndash; are engaging regularly with their counterparts in the UK system.  The UK&rsquo;s place in Europe is also regularly discussed with other EU partners at both political and senior official level.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, the nature of the UK&rsquo;s relationship with the EU is primarily an issue for the British people and we must continue to respect and be sensitive to the democratic process under way there.  We will though continue to play a constructive role in that debate and to ensure that our views are heard and clearly understood.</p></reply>

Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., we continue to work closely with our high level Government contacts and with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond towards achieving some relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the United States and improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.  When the Minister for Foreign Affairs travels to New York next month, he will meet and exchange views with a range of groups and organisations supporting the undocumented Irish and immigration reform.  In addition, Taoiseach Enda Kenny T.D., will travel to Washington for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and will meet with President Obama, Vice President Biden and other senior US Administration figures as well as with key Congressional contacts.    </p>  <p>  These meetings will provide an important opportunity to reiterate our concerns in regard to the position of the undocumented Irish, to seek further information on the detail of President Obama&rsquo;s executive action and to encourage progress on a comprehensive legislative package by Congress.</p>  <p>  While the executive measures announced by President Obama clearly represent real progress, Minister Flanagan and I are well aware that some will not benefit from these new arrangements and the Deputy will also be aware that there are currently legal challenges underway. </p>  <p>  During my visit to Washington from 20-21 January, I had a number of meetings with key Republican members of the House.  It provided an opportunity to assess the intentions of the Republican majority in terms of dealing with immigration this year and to convey the Government&rsquo;s ongoing determination to achieve some relief for the undocumented and improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.</p>  <p>  Our Ambassador and her team in Washington are continuing their ongoing engagement with the US administration on this priority issue for the Government.  We also keep in close contact with the US Ambassador to Ireland and his team at the US Embassy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-26a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015022600050#WRA01100"><p>I welcome the Deputy&rsquo;s question and the opportunity to discuss this important issue.  I share the very serious concern about the situation in South Sudan, which achieved its independence in 2011 but has been in turmoil since the outbreak of conflict in December 2013.  Continuing violence and threats have forced almost two million people to flee their homes.  The country&rsquo;s warring parties signed another ceasefire agreement in February following regional talks led by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), which were supported by the African Union and the European Union.  However, the current peace remains very fragile and the humanitarian situation is extremely serious.  Reports that 89 young boys were abducted over the weekend in Upper Nile State, for use as child soldiers, are particularly worrying.   </p>  <p>  South Sudan remains on the brink of famine, due to insecurity, continuing displacement and reduced food production.  Some 2.5 million people are facing crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity.  Malnutrition rates among children have more than doubled.   The international community has been working with the United Nations to protect civilians and provide humanitarian relief.  The mandate of the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), which provides security and protection for civilians, has been extended to May 2015. </p>  <p>  The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs recently co-hosted a high-level conference on South Sudan at which donors pledged some $600 million in assistance.  Since the outbreak of the conflict at the end of 2013, Ireland has provided almost &euro;11 million for South Sudan, through UN partners and NGOs working to alleviate the suffering of the people of the country and refugees across the region.  We have pledged a further &euro;3 million so far in 2015.  We will continue to monitor the political and humanitarian situation closely, through our Embassies in the region, and in co-operation with our EU partners and the United Nations.  </p></reply>

As I have indicated before, the deaths, casualties and detentions arising from the unrest there require full, impartial investigation in accordance with due legal process.  The apparently high levels of impunity in the case of serious crimes is a matter of further concern as is, indeed, the serious economic situation affecting the people of Venezuela.  I share the concerns expressed in this regard by EU High Representative Mogherini, and those expressed previously by High Representative Ashton, concerning the detention of political figures and of students.  Human rights, including the freedom of expression, of assembly and of association must be protected and upheld.  I renew my call for all parties, including government, opposition, students and civil society, to work together to find a consensus for overcoming Venezuela&rsquo;s current difficulties.   </p>  <p>  This month is the anniversary of the protests last year which resulted in a considerable number of deaths and detentions.  We are following the situation closely and are aware of recent reports, including those to which the Deputy refers.  I remain of the view that the best hope for progress in Venezuela is for an inclusive dialogue that will address, through peaceful means alone, the legitimate concerns of all parties. </p></reply>

Since taking up this role I have visited many Irish communities and the universal reaction has been very positive.  <br/><br/>I am very aware that the question of the extension of voting rights to Irish citizens abroad is an issue of great interest to many members of our community abroad.  I, and my colleague Minister Flanagan, have had a number of meetings with members of the Irish diaspora community at which this topic has been the subject of discussion.In addition, as part of the consultation phase of the review of our Diaspora Policy the issue of voting rights was raised by many of the groups and individuals who made submissions.  <br/><br/>At a meeting in September 2013, the members of the Convention on the Constitution supported the introduction of the right to vote in Presidential elections for citizens resident outside the State.  <br/><br/>The Government has recently considered their response to the recommendation of the Convention and has decided that it is necessary to analyse the full range of practical and policy issues<font color="#FF0000"> </font>that would arise in any significant extension of the franchise, before any decision could be made on the holding of a referendum.  This analysis will be undertaken by the relevant Ministers who will report back to Government on the matter.<br/><br/>A Working Group on Seanad Reform, chaired by Dr. Maurice Manning, was established by the Taoiseach in December 2014.  This Group is exploring ways of reforming Seanad &Eacute;ireann and the manner in which it carries out its business and has been asked to report back to Government not later than the end of March 2015.  The Group is examining these issues within existing Constitutional parameters. <br/><br/>It is clear from our contacts that many of our emigrants abroad see the extension of voting rights to Irish citizens outside the State as being an important step in deepening their engagement with Ireland and allowing them to play a more active role in Irish society.  I understand and appreciate their aspirations in this regard.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-26a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/979" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015022600050#WRA01700"><p>Ireland, in common with all other EU Member States, was unable to support the UN General Assembly resolution on the modalities for the implementation of General Assembly Resolution 68/304 on the establishment of a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes.  The main focus of the  resolution was the setting up of an <i>ad hoc</i>committee to elaborate a binding debt resolution mechanism.At the time of the vote, the EU explained that:<blockquote>&ldquo;The ad-hoc committee must be limited to the elaboration of a non-binding 'set of principles' which builds upon a market-based voluntary contractual approach to sovereign debt restructuring and aims at furthering its implementation and use.  Neither the EU nor Member States will participate in discussions aiming at the establishment of a binding multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes.&rdquo;</blockquote>As the resolution did not limit the scope of the <i>ad hoc </i>committee, the EU position is that in these circumstances we will not be participating in the work of the committee.<br/><br/>Ireland, together with our EU colleagues, and with many other UN member States, is actively engaged in ongoing processes to address the issue of sovereign debt restructuring.  Ireland considers that the work being undertaken at other levels, including in the IMF and at the International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa in July, offers more appropriate and established means for dialogue on the matter.  Ireland will play our full role in working for the success of the crucially important Addis meeting, which is central to the negotiations on the Post-2015 Development Agenda.  These major UN negotiations are being co-chaired by Ireland and Kenya. <br/><br/>Ireland continues to support processes aimed at resolving global debt issues through dialogue, using the most appropriate and effective mechanisms to support the countries most seriously affected.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-26a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015022600050#WRA01900"><p>The question of outstanding commitments from the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements was considered during the Stormont House talks.  Throughout the talks, the Government maintained the view that the best way to strengthen peace and reconciliation across this island was to implement fully the commitments undertaken in these Agreements.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the Good Friday Agreement commitment on the establishment of a consultative Civic Forum in Northern Ireland, the Government advanced the position during the Stormont House talks that greater civic engagement would stimulate informed public debate in Northern Ireland in relation to key societal challenges.  I welcome that the Stormont House Agreement provides for the establishment of a civic advisory panel to meet regularly on key social, cultural and economic issues and to advise the Northern Ireland Executive.  Proposals for a civic advisory panel in Northern Ireland are currently being prepared for consideration.  The ultimate objective is for the first meeting of the panel to take place in June 2015.   </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that it was included in a paper tabled by the Government at the outset of the Stormont House talks, I was disappointed that a commitment to an Irish Language Act, either enacted in Westminster or the Northern Ireland Assembly, did not form part of the final Agreement.  I welcome, however, the explicit endorsement in the Agreement by the British Government of the principle of respect for and recognition of the Irish language in Northern Ireland.   </p>  <p>  I particularly welcome the recent public consultation announced by the Northern Ireland Executive&rsquo;s Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure on an Irish Language Bill, which will run until 5 May.  This follows the Minister&rsquo;s recent publication of a &ldquo;Strategy to Enhance and Protect the Development of the Irish Language 2015-2035&rdquo;, as well as a similar Strategy for Ulster-Scots.  The Strategies set out roadmaps for the Irish Language, and for the Ulster-Scots language, heritage and culture, over the next 20 years in a range of areas such as education, public services, the community and the media.  </p>  <p>  While the Government would have wished to see the establishment of a North South Consultative Forum and a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, the necessary enabling consensus was not forthcoming during the Stormont House talks. </p>  <p>  The Government will avail of other opportunities to secure progress on these outstanding issues.  We will also continue our broader efforts to ensure that the full potential of the Agreements is realised towards achieving effective partnership government, genuine reconciliation between divided communities and economic prosperity for all in Northern Ireland. </p></reply>

I am appalled, in particular, at the rising number of civilian casualties in recent weeks as a direct consequence of the indiscriminate shelling of residential areas in the conflict zone.   </p>  <p>  The welfare of civilians caught up in the hostilities is a major concern and I fully support EU calls on all sides to respect International Humanitarian Law.  It is vital that the protection of civilians and humanitarian workers is ensured and that unhindered humanitarian access is granted to populations in need, in line with humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. It is also essential that the OSCE Mission is permitted to freely undertake its important monitoring and verification work in all areas of the conflict region. </p>  <p>  The most effective way of ensuring the safety of the civilian population is to stop the violence.  On 12 February, an agreement was reached in Minsk on a new peace deal aimed at ending the fighting.  The declaration agreed in Minsk by Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande, President Putin and President Poroschenko and the package of measures signed by the parties to the conflict provides for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons in eastern Ukraine.  The package also contains a timetable for the implementation of key parts of the September Minsk Agreements, which provide the basis for a comprehensive resolution of the crisis.</p>  <p>  On 17 February, the UN Security Council unanimously called on all parties to immediately cease hostilities and abide by the commitments agreed in Minsk.  EU High Representative Federica Mogherini has also issued a strong statement to this effect.  I fully support the UN Security Council Resolution and the High Representative&rsquo;s call, which also underlined the need for the agreed withdrawal of heavy weapons.  It is critical that all parties honour their commitments to end the fighting and fully support a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  On 18 February, President Poroschenko raised the idea of deploying a UN-mandated peacekeeping force to eastern Ukraine.  Russia and the separatists have reportedly rejected the suggestion, claiming that it was not part of the 12 February Minsk agreement.    </p></reply>

There has been an increase in tensions in the prison in recent weeks.  This is due in part to the issuing of threats by prisoners against Prison Service officials in a context where a serving prison officer, David Black, was murdered by dissidents in November 2012.  It is also related to recent construction work in Roe House intended to increase the space available to prisoners in the separated regime for association.  However, it appears the well meaning intentions behind the works were not effectively communicated in advance to inmates.   </p>  <p>  A protest by a small number of prisoners on 2 February ended with both the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice, David Ford, and the Director General of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, Sue McAllister, reporting no injuries to staff or prisoners.  I am aware that some prisoners have said that they were injured during the protest.  Members of the independent assessment team have since met with prisoners and prison management to hear their perspectives on the protest and on how best to take things forward.</p>  <p>  Despite the increase in tension, I take some encouragement from renewed calls by both the Northern Ireland Prison Service and prisoner representatives for the full implementation of the stocktake report.  It is important that this work continue with the good will and support of all the relevant stake holders.  The Northern Ireland Prison Service has reiterated its commitment to the implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  It would certainly facilitate progress if all threats against those working in the prison administration were lifted.  All such threats are completely unacceptable, and serve only to frustrate the process of improving the atmosphere in the prison.  The independent assessment group continues with their engagement, to encourage the implementation of their recommendations, and would be open to a meeting with the Deputy to discuss on-going concerns.  I have discussed prison issues with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on a number of occasions, most recently on 11 February.  I also met in January with a member of the independent assessment group which completed the stocktake Report of September 2014.  My officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continuously monitor the situation at Maghaberry Prison, including through contact with their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Office and officials in the Northern Ireland Prison Service, as well as members of the independent assessment group, and have been keeping me closely informed of developments. </p></reply>

The international community is severely challenged by the number and the seriousness humanitarian crises, driven by conflict, chronic instability and economic and environmental shocks.  Against this backdrop, the UN Secretary-General is convening a World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 to identify ways to meet increasing humanitarian needs as effectively as possible.    </p>  <p>  The UN is at present organising a series of regional consultations in the lead up to the Global Summit next year.  These focus on four themes &ndash; humanitarian effectiveness; reducing vulnerability and managing risk; transformation and innovation and serving the needs of people in conflict. </p>  <p>  Here in Ireland, five stakeholder groups engaged in humanitarian action - civil society, academia, diaspora communities, and the public and private sectors - have come together to reflect on the four priority themes and shape Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the global process.  This unique collaboration will also offer the Irish public the opportunity to give their views through online consultation.  The process will culminate in an Irish Humanitarian Summit, to be held in Dublin in May 2015. </p>  <p>  I see this as an important opportunity to recognise Ireland&rsquo;s strong humanitarian tradition and to re-affirm our national commitment to principled and effective humanitarian action.  It offers a real opportunity to forge innovative solutions and build Irish partnerships that can add value in humanitarian response.  Above all, our deliberations should ensure that the people affected by humanitarian crises are at the centre of our considerations.  The messages from the Irish Summit will inform our participation in the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul in 2016.</p></reply>

Under international law, the economic resources of a non-self governing territory may only be exploited for the benefit of the people of the territory, on their behalf or in consultation with their representatives.

Ireland is completely opposed to the death penalty in time of peace or war and is party to various UN and European human rights treaties that have successively limited (and, in the case of the Council of Europe, completely outlawed) the practice.  Furthermore, Ireland condemns all forms of arbitrary, summary and extrajudicial executions.  <br/><br/>In November 2014 Ireland, together with the other EU Member States, co-sponsored the UN General Assembly&rsquo;s resolution on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions.  At the core of this resolution are the right to life and the fight against impunity.  Notably, by way of this resolution, the General Assembly expressed its deep concern<i></i>about acts that can amount to extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions committed against persons exercising their rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression in all regions of the world, and about killings committed by non-State actors, including terrorist groups and criminal organisations, that may amount to abuses of international human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law.<br/><br/>The strong text of this resolution includes references to killings of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities or because of their sexual orientation or gender identity; killings of persons for reasons related to their activities as human rights defenders, lawyers, journalists or demonstrators; killings of persons affected by terrorism or hostage-taking or living under foreign occupation, racially motivated killings, killings of refugees, internally displaced persons, migrants, street children or members of indigenous communities, killings committed in the name of passion or in the name of honour, and killings committed for discriminatory reasons on any basis.<br/><br/>In June 2014, during the 26<sup>th</sup>session of the UN Human Rights Council, Ireland co-sponsored the resolution which renewed the mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions.  This resolution reiterates the obligation of all States to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; to identify and to bring to justice those responsible, while ensuring the right of every person to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law; to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to bring an end to impunity and to prevent the recurrence of such executions. <br/><br/>As recognised in the above resolutions, extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions may in certain circumstances amount to genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes as defined in international law, including the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.  In circumstances where the Court has jurisdiction by virtue of such executions taking place in the territory of a state party or state that has accepted the Court&rsquo;s role, or by the national of such a state, or where the United Nations Security Council has determined that the ICC has jurisdiction, prosecutions may be brought against alleged perpetrators in appropriate circumstances. <br/><br/>Let me reassure the Deputy that Ireland is committed to upholding the respect for international law in order to prevent extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions in all circumstances and to working for the complete abolition of the death penalty.</p></reply>

My Department is committed to the success of this excellent initiative with a global reach.  ID2015 aims to create 1,800 jobs and 200 new businesses by promoting Ireland as a hub for design excellence and by encouraging investment in design as a key component of competitiveness and innovation.<br/><br/>My Department is represented on the steering group of Irish Design 2015.  ID2015 is convened by the Design &amp;amp; Crafts Council of Ireland (DCCoI), in collaboration with partner organisations, on behalf of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Enterprise Ireland.  President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins is Patron of ID2015.<br/><br/>Since work on this initiative began in early 2014, my Department has facilitated contact between the ID2015 team and the Embassy network.  At the request of the ID2015 team, my Department also facilitated and funded the display of &lsquo;Weathering&rsquo;, an exhibition of contemporary Irish craft and design in the Ullens Centre for Contemporary Art in Beijing, during President Higgins&rsquo; State visit to China in December 2014, as a means of raising awareness of Irish design in that country.<br/><br/>The programme for ID2015 will see significant flagship events in eight design capitals during 2015, viz. Chicago, Eindhoven, London, Milan, New York, Paris, Shenzhen/Hong Kong and Tokyo.  Events include Milan and Dutch Design Weeks, the London Festival of Architecture (where Ireland is the inaugural country of focus), London Fashion Week, the London Design Festival, the Chicago Architecture Biennial and the Bi-City Biennale of Urbanism/Architecture in Hong Kong/Shenzhen.  The Embassy network is working closely with the ID2015 team on these events.<br/><br/>Aside from the flagship events overseas, the ID2015 team is also working with our Embassy network to plan smaller events to celebrate Irish Design in a further 26 destinations around the globe.<br/><br/>The ID2015 team is currently finalising the production of a &lsquo;capsule exhibition&rsquo; for use by the Embassy network.  This portable exhibition will showcase the best of Irish design across the breadth of design disciplines and will link Irish Design to events in international cities globally.  My Department has advised on logistics and agreed to facilitate the transportation of this exhibition to the Embassy network.  The Embassy network will use this exhibition to raise awareness of Irish design among key players in the design and associated sectors overseas.<br/><br/>The Embassy network will also make full use of the unique opportunity afforded by St Patrick&rsquo;s Day events worldwide to deliver key messaging on Ireland as a design hub. <br/><br/>The Minister for Diaspora Affairs, Jimmy Deenihan T.D., has been very supportive of ID2015, promoting it strongly to Irish communities overseas.  <br/><br/>&ldquo;We Built this City&rdquo; is an initiative with a strong diaspora focus which will aim to tell the story of how cities are created, connecting the Irish diaspora and celebrating the contribution Irish people have made to the construction, design, and development of the built environment from historic to contemporary times.  This initiative will feature in London, New York and Chicago.<br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  My Department has also agreed to promote the &lsquo;Global Irish Design Challenge&rsquo;, to be launched next month, targeted at the Irish Diaspora worldwide.  D</font>esigners who have Irish lineage or a strong affiliation to Ireland will be invited to design a 2D or 3D object that reflects their interpretation of contemporary Ireland.  The call for entries will run from March&ndash;September 2015 and a high-profile international panel of experts will assess submitted entries, with the ambition that the top entries will form part of a touring exhibition in 2016 to coincide with the 1916 centenary celebrations.<font color="#104160"> </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  I can assure the Deputy of my Department&rsquo;s strong commitment to the success of Irish Design 2015.</font></p></reply>

The purpose of my visit was to gather information and develop a deeper understanding of the situation on the ground in the context of the Middle East Peace Process.<br/><br/>I met with a range of interlocutors, including the the Foreign Minister of Israel, Avigdor Liberman, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Prime Minister, Rami Hamdallah. I did not meet with Hamas in Gaza.<br/><br/>I also met with UN agencies and with civil society groups to develop a better understanding of the issues faced on all sides.<br/><br/>In Gaza, I was struck by the desperation of the humanitarian situation for so many people.  I met with Pierre Krahenbuhl, the Commissioner General of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).  I visited an UNRWA school and a temporary shelter for families displaced by last year&rsquo;s conflict, where I met with a number of families directly affected by the conflict. <br/><br/>In my subsequent meeting with Foreign Minister Liberman, I raised the need to make further progress in lifting the blockade, to meet humanitarian need and as an enabler of social and economic progress.<br/><br/>One of the big challenges for the reconstruction of Gaza is that much of the money committed at the Cairo Conference on Reconstruction has not yet materialised.  I was pleased to announce funding of &euro;4.7 million for UNRWA and the UN&rsquo;s Emergency Response Fund in the course of my visit.  I hope that other donors can move quickly to deliver on their commitments. <br/><br/>I also met Israelis living near the border with Gaza who live in fear of Hamas attacks.<br/><br/>In the West Bank, I saw at first-hand the impact of settlements, including on the daily life of Palestinians.  In my meeting with Minister Liberman, I raised the issue of settlements and the fact that their continued expansion is a threat to the viability of two-State solution. <br/><br/>At the end of my visit, I had an opportunity to discuss the situation with the Quartet representative on the Middle East, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.I also had a telephone conversation with the leader of Israel&rsquo;s Labour Party, Isaac Herzog, who has strong links with Ireland.<br/><br/>In all of my meetings, I emphasised the need for political leadership and risk-taking.  <br/><br/>Israel is currently in the middle of an election and I hope that we will also soon see elections to the Palestinian Authority. <br/><br/>I met last month in Dublin with the EU High Representative, Federica Mogherini and I spoke with her again from Israel last week.  She is committed to increasing the EU&rsquo;s engagement in the Middle East Peace Process.  She is proposing a reappraisal of the EU&rsquo;s approach and how it can best contribute to creating the conditions for a resumption of purposeful negotiations aimed at the achievement of a two-State solution in co-operation with other key players.  This accords with my own thinking, and my visit will enable me to contribute substantively to the discussions she will convene.<br/><br/>I also had a number of engagements not directly related to the Middle East Peace Process.  I visited the site of Teva, an Israeli pharmaceutical company that employs more than 500 people in Ireland.

Widespread violence has forced 2 million people to flee their homes; 1.5 million people have been internally displaced, and half a million people have taken refuge in neighbouring countries. </p>  <p>  I saw the devastating impact of the crisis when I accompanied President Higgins on a visit to a refugee camp in Gambella, in Ethiopia, last November.  The vast majority of South Sudanese refugees arriving in Ethiopia are women and children, often malnourished and in poor health.</p>  <p>  Since the outbreak of the conflict, Ireland has provided almost &euro;11 million to UN partners and non-governmental organisations working on the ground.  I am committed to continuing Ireland&rsquo;s support.  On 9 February, our Ambassador to Kenya participated at a high level event in Nairobi which helped to build support for the response to this severe humanitarian crisis.  We are now delivering on our pledge by providing a further &euro;3 million for humanitarian assistance in South Sudan.  This funding is being disbursed to the UN-managed Common Humanitarian Fund which provides flexible funding to UN and NGO partners to protect vulnerable women and children, and to meet food, nutrition and health needs.  In addition, I expect to provide additional direct funding to our NGO partners for their work in South Sudan through Irish Aid&rsquo;s Emergency Response Fund.  </p>  <p>  We will continue to monitor the situation closely and provide assistance, within our means and as the situation evolves.</p></reply>

Ireland is deeply concerned by the persecution of Christians.  </p>  <p>  I am deeply shocked by recent reports of the brutal killing of Coptic Christians in Libya by ISIS and the kidnapping of 150 Assyrian Christians in eastern Syria.  These are monstrous acts beyond comprehension, which must be condemned in the strongest possible terms.  They are also savage attacks on minority communities and on the values of tolerance and pluralism which underpin freedom of religion or belief.  Ireland has repeatedly recalled the duty of States to protect vulnerable minorities in the Middle East, including Christian communities. I have reiterated that call and will be raising this with my EU colleagues at the earliest opportunity. The situation is particularly difficult, of course, in areas where the authority of the state has effectively collapsed.   </p>  <p>  Ireland attaches great importance to combating all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  We firmly believe in tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.</p>  <p>  Ireland raises the issue of the safety of Christians through its official bilateral contacts with the countries in question, stressing the responsibility of the government to protect all citizens and minorities.  We consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora, including the EU and UN.  I highlighted the issue when I addressed the UN General Assembly in New York on 29 September 2014.  I also raised it during my meeting with UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon.</p>  <p>  Ireland works within and alongside the EU to address the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, notably with the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief adopted during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013.  These Guidelines provide EU officials with an overview of the legal and policy framework within which the right to freedom of religion or belief is protected.  They also elaborate an EU strategy on how to engage with third countries on the right to freedom of religion or belief, a strategy which we hope to see bear fruit as we assess the implementation of the Guidelines.</p>  <p>  The EU leads resolutions on freedom of religion or belief at both the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, and at the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva, of which Ireland is currently a member.  Ireland is an active participant in the negotiation of these resolutions.  In 2014, the EU-led resolutions on freedom of religion or belief were successfully adopted without a vote by the HRC (March 2014) and by the UN General Assembly during its 69th session (December 2014).  Ireland also raised concerns in relation to persecution on the basis of religion or belief in interactive dialogues with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion during the 69th session of the Third Committee in 2014. </p>  <p>  The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is a unique peer review mechanism whereby the human rights records of individual states are reviewed in the UN Human Rights Council.  Ireland is an active participant in the UPR. and, where applicable, raises concerns in relation to persecution on the basis of religion or belief during the dialogue with states under review.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to actively support freedom of religion or belief across our foreign policy.</p></reply>

Ireland has continually advocated that civil society actors must be free to operate in a safe and enabling environment, free from repression.  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns on such human rights issues in Bahrain have been conveyed regularly to the Bahraini authorities.  <br/><br/>At the second Universal Periodic Review of Bahrain in May 2012 at the Human Rights Council Ireland recommended that Bahrain amend any article of its Penal Code that can be used to prosecute individuals for the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly or association, and bring its laws into line with international standards established by the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights.  <br/><br/>Ireland was one of 47 member states who delivered a joint statement expressing serious concern over the human rights situation in Bahrain at the 26<sup>th</sup>Session of the UN Human Rights Council in June of 2014.  In this statement, the signatories expressed their concern regarding the protection of human rights in Bahrain and called on the government to expedite the implementation of the recommendations received from the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry in this regard. <br/><br/>At the 27<sup>th</sup>session of the Human Rights Council in September 2014, in a national statement, Ireland again expressed our serious concerns about the human rights situation, in particular condemning &lsquo;the continuing arbitrary detention of human rights defenders, detained for peacefully exercising their human rights&rsquo;.<br/><br/>The situation faced by human rights defenders in Bahrain has also been raised with the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders. <br/><br/>Human rights defenders and civil society actors, whether in Bahrain or elsewhere, should not be detained or persecuted for simply exercising their rights. <br/><br/>I am aware of reports of the revocation of citizenship referred to.  I would recall Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that, &ldquo;Everyone has the right to a nationality&rdquo; and, &ldquo;No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality.&rdquo;  Without due process, no one should be deprived of their nationality. <br/><br/>Ireland will continue to raise its concerns in relation to these matters. </p></reply>

The package also contains a timetable for the implementation of key parts of the September Minsk Agreements, which provide the basis for a comprehensive resolution of the crisis.   </p>  <p>  The ceasefire came into effect at midnight on 14 February.  The OSCE has reported that it had largely held across most parts of the conflict area, with the notable exception of Debaltseve, a strategically important transport hub linking the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk.  Despite signing the ceasefire agreement, Russian-backed separatists continued a full scale assault on Debaltseve forcing Ukrainian troops to withdraw from the town, which is now in rebel hands.  I strongly condemn the rebel assault on Debaltseve.  It is a major breach of the ceasefire and threatens to undermine the peace deal agreed in Minsk on 12 February. </p>  <p>  Having achieved their objective in Debaltseve, it remains to be seen whether the rebels may now take steps to implement the ceasefire and withdraw their heavy weapons.  Russia has a key role to play in this regard given the considerable influence it exercises over the separatists groups.      </p>  <p>  Events last weekend, particularly the release of prisoners and the commitment by both sides to begin withdrawing heavy weapons this week, are positive signs. However, there have been worrying reports about shelling near Mariupol city.   </p>  <p>  Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande, President Poroshenko, President Putin and their Foreign Ministers remain in telephone contact and have indicated that they will continue to push for implementation of the package of measures agreed in Minsk on 12 February.   </p>  <p>  On 17 February, the UN Security Council unanimously called on all parties to immediately cease hostilities and abide by the commitments agreed in Minsk, including facilitating access for the OSCE Mission to enable them to monitor the situation on the ground.  EU High Representative Federica Mogherini has also issued a strong statement to this effect. </p>  <p>  I fully support the UN Security Council Resolution and the High Representative&rsquo;s call, which also underlined the need for the agreed withdrawal of heavy weapons.  It is critical that all parties honour their commitments to end the fighting and fully support a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine. </p></reply>

The most recent meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council on 9 February was an important opportunity for me to discuss the fluid situation on the ground in Libya with my counterparts from other EU Member States. We considered how the EU can best respond to the crisis in Libya.  This meeting adopted Council Conclusions on Libya which set out the EU position in detail.    </p>  <p>  The conclusions welcomed the convening of UN-facilitated dialogue process, renewed EU support to the work of the UN in Libya, condemned human rights violations and underlined EU readiness to continue supporting Libya in its transition. </p>  <p>  It is my sincere hope that the promise of a political resolution to the crisis in Libya can be fulfilled.  The convening of talks under the auspices of the UN is a positive step in this direction. </p></reply>

The detailed expenditure data for 2014 are currently being collated and verified for ODA eligibility, and when finalised will be published in the statistical annexes to the Irish Aid Annual Report available at .<br/><br/>Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is implemented in challenging, complex and indeed, inherently risky environments.  My Department has implemented a comprehensive system of internal controls to mitigate against those risks, ensure the efficient and effective use of resources and deliver value for money.  It operates rigorous systems for planning, monitoring, evaluating and auditing all funding provided for under the aid programme.  Programmes are closely monitored at mission and headquarters level to ensure they deliver on the intended results, and are meeting our overall objective of contributing to the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger in some of the poorest countries and communities in the world. <br/><br/>All expenditure is subject to audit by the Department&rsquo;s Evaluation and Audit Unit which reports directly to the Secretary General of the Department.  The work of the Evaluation and Audit Unit is overseen by the Department&rsquo;s independent Audit Committee.  All expenditure is also audited annually by the Comptroller and Auditor General.<br/><br/>While  no system can safeguard completely against the incidence of  fraud, I am satisfied that the Department has in place a comprehensive system of controls which ensures all expenditure provides value for money, and that funding provided under the aid programme is used to the greatest possible effect for the purposes intended.  </p></reply>

This remains an issue to the present day. There has been a change in Government in Sri Lanka following the presidential election last month, and I welcome the stated commitment of the new President, Maithripala Sirisena, to re-establish democracy, freedom, good governance and respect for human rights.  Through our Embassy in New Delhi, which is accredited to Sri Lanka, we are in regular contact with the EU Delegation in Colombo which reports that the new Government have already made some positive steps to deal with resettlement issues, including returning some military land (used for commercial purposes), nomination of a civilian governor in the Northern Province, cancelling the foreign travel restrictions in the North and welcoming Tamil refugees from India.<br/><br/><b></b>This year, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) plans to enhance its capacity to conduct refugee status determination and resettlement submissions in Sri Lanka.  I understand that they will also facilitate the voluntary return of Sri Lankan refugees and those internally displaced, in safety and dignity, and will assist them to reintegrate through community mobilization projects.<br/><br/>At the UN Human Rights Council session in March 2014 Ireland supported a resolution promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka.  One aspect of that resolution was a request for an investigation by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights into alleged serious violations of human rights in Sri Lanka.  The report of that investigation is scheduled to be published and considered by the Human Rights Council in September 2015.</p></reply>

JobsPlus is biased in favour of those who are longer term unemployed.  It provides employers with two levels of payment: &euro;7,500 over two years where a jobseeker who is 12-24 months on the live register is recruited and &euro;10,000 for each person recruited who has been unemployed for more than 24 months.  Since January 2015, eligibility for the lower level of subsidy has been broadened to include young jobseekers (aged 18-24) unemployed for four months or more and persons in a jobseekers allowance transitional arrangement.   The subsidy is paid in monthly instalments over a two year period provided the employment is maintained.  At the end of January 2015, the Department provided 3,010 employers with cash payments valued at some &euro;1.53 million in respect of 4,047 employees.  Sixty-two percent of those employees supported had previously been on the live register for at least 24 months.</p>  <p>  The proposal made by the Deputy to provide a subsidy of 70% of the minimum wage for 37.5 hours work per week for a period of 18 months for each employee would cost &euro;983.94 per month compared with the lower level of subsidy of &euro;312.50 per month and &euro;416.67 per month for the upper level of subsidy.  The cost of the proposal would be of the order of &euro;17,710 for the 18 month duration against the current costs as stated above.  Given the level of take up of the scheme to date and the positive feedback from employers, I do not consider that a rationale exists for increasing the level of payment as proposed, nor do I consider that the proposal would represents good value for money in achieving the objectives for JobsPlus.</p></reply>

Separate to the liquor licensing laws, a club may sell beer if it holds a certificate of registration from the Courts under the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 - 2008. </p>  <p>  In addition to the licensing requirements, beer may be produced only in a tax warehouse by a person who is authorised by the Revenue Commissioners under the Finance Act 2001.</p></reply>

It should be noted that both of these credits are no longer available for new claimants. Mortgage interest relief is not available for homes purchased on or after 1 January 2013 and rent relief has not been available for new claimants from 8 December 2010. The relief for pre-existing claimants is being be phased out with both schemes scheduled to finish at the end of 2017.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to estimate the cost to the Exchequer of providing the &euro;6,000 housing tax credit outlined by the Deputy as there is insufficient detail as to how such a credit would work. For example, is the proposed tax credit an annual allowance or a once-off lifetime credit? In addition, it is not clear how the proposed credit would interact with mortgage interest relief already claimed, for example, how would it apply where a person has already received mortgage interest relief for one year, compared to someone who has claimed it for six years. These variables would affect the estimation of cost over a period of time.</p>  <p>  I would have concerns about the introduction of such a credit in terms of the possibility of its value being absorbed by landlords, resulting in no gain for tenants. Similarly, the availablity of such a credit could act to encourage lenders to charge higher rates of interest on home loans. In addition, it should be noted that tax credits are only of value to those who are liable to income tax. In this regard, the Deputy may wish to note that it is estimated that approximately 38% of income earners will not have a liability to income tax in 2015.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy wishes to scope out the proposal in greater detail my officials in conjunction with Revenue will see if they can provide an estimate of the cost of the proposed credit.</p></reply>

The objective of the compliance program is to ensure that the purpose of any transfer of pension funds off shore is for bona fide reasons and do not contravene tax legislation or undermine pension tax policy. At this point, the question of settlements does not arise as the priority to date has been to verify the bona fides of the transfers and to establish the scale of the issues involved. </p>  <p>  For taxpayer confidentiality reasons it is not possible to give precise details of the enquiries underway. However, I am advised that from 2012 to date a total of 456 notifications to transfer pension arrangements off-shore have been received by the Revenue Commissioners and the value of the funds to be transferred amount to &euro;54,707,326. It is important to bear in mind that not all of these transfer notifications may actually have proceeded to an actual transfer. Also many would have been made for bona fide purposes and fully compliant with tax legislation and pension tax policy.  While there is a range of countries involved, 348 of the transfers were to Australia, Cyprus, Malta and the United Kingdom.</p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that moving pension funds off-shore in an effort to circumvent the requirements of Irish pension tax legislation may fall foul of the conditions under which a pension scheme was approved by the Revenue Commissioners as an exempt approved scheme or the conditions under which a Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) product received Revenue approval.  This could result in the withdrawal of the approval of an occupational pension scheme in accordance with the provisions of section 772(5) of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 or the withdrawal of the approval of the PRSA product under section 787K (3) and (4) TCA 1997. Any such withdrawal of approval could trigger significant tax liabilities on the sums moved off shore and the withdrawal or claw back of tax reliefs. Moreover, in such cases and depending on the circumstances and the motivation of the individual concerned the possibility also arises that such transactions may also fall foul of the legislation designed to counter tax avoidance transactions.</p>  <p>  In addition to Revenue s compliance program, the Department of Finance has initiated a review of the whole area of pension transfers abroad in conjunction with Revenue, the Department of Social Protection and the Pensions Authority.  Revenue s findings from the on-going compliance programme will feed into and inform that review.</p></reply>

Following review of all submissions received the Central Bank has informed me that a feedback statement outlining the information received, the Central Bank's response and the final regulations for credit unions will then be published. All submissions received will be published on the Central Bank's website.I am satisfied that the safety of members savings and the security of the credit union sector as a whole are central to any actions taken by the Registrar of Credit Unions.<br/><br/>The draft lending regulations set out in CP88 define the categories of lending a credit union can undertake but do not limit credit unions to charging interest rates based on the category of lending i.e. a credit union may charge different interest rates for loans within the same category of lending.  Under the draft lending regulations where a credit union is providing home improvement loans these may be provided as personal loans or as house loans.  Where such a loan is provided as a house loan the credit union must hold the first legal charge secured on the property. However, where such a loan is provided as a personal loan there is not a requirement to hold the first legal charge secured on the property. <br/><br/>The Commission on Credit Unions recommended the restructuring of the sector and on foot of this recommendation the Credit Union Restructuring BoardReBo was established. Restructuring is currently being carried out on a voluntary, incentivised and time-bound basis in line with the Commission recommendation. While restructuring can be used by credit unions as a means of addressing current weaknesses or as a business strategy for credit unions that wish to achieve the scale necessary to develop a more sophisticated business model, it is recognised that restructuring will not apply to all credit unions and that some credit unions will continue to operate on a stand-alone basis.<br/><br/>While the Government recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in this country, it is vital that measures implemented will ensure a viable credit union sector into the future. <br/><br/></p></reply>

Any agent acting on behalf of a regulated lender must comply with the requirements of Irish financial services law and failure to do so may result in the Central Bank imposing penalties on the regulated lender concerned.   </p>  <p>  I am also informed by the Central Bank that it has also communicated to firms its preference that the outcome of any sale of mortgage books by regulated entities would ensure continuity of borrower protections under Codes and also that the purchaser would have relevant policies and procedures, systems and control checks to appropriately manage a mortgage loan book. </p>  <p>In relation to the sale or transfer of loan books to third parties, Provision 3.11 of the 2012 Consumer Protection Code requires that regulated entities subject to that Code notify the Central Bank immediately where they intend to transfer all or part of their regulated activities to another regulated entity. In general however, the Central Bank has no role in approving the sale or transfer of loan books to third parties, and it has no data available at this time on the number and book value of such sales or transfers for the period requested.  In addition, by virtue of an exemption in Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997, an unregulated entity to whom a cash loan is transferred by a regulated entity is not currently subject to Central Bank supervision under the Consumer Protection Code and CCMA.</p>  <p>  However, I understand that most purchasers of loan books have stated they are voluntarily complying with the Codes. Of course voluntary compliance is not enforceable. In order to ensure that consumers maintain these protections, the Government committed in March 2014 to bringing forward legislation to protect consumers whose loans are sold to unregulated entities.</p>  <p>  The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2015 was published in January and second stage of the Bill was taken in the D&aacute;il on 4 February. Since then, my officials have been in contact with the Central Bank and with the Office of the Attorney General to further progress the legislation. It remains my intention to ensure that borrowers whose loans are sold by a regulated entity to a currently unregulated entity maintain the same protections as they had prior to the sale. The Bill will continue its progress through the legislative process and I look forward to further discussion of the Bill at Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  In relation to the data requested by the Deputy, I said in PQ 42363 on 5 November last that  information from company announcements in the public domain, would suggest that between 8,000 and 10,000 mortgages in total have been sold to unregulated entities in recent years. Since then, I understand that approximately 6,000 mortgages were sold by IBRC.</p></reply>

Such an issue is a matter for the Stormont and UK Governments.</p>  <p>  While a formal assessment has not been carried out in relation to the possible impact of a cut in the Northern Ireland corporation tax rate on the economy in the Republic, it is well known that Ireland is a supporter of fair tax competition and the OECD has consistently stated that low corporation tax rates combined with a broad base is the best way to encourage economic growth while still maintaining tax revenues. That is what we have being doing for many years and what we will continue to do.</p>  <p>  The 12.5% rate is a central pillar of our taxation system but it is important to remember that attracting foreign direct investment and stimulating growth is about much more than just having a competitive tax rate. As I have stated many times, the Irish system is built upon the 3 Rs and while rate is a key feature, the other two Rs of regime and reputation are equally important in shaping a competitive taxation landscape.</p>  <p>  Ireland would be fully supportive of any measures which would make the Island of Ireland, as a whole, more competitive but a low stable corporate tax rate is only one piece in the competitiveness jigsaw. A reform of the Northern Ireland corporation tax rate has the potential to generate benefits on both parts of the island.</p></reply>

As a consequence the bank has submitted a Capital Plan to the SSM, which outlines how the bank intends to meet the capital shortfall.  Much of the shortfall has been met through performance in 2014 and deleverage of assets in 2014. The remaining shortfall will require the bank to raise capital, including equity capital, from private sources before 26 July 2015, diluting the State's shareholding.  Details of the capital raise, including quantum and structure, will be finalised and publicised in due course .  </p>  <p>  I am of the view that the best way to protect the value of the State's shareholding is to ensure Permanent TSB is well prepared, that it conducts a comprehensive and competitive exercise to raise the capital with appropriate legal and financial advice, and that the State has meaningful oversight and involvement in the process. Officials from my Shareholding Management Unit and our financial advisers, JP Morgan Cazenove, are well placed to fulfil this role and are engaging with the bank on important aspects of the capital raise on a regular basis.</p></reply>

However, in the last two months there are tentative indications of a moderation in price growth in Dublin; the monthly rate of property price growth was -0.1 per cent in November and was 0.3 per cent in December. This compares to an average monthly growth rate of close to 3 per cent in the six months prior to November 2014.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises that the main driver of house price growth in Dublin is a shortage in the supply of housing to meet growing demand. Under Construction 2020 Strategy: A Strategy for A Renewed Construction Sector, the Government has set out its strategy to address the issues that are impeding a fully functioning construction and property market. My Department along with other relevant Departments and bodies, is involved in a range of actions as part of the Strategy which addresses among other issues housing supply, planning issues, sustainable development financing, sustainable mortgage lending, as well as addressing legacy issues associated with the property bubble. </p>  <p>  The recently introduced macro prudential residential mortgage lending rules by the Central Bank are one of a number of instruments at the Central Bank's disposal to strengthen the resilience of the banking system and the household sector against sudden house price changes. To extent that the new regulations contribute to sustainable mortgage credit lending and affect buyers' price expectations, this may to contribute to a lowering of the current growth rate of property prices in Dublin.</p></reply>

This is a strategic approach that recognises the need, in line with international best practice, to move to a more sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems. The CFRAM Programme is the principal vehicle for implementing national policy on flood risk management and the European Directive on the Assessment and Management of Flood Risk (2007/EC/60).  Further information is available on the Programme website www.cfram.ie.</p>  <p>  In brief, the CFRAM Programme has three principal milestones:</p>  <p>- Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (completed)</p>  <p>- Flood Maps (for finalisation 2015)</p>  <p>- Flood Risk Management Plans (for finalisation 2016)</p>  <p>  This national programme of CFRAM Studies, which is being carried out by several engineering consultancies over six regions, is focused on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (or &ldquo;AFAs&rdquo;).  The designated AFAs were selected following the Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (PFRA) phase which involved public consultation including the public exhibition of consultation documentation in Cork Co. Council (and all other City and County Councils) in Autumn 2011. Arising from the PFRA, the town of Dunmanway has been designated as one of the AFAs and is being assessed under the South Western CFRAM Study.  </p>  <p>  Predictive flood mapping has been produced by engineering consultants based on extensive survey data and watercourse modelling. A Public Consultation Day on the draft flood maps was held in Dunmanway on 10th February last. The draft flood maps for Dunmanway are currently available for inspection on the Study website www.southwestcframstudy.ie and members of the public may provide feedback on same.  A national statutory consultation is due to be held in early summer.  </p>  <p>  All feedback received during the draft flood maps consultation period will form part of the process of finalisation of the flood maps.  It is important to emphasise that flood risk areas within Dunmanway will not be formally identified by the South Western CFRAM Study until the flood maps are finalised later in 2015.</p>  <p>  Following the finalisation of the flood mapping and the assessment of appropriate flood risk management options, the final output from this important project will be integrated Flood Risk Management Plans containing specific measures to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risk identified. The CFRAM Programme will be used to determine national priorities for future State investment in flood defences. </p></reply>

The Act does not accord me as Minister any function in this regard. </p>  <p>  There are two provisions in the legislation governing the assessment of valuations which result in the issue of valuation certificates, i.e. revaluation and revision. They are dealt with under Parts 5 and 6 of the Valuation Act 2001 respectively. There has been no change in the legislative provisions during this D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  Revision of valuation is the mechanism used to maintain local authority valuations lists. It is used to add new properties to the list, to amend the valuations of altered properties and to remove demolished or defunct properties from the list. By contrast, in a revaluation the entire commercial valuation list for a local authority is brought up-to-date by reference to a specific valuation date. The entire list is published on one date (usually 31 December) and it comes into effect for rating purposes on 1 January the following year.  </p>  <p>  The revaluation of a rating authority area is commenced by the making of a Valuation Order by the Commissioner of Valuation which among other things specifies the publication date of the new valuation list. It is for the Commissioner to set the publication date which would take account of factors such as the number of items to be valued. The Act states that the publication date shall not be more than three years after the date the valuation order is made. In practice the gap between the date the valuation order was signed and the publication date is between 24 and 33 months. Prior to 2011 the gap was between 26 and 33 months. Since 2011 the gap between the order date and the publication date has been between 24 and 33 months. As can be seen from the figures below nearly 2/3 of the properties revalued have been completed on valuation orders signed in 2011 or later with 1/3 of properties revalued on valuation orders signed between 2005 and 2011. </p>  <p>  To-date, revaluations of all local authorities in Dublin, Waterford and Limerick have been completed comprising approximately 49,500 properties, representing approx. 57% of the national rateable valuation base in monetary value terms or 33% in numerical terms. In addition, 13 public utilities representing some of the largest ratepayers in the State have been valued on a national basis. </p>  <p>  Since 2011, as part of the national revaluation programme the Valuation Office has issued in excess of 32,000 proposed valuation certificates and 31,482 final valuation certificates, all within the required timelines. The latter are broken down as follows:</p>  <p>  Dublin City 20,845</p>  <p>  Waterford City &amp;amp; County 3,917</p>  <p>  Limerick City &amp;amp; County 6,720</p>  <p>  Valuations of commercial properties at revision are determined under Part 6 of the Valuation Act 2001, by reference to the net annual values of comparable properties on the same valuation list. The Act provides for applications for revision to be made to the Commissioner by an occupier, a rating authority, an interest holder in a rateable property or the occupier of another rateable property in that same rating authority area. On receipt of a revision application the Commissioner appoints a revision officer to deal with the application and the Act requires that officer to deal with that application within 6 months of his/her appointment. </p>  <p>  Revision applications are received on an ongoing basis throughout the year and, in so far as reasonably practicable, the statutory timelines provided for in the Valuation Act 2001 are adhered to. While there are always some arrears of revision casework, these are not significant. The vast majority of applications are lodged by local authorities with whom the Valuation Office maintains close liaison, to ensure that revision applications are dealt with as expeditiously as possible and to agreed timelines having regard to the local authority budgetary year. Revision applications relating to new properties and those received from the public are disposed of expeditiously; the Valuation Office aims to deal with the majority of ratepayer revision applications within 3 months of receipt of the application. </p>  <p>  During 2014, 3,467 revision applications were received, 4,204 revision applications were dealt with which resulted in 1,804 new records being created and 6,024 valuation certificates being issued in total. </p></reply>

I understand that officials in that Department have worked with a broad range of stakeholders to ensure the industry was aware of, and prepared for, the implementation of the Construction Products Regulation in Ireland. I also understand that a significant number of steel fabricators operating in the State have already established the systems necessary to comply with their obligations under the Construction Products Regulation and, more specifically, the requirements of I.S. EN 1090-1. D/ECLG remains committed to working with all stakeholders in order to continue to raise awareness and facilitate the implementation of the Construction Products Regulation in Ireland.    With regard to your specific question concerning the role of the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in providing training support for companies affected by the Construction Products Regulation, the role of the LEOs is to provide information to small and micro firms and to signpost them to relevant agencies / bodies for training and certification.</p>  <p>  The provision of the specialist technical training required to achieve certification to an International or European Standard, such as that required by steel fabricators in this instance, is outside of the remit of the LEO services. However, I understand that to date the LEOs, in conjunction with the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) have provided four general awareness / information seminars on the topic at various venues around the country. In view of the NSAI&rsquo;s final certification role, and given the roles and responsibilities of other Departments and agencies, my Department has discussed the requirements of the CPR with the relevant Departments and agencies i.e. Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Department of Education and Skills, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) network and the NSAI. </p>  <p>  I also understand that the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) in Cork, Dundalk, Galway, Shannon, Tralee and Waterford provide metal fabrication apprenticeship training, which incorporates elements of certification training. The ETBs come under the remit of the Department of Education and Skills. It may be beneficial for companies to explore what economies of scale might be achieved for companies seeking the same upskilling in the same area.</p></reply>

Records available to the Department confirm that the person named applied for a Nitrates Derogation in 2011 and 2012, which would have allowed him to farm up to 250 kgs of Nitrogen per hectare per year, subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the Derogation, which include the submission of a Fertiliser Plan, a critical element of the derogation process.  The Derogation applications for 2011 and 2012 were rejected as no Fertiliser Plan was submitted for either year. This resulted in non-compliances with the maximum limits of Nitrogen kgs per hectare requirements of the Nitrates Regulations being determined in each of these years.  This resulted in penalties being applied against the 2011 and 2012 Direct Payments Schemes. </p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s records indicate that in 2013, the amount of nitrogen from livestock manure applied to land on the holding of the person named above (including that deposited by animals) was 198 kgs per hectare, which exceeded the limit of 170 kgs per hectare set down in the Nitrates Regulations.  The person named did not apply for a Nitrates Derogation in 2013.</p>  <p>  As similar breaches under the Nitrates Regulations had been identified within the previous three years, as detailed above, the regulatory provisions require that rules on repetition must be applied and this resulted in a 100% penalty being applied against the 2013 Direct Payment Schemes. </p>  <p>  The person named was notified of this decision on 14 October 2014, and of his right of appeal to the Agriculture Appeals Office.  I understand from that office that the person named has not availed of this option.</p>  <p>  EU Regulations governing payments under the Direct Payment Schemes require that where overpayments are identified in respect of a scheme year for which payments have already issued, the over-payments must be recouped from any future year&rsquo;s payments due to the applicant.  In this case the 2013 overpayment under the Single Payment Scheme was deducted from the 2014 payment due to the person named under this scheme, resulting in a net payment of &euro;18.43 issuing in respect of 2014 scheme.

These events show that all States must remain vigilant and attentive to the risks posed by international terrorism. <br/><br/>Ireland, like any other democratic country with similar values, is not immune to a threat from international terrorism.  While an attack on Ireland is possible it is not assessed as likely and there is no specific information in relation to a threat to Ireland.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are keeping the level of threat from international terrorism under continuous review in light of ongoing developments and continuing to take all appropriate measures to counteract this threat.  In this they have the full support of the Government.<br/><br/>The radicalising affect of online propaganda must also be dealt with and this is a matter which has received direct attention from EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers at our recent meetings.  Indeed, this has been a focus of actions at EU level for a number of years now, particularly in the context of the EU's Strategy for combating radicalisation and recruitment to terrorism and the EU's Internal security strategy.  The Deputy will wish to know that the recent informal meeting of EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers focused on the international terrorism and foreign fighters issues.  Ireland along with its European counterparts is seeking to work with all relevant stakeholders to develop further initiatives in this domain.<br/><br/>The Government is committed to ensuring that the necessary legislation is in place to address terrorist threats.  The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014 has already passed all stages in the Seanad.  It is expected that the Bill will come before the D&aacute;il shortly.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>The Bill, when enacted, will create the three new offences of, public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism.  These offences will carry sentences of up to 10 years imprisonment on conviction on indictment.<br/><br/>As the Deputy will appreciate, any response to this issue must be proportionate to the level of the threat and multi-faceted in approach.  In addition to conventional security measures, engagement with minority or at risk communities is an essential element of the response.  In that context, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operates a progressive programme of community engagement with minority communities.  The aim of these programmes is to build a sense of inclusiveness amongst minority communities and to address feelings of marginalisation in order to avoid providing  fertile ground for radicalisation and those seeking to radicalise others. </p></reply>

The CSO has previously indicated that it is carrying out a detailed analysis of certain issues raised by the Garda Inspectorate in relation to the recording, classification and reclassification of crime, to see whether and to what extent they may have implications for the crime statistics which that Office produces<i>.</i>This process is currently ongoing and the CSO has indicated that it has resulted in a delay in publishing the Quarter 3 statistics for 2014.  The figures published up to Quarter 2 in 2014 indicate a reduction in the overall number of offences recorded in the 12 months to that date.<br/><br/>Insofar as burglary offences are concerned, and as I indicated in my remarks as referred to by the Deputy, I am very conscious of the concerns which relate to these crimes and working closely with the Garda Commissioner and other relevant criminal justice agencies to ensure that an effective, whole of system response is in place.  I understand that the general trend is that, having fallen in 2013, there has been an increase in such offences during 2014.<br/><br/>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are pursuing a range of strategies to tackle this, including the establishment of Burglary Response Units and through operations such as Operation Fiacla and Operation Acer, which are focusing on identifying and targeting the criminal groups who have played a large part in the recent increase.  In addition to these policing responses, I am also carrying out a broader and urgent review of the criminal justice system's response to the problem of burglaries. This includes a focus on interagency measures in relation to the management of prolific offenders, visible policing, crime prevention support for communities, and an examination of legislative issues. Burglary is a persistent and highly damaging crime, and I am determined to tackle it on a number of fronts, and through a partnership approach between criminal justice agencies and the community.  <br/><br/>In relation to the closure of Garda stations, the Deputy will be aware that the decisions made in 2013 in this regard were the result of a comprehensive operational assessment carried out by the Garda Commissioner, the objective of which was to ensure that Garda resources are used in the best and most efficient way possible.  In particular, freeing up Garda&iacute; from desk duties has increased the number of Garda&iacute; available for frontline policing and confronting crime.  While the deployment of resources is kept under review at all times by the Garda Commissioner, none of the advice to me suggests that the closure of Garda stations is a significant factor in the recent increase in burglary, or that its reopening would contribute materially to a solution.  Tackling highly mobile gangs involved in burglary will not be helped by reopening Garda stations, as to do so would take Garda&iacute; away from visible front line policing and crime prevention.</p></reply>

As well as introducing an option for persons to pay fines by instalment, there are also changes in the way those who fail to pay fines are dealt with, with a range of options available to judges including recovery orders, attachment of earnings, community service and ultimately imprisonment.  <br/><br/>Work is ongoing in preparing for the implementation of the Act.  The area most directly affected by the changes is the Courts and the Courts Service is working on a number of developments which will ensure that the implementation of the legislation, and the new procedures which will operate under it, are as efficient as possible.  <br/><br/>In relation to the introduction of payment of fines by instalment, a decision was taken to outsource all aspects of the recovery of fines to an external provider.  The Courts Service is introducing new arrangements for the payment of fines which will allow payments to be made in a range of outlets across the country, and not just through Courts Service offices.  There are significant changes in information technology required to ensure that the instalment payment system operates effectively and that the necessary accounting procedures are in place for the recording of payments. Changes are also required in the way that information is transferred between the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that both organisations have fully up to date information on the cases and their current status.  <br/><br/>It is expected that all the preparations for the new system will be completed by the third quarter of 2015.  While it is desirable that the Act be commenced as soon as possible, it is important that these preparations are done correctly to ensure that the significant changes being implemented in the fines system as a result of this legislation are implemented smoothly and effectively from the start.  <br/><br/>In the case of 2014, these figures are provisional pending the publication of the Irish Prison Service Annual Report 2014.  <table><tr><th>County</th><th>Number of Persons in 2012</th><th>Number of Persons in 2013</th><th>Number of Persons in 2014 (up to and including the 16/04/2014)</th></tr><tr><td>Antrim</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Armagh</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>78</td><td>65</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>76</td><td>89</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>268</td><td>315</td><td>124</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>1,215</td><td>1,324</td><td>425</td></tr><tr><td>Derry</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>129</td><td>83</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>Down</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>1,886</td><td>1,556</td><td>499</td></tr><tr><td>Fermanagh</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>187</td><td>342</td><td>167</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>240</td><td>238</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>304</td><td>203</td><td>84</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>132</td><td>193</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>155</td><td>131</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>17</td><td>22</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>673</td><td>783</td><td>190</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>43</td><td>78</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>137</td><td>172</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>95</td><td>83</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>165</td><td>118</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>60</td><td>51</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>No Fixed Abode</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>123</td><td>213</td><td>84</td></tr><tr><td>Outside Country</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>66</td><td>55</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>91</td><td>63</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>348</td><td>319</td><td>106</td></tr><tr><td>Tyrone</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>291</td><td>253</td><td>95</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>166</td><td>133</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>239</td><td>261</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>270</td><td>207</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>7,476</td><td>7,365</td><td>2,491</td></tr></table></p></reply>

One of the main statutory functions of the PSRA is the licensing of Property Service Providers, i.e. auctioneers, letting agents and property management agents. The Authority is independent in the performance of its functions.</p>  <p>  The 2011 Act provides for the licensing of all persons engaged in the provision of property services. Applicants for a Property Service Provider's licence must meet certain "minimum qualification requirements" which are set out in paragraphs 2(a), (b), (c), and (d) of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011, (Qualifications) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 181 of 2012), before a licence can be granted, namely minimum academic qualification, lawful experience or other qualifications or experience. The appropriate experience requirement means that a person must be able to demonstrate to the Authority that they have been lawfully engaged in, and for periods amounting together to not less than 3 years of the 5 year period immediately preceding the making of the application, the provision of the property service for which they are seeking a licence. </p>  <p>  I should point out that I am advised by the Authority that employees with extensive relevant experience are not being excluded from qualifying for a licence based on this experience alone. Rather, it is the case that where a person fails to quality under paragraphs 2(a) to 2(c) of S.I. 181 of 2012 referred to above, i.e. under the minimum academic qualifications and lawful experience criteria, the Authority always exercises the discretion available to it under paragraph 2(d) relating to other qualifications and experience, and any person who can demonstrate that they have appropriate other qualifications or experience relevant to the licence being sought, may be granted a licence.</p></reply>

This is clear from the census and from our citizenship ceremonies.  </p>  <p>  At EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments "to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons".  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases.  It is open to persons in an undocumented situation to present their case on its merits, to have it considered and to abide by the decision.    </p>  <p>  I note the report to which the Deputy is referring.  I think however that it is important to recognise that in most cases a person becomes undocumented through their own actions by making the choice to remain in Ireland without immigration permission as opposed to the alternative of leaving the State, as they are supposed to do. The Department has operated a scheme to address the situation of that minority who became undocumented through no fault of their own.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to introduce a general regularisation scheme for those who are currently undocumented in the State, although I am aware of calls for something on these lines.   A proposal of this nature could give rise to very large, unpredictable and potentially very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services.  Any possible implication for the operation of the Common Travel Area would also have to be very carefully considered.</p></reply>

A breakdown of their location is set out in table 1.<br/><br/>Information on prisoners on restricted regimes is included in the Irish Prison Service quarterly statistics report on the prison population.  Restricted regime is define by the Irish Prison Service as those prisoners whose daily out of cell time is restricted to less than 5 hours i.e. they are locked up for more than 19 hours per day. <br/><br/>I can advise that on the 14th of January 2015 there were 3,661 prisoners in custody.  Of this there were 300 prisoners had there regime/out of cell time restricted.  A detailed breakdown by institution and restriction is set out in Table 2.<br/><br/>I can advise the Deputy that of the 300 on restricted regime 23 were aged 18- 20 and 64 were aged 21-24.  A breakdown of these groups are set out in Table 3 and Table 4.<br/><br/>The restriction of a prisoner's regime can occur due to a number of factors including, the protection of vulnerable prisoners.  This is provided for under Rule 63 of the Prison Rules 2007.  A prisoner may, either at his/her own request or when the Governor considers it necessary, in so far as is practicable and subject to the maintenance and good order and safe and secure custody, be kept separate from other prisoners who are reasonably likely to cause significant harm to him/her.<br/><br/>In July 2013, the Director General of the Irish Prison Service established a high level group to look at measures which can be introduced to reduce the number of prisoners currently held on restricted regimes with a view to ensuring that all receive, as a minimum standard, out of cell time of 3 hours per day, to engage in exercise or activity.<br/><br/><b>Table 1.
