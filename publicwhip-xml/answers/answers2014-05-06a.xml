It points to the need for significant State investment to ensure delivery of next generation broadband outside of principal urban areas.</p><p>  The CEDRA report makes a number of recommendations regarding the provision of next generation services to rural areas. The strategy for the State intervention under the National Broadband Plan which I announced on 25 April is very much in line with the recommendations of the CEDRA report. I outlined the key elements of the strategy in reply to Priority Question No. 5 on today's Order Paper. I believe that this strategy, which involves a major telecommunications network build out to rural Ireland with fibre as a foundaton for future proofed broadband services, will definitively address current connectivtiy challenges being experienced in rural areas. It also provides a solution capable of scaling up over multiple platforms and responding to new developments and will ensure that speeds can increase in line with demand, a key point referred to in the CEDRA report.</p><p>  I fully share the concerns outlined in the CEDRA report about the quality of broadband in rural areas. It is my intention to deliver a solution which will ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas. In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, the Government is reaffirming its commitment to addressing current connectivity challenges in a meaningful and sustainable way and recognises that quality and reliable broadband is a necessity for a 21st century economy and society.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-06a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050600053#WRA01000"><p>Ireland manages salmon stocks on an individual river basis. This management is carried out by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), the State Agency with statutory responsibility for inland fisheries under the 2010 Inland Fisheries Act. The individual river management strategy is based on the fact that each of Ireland&rsquo;s 143 salmon rivers has its own unique stock of salmon which migrates to sea as juveniles and returns to the same river in adulthood to spawn and create the next generation of fish exclusive to that river.</p><p>  IFI is supported in its management of salmon stocks by a statutorily based Standing Scientific Committee on Salmon (SSCS) comprising scientists from IFI, an Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM), the Loughs Agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Marine Institute, the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI- Northern Ireland) other State bodies and third level institutions. This independent scientific committee assesses and offers advice on the predicted stocks status in all 143 Irish salmon rivers each year against that river's Conservation Limit using the most recent five years of available data from the catchment. The Conservation Limit is the number of adult salmon required on each river to maintain a healthy population, the stock level that maximizes the long-term average surplus. </p><p>  IFI also undertakes an extensive programme of patrol and protection of the fisheries resource, in gathering data on stock status and in seeking to improve angling potential and develop angling tourism. In 2013, IFI is currently involved in projects funded to the value of over &euro;9M in research on and enhancement and development of the inland fisheries resources and habitats with many projects active in the area of wild salmonids. IFI also administered projects under the Salmon Development Fund to the value of almost &euro;400,000 primarily through supports to angling clubs and federations.</p><p>  The Atlantic salmon is a protected species under the EU Habitats Directive and Ireland&rsquo;s current salmon management regime complies with the requirements of this legislation. The conservation imperative means that exploitation of salmon from each river is only permitted where the independent scientific committee determines that the stock in that river is above its conservation limit. The annual advice of the SCCS is available on the website of IFI.  For 2014, based on the scientific advice, of the 143 rivers assessed, 57 rivers are open to exploitation of a harvestable surplus, 30 are open to catch and release angling only and 56 are closed to all activity. Each of these rivers will be reviewed again as part of the annual scientific assessment later this year in contemplation of management measures for 2015.</p><p>  Commercial harvest fisheries are only allowed on individual river stocks which are shown to have a surplus of fish over the Conservation Limit. Fisheries in estuaries may also be permitted where the stocks from individual rivers entering the estuaries are each meeting their individual conservation limits. District Committees comprising commercial and angling stakeholders as well as IFI and BIM have been established to discuss the sharing of any surplus available for exploitation.</p></reply>

That Memorandum demonstrated our shared interest in developing the opportunity to export green electricity from Ireland to Britain. A key objective was to realise the potential for investment, jobs and growth. An agreed programme of work was put into place with work-streams across several areas.</p><p>  Economic analysis conducted by my officials, with significant inputs from ESRI and NewERA indicates that under agreed policy and regulatory conditions, renewable energy trading can deliver significant economic benefits to Ireland and the UK, and would also be attractive to commercial investors and developers.  However, progressing to an Inter-Governmental Agreement on renewable energy trading would require any IGA to be designed in a manner that would work for both countries. In that regard, the UK side is not yet in a position to take certain key decisions regarding quantity of energy to be procured, the regulatory treatment of Irish assets, the structure of subsidies to Irish developers and the resultant financial flows. </p><p>  Following further discussions since the Summit between the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Cameron in early March, I am confirmed in the view that given the economic, policy and regulatory complexities involved, and the outstanding decisions to be taken by the UK, delivery by 2020 of an IGA to facilitate energy export is not now a realistic proposition.  While it has not been possible at this time to conclude an agreement, I do believe that in the context of a European Internal Energy Market, greater trade in energy between Britain and Ireland is inevitable in the post 2020 scenario.</p></reply>

ComReg is independent in the exercise of its functions and is accountable directly to the Oireachtas in accordance with Section 34 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002.   The investigation of any alleged unlicensed radio transmissions including any subsequent remedial actions is a function of ComReg and I have no function in this matter.</p><p>  The Government has appointed retired High Court Judge John Cooke to conduct an Independent Inquiry into Reports of Unlawful Surveillance of the Garda Ombudsman Commission and to report within eight weeks or as soon as may be thereafter. The Terms of Reference, which were agreed by Government on the advice of the Attorney General, are in the public domain, and include a review and assessment of any evidence of a security breach or attempted security breach at the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.

The strategy will set out the actions required to optimise the contribution that a sustainable bioenergy sector could make to the achievement of the 2020 renewable energy target for Ireland. A strong bioenergy sector could also make important contributions to a wide range of Government policy objectives, from agriculture through to environment policy and the strategy will draw on contributions from various government departments and agencies, as well as other stakeholders.</p><p>  Central to the strategy is the continued support for the significant policies already in place. The Biofuel Obligation Scheme will continue to be the primary means through which Ireland will meet its 10% target for renewable energy in transport. Additionally, the Biofuel Obligation Scheme has the potential to incentivise production of indigenous biofuels. The REFIT schemes will continue to support the generation of electricity and Combined Heat and Power from a range of biomass feedstocks.</p><p>  The analysis underpinning the strategy is that an additional bioenergy-focussed measure in the heat sector represents the most cost effective means of meeting a number of different policy goals. It is intended, therefore, subject to Government approval, that the strategy will incorporate targeted and cost effective measures to stimulate demand for biomass-fuelled heat.  I intend to establish a cross-departmental steering group to oversee the implementation of the actions arising from the bioenergy strategy. Having such a group in place would also serve a dual purpose of maintaining a high visibility and profile for the sector as well as being a vehicle to facilitate constructive engagement between all the relevant actors. I intend, also, to have the group examine the potential for cost effective deployment of biogas and biomethane to help meet our renewable energy targets.  The strategy will also set out a series of actions to support the cost effective supply of biomass from indigenous sources.</p></reply>

Competitiveness, security of supply, and sustainability, as well as energy policy&rsquo;s potential to support economic growth and job creation, will be the key pillars of the Green Paper which I expect to publish next week.</p><p>The energy policy landscape has undergone considerable change since the Energy Policy White Paper was published in 2007. The Green Paper provides a useful overview of the very significant developments that have taken place since then including billions of euro of investment in generation, transmission, distribution, supply, energy efficiency, renewable energy and new technologies. Other important developments including retail market competition, the Single Electricity Market, the development and commissioning of the East West Interconnector, renewable energy investment initiatives, energy efficiency incentives, and key policy documents are also referenced in order to set the scene for public consultation. The paper also points to developments at EU and international level that are having a direct impact on the Irish energy landscape.</p><p>The Green Paper sets out six energy policy priorities as follows:</p><p>- Empowering Energy Citizens;</p><p>- Markets and Regulation;</p><p>- Planning and Implementing Essential Energy Infrastructure;</p><p>- Ensuring a Balanced and Secure Energy Mix;</p><p>- Putting the Energy System on a Sustainable Pathway; and</p><p>- Driving Economic Opportunity.</p><p>There will be a full public consultation process on the Green Paper during which interested parties will be invited to submit their views which will form a key imput to the development of a new Energy Policy Framework in the form of a White Paper. It is my intention to publish the Energy White Paper around the end of this year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-06a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050600053#WRA02100"><p>I wish to acknowledge at the outset the contribution of the independent radio sector in bringing diversity to the airwaves, and serving the needs of communities, often at a very local level. That said, however, it needs to be borne in mind that these stations were established as commercial entities.  Station owners sought and accepted licences on clear terms; terms which included a limited amount of &lsquo;public service&rsquo; type content. Moreover, in many cases, their success in the licence application process was assisted by the voluntary commitments they gave in regard to the provision of public service type content, over and above that required by the relevant legislation.</p><p>  The licences were accepted in full knowledge of the current system of public funding. The fact that some of these stations are now undergoing a degree of financial stress is regrettable and a cause for concern but it does not mean that the State should step in and provide funding &ndash; they are and remain commercial enterprises.  The rationale for providing State funding for the Public Service Broadcasters is to provide an independent and reliable income flow that allows these corporations to attain their statutory public service objects while ensuring they can maintain editorial independence. This is especially important in the context of news and current affairs.</p><p>  Over the last number of years, there have been calls from a wide range of media organisations in relation to the future distribution of licence fee funding. Before considering any wider distribution of public funds than that which applies at present, I would have to be convinced that such a distribution would represent a sound proposition in terms of policy for the sector and would not be to the ultimate disadvantage of our Public Service Broadcasters.  Even if I were minded to provide public monies to private investors, EU State Aid rules would apply. It is categorically not possible for the State to simply decide to fund a set of incumbent licence holders during a licence period.</p><p>  Additionally, the independent radio stations receive a significant amount of publicly funded support from the Broadcasting Funding Scheme. This Scheme is currently funded by way of a set proportion of net television licence fee. The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) is assigned responsibility under Part 10 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 for the administration of the Scheme.</p></reply>

In that role it provides scientific advice to my Department regarding the most up-to-date status of species under its brief.  Sea trout, bass and salmon are all managed as recreational angling species. All three are highly valuable angling species and provide the basis for significant employment and associated revenue generation in the angling tourism sector throughout Ireland.</p><p>  IFI manages salmon stocks on an individual river basis as each of Ireland&rsquo;s 143 salmon rivers has its own unique stock of salmon. IFI is supported in its management of salmon stocks by a statutorily based Standing Scientific Committee on Salmon comprising scientists from IFI, Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM), the Loughs Agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Marine Institute, the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI- Northern Ireland) other State bodies and third level institutions. IFI carries out extensive monitoring of salmon stock status which feed into the the scientific committee's assessments carried out every year. Sea trout greater than 40cm length are managed under the same regulations as salmon. </p><p>  The offshore and inshore salmon and sea trout commercial fisheries were closed in 2007 in order to comply with the EU Habitats Directive. A &euro;25M Hardship Scheme was established for fishermen. While the scheme was administered by BIM, I understand that the average payment under the scheme was almost &euro;23,000 and the highest payment was over &euro;195,000. Conditions of the scheme included that nets had to be verifiably decommissioned and those availing of the Scheme would not be entitled to a licence in the future. </p><p>  Commercial harvest fisheries are currently permitted on individual river stocks which are shown to be meeting their conservation limit. Fisheries in estuaries may also be permitted where the stocks from individual rivers entering the estuaries are each meeting their individual conservation limits. The current management approach allows Ireland to meet its international and national obligations in terms of salmon conservation and operate sustainable harvest fisheries (commercial and recreational) where this is feasible.</p><p>  The steep decline in bass stocks in Ireland in the mid-1970s resulted in a severe deterioration of the renowned Irish bass angling resource. Ultimately the decline led to the cessation of the commercial fishery in 1990 via the Bass (Conservation of Stocks) Order, 1990. Since then bass, which are at the extremes of its European distribution in Irish coastal waters, have been regarded solely as an angling species and are restrictively managed largely on a catch and release basis.</p><p>  Since 1990 Ireland has applied the precautionary principle in relation to management of Irish bass stocks and has concentrated on measures to enable the rebuilding of the severely depleted stock. Recent advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) is that data are insufficient in the wider Northeast Atlantic Area, which includes Ireland, to evaluate the status of bass and that, on a precautionary basis, catches should not be allowed to increase. The current advice states that Irish bass are slow growing and discrete and the stock is highly dependent on suitable environmental conditions for successful recruitment.</p><p>  IFI is currently delivering on its bass research programme, which seeks to provide greater insight into the ecology and biology of bass to support long-term bass sustainability. The outputs from this research and associated annual monitoring will, in the future, provide scientific advice to support the future management and conservation of Ireland&rsquo;s bass stocks. The current Irish management model is regarded as being progressive by many observers and there are no data to warrant any change in the management approach. I am advised that the focus should be to continue observing the precautionary principle and collecting better quality data on stock status as consistently advocated by ICES for all species as a fundamental policy approach.</p><p>  There are three species of mullet in Irish waters; the most abundant and common is the grey mullet. Grey mullet is also a popular recreational angling species which is sought after by specialist recreational anglers. I am advised that stock status is unknown as there is no formal stock assessment and no evaluation of mullet stocks by ICES in the north east Atlantic. Like bass, mullet are slow-growing, long-lived and late-maturing fish. In the absence of formal assessment I am advised by IFI that the precautionary principle is recommended. Opening up a fishery on stocks with an unknown status presents the possibility of over-exploitation without any measure of current sustainability.</p></reply>

I have no direct statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.</p><p>The CER, in 2006, approved a network connections policy which enabled reassessment of the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network. In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite. The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.  This policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recouped through the actual economic consumption of gas and the associated tariffs. Uneconomic projects would increase costs for all energy consumers.</p><p>Under the CER&rsquo;s policy framework, Bord G&aacute;is Networks, and latterly Gaslink, carried out a comprehensive review of towns not connected to the national gas network. Gaslink published its New Towns Analysis Phase 3<i></i>report in 2010.  The study included a review of the feasibility of connecting 11 towns in the West and North West region which are the focus of the Western Development Commission paper, &ldquo;Why Invest in Gas?&rdquo;. However, the Gaslink review found that none of the towns qualified for connection on economic grounds. Gaslink will continue to review the towns which did not qualify for connection under the 2010 Study as well as other towns. The key factor which would qualify a town or group of towns in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, usually as a result of the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.</p></reply>

Performance against this target is regularly monitored by my Department and I will be publishing an update to the NEEAP in the coming months. To achieve this target, my Department works with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and the Office of Public Works (OPW) to develop, enhance and embed good energy management practices in the public sector. Action number 20 of the second Action Plan states: &quot;<i>We will work with public bodies to fulfil their exemplar role with respect to building energy efficiency</i>.&quot;</p><p>As part of delivering that goal we have committed, inter alia, to: developing an inventory of public sector buildings; requiring that Display Energy Certificates are prominently displayed in all buildings that are occupied by public bodies over certain defined thresholds; and requiring that all new buildings occupied and owned by public bodies from December 2018 be nearly zero-energy buildings. I intend to underline and reinforce the Government's public sector energy efficiency ambitions by bringing forward a Public Sector Action Plan on Energy later this year.  The Public Sector Action Plan on Energy will bring a greater impetus and strategic focus to ensure that the 2020 33% energy saving target is met.</p><p>The OPW manages the central government stock of buildings and they already have a register of the buildings they own and lease, which includes detailed energy usage information on about 250 of the larger buildings. This register includes central government buildings, some agencies and Garda stations.  In fulfilment of our obligations under article 5 of the Energy Efficiency Directive, OPW calculated the equivalent annual savings that would be achieved if 3% of the floor area was retrofitted and proposed using the &quot;alternative approach&quot; to achieve our energy saving requirements under the Directive, which in practice is an expansion of their successful <i>Optimising Power at Work</i>campaign, to targeted buildings in the wider public sector. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform allocated &euro;9m over three years to the OPW in Budget 2013 to expand this campaign. </p><p>There is also an obligation on all public sector organisations to report annually on their energy consumption. SEAI maintains a database of the public sector&rsquo;s energy usage and tracks each individual organisation&rsquo;s progress towards the 33% target. Although initially focussed on the top 135 energy-using public bodies, in time the objective is to include all 440 public bodies. Public bodies insert their electrical and gas meter numbers and SEAI gets the annual consumption for them for these energy uses. The database contains 40,000 meter numbers and is growing. Each public body receives an annual scorecard to show their progress. This database is being developed with linkages to the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) and will lead to better procurement of energy supplies for the public sector. A report on public sector energy consumption will be published later this year. </p><p>Under the Social Housing Investment Programme, funding is provided by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to local authorities for a wide range of measures aimed at improving the social housing stock. Over the course of 2011 and 2012, the Department of the Environment&rsquo;s retrofitting programme focussed exclusively on the refurbishment of vacant properties with the objective of returning as many of these to productive use. Over that period, some &euro;52.5 million was recouped to local authorities and some 4,774 properties were improved.</p><p>Phase 1 of the Energy Efficiency scheme (Fabric Upgrade-phase 1) commenced in June 2013 and targeted the improvement of insulation standards and overall energy performance across 30,000 social rented properties and continues in 2014. It is envisaged that all Phase 1 works will be completed in 2014 and funding drawn down by year end.  In 2014, a new measure with funding of &euro;15 million was announced which will be invested in bringing vacant and boarded-up local authority houses back into productive use. In this context, local authorities were recently advised that funding of up to &euro;30,000 per dwelling will be provided for a suite of retrofitting works to bring vacant properties back to a high standard.</p></reply>

My Department has also organised and delivered cyber exercises across all Government Departments and critical infrastructure providers in the energy and telecommunications sectors to test and coordinate responses to cyber security challenges. This is an ongoing activity which takes into account the ever changing nature and challenges associated with computer security.  For reasons of operational security, it would not be appropriate to provide any further details regarding this matter.

This will be achieved by providing a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. For example:</p><p>- Eircom is rolling out a &euro;400m investment in a Next Generation Access Fibre Network that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps. Service is already available to over 800,000 addresses, with planned coverage to reach 1.4m addresses by 2016.</p><p>- UPC has invested over &euro;500m in upgrading its cable network. Over 700,000 homes can already access minimum broadband speeds of 120Mbps and up to 200Mbps. Businesses can access speeds of 500Mbps.</p><p>- ESB is engaged in a new project allowing a fibre network to be rolled-out on its existing electricity infrastructure. It is understood that discussions between ESB and Vodafone to form a new Joint Venture Company are at an advanced stage. The company has initial plans to construct a fibre network directly to 450,000 premises outside of Dublin and it is expected that details will be announced over the coming weeks.</p><p>- Mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile broadband services following ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction. There has also been continued investment by all operators in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements.</p><p>- Fixed wireless operators are continuing to invest in high speed point-to-point wireless broadband.</p><p>- The broadcaster Sky has entered the broadband market, increasing choice for consumers.</p><p>My Department does not hold any records of the number of residential premises in Ireland, nor would it hold an accurate number of those that would have broadband in excess of more than 30Mbps now or by end of 2016. I note however that the ComReg quarterly report for the period Q3 2013, found that over 35% of the 1.7m broadband subscribers in Ireland are now subscribing to services over 30Mbps. </p><p>Under the national mapping exercise that is being undertaken as part of the National Broadband Plan information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA). Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing. The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines. Of the estimated 2.3m premises in Ireland, approximately 1.4m are expected to be served by these commercial next generation broadband services over the coming years. </p><p>This accelerated roll out of high speed services by the commercial sector means that the addressable area required by the State intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. The speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. </p><p>On 25th April, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as a cornerstone of its investment under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way.  Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build-out will also ensure that fibre is deployed to strategic locations on each route such as schools, business hubs and health facilities. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the comprehensive mapping process currently underway. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. The list is available on my Department's website . </p><p>In tandem with the fibre build-out, the Strategy will include measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services, and the provision of access services in the most remote areas where fibre rollout may be insufficient to stimulate commercial investment or may be cost-prohibitive.  Intensive design work is ongoing in the Department with a view to publishing an end-to-end implementation strategy later this year, together with the outcome of the mapping exercise which will identify the areas that require intervention. A full public consultation will take place once the strategy is published and EU State Aids clearance will be required for the intervention strategy once finalised. It is expected that the detailed procurement process will take place in 2015 with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services as quickly as possible.</p><p>It is my intention to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by ensuring an end-to-end market intervention with fibre as a core component. In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, the Government is acknowledging that broadband is the key infrastructure of the 21st century.</p></reply>

Through the programme, we have made a significant contribution to development and the fight against poverty and hunger in Ethiopia. In the past decade, the country has recorded remarkable improvements in human development as measured by the UN Human Development Index. This progress is an example of the success of international development assistance when delivered in partnership with a developing country Government.  It is our strong position that positive development results and respect for human rights must go hand in hand, and we are working with the Government to build good governance, and the institutions which can protect the rights of all citizens, including the most vulnerable. </p><p>  The Government monitors the human rights situation in Ethiopia through our Embassy in Addis Ababa and in cooperation with our EU partners.  Through the Embassy, I am aware of the situation of the individuals referred to by the Deputy, which has also be the subject of a recent report from Amnesty International.  The people involved were arrested in 2011 and, following a trial, imprisoned in late 2012. I understand that several months ago they were moved from Ziway prison south of Addis Ababa, to Kaliti prison on the outskirts of the capital city, reportedly after a doctor in Ziway referred the two men for hospital treatment. However, since the transfer, the men have apparently been denied access to a hospital. </p><p>  Oromia is one of the nine regions in Ethiopia, accounting for approximately 35% of the total population of the country.  Officials from my Department have on previous occasions met with representatives from the Oromo people in Ireland to discuss the concerns of the Oromo people which centre on boundary disputes with the central Government and the displacement of Oromo communities.</p><p>  Our Ambassador in Addis Ababa has raised the situation of the two political opposition leaders with the International Committee of the Red Cross, which investigates such cases on a confidential basis.  He and other European Union Ambassadors met recently with the Prime Minister of Ethiopia and urged him to invite the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, to Ethiopia to examine these and other cases.  At the same meeting, the Irish Ambassador encouraged the Prime Minister to sign and ratify the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.  The Convention grants diplomats rights of access, subject to terms, to their citizens in detention.</p><p>  We will continue to work in cooperation with our EU partners to raise human rights issues with the Ethiopian Government and to improve the situation on the ground through our engagement with Government, NGOs and local communities and through our development assistance programme.</p></reply>

Together with our EU partners, we have emphasised the importance of a negotiated political settlement.</p><p>  We strongly support the agreement reached in Geneva on 17 April between the EU, Russia, Ukraine and the US.  It sets out concrete steps to de-escalate tensions and restore security for all citizens.  The EU has made it clear that all parties to the agreement must ensure that its terms are fully implemented, including by using their leverage on illegal armed groups to end all violence and provocation and hand in their arms.</p><p>  Presidential elections in Ukraine are scheduled for 25 May 2014 and will be monitored by the OSCE.  Ireland has already sent a member of the election observation roster maintained by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to participate as a long term observer on the OSCE monitoring mission.  As stated in previous replies to Questions on this issue, we have also undertaken to put forward a substantial number of short term observers for the mission.  The OSCE requested nominations for short term observers at the start of April, with a deadline of 5 May 2014.  The European External Action Service has also asked EU Member States to nominate short term election observers for the OSCE mission.  On this basis all members of the election observation roster were invited to express an interest in participating as short term observers.  </p><p>  In line with the commitment already given, we are putting forward a total of eighteen nominees to participate as short term observers in the OSCE mission.  As with all such missions, nominees were selected in line with the OSCE&rsquo;s requirements for short term observers.  Consideration was also given to the length of time since serving on an election mission, and all applicants were asked to confirm their availability for a second round of elections, should it prove necessary.  The nominees being put forward to the OSCE are a mix of roster members with previous experience in Ukraine, roster members who have observed missions elsewhere, together with a number of new members of the roster, which came into effect last year.  I expect that the OSCE will complete the approval process for nominees in the coming days.  At that point, I will arrange for the full list of approved observers nominated by Ireland to be provided to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the Code requires a regulated financial institution to make full disclosure of all relevant material information, including all charges, in a way that seeks to inform the customer.  Paragraph 6.9 of the Consumer Protection Code refers specifically to cases where a regulated financial institution offers a personal consumer the option to move from a tracker interest rate to an alternative rate on the existing loan. As well as the information provision, the paragraph also requires that a specific warning is issued in circumstances where a personal consumer will not be allowed to revert to a tracker interest rate if that consumer moves to an alternative rate.</p></reply>

However, in recogntion of the peak in house prices, the relief is still available for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage between 2004 and 2008. This relief will continue up to and including the 2017 tax year.  In addition, rent relief was abolished in Budget 2011 for new claimants. Existing claimants will see a gradual reduction in the amount of tax relief available with a complete cessation of relief in 2017.</p><p>  In relation to rental property, section 97(2)(d) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for a deduction in computing taxable rent in respect of the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property.  As the Deputy will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones. The Deputy will also appreciate that I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the significant budgetary constraints.  Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

The Register was populated using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue's own databases, the Local Government Management Agency database and data from various utility companies. The various data sets were cross-checked by Revenue to ensure the accuracy of the information in respect of each property being included on the Property Register.</p><p>  However, given the scale of the project it was inevitable that there would be some errors and in a small number of instances properties were either duplicated, or omitted from, the Property Register. Revenue clearly indicated this possibility in all of its communications in regard to LPT and stressed that in such circumstances the onus was on the property owners to make contact and provide the correct details.</p><p>  In regard to the specific case to which the Deputy refers, the person in question received correspondence on a number of occasions since the commencement of LPT but failed to engage with Revenue until now, to advise that the LPT had been previously paid by another family member. A duplicate record had been registered on the basis that two versions of the address, Terrace and Crescent, were in use for the particular property and the person in question was associated with one of the records.  Revenue has now confirmed that the duplicate record has been removed from the LPT Register and that the 2013 LPT return has been filed and paid for both 2013 and 2014 and that the Household Charge has also been paid in respect of the relevant property. </p></reply>

They should then contact the owner or, in the case of enforcement, the appointed receiver/administrator.</p><p>NAMA, like other lenders, is precluded from disclosing details relating to its debtors and their properties but a full listing of NAMA-related properties subject to enforcement is available on the NAMA website, .  This listing includes contact details for the appointed receiver/administrator.  If a Deputy has a query about a specific NAMA property, they can contact NAMA on .

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-06a.127.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050600056#WRD00300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 and 159 together.</p><p>Under EU law which governs non-life insurance, an insurer is required to inform the regulator in its home Member State (its home regulator) that it intends to pursue business in another Member State.  The home regulator must then provide the host regulator with a certificate attesting that the insurer covers the EU Solvency Capital Requirement, as well as the nature of the business which the insurer intends to undertake.  The insurer may start to pursue business from the date that the certificate is communicated to the host regulator, in this case the Central Bank of Ireland.</p><p>Setanta Insurance Company Limited (&quot;Setanta&quot;) is a Maltese incorporated company which was both authorised and prudentially supervised by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA).  While its financial position is not supervised by the Central Bank of Ireland as the Central Bank has no role in that regard, the firm is supervised by the Central Bank for conduct of business rules, i.e. consumer protection obligations.  The Central Bank is in ongoing contact with the Malta Financial Services Authority in relation to Setanta Insurance Company Limited, the impact on policyholders and the provision for relevant and appropriate information, particularly in relation to claims.</p><p>Setanta was regulated at EU regulatory level in accordance with a directive known as Solvency I which currently places requirements on the amount of regulatory capital European insurance companies must hold against unforeseen events.  I understand that Setanta met its EU regulatory obligations and under EU law is therefore entitled to trade across EU borders.  Following negotiations that were completed at European level in November, 2013, a new regime known as Solvency II will commence on 1 January 2016, which will further strengthen the EU regulatory framework.  The Solvency II EU Directive sets out new, stronger EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the key aim of increasing policyholder protection.  The new regime will also ensure greater cooperation between supervisors.</p><p>My Department and the Central Bank will be reviewing the circumstances relating to Setanta and will be reporting to me on what lessons can be learnt and how the framework can be strengthened.  The European Commission have indicated that it will review whether any issues raised relating to the regulatory framework require action.  On 16 April, 2014, Setanta determined that the company was insolvent.  This means that Setanta does not have sufficient funds to be able to honour its full obligations towards claimants, policyholders and other creditors.  Setanta was formally placed into liquidation by the MFSA following a meeting of the creditors which took place on 30 April, 2014 where a liquidator, Mr Paul Mercieca, was appointed.  The meeting was attended by a representative from the MFSA, who advised the Central Bank of Ireland on developments.</p><p>While the position on each policy is for the liquidator to decide in due course, policyholders will be given cancellation notification during which period cover will remain in force.  While policies will remain valid until the required notice period has been served, it is important to be clear that the amounts due under any claims may not be fully recoverable in all circumstances.  The Central Bank has written to over 230 brokers and firms who were offering policies from Setanta Insurance to consumers to require them to immediately contact any Setanta policyholder and inform them of the urgency to make alternative motor insurance arrangements.</p><p>Claims on personal insurance policies will be payable from the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF).  Claimants will be eligible for 65% of the amount due or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser.  Under Section 3.6 of the Insurance Amendment Act 1964 (as amended) first party claims by a body corporate or unincorporated body are not covered by the ICF.</p><p>The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland (&quot;MIBI&quot;) is a non-profit-making organisation which was established by Agreement between the Government and those companies underwriting motor insurance in Ireland.  The principal role of MIBI is to compensate innocent victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles.  If, for legal reasons, MIBI is not in a position to accept a claim, these third party claims will be eligible to proceed for consideration by the High Court for compensation from the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF).  The ICF is subject to the limit of 65% of the amount due or &euro;825,000, whichever is the less.  The refund of premiums for commercial and personal insurance policies is not covered by the ICF or MIBI.  A portion of the premium refunds may, however, be available upon completion of the Setanta liquidation.  Until otherwise advised those policyholders which have been affected by the collapse should continue to contact to Setanta Insurance Services Limited at 0818 255 255 (if calling from outside Ireland +353 1 897 6300or on .</p></reply>

This will bring the number of detector dog teams to 17, and the Revenue Commissioners consider that that complement will provide the requisite support for their work in detecting and seizing illegal drugs and tobacco products and cash.

I have also been in contact with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in these matters. </p><p>  There are potential tax implications arising from the disposal of single farm payment entitlements, mainly capital gains tax (CGT) and VAT. I have no discretion under EU law to provide for a VAT exemption on the disposal of the payment entitlement assets. Having considered the matter, however, I was prepared to provide for an exemption from CGT on any chargeable gains arising from the disposal by the owners of payment entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme where all of those entitlements were leased out in 2013 and where the owners, because of the change in CAP regulations, were advised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to transfer their entitlements to an &quot;active&quot; farmer by 15 May 2014. I made an announcement to this effect last week.</p><p>  I propose to include appropriate provisions to give effect to the CGT exemption in Finance Bill 2014 which will be published shortly after Budget 2015 in the Autumn. While the CGT due on any chargeable gains arising from the disposal of farm payment entitlements made by 15 May would have to be paid in the normal course by 15 December 2014, the Revenue Commissioners have indicated that they will not require such payments to be made pending the passing of the Finance Bill and the coming into law of the relevant CGT amendments to be included in that Bill.</p></reply>

The Commissioners have confirmed that they received additional files from the LGMA in 2013 to assist in identifying further properties that had paid the charge or, in respect of which a waiver or exemption from the charge had been granted. I am also advised that since then there has been extensive on-going engagement with the LGMA to ensure all the relevant Household Charge data held by them has been forwarded to the Commissioners. </p><p>  A comprehensive data matching exercise was undertaken by Revenue which identified a database of some 400,000 properties for which the Household Charge (HHC) was outstanding. Work on the database is continuing according as property owners contact Revenue.  It is accepted that the database may not be 100% accurate for a number of reasons, including:</p><p>  -  The LGMA Register captured the name of the person who paid the HHC rather than the owner of the property, therefore, for example, where a son or daughter paid the HHC on behalf of a parent and particularly where the address of the property was a 'non-unique' rural address, Revenue may not have been able to match the HHC payment to the right property.</p><p>  -  The legislative basis for both the HHC and LPT are different. Some properties that are liable for LPT were exempt from the HHC and, unlike LPT, property owners were not actually required to make a claim for exemption from HHC.  For that reason, Revenue could not identify every property that was exempt from HHC through the cross-referencing process.</p><p>  In all its communications with property owners during the current compliance campaign, the Revenue Commissioners have highlighted that these inconsistencies exist and have outlined the action that owners need to take if the HHC is not due.  The Commissioners have confirmed that as part of their Household Charge compliance campaign they are currently writing to some 227,000 property owners who, according to their records, have not paid the &euro;200 arrears in respect of about 273,800 properties.  The letter advises property owners to log in to the LPT/Household Charge arrears online system on the Revenue website and make arrangements to pay the &euro;200 arrears, or update their Household Charge arrears record to confirm they have paid the charge or are exempt, or entitled to a waiver, from the charge. Owners who require assistance or who are not the liable person for the Household Charge are being advised to contact the LPT helpline on 1890 200 255.</p><p>  Where a liable person ignores the letter, payment of the LPT/Household Charge arrears will be pursued, where necessary, using the range of collection/enforcement powers at Revenue's disposal which includes mandatory deduction at source from salary, various occupational pensions or from certain Government payments.  I am also informed that since taking on responsibility for Household Charge arrears in July 2013, about &euro;7.6m has been collected by the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

While Ireland applies a zero VAT rate to printed books including atlases, children's picture, drawing and colouring books and books of music, by virtue of a derogation under the VAT Directive for such exceptional treatment, there is no option under EU VAT Law to either exempt e-books from VAT or to apply the zero VAT rate or a reduced VAT rate to such products.</p><p>  The different VAT treatment of printed books and e-books reflects the nature of these products, the latter being a richer product often providing content beyond simple text to include embedded digital music, software, film and internet links. While it is possible to reduce the standard rate on e-books to below 23%, such a reduction would, under EU VAT Law, have to apply to all goods and services at the standard VAT rate, which would be excessively costly to the Exchequer.</p></reply>

Where, in the opinion of the CBI, the state of the ICF is such that financial support should be provided for it, it determines an appropriate contribution to be paid to it by each insurer calculated as a percentage, not exceeding 2% of the aggregate of the gross premiums paid to that insurer in respect of policies issued in respect of risks in the State. </p><p>Funds from the levy are collected from insurers by the Revenue Commissioners and these funds are transferred on a monthly basis to the ICF. The total amount transferred to the ICF is as follows:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total received </th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;45,565,922.16</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;65,697,953.38</td></tr><tr><td>2014 (up to 1st May 2014)</td><td>&euro;15,099,263.28</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro;126,363,138.82</td></tr></table>The above total has been collected by the Revenue Commissioners from the ICF levy. &euro;60,950.37 has been deducted to cover the set up costs and annual administration costs of collecting the levy.</p><p>The ICF levy was previously introduced on 1 January 1984 following the collapse of PMPA in October of the preceding year. The 2% levy was paid by all non-life insurers at this rate until 31 December 1991 and a reduced levy of 1% applied for the period 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1992, when it was discontinued as sufficient moneys had been collected to successfully complete the administration of the former PMPA.  In the last ten years &euro;1,118m has been paid out of the fund broken down per year as follows:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total advanced from the ICF</th></tr><tr><td>2004-2010</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;320m</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;488m</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;310m</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro;1,118m</td></tr></table>The balance between the amount paid out of the ICF and that paid into the fund from insurance policies is made up of existing cash in ICF, receipts following the completion of the Icarom and Primor administrations and advances from the Exchequer.</p></reply>

As a result of the review, qualification allowances were abolished with effect from 1st February 2012. Department of Education and Skills Circular 0008/2013 outlines the effect of this decision on teachers. The circular was agreed under the auspices of the Teachers' Conciliation Council, a body established in accordance with the terms of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for Teachers. The Council is composed of representatives from the teacher unions, school management, the Department of Education and Skills and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, chaired by an official of the Labour Relations Commission.</p><p>  In paragraph 12 of Circular 0008/2013 an exception is made in the case &quot;where as at 5 December 2011, a teacher in employment on that date and eligible for receipt of a qualification allowance in respect of the post they held on that date, was actively undertaking a course of further study leading to an additional qualification, provided that the teacher does not cease to be a registered student on that course before its completion. Such individuals may apply to the Department/VEC as appropriate for a derogation from the general position within 3 months of the date of receipt of the award.&quot;</p><p>  As the person concerned was not a teacher in employment in an Oireachtas funded post on 5 December 2011 and not eligible for receipt of a qualification allowance in respect of any teaching post on that date, they do not qualify for payment of an allowance in respect of the qualification related to the course being undertaken at that time. Since the 2012/13 school year, access to the Supplementary Panel is no longer based entirely on the length of a teacher's service. In order to be placed on the Supplementary Panel for the 2014/15 school year, teachers must meet the eligibility criteria, including scale point and earnings requirement, set out in Circular 0057/2013.  The teacher referred to by the Deputy failed to meet the criteria and so is ineligible for the Supplementary Panel for the 2014/15 school year.</p></reply>

Children with special educational needs may be enrolled in a mainstream school and attend all mainstream classes and receive additional teaching support through the learning support and-or resource teacher. If they have assessed care needs they may be supported by a Special Needs Assistant (SNA).</p><p>In respect of children who cannot be accommodated in mainstream education, they may be enrolled in special classes or special schools where more intensive and supportive interventions are provided. Special schools offer specialist supports for pupils with special educational needs from 4 to 18 years of age. Students attending special schools are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios ranging from 6:1 to 11:1, on the basis of each school's pupil profile. Students attending special schools also have access to SNA support, specialist transport arrangements and assistive technology support, as necessary.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools details that there are 119 special schools nationwide, with approximately 7,094 students attending such special schools in the 2012/13 school year.

The existing provision for 10,575 posts has been increased to 10,965 posts being made available for allocation by the end of 2014.  This will bring to almost 11,000 the number of SNA posts available to work with children who have an assessed care need requiring SNA support in primary, post primary, and special schools.  These extra posts will ensure that the Government's policy of ensuring that every child who is assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to such support.</p><p>  In June 2011, the Department of Education and Skills published a Value for Money and Policy Review of the SNA scheme. In May 2013, the National Council for Special Education published its Policy Advice on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools.  Both reports concluded that the SNA scheme has been highly successful in supporting the care needs of children with special needs in schools and with assisting to facilitate their integration and inclusion. However, the reports also concluded that the intended purpose of the scheme was not always generally well understood by parents or schools and that the scope and purpose of the scheme should be clarified for schools.</p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills accordingly prepared a new Circular for schools, which was designed to clarify the scope and purpose of the SNA scheme, in accordance with the recommendations of the reports and policy advice noted above.  The circular therefore should not be interpreted as a means to reduce the numbers of SNAs in schools.  It is considered that this Circular will provide useful guidance and support for schools and parents in clarifying the purpose of the scheme and setting out the circumstances in which SNA support will normally be provided to assist children with special educational needs to access education.</p><p>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that all applications for July Provision will be processed in the order of date received. It is therefore in the best interest of parents to submit their completed application form as soon as possible.  If parents of eligible children have questions on the scheme they may contact my Department on 090 6484296.</p></reply>

It is a matter for each individual school to determine which particular measures are most suited to its individual circumstances and to how the school concerned organises teaching and learning.  The circulars (PC 13/05 and M35/05) and the report of the Working Group on the Weight of School Bags are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.</p></reply>

Providers must have regard to the Criteria and Guidelines published by the Teaching Council, the statutory body with responsibility for the regulation of the teaching profession. All ITE Programmes are subject to ongoing review by the Council in accordance with the Criteria. It is the aim of the Council that teachers are competent to teach in the different teaching environments and are prepared to be lifelong learners continually adapting to enable them to support their students in achieving their full potential. Graduates from primary ITE Bachelor of Education courses are recognised to teach in all primary schools.</p><p>  Policy on the programmes, interventions and supports for children in education is a matter for my Department. Decisions in this regard are informed by evidence based research and advices received covering a range of matters including pedagogy, school curriculum, special educational needs and child development. The role of the SESS is to attend to the training needs of teachers on foot of these decisions. In selecting and developing suitable programmes, the service is guided by advices from my Department, aegis bodies of the Department where appropriate, relevant research and best practice.</p><p>  The SESS has developed the Contemporary Applied Behaviour Analysis (C-ABA) Course under the direction of Dr Patsy Daly. This course provides an introduction to ABA for practising teachers in special education settings in Irish schools. The course trains teachers to 'design, implement and evaluate' interventions to change the behaviour of students in their care.  My Department is satisfied that research does not support the exclusive usage of any one approach as a basis for national educational provision for children with autism. It is for this reason that the preferred policy is for a child centred approach based on the individual child's needs. It is important that children have access to a range of approaches so that their broader needs can be met. While ABA helps to improve behaviour, other approaches, such as Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) are just as important in developing children's communication and speech skills.</p></reply>

Applied Behavioural Analysis, or ABA, is one of the approaches used in special classes for children with autism.</p><p>  The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions is particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues. My Department supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use.  Other approaches, such as Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) are also used in developing children's communication and speech skills. It is important that children have access to a range of approaches so that their broader needs can be met. As children differ significantly from one another and as children's needs vary and change over time, it is not possible to impose a method or approach that will work for all children with autism. It is not the practice to issue a circular on each approach used in the classroom setting.</p><p>  As outlined in my previous response, in accordance with the Education Act 1998, the Board of Management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school with the responsibility of operating the school efficiently and effectively. In line with the Act the principal teacher is responsible for the day to day management of the school including the guidance and direction of the teachers and other staff.  Furthermore my Department's inspectorate has a role in evaluating, advising and supporting schools in all aspects of teaching and learning.</p><p>  The NEPS service to all schools, including schools where there are ASD classes, is progressed through the Continuum of Support Guidelines which encompasses a graduated problem solving model of assessment and intervention. NEPS service is planned and delivered following planning meetings in schools where needs are prioritised. In addition to case work, NEPS supports schools in developing more systemic and preventative approaches to meeting the needs of pupils with SEN in line with priorities highlighted in the planning meetings.  Therefore there is not  one person or organisation who has responsibility for the implementation of ABA in the classroom.</p></reply>

These supports in addition to appropriate departmental circulars and guidelines ensure consistency in practice without the need for a specific project plan for these schools.</p><p>  The comprehensive system of continuing professional development (CPD) for teachers in the area of special educational needs including teachers of children with autism is provided by the Special Education Support Service (SESS).  The SESS specifically targets schools with newly approved autism classes for support and continues to provide on-going support through CPD. The NCSE local network of Special Educational Needs Organisers provide support to schools in relation to the establishment of special classes. SENOs may support schools by meeting with Principals to provide information on the resources and supports available for schools which may include, for example, access to specialist staff training. SENOS liaise with NEPs personnel at local level, where appropriate, to inform Principals.</p><p>  The NEPS service to all schools, including schools where there are ASD classes, is progressed through the Continuum of Support Guidelines which encompasses a graduated problem solving model of assessment and intervention.

In addition to case work, NEPS supports schools in developing more systemic and preventative approaches to meeting the needs of pupils with SEN in line with priorities highlighted in the planning meetings.</p><p>  My Department's inspectorate has a role in evaluating, advising and supporting schools and the Deputy may be interested in their evaluation of educational provision for children with autism spectrum disorders which is available on my Department's website www.education.ie.

All public servants are being asked to do more with less and the teachers in our small schools cannot be exempt from this requirement.  It should be noted that the threshold of 20 pupils for a two teacher school is significantly below the threshold of 28 pupils that operated up to the late 1990s.  There is also an appeals process available to small schools to give them an opportunity to have their staffing based on their projected pupil enrolments for September 2014.</p><p>  Our current configuration of small primary schools has been examined by the Department in a value for money (VFM) review. This review took account of the ethos of schools and the locations of small schools relative to other schools of a similar type.  I am currently considering the findings of this review in consultation with my Government colleagues and I intend to publish the report on completion of this consideration process.</p><p>  In accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, it is the responsibility of individual school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools. The Statement should identify potential hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate provision in place to safeguard the safety and health of employees and pupils. The Health and Safety Authority in conjunction with the Kilkenny Education Centre issued guidance to all primary schools in relation to managing safety, health and welfare.  These guidelines were developed following consultation with relevant stakeholders and include some specific guidance for a one-teacher setting.

This included about &euro;1.5 billion to fund the proposed new Public Private Partnerships (PPP) programme.  Since then, two PPPs (Schools Bundle 3 and the N11/Newlands Cross roads PPP) which had been included in previous programmes reached financial close in November 2011 and April 2012 respectively and are in construction.  The successful closure of both these projects, which had been delayed due to the global credit crunch, were key enablers in re-opening the Irish PPP market. </p><p>  The first project in the new PPP programme has also been successfully closed.  Last month, on 30 April, myself  and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport signed a contract with a consortium to construct the M17/M18 Gort to Tuam PPP Scheme which will create up to 450 jobs, boost local economies in the west and ease congestion.  This is the largest of the projects in the programme and work has commenced on the delivery phase of the project with completion targeted for end 2017. </p><p>  The procurement process is underway on the remainder of the programme with the projects expected to reach financial close during 2014 and 2015.

However, drafting legislation that cuts across the conventions of contract law and, in particular, to intervene in private agreements between individuals is not undertaken lightly.  The mechanisms required for the successful delivery of the legislation are complex and, although similar legislation operates in other jurisdictions, aspects of the Act such as the panel of adjudicators must be carefully considered to ensure the Act will operate as intended.</p><p>  Two further steps are necessary for the operation of the legislation prior to its commencement.  The first, a comprehensive code of practice for the conduct of adjudication, has been the subject of consultation with key stakeholders.  The final draft of the code of practice was circulated to stakeholders in March.  The second element requires the establishment of a panel of adjudicators and a chair of that panel to be appointed.  The chair of the panel will appoint an adjudicator where parties to a payment dispute (that has been referred to adjudication under the Act) fail to agree on an adjudicator between them.</p><p>  Officials in my Department are working on the details of the structure for the panel, its set up and operation and this will shortly be circulated to stakeholders for consultation.  Once this process is concluded, applications for the panel will be advertised and when the appointment process to the panel is complete the Act will be commenced.</p></reply>

The report concluded that while the economic justification of this proposal was not strong, it did merit further investigation.</p><p>  A Design Report on the Mannin Cross Scheme was commissioned by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and completed in 2000.  The proposal identified the need for a flow control structure at Parkslevbaun Lough in Pollnagarragh East to confine flood waters to the immediate area, and a route was identified for a drainage channel to discharge the excess waters into the Aggard Stream which flows into the Dunkellin River.  The report concluded that if the scheme were implemented, it would have a significant impact on the Aggard stream and on the Dunkellin River and was therefore, considered not to be feasible at that time. </p><p>  A further review of the South Galway Flood Study was carried out on behalf of OPW in 2010.  This concluded that in order to advance the substantive works involved in the Mannin Cross Scheme, an assessment of the addition capacity needed on the Aggard Stream and on Dunkellin River to accommodate the additional flows, must be made and that the scheme could not proceed in advance of the implementation of the proposed Dunkellin Flood Relief Scheme.</p><p>  The Dunkellin scheme is being advanced by Galway County Council with funding from the OPW.  It is understood that the Council intends to submit the scheme to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for consideration in early Summer.  It is not possible to indicate when works can be commenced until the scheme has been progressed through the planning process.</p><p>  With regard to swallow holes, it is OPW's view that works in the vicinity of swallow holes would be unlikely to improve local drainage in the Mannin Cross area.</p></reply>

Of the total amount being made available, up to &euro;19.6 million is available via the Office of Public Works (OPW) for the repair of damaged coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure.  The allocation of funding to local authorities under the Government Decision was to specifically address the repair of existing damaged infrastructure as a matter of priority.</p><p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (DoECLG) wrote to Kerry County Council indicating, based on the estimate submitted by the Council to that Department, that up to &euro;1,226,920 is being made available to the Council via the OPW to undertake the necessary repair works to damaged coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure.  The estimates submitted by Kerry County Council to the DoECLG included both repair and strengthening works to an embankment at Cromane Lower.  The strengthening element falls outside of the scope of the Government Decision and the Council will need to address this separately and outside of the current process aimed at repairs and emergency works. </p><p>  The Council must submit overall programmes of works to the DoECLG detailing how it proposes to spend the total allocation that is being made available.  The Council must also submit the relevant elements of its programme to each Department from whom funding will be made available for consideration of technical aspects of the proposed works.  When the Council's programme of coastal protection and flood defence projects is received by the OPW it will be reviewed having regard to related guidance issued by the DoECLG to the local authorities. </p><p>  The OPW has informed the local authorities that in order to assist them in a practical way and to avoid any potential cash-flow issues, it will consider requests for advance funding of up to 80% of the estimated cost of approved projects where a contract for works has been made.</p></reply>

The PAS operates under licence from the Commission for Public Service Appointments and is independent in its operations.</p><p>  As the Deputy notes, there has been a moratorium in place since 2009 which has severely curtailed recruitment into permanent positions, other than with critical replacements and key skills shortages.  There are no Civil Service Clerical Officer competitions or panels currently active due to the lapse of time since they were run.  The competition referenced by the Deputy was launched in 2007 and will not be revisited for offers of appointment at this stage.</p><p>  The Temporary Clerical Officer (TCO) campaigns being run each year have facilitated the filling of short-term vacancies/absences without conflicting with Government policy of reducing overall civil service numbers.  While a key aspect of this campaign has been the arrangements around Term Time absence, it has been more broadly focused in recent years to cover other time limited situations.</p><p>  The  TCO 2014 competition contains an enabling provision in the Information Booklet whereby temporary staff who have performed effectively may be given an opportunity to compete for a limited number of permanent positions.  This provision was inserted in recognition of positive feedback from Departments/Offices on the quality of appointees and also takes account of the effort and investment in bringing these staff to the required level of competence in their respective areas.  This arrangement is not designed to circumvent or to preclude the holding of an open Clerical Officer competition should my Department require it in line with workforce planning returns.</p></reply>

I addressed the opening plenary session at this conference alongside Minister Lebranchu, Didier Migaud, President of France's 'Cour des comptes' and Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office in the United Kingdom.</p><p>  The conference offered an excellent opportunity to discuss issues and ideas ranging from open democracy and open data, accessibility of data, the development of the open data ecosystem and the link between open data and innovation, with many practical and concrete examples being shared amongst participants and speakers from a wide range of countries.   The event was of significant relevance to my Department's work on the Open Government Partnership (OGP), which Ireland intends to achieve full membership of later this year.  Indeed, open data is core to Ireland's draft OGP Action Plan and to open government objectives in Ireland overall.  I believe that through open data and technology, we can empower citizens, bring them closer and allow them to participate more closely in decision-making.  Accessible data can promote greater citizen participation, increase transparency and accountability and enable new and innovative business opportunities, services and products.  I am strongly in favour of making information available and easily accessible online with a view to it being used by businesses and citizens alike. </p><p>  At the conference, Minister Lebranchu announced that France will sign up to the OGP and I very much welcome this announcement.  Participants came away from the conference with many concrete examples of open data being used on a day-to-day basis and with much food for thought.  I believe that this sharing of ideas will contribute to a greater understanding of the benefits of open data in both contributing to, and increasing openness and transparency in Ireland, and I look forward to hearing more discussion and debate on the benefits of open data at the OGP Europe Regional Meeting that I am hosting in Dublin Castle on 8 and 9 May.</p></reply>

Given that the Civil Service Departments and Offices rely on the CSSO for their own legal advice, there is a strong risk of a conflict of interest arising if the CPSA were also to seek legal advice from the CSSO and, as such, it would be entirely inappropriate for the CPSA to seek independent legal advice from the CSSO.  The contract for the provision of its legal services was awarded in December 2009 following a tender competition in which bids from 7 legal firms were obtained.  I understand that the CPSA is satisfied with the independent legal services which have been provided.  It should be noted that following the amalgamation of the Office of the Ombudsman with the CPSA, any future contracts negotiated for the provision of legal services for the Office of the Ombudsman will include any legal services requirements of the CPSA.</p></reply>

Included in the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposal is an Article (Indication of the Origin) which provides for mandatory &ldquo;made in&rdquo; labelling for non-food products.  The European Parliament and the EU Council, the co-legislators, have not yet addressed this jointly. </p><p>  While I am aware of some of the arguments made in support of this issue such a proposal would impose additional disproportionate costs on business, especially SMEs, because manufacturers often have complex supply chains and use components from a variety of EU and international sources. Trying to calculate the source and value of many components in a final product to determine country of origin would be a further administrative burden on business that is difficult to justify in the present climate.</p><p>  Furthermore, there is no evidence that mandatory &ldquo;made in&rdquo; labelling will enhance product safety or improve the functioning of the internal market, both of which are objectives of the Consumer Product Safety Regulation.  Indeed, the article concerned would add significantly to the administrative burden of market surveillance authorities in the State without giving consumers the protection that they need from unsafe products.  In addition there are likely to be associated Exchequer costs without clear offsetting benefits flowing to consumers. </p><p>  It is relevant to note that an earlier EU Commission proposal in 2005 for mandatory country of origin labelling was eventually withdrawn by the Commission due to lack of sufficient support across member states.  Food labelling is a matter for the Ministers for Health, and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></reply>

The voluntary registration of stillbirths is provided for in section 28 of the Civil Registration Act 2004.  The definition of a &ldquo;stillborn child&rdquo; is contained in section 2(1) of that Act and provides that a stillborn child means a child who, at birth, weighs not less than 500 grammes or has a gestational age of not less than 24 weeks and shows no sign of life.</p><p>  Registration of stillbirths was first provided for in the Stillbirths Registration Act 1994.  The definition of a stillbirth contained in that Act was carried forward to the 2004 Act.  When the 1994 Act was passed by the Oireachtas, detailed consideration was given as to what the most appropriate definition of a stillbirth should be. The position varies from country to country.  Some countries use gestational age only, while others use weight, or a combination of both.  Currently, there are no plans to amend the definition of stillbirth as provided for in the Act.</p></reply>

The allowance is subject to a means test and is paid only to those who live alone or with certain exempted people.

This allowance is subject to a means test for those aged under 70 and is also paid only to those who live alone or with certain exempted people.  In addition, a person living alone and in receipt of a pension, a widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s payment or a disability payment from the Department may be entitled to the living alone allowance of &euro;7.70 per week.  </p><p>  In terms of older people approaching pension age, if they are in receipt of long-term jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (15 months or more in payment) they may be entitled to fuel allowance.

I am not in a position to extend the criteria for these schemes or the current value of the allowances.</p><p>  It is recognised in the Government&rsquo;s Energy Affordability Strategy that the best way to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling.

Accordingly, Revenue asks people with &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers to change them once they need to engage with them on taxation matters.  While ordinarily such requests are made to my Department by the PPS Number holder themselves, there are occasions when it is done by a person&rsquo;s legal or financial representative (e.g., solicitor or accountant).  My Department will then purge the existing number and replace it with either a new number or a number that the individual may have had prior to marriage.  In all such cases the change is notified to the person concerned (not the legal or financial representative) by letter.  In this case the person concerned was notified by letter to their home address on 19 January 2011.  Since then a number of other communications containing the new PPS Number have issued from the Department to her at the same address.</p><p>  Following extensive checks of records available to the Department, I can confirm that no evidence exists of any fraudulent activity in relation to the identity of the person concerned or the PPS Numbers involved.  Finally, while it is possible for the Department to restore the person&rsquo;s old number, the potential for Revenue to ask her to replace it again in the future exists.  Officials from the Department are available to discuss the issues with the person concerned if required.</p></reply>

It is paid to around 616,000 families in respect of some 1.17 million children, with an estimated expenditure of around &euro;1.9 billion in 2014.  I am conscious that child benefit is an important source of income for all families.</p><p>  Child benefit as a &ldquo;universal&rdquo; payment is paid in respect of all qualified children up to the age of 16 years and reflects the situation whereby school attendance is a statutory requirement for children up to that age.  The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education or who have a disability.  For continued payment of child benefit, parents with school going children at age 16 and at age 17 have to submit a form to the Department, certified by the child&rsquo;s school or college, confirming that their children are in full-time education for each of these years.  I am satisfied that the requirement for school attendance for children aged 16 and 17 years in receipt of child benefit is an effective measure in terms of education and social protection policy. </p></reply>

Significant changes in pension policy have been introduced in recent years, particularly in relation to increasing State pension age and supporting the sustainability of defined benefit pension provision.    </p><p>  It is a priority for the Government to increase supplementary pension coverage and the Programme for Government includes a commitment to reforming the pension system to progressively achieve universal coverage, with particular focus on lower-paid workers.  Recent figures indicate that only half of workers aged between 20 and 69 years have a supplementary pension and this relatively low coverage is of major concern.  The sustainability of the pension system is a particular concern because of the demographic challenges faced by Ireland, the associated increases in pension (and other age related) costs, and the deterioration in the public finances.  This means that the task of financing future increased pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population as demographic projections indicate the ratio of working age to pensioners will decrease from 5.3:1 at present to 2.1:1 by 2060.</p><p>  The OECD Review of the Irish Pension System, which I published last April, provides an international perspective on Ireland&rsquo;s retirement-income provision.  It covers all components of the pension system: State, private personal and occupational plans, and schemes for public-sector employees. Whilst endorsing pension policy reforms undertaken to date, the report also makes a number of recommendations for future reform.  The OECD&rsquo;s key finding was that private pension coverage, both in occupational and personal pensions, is uneven and needs to be increased urgently and the review recommended that this could be done through a universal employment-based pension system.    </p><p>  While there are no plans, at present, to establish a commission on pensions, options in this area are actively being considered with a view to developing a road-map for the introduction of a comprehensive occupational pension scheme.</p></reply>

This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people. </p><p>  A range of services are available to persons who are unemployed but not in receipt of a social welfare payment. For example employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status.  Further, unemployed persons not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through ETB (formerly F&Aacute;S) training for unemployed people, but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course.  The Work Placement Programme is also open to persons not in receipt of a social welfare payment, although the participant will not receive a payment while on the programme.</p><p>  An unemployed person who does not qualify for a social welfare payment due to the assessment of their means may be eligible to sign for social insurance contribution credits.  Persons who sign for credits for three months (78 days) of the last six months are eligible to participate in the JobBridge programme.  There are no plans to make changes to these arrangements at present.  </p></reply>

While the relevant legislation excludes from the schemes students who are attending a full-time day course of study other situations, including online degree courses, must be examined individually to determine if participation is consistent with satisfying all conditions of the relevant scheme.  In this context, factors to be considered are the status of the course, i.e. full-time or part-time, and the overall level of commitment, including the time and possible expense involved, required by the course participant.  </p><p>  In general, it is considered that the level of commitment required to participate in a full-time course of education is not consistent with the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes requirement to be available for full-time employment and genuinely seeking such work.

ComReg operates a website to assist mobile telephone users in Ireland to identify the most competitively priced mobile telephone plans suitable to their needs. The ComReg site also offers advice on additional checks customers should undertake before moving from one provider to another, in order to avoid penalty payments for early cessation of services, as one example of the additional points customers should consider in their own interests.</p><p>ComReg also publishes quarterly data reports on developments within the electronic communication sector which include price comparisons across participating EU countries. The performance of service providers on mobile prices in Ireland varies across the different baskets considered. In the December 2013 report Ireland:</p><p>- ranks 7th lowest among the 21 countries benchmarked in the high user post-paid mobile basket, </p><p>- ranks 8th lowest priced out of the 21 benchmarked countries for the medium user post-paid mobile basket,</p><p>- ranks 3rd highest of 20 countries compared for the low user post-paid mobile basket, and </p><p>- ranks 5th highest among the 21 benchmarked countries in the pre-paid mobile basket.</p><p>The wide variation in performance across these different categories is indicative that consumer choice is exerting downward pressure on prices in categories where consumer price sensitivity is keenest. </p></reply>

This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and </p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. For example:</p><p>- Eircom is rolling out a &euro;400m investment in a Next Generation Access Fibre Network that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps. Service is already available to over 800,000 addresses, with planned coverage to reach 1.4m addresses by 2016. </p><p>- UPC has invested over &euro;500m in upgrading its cable network. Over 700,000 homes can already access minimum broadband speeds of 120Mbps and up to 200Mbps. Businesses can access speeds of 500Mbps. </p><p>- ESB is engaged in a new project allowing a fibre network to be rolled-out on its existing electricity infrastructure. It is understood that discussions between ESB and Vodafone to form a new Joint Venture Company are at an advanced stage. The company has initial plans to construct a fibre network directly to 450,000 premises outside of Dublin and it is expected that details will be announced over the coming weeks. </p><p>- Mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile broadband services following ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction. There has also been continued investment by all operators in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements. </p><p>- Fixed wireless operators are continuing to invest in high speed point-to-point wireless broadband. </p><p>- The broadcaster Sky has entered the broadband market, increasing choice for consumers.</p><p>Of the estimated 2.3m premises in Ireland, approximately 1.4m are expected to be served by these commercial next generation broadband services over the coming years. </p><p>This accelerated roll out of high speed services by the commercial sector means that the addressable area required by the State intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. The speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. </p><p>On 25 April, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way.  Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build-out will also ensure that fibre is deployed to strategic locations on each route such as schools, business hubs and health facilities. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the comprehensive mapping process currently underway. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. Currently I envisage that a total of 59 areas in County Kerry will be included in the proposed fibre build-out. The list is available on my Departments website .</p><p>In tandem with the fibre build-out, the Strategy will include measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services, and the provision of access services in the most remote areas where fibre rollout may be insufficient to stimulate commercial investment or may be cost-prohibitive. </p><p>Intensive design work is ongoing in the Department with a view to publishing an end-to-end implementation strategy later this year, together with the outcome of the mapping exercise which will identify the areas that require intervention. A full public consultation will take place once the strategy is published and EU State Aids clearance will be required for the intervention strategy once finalised. It is expected that the detailed procurement process will take place in 2015 with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in the areas that require intervention as quickly as possible. </p><p>The EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on state aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude member states from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. In this regard it is noted that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out a fibre-based broadband network in County Leitrim, which includes rolling out that service in Carrigallen by July 2016.</p><p>I fully share the concerns of local representatives about the quality of broadband in rural areas. I intend to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by ensuring an end-to end market intervention with fibre as a core component. In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, the Government is acknowledging that broadband is the key infrastructure of the 21st century.</p></reply>

The Better Energy Programme, which principally provides funding for energy efficiency measures, also provides grants for the installation of solar panels. The Renewable Heat Deployment Programme (ReHeat), Greener Homes Scheme and the CHP Deployment Programme, previously provided grants but are now closed and residual payments were made in 2011.  Since 2011, SEAI has administered the Electric Vehicles Grant scheme which provides grants of up to &euro;5,000 towards the purchase of new electric vehicles. These grants are in addition to the VRT reliefs of up to &euro;5,000 which apply to electric vehicles.</p><p>The principal supports for the deployment of electricity generation from renewable sources are the current REFIT and former AER schemes which are not subsidised by the Government. These are funded through the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy, which is paid for by all electricity consumers.  The supports for biomass CHP under REFIT 3, along with the requirements of Part L of the Building regulations, contribute to increasing the uptake of renewable heat.  Details of the grants provided through SEAI for renewable energy for the years 2011 to 2013 (excluding energy efficiency grants) are set out in the table.<table><tr><th>-</th><th>2011 (million euro)</th><th>2012 (million euro)</th><th>2013 (million euro)</th></tr><tr><td>ReHeat Programme (residual expenditure)</td><td>0.332 </td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>CHP Deployment (residual expenditure)</td><td>0.376 </td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Greener Homes (residual expenditure)</td><td>4.590</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Better Energy (Solar grants only)</td><td>0.934</td><td>1.742</td><td>1.292</td></tr><tr><td>Electric Vehicles</td><td>0.198</td><td>0.768</td><td>0.242</td></tr></table></p><p>In terms of supporting renewable transport fuels, the Biofuel Obligation Scheme has, since 2010, obliged all road transport fuel suppliers to include a certain proportion of biofuel in their overall fuel mix. </p><p>It is also noteworthy that the ESB, through its ecars programme, is continuing to roll out both publicly accessible charging infrastructure and domestic charge points to support the uptake of electric vehicles. ESB Ecars also promotes the use of electric vehicles and just recently launched the Great Electric Drive to give 26 members of the public and six commercial organisations the opportunity to trial an electric car for up to four months each.</p></reply>

In addition, I have written to my Government colleagues, including the Minister for Social Protection, to encourage them to consider what assistance their Departments might be able to give for the stimulation of new business for the post office network.</p><p>  I see a strong future for the network by using its existing strengths to remain a significant player in the provision of Government, financial and other services. Securing the future viability of the post office network in the longer term will entail the network continuing to modernise, as it is doing, to provide the services that its customers require. Any such developments would need to be subject to competition and public procurement requirements as appropriate.</p></reply>

In subsequent D&aacute;il debates I stated my intention to seek further independent expert advice on the &ldquo;fitness-for-purpose&rdquo; of Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal terms, such expert advice to focus on what level of fiscal gain is achievable for the State and its citizens and, equally important, on the mechanisms best suited to produce such a gain.</p><p>  In March of this year my Department appointed Wood MacKenzie to provide expert advice on the fitness for purpose of Ireland's fiscal terms for oil and gas exploration, development and production.

The evidence presented by the number of active mineral prospecting licences indicates that the minerals development legislation is adequate in regard to the incentivisation of interest in minerals exploration activity. In the event of a commercially viable discovery being brought into production, companies are entitled to have the allowable exploration expenditure set-off against their tax liability. It has also been possible to agree a satisfactory return to the exchequer from on-going mining activities within the existing statutory framework. I do propose, however, to publish a new minerals development bill this year that will consolidate, modernise and further streamline the exploration and mining regulatory process.</p></reply>

Ireland is currently heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels to meet our energy needs. While it is acknowledged that fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix for some time to come, progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy in our generation portfolio. The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources. Provisional figures for 2013 show that 20.5% of electricity demand was met from renewables.</p><p>  To date wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. Provisional figures for 2013 indicate that 16.4% of electricity demand was met by wind generation. At the end of 2013, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was 2,300 MW. It is estimated that a total of around 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target. Currently, over 3,000 MW of renewable generation has taken up connection offers under the Gate 3 grid connection programme. </p><p>  With regard to other renewable energy technologies, my Department is currently in the process of finalising a national bioenergy strategy, which will be published shortly. It will set out the actions required to optimise the contribution that energy from biomass could make to the achievement of the 2020 renewable energy target for Ireland. </p><p>  Furthermore, the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP), which I published in February this year, identifies the opportunity for Ireland of realising the potential of our offshore energy resources for increasing indigenous production of renewable energy, thereby contributing to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and improving the security of our energy supply. The Strategic Environmental Assessment carried out for the OREDP found that it would be environmentally sustainable for 4,500 MW of offshore wind and 1500MW of wave and tidal devices to be developed in Irish waters in the period to 2030. </p><p>  EU Member States are currently considering an energy and climate change framework for 2030 in pursuit of a low carbon economy by 2050. Following the recent publication by the European Commission of its proposal for a 2030 Climate and Energy Framework, my Department is undertaking analysis to establish the scale of the contribution Ireland can make to the achievement of the proposed EU renewable energy target of 27%, while also ensuring that any action taken would not give rise to unintended consequences, particularly from a competitiveness perspective.</p></reply>

This dependency underlines the immediate and long term imperatives of enhancing energy security, reducing price volatility and ensuring energy sustainability. National energy policy objectives are in line with overall EU policy objectives and are informed by the critical work of the International Energy Agency (IEA) on all aspects of energy security.  Electricity and gas costs in Ireland are influenced by various drivers, including wholesale gas prices, the cost of capital, exchange rate fluctuations, the small size of the Irish market, geographical location and low population density. Wholesale gas prices are by far the most significant factor with prices rising since 2009 driven by events in the Middle East, North Africa and Japan and the significant growth in demand from China and India.</p><p>  Currently, almost all of Ireland&rsquo;s gas comes from the UK. Figures published by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) in February 2014, show that around 49% of our electricity was generated using gas in 2012. While the UK is not heavily reliant on Russian gas, a shortfall in the supply of Russian gas could potentially result in an increase in the wholesale price of gas on the continent, including in Ireland. However, in Europe generally there are supplies of storage gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) available and there is lower gas demand over the summer period. Gas flows consequential on any such supply disruptions and wholesale price rises are difficult to predict. My Department is continuing to monitor the Ukraine situation in close co-operation with other EU Member States.</p><p>  Detailed operational plans are in place to deal with any unexpected short term disruption to gas supplies. In the unlikely event of a major gas disruption, EirGrid and Gaslink would implement their respective emergency plans to deal with the situation. In terms of oil imports from Russia, in 2013 Ireland imported only a very small quantity of gasoil and no other petroleum products or crude oil. As such, the crisis in Ukraine would not have a direct impact on Irish oil supply. There are a number of EU Member States that directly import oil from Russia by pipeline and these Member States would stand to be directly impacted in the event of a reduction in oil supplies. </p><p>  Ireland is a founding member of the IEA which was established to improve international oil security. The IEA continues to keep the situation in the Ukraine under review, as does the EU. In terms of prices, Ireland is a price taker in the global fossil fuel market. In the event of reduced international oil supply, it is likely that international oil prices would rise which could ultimately impact on consumer prices.</p><p>  In terms of long term plans for energy security, Ireland&rsquo;s approach is to diversify fuels and supply sources. The use of indigenous gas and access to Liquefied Natural Gas storage would enhance diversity. Continuing to develop indigenous renewable electricity is also a key strategy in ensuring supply diversity. Currently over 20% of electricity is generated from renewable sources and supports are in place to ensure we attain our target of increasing this to 40% by 2020. In addition, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, funded and assisted by my Department has, over the past decade, been proactive in maximising energy efficiency. Several successful initiatives have been undertaken while new initiatives are also being considered which will further improve the efficiency of energy consumption, thus reducing our consumption (including consumption of imported energy) and contributing to security of supply.</p></reply>

Following on from this, a number of measures, including restricting the number of posters per candidate and the display of posters in designated areas only, were pilot-tested during the 2009 Local and European Election. Local authorities were canvassed for their views on these measures.Several local authorities indicated that any restriction on the number of posters per candidate would be difficult to police effectively. There were also concerns that restricting the number of posters per candidate would favour larger parties with several candidates running, while restricting the number of posters per party would disadvantage candidates with running mates. Furthermore, there were concerns that any such measures would disadvantage first-time candidates and thus interfere with the democratic process. Other concerns included the diverse geographical nature of constituencies, e.g. small urban versus large rural electoral districts.</p><p>  As a result, no measures were introduced to restrict the number of posters at that time. However, section 19(7) of the Litter Pollution Act 1997 was amended by the Electoral (Amendment) (No.2) Act 2009, to introduce a 30-day time limit prior to an election taking place, during which election posters can be displayed. Prior to this amendment, the relevant legislation had required that election posters be taken down within 7 days of an election but provided no time limit for the period prior to an election within which posters could be displayed. While not dealing directly with the number of election posters on display, this legislation ensures that posters are only displayed for a finite and reasonable period.</p><p>  For the reasons outlined, I have no plans to restrict the number of election posters permitted at this time. However, I understand that, under section 95 (14) of the Road Traffic Act 1961 which falls within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the erection of posters on directional signs and traffic light poles is an offence, if such posters obscure the visibility of the signs or obstruct the view of public road users so as to render the road dangerous to them.</p></reply>

The Act provides the main regulatory framework for the private rented residential sector and provides for security of tenure. The grounds upon which a tenancy in the private rented residential sector may be legally terminated are clearly set out in the 2004 Act. It also specifies minimum obligations for both landlords and tenants under a tenancy.   </p><p>  In accordance with the terms of the Scheme local authorities retain the responsibility to source further accommodation for a RAS household should the dwelling that the household is living in become unavailable through no fault of their own.  Local authorities, with the cooperation of the tenants, will make every effort to source alternative accommodation as quickly as possible. In seeking replacement accommodation a local authority will attempt to source a suitable alternative within or close to the area in which the tenant is residing. However that may not always be possible because of scarcity of suitable properties available to let in the areas affected. In all cases, not just where a tenancy is under threat, there is no bar on RAS households from sourcing alternative accommodation themselves, if they so desire, as long as the local authority is satisfied that the accommodation meets the needs of the household and conforms to standards for rental accommodation which are set out in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. </p><p>  An Inter-Departmental Working Group was established to advise the Government on the appropriate method for addressing affordability issues which may arise with the introduction of domestic water charges. This includes the examination of issues arising for those with specific medical conditions that require high water usage.  The Government has decided today, following consideration of proposals in relation to the funding model for Irish Water and taking account of the work of the Inter-Departmental Working Group, to provide a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply. The Government has also decided to provide for an additional free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as child benefit, such that water charges will in effect only apply to adults in such households. The normal consumption is estimated at 38,000 litres annually per child of water supplied and waste water treated and so the allowance being provided will be up to 38,000 litres per annum. This level of consumption will be verified over time through actual data from metering.</p><p>  The Government has also decided that charges will be capped for those customers with particular medical conditions which necessitate high water usage. These decisions will be communicated to the CER through a Ministerial Direction issued in accordance with the Water Services (No.2) Act 2013.  The CER will announce its decision on the approved water charges plan in August 2014. In making its decision on the approval or otherwise of the first water charges plan, the CER will take into account the decisions made by Government on the funding model for Irish Water and the approach to be taken to charging.</p></reply>

In the case of water services, under the provisions of the Water Services Act 2007, household pipes internal to the boundary of a property are considered the responsibility of the householder, and thus water meters are being fitted at the stopcock at the boundary of the property. As this is located on publicly accessible land, it minimises disruption during the installation programme and in terms of meter reading in due course, as access is not required to people&rsquo;s homes. The meter boxes are not sealed and can be opened to allow the householder to read their meter, if necessary. Meters will be read automatically and the information will be provided directly to customers in their bills.  Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that all of the water metering contracts are fully compliant with the Disability Act 2005 and that the water meters in use by Irish Water comply with the Measuring Instruments Directive.  In all customer communications, Irish Water asks any householders with any disability, mobility or medical concerns to contact its call centre (1890 278 278) in advance of the meter installation so any additional support or advice can be arranged.    </p><p>Irish Water will not need to reset water meters to zero for October 1st 2014.  The meters used in the domestic water metering programme maintain a record of the reading at midnight on the last day of each month.  This provides Irish Water with an accurate month end/month start cumulative consumption on an ongoing basis. These month end records will be collected each time the meters are read.   </p><p>To assist the homeowner in the identification of any leaks Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that water meters being installed as part of the metering programme have a &ldquo;constant flow&rdquo; alarm which alerts Irish Water who will in turn alert the affected homeowner. Householders with a meter installed will be provided with a reading of their meter as part of their bill and any unusual usage patterns can be discussed with Irish Water if the householder is concerned.  As part of the metering programme, my Department, in conjunction with Irish Water, is currently working on a proposal regarding customer-side leakage.   </p><p>In common with meters for other utility services, the meters will be the property of Irish Water which will also be responsible the repair and maintenance of the meter.  Section 74 of the Water Services Act 2007 provides that it is an offence to damage or otherwise impair a water meter.  I would also like to inform the Deputy that Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.  They may be contacted via email to or by telephone on 1890 278 278.</p></reply>

The DEC was valid for a period of 12 months and needed to be updated and renewed on an annual basis.   </p><p>Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings (recast) repealed and replaced the original Directive and is transposed in Ireland by the <i>European Union (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2012</i>which came into effect on 9 January 2013. Under the new regime, the requirement in respect of DECs is revised to include all buildings with a total useful floor area of greater than 500 m<sup>2</sup>and which are frequently visited by the public. The floor area threshold is to be reduced to 250 m<sup>2</sup>from 9 July 2015 for buildings occupied by public bodies.   </p><p>Under the DEC scheme, buildings are assessed by appropriately qualified assessors who have registered with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. Having regard to a building&rsquo;s actual energy consumption in the preceding 12 months, a rating scale of A to G applies, with A-rated buildings being most energy efficient and G-rated buildings least efficient.   No minimum energy rating is specified but it is anticipated that building owners will take steps to improve a building&rsquo;s performance over time, particularly where the potential for cost effective improvements exist.   </p><p>Compliance with all statutory obligations, including DEC requirements, under the <i>European Union (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2012</i>is, first and foremost, the responsibility of building owners or, in the case of public bodies, the administrative head of each public body.   Public bodies have been notified of their statutory obligations by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland which has been designated as the Issuing Authority under the Regulations and is responsible for the day to day administration of the DEC scheme.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland report that there are currently in the region of 60 valid DECs in place.   </p><p>An EPBD Implementation Group meets on a regular basis to monitor progress in relation to the ongoing implementation of the recast EPBD in Ireland, to oversee the operation of the Building Energy Rating scheme and to co-ordinate and plan for future developments in relation to the energy performance of buildings. The EPBD Implementation Group is comprised of officials from my Department, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.

Responsibility for enforcement of minimum standards rests with local authorities. </p><p>  The revised standards in the 2008 Regulations were based on a review of minimum standards dating back to 1993 which tolerated very basic facilities such as external toilets, cold water only and having an open fireplace as the only heating source. Minimum standards are necessary as a protection to all consumers and especially to the most vulnerable who may not be in a position to protect themselves adequately.</p><p>  The purpose of Article 6 of the Regulations is to ensure that each rental property has exclusive access to its own sanitary facilities and that those facilities are contained within the dwelling unit.  Article 7 relates to effective heating which can be independently managed by the tenant, while Article 8 provides for sole access to adequate facilities for the hygienic storage, preparation and cooking of food. The objective of the revised standards is to improve the quality of accommodation in this part of the housing market by providing for clean, safe and secure facilities.  It should be noted that the 2008 Regulations came into effect generally on 1 February 2009 but allowed a generous four year phasing - in period to facilitate any improvement works that needed to be carried out in respect of Articles 6, 7 and 8.  Landlords affected by these changes should have engaged with their tenants during this time to discuss the implications of any works that needed to be carried out on their properties.</p></reply>

This new scheme is being designed so as to bring all of the social housing services provided by the State together under the local authority system, with local authorities being responsible for all households with an established housing need and ensuring significant efficiencies in the provision of rental assistance.  On 30 April 2014, Government approved the publication of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 which will, when enacted, provide the legislative framework for the introduction of HAP.  My Department and the Department of Social Protection continue to work closely on the legal, policy and operational issues involved in developing and introducing HAP.</p><p>  HAP will provide a new framework for the provision of rental assistance, and will support the removal of existing barriers to employment by allowing HAP recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment. In that context a household which is eligible for HAP will, having sourced appropriate accommodation, pay a rental contribution to the local authority based on the differential rent scheme for the relevant local authority. The local authority differential rent scheme is an income based scheme which relates the amount of rent a household must pay to the household&rsquo;s income and therefore their ability to pay. The planned introduction of a harmonised rents framework coupled with a phased reduction in rental assistance will go some way towards providing additional security to households in the early stages of returning to employment.</p><p>  Following an administrative and statutory pilot phase in 2014 which involves 7 local authorities, roll out to the remaining local authorities is scheduled to begin on a phased basis in 2015. It is intended that the pilot and implementation phase will prioritise, as much as is possible, the transfer to HAP of long-term unemployed rent supplement recipients, or those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.</p></reply>

A household that refuses two reasonable offers of such tenancies in any twelve-month period, other than an offer made under the choice-based letting procedure, will not receive any further offers from any housing authority for a period of one year from the date of the second refusal and the latter period is not subsequently reckonable for the purposes of determining the household&rsquo;s relative priority for another social housing tenancy. An offer is deemed to be reasonable where the dwelling concerned would, in the opinion of the authority, meet the housing needs of the household and, except in an emergency, is located in an area of choice specified by the household.</p><p>  The 2011 Regulations also empower a housing authority to adopt a choice-based letting approach to the allocation of social housing, whereby a housing authority considers allocating a particular tenancy only to households that have applied for that tenancy. A household that refuses a tenancy offered under choice-based letting will not be entitled to apply for another tenancy under that system for a period of one year from the date of its refusal.  My Department does not collate information on the number of, or reasons for, refusals by households of offers of social housing tenancies.</p></reply>

As agreed by the key stakeholders, the course of action now being pursued by Dublin City Council is the refurbishment of the Priory Hall complex, with support from the Government, in a manner that will make the complex a desirable, high quality, safety assured residential location that will accommodate, as with the original development, a combination of private, social and other forms of housing.</p><p>  An implementation group, chaired by Dr Martin McAleese, has been put in place to oversee the effective implementation of all aspects of the agreed Framework. The implementation group includes representatives of both former residents and buy-to-let owners, thereby ensuring that all of the Priory Hall homeowners are fully engaged and fairly treated. While the implementation group is actively progressing all aspects of the framework and is understood to be making good early progress, the overall resolution framework remains at a relatively early stage of delivery.  However, I also understand that Dublin City Council has made good progress in surveying the individual apartment units at Priory Hall in advance of the necessary remediation works and that a competitive tender process for procuring remediation solutions has been publicly advertised in recent weeks.</p></reply>

My Department, together with the Garda authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has examined the feedback obtained during the review process, as well as related issues arising from the broader process of local government reform. In this context, the Deputy will be aware that as part of the process of local government reform the existing town councils will be replaced as part of a new model of governance, and it follows that this will have implications for the number of JPCs in the future.</p><p>  Under the terms of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, JPCs operate in each local authority area. Therefore, with the reduction in local authority areas as a result of local government reform JPCs will remain in city and county areas only. I should point out that a feature of the feedback received during the recent review of JPCs was that the number of committees needed to be rationalised to ensure that they maintained a proper focus on strategic policing issues.</p><p>  As part of the present JPC review process and in consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Garda Commissioner, I will take account of all relevant developments in local government structures with a view to ensuring that the structures which support local policing are as effective as possible. I can advise the Deputy that recommendations concerning revisions to the JPC guidelines are at an advanced stage of preparation.</p></reply>

Details in respect of each category are as follows:</p><p><b><i>Criminal Legal Aid</i></b></p><p>Total expenditure on Criminal Legal Aid for 2012 came to &euro;50.5 million, a reduction of 10% over 2011 (&euro;56.1million).  This reduction in the annual expenditure is the largest ever recorded and represents a fall of approximately &euro;10 million, or 16%, over the peak recorded in 2009.</p><p>Under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal aid themselves.  The 1962 Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  Criminal prosecutions originate in the District Court and if so satisfied, the Judge will grant a criminal legal aid certificate.  I can inform the Deputy that the District Courts granted 49,639 certificates in 2012.  However, as more than one certificate may be granted to any one person, it is not possible to provide a figure for the total number of persons provided with criminal legal aid.</p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that in relation to the request for the ten largest amounts paid for individual cases, my Department's computer records are not kept in such a manner as to allow for this information to be extracted without requiring a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort.  This could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.  With regard to information sought in relation to the average cost of legal aid, given that expenditure in 2012 was &euro;50.5 million and the number of certificates granted was 49,639, the approximate average cost was &euro;1,017.</p><p>An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for the granting of criminal legal aid under the Act and consequently the information sought by the Deputy in respect of the number of persons who received criminal legal aid on more than one occasion is not available.  Records are not kept in a manner which would allow for the extraction of information showing the number of times a person has been granted criminal legal aid.</p><p><b><i>Civil Legal Aid</i></b></p><p>In respect of civil legal aid, this is provided by the Legal Aid Board, an independent State agency. Persons availing of civil legal aid pay a contribution towards the service, with some exceptions, so it is not a free service per se. Exchequer funding is provided by way of a grant-in-aid to the Board. In 2012, this grant amounted to &euro;32.922 million and this increased to &euro;33.759 million last year. The service is primarily provided through the Board's law centre network and by its own solicitors, although private practitioners on the Board's panels are engaged to provide a complementary service by the Board, mainly in District Court family law matters.  Overall in 2012, civil legal aid was provided in some 17,652 cases, of which 9,962 involved court representation.  For civil legal aid, information on the most expensive cases is not readily available due to the nature of the Board's operating model.  Whilst it is not unusual for an applicant to access civil legal aid services more than once, particularly in family law matters, applicants do not tend to be in receipt of civil legal aid repeatedly. It should be noted that each and every application for civil legal aid is subject to a means test and a merits test, in line with the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, and the associated Regulations. Figures in respect of persons in receipt of civil legal aid more than once in a year are not available.</p><p>Further details can be found in the Board's 2012 Annual Report, available at www.legalaidboard.ie.</p></reply>

The first is where the details are provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na prior to submission of an application for a summons in respect of the offence. Where the driving licence number is so collected, the driving licence number is sent electronically to the Courts Service with the summons application and the licence number is updated to the Courts Service computer system. Under the second method, the details are collected by the Court Registrar where a licence is produced to the Court at the hearing of the offence.  As outlined above, if the licence is produced,  the Court Registrar records the licence number and the number is updated to the Courts Service computer system.  If the accused is convicted of the offence, the details of the conviction and the associated driving licence number are subsequently sent electronically to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for the application of penalty points.</p><p>  The Courts Service has indicated that It is not possible to differentiate between the two methods above to provide statistical data in relation to the number of driving licence numbers actually collected within a Court. My Department is in contact with the Courts Service with a view to examining an adjustment to the method of recording such that the number of licences produced in court can be established.</p><p>  I am informed that where an accused is summonsed to appear before a court in respect of a penalty point offence and is convicted of the offence, if a driving licence is not produced to the Court, the Court Registrar records on the Court Minute Book or on the summons that no driving licence was produced. The non-production of the driving licence is recorded whether or not the accused appears before the Court. The Courts Service computer system does not currently support the updating of data in relation to the non-production of driving licences in court.</p></reply>

A report detailing the findings of an inspection by Limerick County Council on 16 January 2013 was received by my Department on 4 April 2013. This report detailed breaches of cross compliance requirements in relation to Nitrates Regulations and the requirement to maintain lands in Good Agriculture and Environmental Condition.</p><p>  The breaches under the Nitrates Regulations were reported in relation to the maintenance of records, the inadequate collection of soiled water, livestock manure and organic fertiliser and the stockpiling of farmyard manure on land in breach of regulations governing buffer zones. The breaches were deemed serious and intentional resulting in a 60% penalty being determined.</p><p>  The inspection report also detailed a breach relating to the requirement to maintain lands in Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition due to evidence of poaching of lands. This resulted in a 5% penalty being determined. However as a similar breach had been recorded at an inspection in 2012 rules regarding repetition were applied which resulted in a 15% penalty being recorded.</p><p>  Overall, these breaches resulted in a 75% penalty being applied against the 2013 Single Payment Scheme. The person named was notified of this decision on 16 May 2013. The person named appealed this decision and was notified of the outcome of the review, which was to uphold the original decision, on 6 February 2014.  The person named has appealed this outcome to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office and that office will be in contact with the person named in due course to arrange an oral hearing.</p></reply>

This issue, which had been the subject of detailed discussions between our two Departments, arose due to a necessary technical adjustment arising from the recent changes in the Common Agriculture Policy regulations and affected those who had been leasing out all of their farmland and single farm payment entitlements. This decision is important in that it maintains confidence in the long-term leasing of farmland and its contribution towards achieving the goals set out in Food Harvest 2020 and it will put an end to the uncertainty facing those farmers who would have been adversely affected.</p></reply>

It set stretch targets to be achieved by primary producers, by industry and by exporters and also included over 200 actions to be implemented by all the key stakeholders.  Its headline targets were to increase by 2020 the value of: <blockquote>- Primary output in the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sector by 33%;<br /><br />- Value added production by 40%;<br /><br />- Agriculture, food (including seafood) and drink exports by 42%;</blockquote>In addition, a 50% increase in milk production and a 78% increase in the volume of aquaculture production was envisaged.</p><p>Implementation of this report is driven by the High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC), which I chair and which also involves the chief executives of the main state bodies. In addition, the HLIC engages with the agri-food related commitments in the Action Plan for Jobs to provide cohesive direction and focus for the sector.</p><p>Annual progress reports on progress are produced, the 3rd and latest being Milestones for Success 2013.  On its headline targets, the current position is that the sector has achieved growth in value in excess of 33% for primary production (CSO 2013 advance estimate), 20% in gross value-added output (CSO 2011 data ) and a 24% increase in the value of exports (Bord Bia 2013 data) compared to the baseline period. In addition to noting progress on the main sectoral targets, the 215 recommendations in FH2020 and advance benchmarks set in 2010, the Milestones for Success report () also documented progress on achievements under a range of other initiatives for the sustainable development of the agri-food and fisheries sector. These included improved policy environment outcomes, industry investment, SME credit facilities and case studies on improved competitiveness, sustainability, collaborative working, innovation and entrepreneurship.</p><p>The result of this sustained focus on the &lsquo;Smart&rsquo;, &lsquo;Green&rsquo; themes in Food Harvest 2020 is that the agri-food and fishing industry has grown in size and importance.  It now plays a very  significant role in national economic development, providing the primary employment for 175,300 people or 9.2% of total employment, 12.3% of all merchandise exports and 23% of all industry turnover.</p><p>Further opportunities exist to increase our exports to countries such as China, Africa, South East Asia and the Middle East and there will be opportunities arising for increased market access from the negotiation of Free Trade Agreements.  I therefore believe that the agri-food and fisheries sector is well placed to meet the Food Harvest targets, and to continue to make a substantial contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s export-led economic recovery.</p></reply>

As advised to the Deputy in March, Phytophthora ramorum was confirmed on Japanese larch trees in Gougane Barra Forest Park, County Cork, earlier this year. To prevent the further spread of the disease, control measures were implemented in accordance with Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine protocols. Felling the infected trees is the appropriate measure with the aim of preventing further spread by limiting spore production.</p><p>  In relation to the actual removal of trees, Coillte has advised that 70% of the volume felled in Gougane Barra was Larch and that the remaining 30% was made up of Lodgepole pine (19%) and Sitka spruce (11%). I am advised that these areas were felled along with the larch because they were either in intimate mixtures with the Larch or would have been small blocks of these other species remaining isolated in the forest and would have blown over in the first storm event.  I understand that, subsequently, there was substantial wind-blow in other parts of the Forest Park after Storm Darwin and Coillte advise that removal of these extra species proved to be the prudent option as going back to harvest these isolated blocks would have proven very difficult.</p></reply>

The Department must put the safety of members of the public above all else and therefore facilitates the felling of trees that pose a risk to public safety, regardless of their age or aesthetic value. Safety is a consideration throughout the relevant legislation &ndash; the Forestry Act, 1946, has exemptions from the need for a licence for trees &ldquo;<i>standing within one hundred feet of any building other than a wall or temporary structure</i>&rdquo; or where &ldquo;<i>the tree is certified by a local authority as dangerous to road traffic on account of age or condition</i>&rdquo;.  In addition, under the Roads Act, 1993, there is an onus on local authorities and landowners to ensure that roadside trees do not pose a risk to traffic. In this context, it is therefore essential that all tidy up operations after the recent storms, and particularly in regard to trees on roadsides, are performed as quickly and safely as possible.</p><p>There have been 134 tree felling licences issued to date in respect of storm damaged trees. Of these cases the majority will have health and safety concerns but 17 applications specifically stated that there were safety concerns. Each application was reviewed by a forestry inspector, resulting in the need for 2 site inspections. 5 applications were referred to National Parks and Wildlife Service for its comments.</p></reply>

Since this date the staff of the former NEWB, including its Educational Welfare Officers, have transferred to the new Agency.  Within the Child and Family Agency, the statutory Education Welfare Service (EWS) has specific authority for the Agency&rsquo;s general functions to monitor school attendance and ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. </p><p>  The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, provides the legislative framework for promoting school participation, retention and regular attendance as well as tackling the causes of absenteeism and early school leaving. The legislative provisions include distinct responsibilities for parents, school authorities and the Agency in respect of school attendance.  Every child has a right to an education and it is a parental responsibility to ensure that children of compulsory school age attend school or otherwise receive an education. </p><p>  Recognised schools are required to record and monitor daily attendance for all students enrolled in the school, irrespective of the age of the student. Schools must report patterns of non-attendance or concerns about the educational welfare of individual students, including those aged under 6 years, to the designated Educational Welfare Officer (EWO). The EWO will then work with the family, the school and other services where appropriate to improve attendance and participation in school. </p><p>  There is no legislative impediment to proactive intervention by schools and the Agency to positively support parents of children under six years of age who may be experiencing difficulties. However, as compulsory school attendance does not extend to children under six years of age, EWOs cannot consider a prosecution against parents of children under six. It is important to understand that the Act requires the Agency to exhaust all welfare interventions to remedy the situation before considering legal action in any case.  The focus of an Educational Welfare Officer&rsquo;s work centres on establishing the barriers preventing a child from attending school regularly and then working with the family to resolve these issues. If appropriate or necessary, the EWO will link in with other agencies and support services. Therefore only a small percentage of the overall casework ends up with parents being prosecuted.</p></reply>

The majority of children in care are in foster care, one third of whom are placed with relatives.  The Child and Family Agency receive a child into care where it appears that a child requires care and protection that he is unlikely to receive unless he is taken into care.  Children are not received into care for the purpose of alleviating financial hardship.  The Department of Social Protection provides for a guardianship payment in such circumstances. </p><p>  The Department of Social Protection has advised that Guardian's payment (contributory) and guardian's payment (non-contributory) are payments made to a person caring for a child who is defined as an orphan under Social Welfare legislation; both of whose parents are dead, or a child whose parent or parents have abandoned and failed to provide for them.  In cases where one or both of the child's parents are still alive, a Deciding Officer considers all of the evidence available, including the nature of the relationship between the parent(s) and the children concerned, in order to establish whether or not the children in question have been abandoned.</p></reply>

A set policy is not in place in regard to the longer-term provision of bras to post-mastectomy patients who hold medical cards.  Mastectomy bras in such cases are normally provided through Local Health Offices on foot of prescriptions issued by a Consultant or a GP.  A national group has recently been established in the HSE to review practices in this area and to develop a national policy on the provision of prosthesis bras, as well as hairpieces, for cancer patients.  It is anticipated that the Group will complete its work in the first half of 2015.</p></reply>

Services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families and carers and a range of statutory, non-statutory, voluntary and community groups.  Services provided by ASD &lsquo;Service Providers&rsquo; include assessment, diagnosis and ongoing treatment and intervention supports.  Ongoing interventions and supports may include home support services, respite services and multi-disciplinary team supports to assess the individual needs of each person with ASD and provide for the appropriate interventions. </p><p>  The Cabinet Committee on Social Policy has been examining issues around autism across Government Departments in association with the National Disability Authority (NDA). This work by the NDA, which has included consultation with families, will be of significant assistance in informing how best to address the needs of people with ASD so that we can be sure that they are appropriately reflected and included in policies and actions. </p><p>  As the Deputy's question relates to service matters I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Health Authority of these countries issue invoices for care provided to the HSE in the form of E125s.  These invoices (E125s) are received in arrears - often up to 2 and 3 years in arrears.  Therefore the figures detailed below are the current costs on this date and are liable to change as invoices for previous years are received and paid and should be read in that context.   </p><p>The HSE Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS) was centralised into a single office in 2012. Prior to this it was administered at various local offices.  Comprehensive figures for the TAS prior to the centralisation of the Scheme are not available. <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Cost</th><th>Comment</th></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td></td><td>Figures for 2009 are not available</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>&euro;4,499,806.59</td><td>The 2010 and 2011 information relates to information available through the central TAS office only.

In line with patient confidentiality issues and data protection legislation, the HSE does not disclose information where the number of patients who availed of a particular treatment numbers less than five in any given year.  On this basis, the following are the most common treatment types that patients accessed under the HSE Treatment Abroad Scheme: Deep Brain Stimulation; Cardiac Transplantation; Sap Scan; Liver Transplantation.</p><p>The Deputy has also sought costs per treatment.  The HSE has apologised that it is not possible to give the costs in this way.  The reasons for this are:</p><p>- The referring consultant stipulates the treating consultant and hospital abroad so referrals for the same treatment may be provided by different providers and even in different countries at different costs;</p><p>- The actual cost of a treatment is specific to the needs of the individual patient e.g. one patient may have no complications and be discharged early while another may have complications and require a greater input and/or duration of care.</p><p>Therefore to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s query as to the actual cost of each treatment would require the HSE to provide the individual cost of the circa 1,000 episodes of care provided under the TAS in any given year.  This in turn would have implications for patient confidentiality so regretfully that information is not available.</p></reply>

I understand that, under the EAMS, medicines will be provided to patients at no charge by the relevant pharmaceutical company until they are licensed by the MHRA.  I also understand that the UK Government does not intend to establish a dedicated fund to support access to medicines under the Scheme.  There is currently no equivalent scheme in place in Ireland.  I will continue to closely monitor the implementation of the EAMS in the UK. At this stage, it is premature to consider the possibility of introducing a similar scheme in Ireland.</p></reply>

Under European and Irish legislation, medicines must be authorised (licensed) before being placed on the market.  The legislation provides that a medical practitioner may prescribe an unlicensed medicine for use by an individual patient under his direct personal responsibility.  Off-label use of a medicine arises where a medicine which is authorised for use for a particular condition is used for the treatment of a different condition.  Medicines shortages have become increasingly prevalent in recent years and off-label use and use of unlicensed medicines are two of a number of strategies used to ensure that the needs of patients are met. At EU level, initiatives have been put in place to promote the development of orphan (treatment of rare medical conditions) and paediatric medicines to address unmet need in those areas.</p><p>  The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) operate a notification scheme whereby wholesalers and manufacturers are obliged to notify the IMB of requests to import  authorised medicines.  This notification scheme provides information on the use of unlicensed medicines.  However, very little information is available on the off label use of medicines as a medical practitioner is not required to notify such usage to the IMB or HSE.</p></reply>

Supporting infrastructure, procured through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of multidisciplinary primary health care.  Considerable progress has been achieved to date.  37 primary care centres have been opened since March 2011 and infrastructure development is underway at a further forty three locations.  </p><p>In addition to the rank of the locations as a result of the 2012 prioritisation exercise, the mechanism and timescale for delivery of primary care infrastructure is dependent on a number of factors, including GP participation.  Regardless of the delivery mechanism, all potential primary care centres are also subject to suitable locations being offered/provided/available and to successful planning processes.  In addition, the operational lease mechanism is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to sufficient financing.</p><p>As regards the PPP project, the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) published a Prior Indicative Notice (PIN) / Pre-Qualification Questionnaire in the OJEU on 19 December 2013.  Four submissions were received by the closing date   which was 10 March 2014.  Information can be located at the following web address: .  It is expected that 10-14 sites (indicative number 12 based on affordability) will be delivered as part of a single PPP contract with the remaining centres to be delivered by the HSE using other procurement means.  </p><p>As with all capital projects this programme must be considered within the overall capital envelope available to the health service.  There will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer.  There is limited funding available for new projects over the period 2014-2018 given the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place.  Nevertheless, where possible, the HSE's capital programme will include provision to progress primary care centres with the highest ranking following the 2012 national prioritisation exercise by direct/own-build in the event that other delivery mechanisms are not feasible. </p><p>Please see the following table, which provides the information on primary care infrastructure -</p><p>- Primary care infrastructure opened since March 2011</p><p>- Primary care infrastructure underway </p><p>- The PPP project.</p><p><b>Primary Care Centres opened since March 2011   </b><b><i>Update at 30 April 2014</i></b><table><tr><th>Count</th><th>HSE Region</th><th>County / Area</th><th>PCT Name / Location </th><th>Delivery Method</th><th>Open</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Inchicore</td><td>Direct Build</td><td>2011 Q4 </td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Ballyfermot</td><td>Direct Build</td><td>2012 Q3 </td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Rathfarnham</td><td>Lease</td><td>2012 Q4 </td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Churchtown</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2012 Q4 </td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Dublin City at James's St</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2012 Q4 </td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>DML</td><td>Kildare</td><td>Newbridge</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2013 Q2 </td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>DML</td><td>Laois</td><td>Portarlington</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2011 Q3 </td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>DML</td><td>Longford </td><td>Longford Town</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2013 Q2 </td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>DML</td><td>Westmeath</td><td>Athlone at Clonbrusk</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2014 Q1</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Bride St / Liberties (Old Meath Hospital Campus)</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2014 Q2</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>DNE</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Blanchardstown</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2013 Q4 </td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>DNE</td><td>Meath</td><td>Dunshaughlin</td><td>Direct Build</td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>DNE</td><td>Meath</td><td>Ashbourne </td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2013 Q1 </td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>DNE</td><td>Meath</td><td>Summerhill</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2014</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>DNE</td><td>Louth</td><td>Carlingford</td><td>Direct Build</td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>DNE</td><td>Louth</td><td>Ardee</td><td>Direct Build</td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>DNE</td><td>Cavan</td><td>Cootehill</td><td>Direct Build</td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>DNE</td><td>Cavan</td><td>Bailieborough</td><td>Direct Build</td><td>2012 Q4 </td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>DNE</td><td>Cavan</td><td>Cavan Town</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2012 Q1 </td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>DNE</td><td>Cavan</td><td>Kingscourt</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2012 Q3 </td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>DNE</td><td>Cavan</td><td>Cavan Town at Connolly Court</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2013 Q2 </td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>South</td><td>Wexford</td><td>Gorey </td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2012 Q3 </td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>South</td><td>Kilkenny</td><td>Kilkenny at Grange's Road</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2011 Q3 </td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>South</td><td>Kilkenny</td><td>Callan </td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2011 Q3 </td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>South</td><td>Waterford </td><td>Tramore</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2011 Q4 </td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>South</td><td>Cork / South Lee</td><td>Cork City at Mahon</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2011 Q4</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>South</td><td>Cork / North Lee</td><td>Macroom</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2012 Q1 </td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>South</td><td>Cork</td><td>Schull</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2013 Q4 </td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>South</td><td>Kerry</td><td>Kenmare</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2012 Q3 </td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>South</td><td>Kerry</td><td>West Kerry (Dingle)</td><td>Direct Build</td><td>2013</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>West</td><td>Limerick</td><td>Limerick City at Abbey St Mary's</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2012 Q1 </td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>West</td><td>Galway</td><td>Galway City East</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2011 Q2 </td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>West</td><td>Galway</td><td>Athenry</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2013 Q3 </td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td>West</td><td>Mayo</td><td>Ballina</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2011 Q2 </td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td>West</td><td>Roscommon</td><td>Castlerea</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2012 Q3 </td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td>West</td><td>Roscommon</td><td>Monksland South Roscommon</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2012 Q4 </td></tr><tr><td>37</td><td>West</td><td>Donegal </td><td>Glenties</td><td>Direct Build</td><td>2012 Q3 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

Each year a number of medicines are withdrawn from the Irish market for commercial reasons.  Manufacturers are obliged to notify the IMB of their intention to withdraw a medicine from the market.  When they intend to withdraw a critical product for which there is no alternative in Ireland, they must notify the HSE nine months in advance to give it and the IMB the opportunity to source an alternative product for the Irish market.</p><p>  The IMB engages with manufacturers to facilitate continuity of supply of all medicines and particularly critical medicines on the market.  Among the steps taken by the IMB are an expedited review of submissions for authorisation and the facilitation of joint packs with other EU markets to improve efficiencies for manufacturers.  In terms of best value for patients, the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 means that patients may now opt for lower cost interchangeable medicines, where available.</p></reply>

As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees. This will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees.  The Government is providing new, additional funding of &euro;37 million to meet the cost of this measure which will provide a GP service to approximately 240,000 children that must currently pay to see a GP.</p><p>The implementation of this new service requires primary legislation. In that respect, the Health (General Practitioner Service) Bill 2014 was published on 23 April 2014. The key features of this Bill are as follows: </p><p>- it provides an entitlement for <i>all</i>children aged under 6 to a GP service without fees;</p><p>- it removes the need for children aged under 6 to have a GMS medical card or GP visit card in order to qualify for a GP service;</p><p>- it provides that the HSE may enter a contract with GPs for the provision of this service to children; and </p><p>- it provides that the Minister may set the rates of fees payable to GPs for this service, though requiring that the Minister must follow a set process before doing so.</p><p>It is intended to introduce the Bill in the Oireachtas during May, with a view to enactment by July.  Payments can only be made to GP's where the requisite legislation and contractual arrangements are in place. Therefore, payments related to the provision of the GP service without fees for children aged 5 and under cannot be backdated, prior to when the service is available, to the date on which the measure was announced.</p></reply>

The period of validity of a certificate of roadworthiness (CRW) is calculated by reference to the last test due date. In cases where a vehicle is overdue its test by more than one year and is presented for testing, current Regulations provide that the period of validity for the CRW shall be either 6 months falling after the testing date or a period of validity determined by reference to the date of the anniversary of the test due date whichever is earlier. This change was introduced so as to ensure that an operator who does not have the vehicle tested by the due date does not gain economic advantage over an operator who had their vehicle tested annually in accordance with the legal requirements.</p></reply>
