PHECC registers pre-hospital practitioners - emergency medical technicians, paramedics and advanced paramedics &ndash; to practise in Ireland, and conducts fitness to practise proceedings.  As the competent authority for Ireland, PHECC sets education and training standards for pre-hospital care.  It also carries out and funds research.  </p><p>  In seeking to ensure the safety of patients in the care of ambulance services, PHECC firstly assesses and confirms the qualifications of each paramedic.  This ensures that registered paramedics have the necessary education, training, experience and skills to fulfil the requirements of their role.</p><p>  Secondly, PHECC licenses an organisation to provide ambulance services.  Licensed providers are allowed to use and implement specific clinical practice guidelines.  The Council prepares such guidelines and makes them available to pre-hospital emergency care providers as appropriate.</p><p>  Finally, PHECC sets the scope and limits of practice for paramedics working for a particular licensed provider.  This ensures that the paramedic provides care and services within the organisation&rsquo;s licensed limits.  </p><p>  It is clear that the organisation of pre-hospital care in Ireland has come a long way in the last two decades.  Since its establishment as an independent statutory body in 2001, PHECC has put in place the structures for pre-hospital care in Ireland to ensure that  ambulance services continue to develop in line with best operational and clinical standards.  </p></reply>

The elimination of waiting lists would entail very significant additional resources, including capital developments.  It is not currently possible to provide a comprehensive total of the funding required.  </p><p>  Over the last ten years, the health service has delivered significant productivity gains and there is further scope to build on this by reference to international best practice and in the context of acute hospital reform.  Department of Health figures show that between 2004 and 2013 - in-patient discharges increased 11.2% whilst in-patient beds reduced by 12.4% and in-patient length of stay reduced by 13.5% - daycases increased 80.3 % excluding dialysis -  total discharges excluding dialysis went up 41.3 %  and daycases as a percentage of total discharges went up 27.7% excluding dialysis.</p><p>  With regard to targeted investment, an additional &euro;25 million has been provided in 2015 to address delayed discharges and thereby improve timelines for admissions from Emergency Departments and waiting lists.  Plans to address inpatient and daycase waiting lists are being considered in the 2015 Service Planning process which is currently under way.  Actions to address the waiting lists will include the undertaking of additional surgical lists, using theatres outside of regular hours and more efficient inter-hospital use of capacity within hospital groups.</p></reply>

This is a matter of concern for me, and my Department and the HSE are working to ensure that the resources that are available deliver the best possible outcomes for older people.  This will require an integrated approach across community, residential and other service areas.</p><p>  The HSE controls the release of funding to manage the financial allocation that is available across the course of the year.  Funding is released to approved applicants according to their place, in order of their approval date, on the national placement list.  Over the course of the year to date, demand has exceeded what could be funded and the national placement list has grown as a result.</p><p>  In July this year, the HSE allocated &euro;5 million for an initiative to improve access to appropriate care for older people.  To date, this has funded over 300 transitional care beds for patients in acute hospitals from the placement list for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme and over 200 home care packages to assist patients in the acute hospitals who require a home care package to be discharged.</p><p>  The Government has provided additional funding of &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges.  This funding will be targeted at hospital and community services which can demonstrate initiatives to address the specific needs of delayed discharge patients most positively and, therefore, improve timelines for admissions from Emergency Departments and waiting lists.  These will include measures to place patients in more appropriate settings through the use of home care packages and intermediate and long-term care.  It will include provision for an increased allocation to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.  Planning for this initiative is well advanced.  Details will be finalised in the HSE's Service Plan later this month, with a view to their early implementation.</p><p>  The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme which is currently under way will consider the future funding and sustainability of the Scheme as well as how community and residential services are balanced.  This Review will be completed in the coming months following which the Government will be considering how best to meet the needs of older people in the future.</p></reply>

Where an application meets the qualifying criteria the funding is approved and that decision to approve is not based on budgetary implications.<br/><br/>The health authority of these countries issues invoices to the HSE for care provided to those approved patients.  These invoices are received in arrears; often 2 or 3 years in arrears. Therefore the figures detailed below are the costs as currently available to the HSE and are likely to change as invoices for previous years are received and paid and should be interpreted in that context.<br/><br/>In 2012, 791 applications were approved at a cost of over &euro;7.5 million.<br/><br/>In 2013, 640 applications were approved at a cost of over &euro;7.8 million.<br/><br/>In 2014 to date, 500 applications have been approved at a cost of over &euro;9.4 million.<br/><br/>Treatment must be medically necessary, must meet the patient&rsquo;s needs and may not be an experimental treatment.  The hospital outside the State must accept the form E112.  The application must be assessed and a determination given before that patient goes abroad.  The HSE is not required to approve a treatment which is not available in Ireland where an equivalent treatment which will meet the patient&rsquo;s needs is available.<br/><br/>The most common treatment types that patients accessed under the Scheme are Deep Brain Stimulation, Cardiac Transplantation, Sap Scan and Paediatric Liver Transplantation.</p></reply>

This is an increase of 3,736 or 7.5% on August 2013.  </p><p>  In August 2014 the number of patients waiting in excess of 12 months for an outpatient appointment has decreased from 84,167 to 41,604, a reduction of 51% when comparing the same periods in 2013 and 2014.  Furthermore, the percentage of patients waiting more than 12 months has decreased from 22% in August 2013 to 11% in August 2014.  Up to the end of August  there has been a 3% increase in outpatient attendances compared to 2013; this equates to 64,289 additional patients seen.  Although the increased provision and uptake of outpatient appointments is positive, it is likely to result in some additional demand for in-patient and day cases.</p><p>  The trends indicate that waiting lists are likely to continue to increase in to next year.  The capacity to provide services for these patients has been curtailed by increased emergency admissions and delayed discharges.  The HSE continues to seek improvements in the provision of elective surgery, medical and outpatient services through reform, facilitation of local level initiatives, strict adherence to the National Waiting List Protocol and relevant HSE Clinical Programme guidelines and networking of services between hospitals in the new Hospital Groups. The Government has provided additional funding of &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges and thereby improve timeliness for admissions from Emergency Departments and waiting lists.  The plans to address in-patient and day-case waiting lists are being considered in the 2015 Service Planning process which is currently under way and progress in this area will be a priority for hospital groups throughout next year.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-11a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014111100058#WRA01800"><p>Following a long period of rising premiums and a severe decline in health insurance numbers, the number of policy holders is now showing modest growth, with an increase of 1,000 in the number insured between July and September 2014.  I recently announced a series of measures which I hope will contribute to a continuation of this trend.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2014, which I will bring before the House this Thursday, will provide the legislative basis for some of these measures, including:</p><p>- Risk equalisation credits (based on age, gender and level of cover) payable in respect of members aged 60 and over.</p><p>- The Hospital Bed Utilisation Credit which acts as a proxy for health status, is increased from &euro;60 a night to &euro;90 and is payable in respect of overnight stays for all ages.  The combined impact of the Bed Utilisation and RE Credits brings the average net claims down to 130% of market average compared to 133% in 2014.</p><p>- Revised stamp duty rates of &euro;80 for a child and &euro;240 for an adult, which represent a 20% reduction in the levy for those aged 17 and under and a 17% reduction for those aged 18 and over, for products not providing advanced cover.</p><p>- No change to adult and child rates of stamp duty for advanced products (last year it increased by &euro;49).</p><p>  The Bill will also make provision for the introduction of young adult rates, to address the sudden increase in premiums that occurs for most young adults after age 21.  In addition, Lifetime Community Rating regulations were signed in July and will come into effect from 1 May 2015, the aim of which is to encourage younger people to purchase private health insurance before age 35.  Separately, I have decided to reduce the levy which insurers pay to meet the running costs of the Health Insurance Authority.  A nominal rate of just 0.01% of insurers' premium income will apply for two years, resulting in savings for the insurance companies of &euro;2m for each of these years.  The rate will then be set at 0.9%, a 25% reduction on the current rate.          </p><p>  Taken together, all of these measures are designed to try to limit the need for increases in premiums, and make private health insurance affordable again for as many people as possible.</p><p>  The VHI is one of four health insurers operating in a commercial insurance market.  While it is the largest of the four, I do not consider that it holds a 'monopoly' position in the market but I am very conscious of the need for real competition and good consumer choice.  I want to ensure a sustainable and competitive private health insurance market.</p></reply>

The Government has commenced this process in respect of all children under 6 years.  The Health (General Practitioner Service) Act 2014, which provides an entitlement for all children aged under 6 to a GP service without fees, was enacted on 25th July 2014.  Under a Framework Agreement, the Department of Health, the HSE and the IMO are engaged intensively on the introduction of GP services without fees for children aged under 6.</p><p>  In July 2014, the Government approved the drafting of a Bill to amend the Health Act 1970 to provide a GP service, without fees, for all persons aged 70 years and over.  Drafting of the Bill by the Department and the Attorney-General&rsquo;s Office is nearing completion and this will allow for the introduction of access to GP care without fees for persons aged 70 and over. </p><p>  The Government's aim is to have the first two phases for the under-6s and over-70s implemented early next year subject to the conclusion of the present discussions and the completion of a fee-setting process.  By the end of next year, approximately half of the population will have access to GP services, without charges.  That's a major step on the way to universal health care. </p><p>  Some GPs have raised concerns that there could be a high level of inappropriate or unnecessary attendances at GP practices when a service is free and have suggested that there could be an option for a GP to apply a nominal fee to deter such unnecessary visits to a GP, and free up GP time for genuine patients.  However, the Minister for Health is currently implementing the phased introduction of a universal GP service without charges in line with existing and planned legislation.</p></reply>

Following the publication of the Chief Medical Officer's Report into perinatal deaths in Portlaoise the Health Service Executive established an Implementation Group to oversee and ensure the recommendations of the Report are progressed in a timely and effective manner.  The HSE submits regular progress reports on the implementation process to my Department.</p><p>  One of the recommendations of the Portlaoise Report was that the HSE's National Open Disclosure Policy which was developed jointly by the HSE and the State Claims Agency and launched in November 2013, should be implemented in full.   The Policy is designed to ensure an open, consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in healthcare.  This includes expressing regret for what has happened, keeping the patient informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the adverse event.  Implementation of the policy across all health and social services has now commenced by the HSE.  At the recent Patient Safety First Conference last Friday, 7th November, the National Lead for Open Disclosure in the HSE advised that over 250 staff briefing sessions and 95 workshops have taken place to date.  An evaluation of the Pilot sites indicates that there has been positive feedback from the process with staff having gained confidence to engage in open disclosure. </p><p>  Ireland currently has no express legislation to assist the open disclosure process.  However, it is intended that this situation will change with the Health Information Bill which is expected to be ready for publication in 2015.  That Bill will contain a number of measures to better promote patient safety including a provision to encourage open disclosure by affording a degree of protection for healthcare personnel.  This is consistent with the Report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance.  It is also in line with a recommendation in a consultation paper published by the Law Reform Commission in 2008 that &quot;a statutory provision be considered which would allow medical practitioners to make an apology and explanation without these being construed as an admission of liability in a medical negligence claim&quot;.</p></reply>

Beaumont Hospital has a continuous quality improvement programme in place to improve and enhance the services it delivers to its patients.  Hospital management works on an ongoing basis with relevant Divisions in the HSE in respect of funding for major capital development projects to support the growth in hospital activity and to deliver healthcare to modern international standards.</p><p>  Several developments in Beaumont Hospital have been approved and are in progress.  The most significant of these relate to improvements associated with the National Renal Transplant Programme.  The refurbishment of St. Damien's Ward is a key improvement for transplant patients, providing fit-for-purpose ward accommodation, with single, en-suite accomodation and hepa-filtration to minimise the spread of infection between graft recipients.  Separation between transplantation and urology or nephrology patients will further reduce the risk of post-operative infection.  The Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics Laboratory will be extended and the first floor of the Acute Mental Health Department will be fitted out to provide accommodation for an additional 44 dialysis stations.  In terms of resources, staff for an additional theatre will be provided for two days per week and staff will also be provided to undertake a greater number of donor assessments.  </p><p>  In relation to other services, the reconfiguration and re-equipping of the existing Cardiac Catheterisation Laboratory  and the provision of a second Cath Lab are ongoing and the Cochlear Implant Programme will be expanded to include simultaneous and bilateral implantation.</p></reply>

An additional investment of &euro;14m in 2014 also has been made to address deficits in disability services, a reform programme to transform services to a community based model of person centred supports, and to focus on the implementation of the Health Information and Quality Authority standards for residential services for people with a disability. </p><p>  These developments and reform proposals, which were outlined in the VFM and Policy Review published in 2012, are being carried out in an environment of effective communications and engagement with all those involved in services, including people with a disability through the HSE's consultative and programme implementation structures. </p><p>  The VFM Review identified fundamental issues that need to be addressed in the way in which HSE-funded disability services are managed and operated, and lays the groundwork for the introduction of a significant restructuring of the Disability Services Programme.  As well as migration from an approach which is predominantly organised around group-based service delivery towards a model of person-centred, individually chosen, supports, the VFM Review also highlighted the need for greater efficiencies in the use of resources. </p><p>  VFM efficiency targets of &euro;5 million were identified this year in the National Service Plan.  In order to arrive at a fair and equitable allocation of these efficiency targets, the Social Care Division of the HSE has been assessing the capability of the voluntary disability providers to implement the necessary measures. </p><p>  In recognition of the time required to complete this work I understand that only 50% of the 2014 requirement, i.e. &euro;2.5 million, is being assigned to agencies this year.  I have been assured that the HSE will continue to work with disability agencies to ensure that efficiencies are achieved without impacting on service provision.</p></reply>

The underspend in planned Mental Health expenditure and the timing of the recruitment of staff  developments was also due to the time required to get various programmes up and running, such as Counselling in Primary Care, Enhanced Teamworking, Mental Health Information System, Clinical Programmes and the opening of additional in-patient beds.<br/><br/>Additional  funding of &euro;35 million in Budget 2015 brings to &euro;125 million the total investment for mental health services since 2012, for the development and modernisation of the services in line with the recommendations of <i>A Vision for Change,</i>mostly in the way of additional posts to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams for both adults and children.  The additional funding is also being used to enhance specialist community mental health services for older people with a mental illness, those with an intellectual disability and mental illness, forensic mental health services and suicide prevention initiatives. <br/><br/>At the end of September an additional 770 posts of the 890 provided for in 2012 and 2013 had been recruited with the remainder at various stages in the recruitment process, with some difficulties in identifying some outstanding candidates for geographic and qualification reasons.  Therefore, approximately 77% of combined 2 years posts have taken up duty. <br/><br/>In relation to 2014, while &euro;20 million was provided for mental health services, the HSE National Service Plan outlined that this expenditure would be phased-in, in order for the HSE to live within the overall available resource in 2014.  Accordingly, it was decided that the recruitment of 2014 posts would be commenced to provide for posts to come on stream during the last quarter of 2014.  To this end, and informed by the analysis carried out, some 200 posts have now been identified from the 2014 allocation and the recruitment process has now commenced. It is important to stress, however, that the entire underspent funds have been made available to Mental Health for spend in 2014 and subsequent years.</p></reply>

As a first step a review of national and international literature on the organisation and delivery of maternity services was commissioned by my Department.  This review has now been completed and is informing the development of a high level policy paper.  Following the finalisation of this paper, a working group will be established with a view to completing the Strategy in 2015.  In the meantime the HSE has been asked to undertake a review and evaluation of current maternity services.</p></reply>

The Government has commenced this process in respect of all children under 6 years.  The Health (General Practitioner Service) Act 2014, which provides an entitlement for all children aged under 6 to a GP service without fees, was enacted on 25th July 2014.  Under a Framework Agreement, the Department of Health, the HSE and the IMO are engaged intensively on the introduction of GP services without fees for children aged under 6.</p><p>  In July 2014, the Government approved the drafting of a Bill to amend the Health Act 1970 to provide a GP service, without fees, for all persons aged 70 years and over. Drafting of the Bill by the Department and the Attorney-General&rsquo;s Office is nearing completion and this will allow for the introduction of access to GP care without fees for persons aged 70 and over. </p><p>  The Government's aim is to have the first two phases for the under-6s and over-70s implemented early next year subject to the conclusion of the present discussions and the completion of a fee-setting process. By the end of next year, approximately half of the population will have access to GP services, without charges.  That&rsquo;s a major step on the way to universal health care. </p><p>  Some GPs have raised concerns that there could be a high level of inappropriate or unnecessary attendances at GP practices when a service is free and have suggested that there could be an option for a GP to apply a nominal fee to deter such unnecessary visits to a GP, and free up GP time for genuine patients. However, the Minister for Health is currently implementing the phased introduction of a universal GP service without charges in line with existing and planned legislation.</p></reply>

An essential element of the eligibility arrangements is that the public or private status of a patient must be specified on admission to hospital.  </p><p>  Section 55 of the Health Act 1970 (as amended) also provides for the charging of private in-patients. Where a patient elects to be treated privately by a consultant the hospital must treat that patient as a private patient. Persons who opt to be private on admission to hospital are liable for the fees of all consultants involved in his or her care and for hospital charges under Section 55 for that episode of care. The hospital charge applicable depend on the hospital treating the patient and on whether a person is accommodated in a single or multiple occupancy room or on a day case basis. The application of a charge by a hospital for in-patient services is obligatory under the legislation, irrespective of whether the patient occupies a public designated bed or private designated bed, as it relates to the private service provided.</p><p>  The private in-patient charge goes towards meeting part of the cost of providing the hospital&rsquo;s services to private patients, for example, the cost of non-consultant doctors, nursing, diagnostic services (such as x-rays and other scans), laboratory services (such as blood tests etc.), medicines, and capital costs. </p><p>  In the case of a chemotherapy or dialysis patient, best practice is to treat him/her in a seated or reclining position, on a therapy chair or a recliner, rather than on a bed. Treatment trolleys are routinely used in day surgery procedures such as colonoscopy.  It is therefore appropriate to charge for the private service provided.</p><p>  The private in-patient charges do not apply to patients receiving accident and emergency treatment. They only apply where the person has been admitted to the hospital as a private in-patient.</p></reply>

The application is being considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association for the assessment of new medicines. <br/><br/>  In accordance with these procedures, the HSE asked the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics to conduct a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of the new product in June 2014. This evaluation will provide detailed information on the potential budget impact of the medicine.It will also assess whether the product is cost effective at the price quoted by the manufacturer. The Report by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, which is expected to be published shortly, is an important input to assist the HSE in its decision making process.  <br/><br/>The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable.  In advance of this decision the HSE has engaged with the pharmaceutical companies regarding an early access programme for a cohort of individuals with advanced liver disease and who require immediate treatment.<br/><br/>The Department has also established an advisory group to examine the feasibility and cost implications of a multi-annual approach to the clinical and public health management of hepatitis C.  This group will furnish a report to the Minister for Health on this issue when it has completed its work.</p></reply>

Eligibility for health services in Ireland, as set out in the Health Act 1970 as amended, is based primarily on ordinary residence and means. All people ordinarily resident in the State are eligible for publicly-funded hospital services. In addition, about two-fifths of the population are eligible for publicly-funded primary care services. </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Director-General of the HSE established an Expert Panel to examine and recommend the range of medical conditions that would be considered as a basis of eligibility for health services.  The Expert Panel was chaired by Prof Frank Keane, Past President of the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland and Clinical Lead, National Clinical Programme for Surgery. The panel included a range of 23 clinical experts from primary care, specialist services and therapies. It also included a patient representative. The work of the Expert Panel was also informed by on-line public consultation and the convening of a patient representative forum to consider the issues.</p><p>  The Keane report was received by my Department last month and I am considering its findings. The Keane report acknowledged that eligibility is a complex and challenging issue. It is widely known that the report concluded that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions for medical card eligibility.</p><p>  This is a very detailed report and when I have finished considering its conclusions, discussed them with the HSE and consulted as necessary with the Minister for Public Expenditure and the Attorney General, I will be reporting to Government on the matter.</p></reply>

The Strategy sets out a broad framework for the delivery of housing for people with disabilities, and for people with mental health issues, through mainstream housing policy. The development of the Strategy took account of the Government's disability and mental health policies, including the Report of the HSE Working Group on Congregated Settings and  <i>A Vision for Change,</i>to progress the options for people with intellectual, physical or mental health disabilities to obtain suitable housing accommodation at community level, with supports appropriate to their needs. It was envisaged that this would be implemented by way of a leasing funding model for social housing. To advance this, &euro;1 million was transferred from the HSE Vote to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government Vote to provide for housing options for up to 150 people currently resident in disability or mental health settings, in both 2013 and 2014. <br/><br/>Due to the relatively small numbers of people who were in a position to leave institutional type settings in 2013, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government obtained approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for up to &euro;975,000 of this funding to be used for the purchase of a small number of properties, on a once-off basis, to accommodate up to 15 people for whom a person centred plan with appropriate supports was in place.  The remaining &euro;25,000 was targeted at leasing homes in the community for those 'transitioning' before the end of 2013.  <br/><br/>Cross-departmental objectives on housing for people leaving institutional or other disability and mental health settings are being advanced through the Housing Strategy for People with a Disability Implementation Monitoring Group, and its associated Housing Sub-Group, which my Department is participating in. This Group is chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which has the lead role in advancing the Housing Strategy. <br/><br/>Budget 2015 also provided for new Social Housing investment by that Department, which includes provision for 400 new housing units for people with specific needs, and up to 150 new homes in the community for those with disabilities leaving institutional type settings. Some of these homes may be available for people with mental health issues. The Department of Health will continue to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to maximise the options under all social housing initiatives for those with a mental health disability.</p></reply>

In a developed primary care system up to 95% of people's day to day health and social care needs can be met in the primary care setting.  In particular, pharmacy services are well placed within the community to provide essential health advice and to support effective care at the lowest level of complexity and in a cost-effective manner.</p><p>  As we continue to experience increased pressure and demand on the resources within the health system it is necessary to consider new and innovative ways to provide the services we require.  Expanding the role of the community pharmacist to providing a range of new pharmacy services will be an important consideration as we seek to further expand and develop the primary care sector.  </p><p>  The Government recognises the contribution that has been made by community pharmacists in recent years by providing an expanded range of services.  Successful engagement with the sector has enabled pharmacists to provide new services such as  flu vaccinations, an emergency hormonal contraception service, advice on health eating, support for smoking cessation and participation in a pilot project on a medicines use review service.  </p><p>  We will continue to engage with community pharmacists to consider the feasibility of implementing other new services that may be cost-effective for the health system.</p></reply>

This is an increase of 3,736 or 7.5% on August 2013.  </p><p>  In August 2014 the number of patients waiting in excess of 12 months for an outpatient appointment has decreased from 84,167 to 41,604; a reduction of 51% when comparing the same periods in 2013 and 2014. Furthermore, the percentage of patients waiting more than 12 months has decreased from 22% in August 2013 to 11% in August 2014.  Up to the end of August  there has been a 3% increase in outpatient attendances compared to 2013; this equates to 64,289 additional patients seen. Although the increased provision and uptake of outpatient appointments is positive, it is likely to result in some additional demand for in-patient and day cases.</p><p>  The trends indicate that waiting lists are likely to continue to increase in to next year. The capacity to provide services for these patients has been curtailed by increased emergency admissions and delayed discharges.  The HSE continues to seek improvements in the provision of elective surgery, medical and outpatient services through reform, facilitation of local level initiatives, strict adherence to the National Waiting List Protocol and relevant HSE Clinical Programme guidelines and networking of services between hospitals in the new Hospital Groups. The Government has provided additional funding of &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges and thereby improve timeliness for admissions from Emergency Departments and waiting lists.  The plans to address in-patient and day-case waiting lists are being considered in the 2015 Service Planning process which is currently underway and progress in this area will be a priority for hospital groups throughout next year.  </p></reply>

In particular, I want to push ahead as soon as possible with key reforms in areas such as extending free GP care on a phased basis, improving the management of chronic diseases, implementing key financial reforms including Money Follows the Patient, and establishing hospital groups as a critical enabler of improving patient quality and efficiency. <br/><br/>The Government published the White Paper on Universal Health Insurance in April. This set out the Government's proposals for a universal, single-tier health service for Ireland. A public consultation on the White Paper on UHI was undertaken. Last month I received the report of the independent analysis of the main themes outlined in the responses received and I intend to publish it shortly.  My Department has also initiated a major costing exercise for UHI, led by the ESRI. I expect to have initial costings by the end of the first quarter of 2015.<br/><br/>When I became Minister for Health, I reviewed our progress to date and the timescales for implementing very important reforms, including UHI. I came to the conclusion that it will not be possible to introduce a full UHI system by 2019, as envisaged in the White Paper.<i></i>However, I want to emphasise my commitment to implementing reforms, and in order to do this I want to examine some key elements further. I will then decide on the best way forward in consultation with my colleagues in Government. When I receive the results of the ESRI costing exercise next year, I will be in a position to set out in more detail the next steps and I will bring proposals to Government.</p></reply>

Government has agreed that the Scheme will also include payments for the small number of women who have had a pubiotomy. The Scheme is designed to be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial, and aims to minimise the stress for the women concerned. Many are elderly and may not want to experience the delay, publicity and financial risks that sometimes come with a court case.  I met all three support groups representing the women last September and their views have helped to shape the Scheme.</p><p>  Judge Maureen Harding Clark, a retired High Court Judge, will undertake the role of  independent Assessor to the Scheme. Judge Clark, from her previous work on the Lourdes Hospital Redress Scheme, brings valuable experience to the role of determining the appropriate level of award for each individual.</p><p>  The Symphysiotomy Scheme is open to women who are still living and who underwent a surgical symphysiotomy or pubiotomy in the State between the years 1940 and 1990. Awards of &euro;50,000, &euro;100,000 and &euro;150,000 will be offered. Women who have had a surgical symphysiotomy may accept an award of &euro;50,000.  For women who have had a symphysiotomy and have suffered significant disability a higher award of &euro;100,000 will be offered.  Where a woman has had a symphysiotomy immediately following Caesarean section an award of &euro;100,000 will be offered and where she has suffered significant disability following these procedures &euro;150,000 will be offered. For a woman who underwent a pubiotomy an award of &euro;100,000 will be offered and for women who have suffered significant disability following this procedure, &euro;150,000 will be offered. Details of the Terms of the Scheme and how to access application forms have been widely advertised.</p><p>  Awards will be exempt from tax and legislation is being put in place as a matter of urgency to ensure they are also exempt from being taken into consideration for means tested welfare schemes. The Judge expects to make payments to some women before Christmas.</p><p>  It is not a requirement for a woman to retain a Solicitor to make an application.  However, the Scheme makes provision for applicants to have legal and other advice available to them in preparing to submit an application if they wish.  Judge Clark has assured me that if women have questions on any aspect of the Scheme,  her staff will be available to assist in any way possible.</p><p>  I would like to emphasise that women will not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a precondition to participating in the Scheme. Women may opt out of the Scheme at any stage in the process, up to the time of accepting their award.  It is only on accepting the offer of an award that a woman must agree to discontinue her legal proceedings against any party arising out of a symphysiotomy or pubiotomy.</p><p>  Applications must be made within 20 working days of the Commencement Date.  The Closing Date for receipt of applications is therefore Friday 5 December 2014.  In exceptional circumstances, Judge Clark has discretion to extend the time for receipt of applications by an additional 20 working days, that is, to Wednesday, 14 January 2015.</p><p>  I hope the implementation of this Scheme will be of benefit to the women concerned and their families.</p></reply>

There is a link between consumption and harm and evidence that affordability is one of the drivers of increased consumption.  The Government has approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse, to be incorporated in a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill, including minimum unit pricing.</p><p>  The Government has decided that minimum unit pricing is the most effective policy measure to deal with the sale of alcohol at cheap prices.  Minimum unit pricing is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels per gram of alcohol that must be legally observed by retailers in both the on and off trade sector.  This is a targeted measure, designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices.  It is mainly aimed at those who are higher risk, such as adolescents and people who have a harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption pattern.  It should therefore only have a marginal effect on moderate drinkers.  It is not expected that minimum unit pricing will affect the price of alcohol in the on-trade sector or the majority of alcohol products sold in the off-trade sector.</p><p>  Work on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation is continuing and it is hoped to publish a General Scheme of a Bill shortly.</p></reply>

A third were discharged within two days and the remainder within a week of admission.  Admissions to adult inpatient units take place only in a situation of extreme urgency or in a crisis situation.  Admissions would arise where no adolescent bed is immediately available, or where the requirement for immediate assessment and treatment may justify this, and where the nearest suitable and available Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in-patient unit is a considerable distance away.  In individual cases, the presenting needs of the young person who may be nearly eighteen would be a factor in terms of assessment or admission.</p><p>  There are currently 46 child and adolescent beds operational nationally - 14 in Dublin, 12 in Cork and 20 in Galway, with more planned.  Difficulties in recruiting Consultant Psychiatrists have impacted on bed availability in recent months in both Cork and Dublin, resulting in a reduction from 56 beds to the current 46.  However, a further 10 beds are due to open in Dublin over the coming weeks.</p><p>  If there is no public bed available and a bed is required, private in-patient beds are purchased by the HSE in either St. Patrick's or St John of Gods.</p><p>  In regard to the specific education and welfare issues raised by the Deputy, in the first instance these are the statutory operational responsibility of the HSE, and have been referred to the Executive for direct reply.  If he has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, I would ask him to please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

To help address these issues, the HSE Service Plan 2014 committed to the streamlining of the recruitment process to allow for more local control and specialisation in respect of future appointments.  In addition a comprehensive workforce analysis was carried out, together with priorities identified by Area Mental Health Management Teams, to inform decisions as to how best to target the 2014 investment posts.<br/><br/>In relation to the particular staffing issue in Dublin North East, as this is a service issue this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.

This is a matter of concern for me, and my Department and the HSE are working to ensure that the resources that are available deliver the best possible outcomes for older people.  This will require an integrated approach across community, residential and other service areas.</p><p>  The HSE controls the release of funding to manage the funds that are available across the course of the year.  Funding is released to approved applicants according to their place, in order of their approval date, on the national placement list.  Over the course of the year to date, demand has exceeded what could be funded and the national placement list has grown as a result.</p><p>  In July this year, the HSE allocated &euro;5 million for an initiative to improve access to appropriate care for older people.  To date, this has funded over 300 transitional care beds for patients in acute hospitals from the placement list for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme and over 200 home care packages to assist patients in the acute hospitals who require a home care package to be discharged.</p><p>  The Government has provided additional funding of &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges. This funding will be targeted at hospital and community services which can demonstrate initiatives to address the specific needs of delayed discharge patients most positively and, therefore improve timelines for admissions from Emergency Departments and waiting lists.  These will include measures to place patients in more appropriate settings through the use of home care packages and intermediate and long-term care.</p><p>  The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme which is currently underway will consider the future funding and sustainability of the Scheme as well as how community and residential services are balanced.

"Delayed Discharges" arise when patients in acute hospitals have finished the acute stage of their treatment but require alternative arrangements to facilitate their discharge.  The occupancy of in-patient acute hospital beds by patients who no longer require acute care also has a significant impact on people awaiting emergency or other in-patient or day case treatment.</p><p>  While there will always be delayed discharges, current levels are resulting in more people on trolleys and more people having their elective admissions or surgery cancelled. As at 4th November 2014, there were 785 Delayed Discharges in acute hospitals nationally, 437 being in the Dublin Academic Teaching Hospitals. The occupancy of in-patient acute hospital beds by patients who no longer require acute care has a significant impact on others awaiting emergency or other in-patient or day case treatment.</p><p>  The Government has provided additional funding of &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges. This funding will be targeted at hospital and community services which can demonstrate initiatives to address the specific needs of delayed discharge patients most positively, and therefore improve timelines for admissions from Emergency Departments and waiting lists.  These will include measures to place patients in more appropriate settings through the use of home care packages and intermediate and long-term care. It will include provision for an increased allocation to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.  Planning for this initiative is well advanced.  Details will be finalised in the HSE's Service Plan later this month, with a view to their early implementation.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 72,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. <br/><br/>The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to transfer responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need to local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). HAP will provide a more integrated system of housing supports and has been designed to allow any households that find full-time employment to remain in the scheme.  Rent supplement will continue to be paid to those already in the private rented sector who have a short-term need of rental support, often as a result of the loss of employment. <br/><br/>HAP was introduced in Cork County Council, Limerick City and County Council and Waterford City and County Council on 15th September, 2014 and in South Dublin County Council, Kilkenny County Council, Monaghan County Council and Louth County Council on 1st October, 2014.  Details of the number of persons currently in receipt of HAP, as supplied by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, are provided in the tabular statement. <br/><br/>Department of Social Protection officials are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government to support the implementation of HAP within the selected local authorities. <br/><br/><b>Tabular Statement: Household in receipt of HAP as at 6 November 2014 - Source: Department of Environment, Community and Local Government</b><table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>Transferred</th><th>New Claims</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Limerick </td><td>122</td><td>23</td><td>145</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council</td><td>-</td><td>6</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan County Council</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City and County Council</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Totals</td><td>124</td><td>37</td><td>161</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Improving the job/candidate matching capability of this service is to incentivise employers to use the service to provide more jobs for those who are unemployed.  At present jobseekers can use the site to manually search for jobs however employers cannot use the service in the &lsquo;reverse&rsquo; direction to search for candidates. In addition there is no automatic matching of candidates/jobs to present a shortlist of suitable opportunities to jobseekers or suitable candidates to employers.<br/><br/>Accordingly a tender process is currently underway for a new job matching system to replace/upgrade JobsIreland. Subject to the outcome of the tender process it is anticipated that the new system will go live during 2015.  <br/><br/>In order to populate the new site with sufficiently detailed candidate profiles to enable employers match their job requirements with suitable candidates, jobseekers will be asked to upload their CVs on JobsIreland and other similar employment sites.  In addition to providing evidence to the Department that the jobseeker is genuinely seeking, and available for, employment this will bring benefits to the jobseeker as it will improve their chances of being &lsquo;matched&rsquo; with employers in three ways. First, the new Jobslreland service will itself automatically match candidate profiles with suitable jobs and will notify both the jobseeker and the employer of the match details. Second, employers will have the ability to refine the search parameters and conduct an &lsquo;advance&rsquo; search for job for candidates with specific skills, qualifications and/or experience. Third, jobseekers will have a similar search capability and will, by examining matching results, be able to refine the presentation of their CV to maximise its likelihood of being identified as a match for particular job types.<br/><br/>It is important to note that, unless otherwise specified by the jobseeker, candidate personal information, such as name and address, will not be visible to employers or other users.  Instead candidate ID numbers will be used and these will enable prospective employers to communicate with jobseekers using messaging functionality on the system.  In addition jobseekers will only be requested to upload their CV in circumstances where their case worker is of the opinion that it is appropriate to do so. In particular it is not intended that  jobseekers with significant barriers to employment, for example literacy problems, will be requested to upload their CV. Such jobseekers will, as is the practice at the moment, be referred to appropriate service interventions.</p></reply>

The 2014 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;3.28 billion.    </p><p>  It is a fundamental qualifying condition of both schemes that a person must be fully unemployed for four in any period of seven consecutive days, so a person working four days a week will not qualify.   </p><p>  It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from the more traditional work patterns, resulting in an increase in the number of persons employed for less than a full week.

Anonymous reports are not available to Deciding Officers when they are making their decisions on cases.  The Deciding Officer&rsquo;s decision must be based on the full facts and circumstances of the case.  As anonymous reports are used merely to &ldquo;trigger&rdquo; or instigate investigations, but do not form any part of the evidence and are not taken into account when the review of the customer&rsquo;s payment is being decided, therefore detailed statistics on the outcomes of anonymous reports are unavailable.  <br/><br/>It should be borne in mind that while there is often a perception of fraud, when a case is examined the individual may be doing something that is allowed under the rules of the particular payment that they receiving e.g. working and receiving a One Parent Family Payment, provided earnings are within the limits and the Department is aware of the situation, is legitimate.</p></reply>

The wind up priority order was amended by the Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act in 2013. Prior to these changes pensioner benefits were given priority over the benefits of active and deferred scheme members. The recent changes to the wind up priority order essentially de-prioritises a portion of pensioner benefits in the manner in which the resource of a scheme are distributed on the windup of a pension scheme. These changes make more resources of the scheme available in the initial distribution of assets to active and deferred scheme members. The impact of these changes will be determined by the level of funding in a pension scheme at the time of the wind up. </p><p>  These recent changes to the Pensions Act are underpinned by additional measures which have been put in place by the Pensions Authority to assist pension schemes achieve a sustainable funding position. It is the medium term objective that all defined benefit schemes will achieve a level of funding which will include a funding risk reserve to protect the rights of scheme members against future volatility in financial markets.</p></reply>

This excludes claims which are awarded following a review and/or appeal.  It also excludes claims made under EU regulations or bi-lateral agreements which are more complex and take longer to decide.  As at the end of October 2014 there were 2,364 IP claims registered, actioned, and awaiting information necessary to finalise a decision.</p><p>  In addition, the Department has recently introduced a process whereby illness benefit (IB) recipients who are nearing the expiry of their limited duration IB </p><p>payment are proactively reviewed to establish whether they may have a potential entitlement to invalidity pension. This process utilises the medical and contribution information already available to the Department.  The customers so identified are required only to complete a short supplementary form, which is processed promptly on return to the department, ensuring an improved and streamlined customer service.</p></reply>

Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the number of appeals received peaked at 35,484, reducing to 32,777 appeals in 2013. In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.<br/><br/>These measures have also led to a significant increase in the annual number of appeals finalised in the appeals office from 17,787 in 2009 to 38,421 in 2013.  An additional 5,863 appeals were finalised in 2013 compared to 2012.  Good progress has also been made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 9,979 at 6<sup>th</sup>November 2014.<br/><br/>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<br/><br/><b>Appeals on hand at 3 November 2014</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>No. of appeals</th></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td>1,921</td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit <br /><br />(Previously known as Disability Benefit)</td><td>453</td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension</td><td>956</td></tr><tr><td>Carer&rsquo;s Allowance</td><td>1,326</td></tr><tr><td>Carer&rsquo;s Benefit</td><td>31</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives and the reform measures introduced to date go somewhat toward that goal. To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement, all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing whether they are entitled to State pension contributory, and the level of any such entitlement.<br/><br/>Once over 16, the date a person enters into insurance is taken as the date used for averaging purposes in order to qualify for a State pension. <br/><br/>To qualify for a state pension a person must:<br/><br/>- have at least 520 paid contributions and<br/><br/>- satisfy a yearly average test (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid and/or credited is required for a maximum rate pension, reduced rates may be paid at various levels where the yearly average is between 10 and 47).<br/><br/>The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 defines insurable employment as <i>&quot;employment such that a person, over the age of 16 years and under pensionable age, employed in that employment would be an employed contributor&quot;.</i><br/><br/>Once a person reaches pension age he/she is no longer in insurable employment and therefore is not liable to pay PRSI contributions.  There are no provisions in legislation which allow a person to pay contributions beyond pension age.<br/><br/>The majority of those aged over 66 would not qualify for a higher rate of State pension contributory if PRSI was levied on their current income.  In many cases they are either in receipt of such a pension at the full rate, or they receive a pension which is not based on their PRSI record (e.g. a public service pension, or a State pension non-contributory). In many other cases, the additional contributions would not be sufficient to increase their yearly average above the threshold required for a higher rate of pension.<br/><br/>The introduction of a requirement for such people to pay PRSI on their income after 66 would not, therefore, be welcomed by the majority of pensioners.<br/><br/>In the longer term, by 2020, it is planned to introduce a total contributions approach to pension entitlement, replacing the current yearly average system, and issues such as longer working and incentives to encourage this will be considered as part of that reform.</p></reply>

In recent years there has been a focus, in the interest of enhanced efficiency, on amalgamating sub-schemes and consolidation of others where multiple schemes may have been associated with one sponsor for historical or geographical reasons. Accordingly the numbers of projects on a year-to-year basis may vary as these processes take place.  <br/><br/>Numbers on some schemes may also vary within any given year on schemes and the Department liaises at local level with the projects on an ongoing basis, and may grant temporary additional places if there was a particular short-term need for them.  If this need becomes more permanent and places are filled on a consistent basis, and if the overall budgetary figures allow, the places are granted to schemes on a more permanent basis. Expenditure will also fluctuate depending on the number of places on schemes at any one time, the type of allowance of the participant, i.e. single allowance or those with a family, the level and cost of training, and the materials budget of each scheme.<br/><br/>In addition, there are five job initiative (JI) schemes in the relevant areas and figures in respect of these are included. There are also three jobs clubs in these areas which cater for in the region of over 400 clients each annually.

Eurostat monitor this role through documentation, including the excessive deficit procedure (EDP) inventory for Ireland, and through biennial dialogue visits. Eurostat are the ultimate arbiters on the classification of units in relation to EDP and other Government Finance Statistics.</p><p>  The market/non-market test, as described in the ESA 2010, determines if a government controlled institutional unit is a market producer. To determine this, Irish Water or any other semi state company, must sell its products at an economically significant price which, in practice, would be assessed if the sales of the producer cover a majority of the production costs over a sustained multi-year period. The plausibility of the semi state operating as a market producer is also tested by assessing the level of sales dependent on government funding. In the case of a new public enterprise, the classification will be based on the business plan and special attention will be given to check whether the unit becomes a market producer in a short period of time. The market status of government controlled institutional units is assessed on a regular basis.</p><p>  As per standard accruals accounting all billed sales will count towards revenue. If in the future bad debts are written off Irish Water may require new revenue streams to make up the shortfall. This could lead to an increase in the government funding which will be assessed in the market/non-market and plausibility tests.</p><p>  Once decisions are finalised regarding the structure and financing of Irish Water, a submission will be made to the CSO and Eurostat regarding the classification of Irish Water. Until this submission is received the timeline cannot be finally confirmed. It would be expected that a decision will be made by the time of the next EDP reporting date (end March 2015).</p></reply>

I understand that there are 39 licensed moneylenders operating in Ireland at present. </p><p>  The legislation does not provide for an interest rate cap for moneylenders.  The introduction of an interest rate ceiling may not achieve the objective of lowering the total cost of credit where, for example, the licensed moneylender chose instead to extend the duration of the loan.  </p><p>  Lower interest rate ceilings could also result in excluding low income households from access to credit that have repayment capacity, even at the high rates charged by licensed moneylenders. I would have some concerns therefore about the imposition of an industry-wide interest rate cap without a detailed assessment of its impact on consumers.  Often the loans are for small amounts, are needed immediately by the customers and are made available and repaid at the home of the customer. The shorter the duration of the loan e.g. two weeks, the higher the Annual Percentage Rate of Charge (APRC) as the APRC is an annualised measure of the interest charged.  This service may impose extra costs on the moneylenders. The Deputy may also wish to note that, under section 47 of the Consumer Credit Act, a customer may apply to the Circuit Court for a declaration that the total cost of the credit provided is excessive.</p></reply>

These have detailed requirements specifying the information that a moneylender must provide to a consumer, prior to entering into a loan and also during the term of a loan. <br/><br/>Before entering into a loan a moneylender has a statutory duty under Regulation 11 of the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements Regulations) 2010 to assess the creditworthiness of a consumer, using sufficient information.  While the Central Bank acknowledges that the home collection credit industry may lend itself to building on-going relationships with consumers, the Central Bank has stated that such on-going relationships should not be solely relied upon when assessing consumers' creditworthiness.  The Central Bank expects that moneylenders must consider all existing loans and any arrears a consumer may have when assessing creditworthiness and must have strong documented evidence of the consumer's income, expenditure and ability to repay, before advancing each loan. <br/><br/>A moneylender must have a warning on the loan agreement highlighting that it is a high cost loan. Furthermore, the Central Bank maintains a register of all licensed moneylenders, which includes details of the maximum APRs and costs of credit that they are permitted to charge. <br/><br/>The Central Bank periodically undertakes research to inform the regulatory approach to the licensed moneylending industry in Ireland and to see how the firms are treating their customers.  The most recent research, which was conducted in 2013, included engagement with customers of moneylenders as well as moneylenders themselves.  The engagement with customers included structured telephone interviews with 500 customers and in-depth interviews with 8 customers.  In addition, the research agency consulted with key stakeholder bodies, who provided a valuable insight into the review and helped provide a balanced analysis of the industry.  The report was published in November 2013 and is available on the Central Bank's website at . <br/><br/>The Central Bank  recently advised the moneylending industry that assessment of the creditworthiness of consumers will be a future area of focus for the Bank and, where breaches are identified, the Bank will take steps to enforce compliance (including monetary or other penalties).  For additional information see the industry newsletter and the Central Banks communication on responsible lending on the Central bank's website at .<br/><br/>The Central Bank have also indicated that they will consider related media opportunities as part of its on-going media strategy.</p></reply>

I have been advised by the Central Bank that the Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders sets out specific requirements in respect of advertising by moneylenders. While the Code does not restrict the advertising of new credit facilities to existing customers in arrears, moneylenders are prevented from offering unsolicited pre-approved credit facilities. In addition, Regulation 11 of S.I. No. 281/2010 - European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010  obliges creditors, before concluding a credit agreement, to assess the credit worthiness of the consumer on the basis of sufficient information, where appropriate obtained from the consumer and, where necessary, on the basis of a consultation of the relevant database.</p><p>  I would advise the Deputy to report any possible breaches of the Code or the 2010 Regulations to the Central Bank. </p></reply>

Revenue investigates all complaints of this kind and fuel samples are taken from filling stations and referred to the State Laboratory for analysis where the investigating officers have reason to suspect excise fraud.  The State Laboratory makes use of an array of tests to determine whether an adulteration of the petrol has occurred.</p><p>  Revenue are working closely as part of a joint investigation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into a concentration of complaints in Co. Mayo.  As part of this investigation, I understand that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are following up on the examination of engines  and residue on engine parts from vehicles that are alleged to have been damaged as a result of suspect petrol.</p><p>  A total of 79 samples of petrol from filling stations in the Border Midlands West Region have been referred for analysis to the State Laboratory following checks conducted from June 2014 to date.  Conclusive results have been received in one case which confirms contamination through the presence of kerosene and a file is being prepared for prosecution in this case.  A second positive contamination result is currently under investigation.  To date, no evidence of fraudulently contaminated petrol has been found in the remaining samples.</p><p>  As part of Revenue's normal operating procedures, fuel delivery tankers are challenged when encountered by Enforcement officers throughout the Border Midlands West Region.  No cases of contaminated petrol have been identified as a result of these checks from June 2014 to date.</p><p>  Motorists themselves should take care about where they source their petrol and should report any suspicions to Revenue.  Revenue has recently launched a dedicated section of its website specifically dealing with the shadow economy and this includes a reporting facility for anyone who has information about shadow economy practices including the adulteration of fuel.</p><p>  Petrol stretching is an offence under section 102 (1A) of the Finance Act 1999 and the Deputy can be assured that, if Revenue's investigations and the analysis of fuel samples by the State Laboratory indicate the presence of illegal stretching agents in petrol, Revenue will take action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.</p><p>  I am advised that it would not be feasible to undertake sampling and analysis of all petrol being delivered to filling stations.  Checking for contamination will, however, be carried out at various stages of the fuel supply chain, on the basis of an evaluation of the risk of the likelihood of adulteration.</p><p>  Information on the proportion of national retail sales of petrol accounted for by the filing stations from which samples have been taken is not readily available.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are a fully integrated tax and customs administration and it is not possible to disaggregate resources deployed exclusively at any given time on a particular element of their enforcement work.  There are approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to targeting and confronting non-compliance.  These front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection.  I am advised that the current issues relating to petrol quality are being dealt with as a high priority and that the deployment of staff to address those issues, from within the existing resources available to Revenue, reflects that priority.  I understand also that the Revenue Commissioners are working closely with the State Laboratory, which, in addition to analysing samples referred to it, is providing technical and scientific support for the on-going investigations.</p><p>  The first point of contact for motorists whose vehicles may have been affected should be their motor insurance companies.  Persons affected should also contact the point of purchase of the fuel. If they remain unsatisfied, they may have recourse to civil remedies and should seek legal advice.</p><p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission - a merger of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency - has been established to enforce consumer protection law and may be able to provide assistance to those affected by petrol stretching who are seeking redress.</p></reply>

The transitional arrangements does not relate to any business, but to the allocation of VAT receipts between the Member States of consumption and supply.</p><p>  In relation to your query regarding a specific television broadcasting company, it is not possible for me to discuss the tax affairs of individual businesses.</p><p>  With regard to the impact on the consumer of the place of supply changes, the new arrangement could result in an increase in the cost of services for Irish consumers, where the cost of the VAT change is passed on by the supplier.  For example, the VAT charged on broadcasting and electronically supplied services from the UK will increase from the UK standard VAT rate of 20% to the Irish standard VAT rate of 23%, while the VAT on electronic services from Luxembourg will increase from their super-reduced rate of 3% to Ireland's 23% standard rate.  However, the cost of the additional VAT may not always be forwarded onto the consumer; where businesses operate an individual pricing system across the EU.</p></reply>

The review has been carried out and its report was published on Budget Day this year, 14 October.  A key objective of the review is to encourage improved productivity in farming.  There are concerns that the definition of 'farmer' for the purposes of CAT agricultural relief was not sufficiently robust to ensure that this relief is only being availed of by active, productive farmers.  There have also been suggestions that the relief is being used as a tax efficient inter-generational wealth transfer mechanism for non-family farms.</p><p>  To address these concerns and to encourage improved productivity in farming, changes to CAT agricultural relief were provided for in the Finance Bill 2014 as published.  Assuming the other conditions of the relief are satisfied, the changes confine the relief to two categories.</p><p>  Firstly, the relief will be available to an individual who, for a period of not less than six years, commencing on the valuation date of the gift or inheritance, spends not less than 50% of his or her normal working time farming agricultural property, including the agricultural property comprised in the gift or inheritance, on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profits from that agricultural property.</p><p>  Secondly, the relief can be available to an individual who leases the whole or substantially the whole of the agricultural property comprised in the gift or inheritance for a period of not less than six years, commencing on the valuation date of the gift or inheritance, to an individual who spends not less than 50% of his or her normal working time farming agricultural property, including the leased agricultural property, on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profits from that agricultural property.</p><p>  Concerns have been raised with me by various interests about the definition of 'active' farmer for the purpose of the amendments detailed above.  I will consider these concerns and see if further amendments to the provisions are warranted on Committee Stage of the Bill.</p></reply>

Following the rate reset earlier this year in respect of next months interest payment, total cash interest payable in 2014  will be just over &euro;750 million.  The increase in interest payable in 2014 compared to 2013 largely reflects the fact that a full year's interest is payable this year.  The estimates of interest payable on the floating rate bonds in the coming years reflect market-based projections for the six-month Euribor interest rate plus the fixed margins.  The interest margin averages 2.63% across the eight issues.</p></reply>

The ECJ found that the pension funds at issue may be regarded as a special investment fund where the funds are invested using a risk spreading principle and the pension customers bear the investment risk.  The Court also held that the essential characteristic of a special investment fund is the pooling of assets of several beneficiaries, enabling the risk borne by those beneficiaries to be spread over a range of securities. </p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is their understanding that &quot;one member arrangements&quot; are generally administered by life insurance companies and through Small Self-Administered Schemes (SSAS's).  The trustees of &quot;non-insured&quot; contribution pension schemes have a much greater discretion as to how the scheme funds are invested, and there is no requirement that the investments are pooled.  In such circumstances, it is Revenue's view that the administration of such schemes do not meet the ECJ principles for VAT exemption.  In contrast, many smaller schemes in Ireland are &quot;insured&quot; schemes in which investments are made on a unitised/non-segregated basis and concern a contract of insurance held by the pension holder.  The trustee has little opportunity to determine the investment strategy in relation to the assets underlying the policy.  The management of such schemes by an insurance company are exempt as the supply relates to insurance intermediation.</p><p>  The principle of fiscal neutrality precludes economic operators carrying out the same transactions from being treated differently in relation to the levying of VAT. Revenue are of the view that the principle of fiscal neutrality is not breached as the providers are supplying different services to the pension holder. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-11a.365.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014111100066#WRJ01000"><p>It is not possible to provide an accurate cost to the Deputy of the provision of tax relief in respect of childcare costs for children of pre-primary school age as reliable figures are not available for the numbers of children in childcare, the costs incurred by their parents and the number of parents who are paying tax. <br/><br/>However, a tentative figure can be calculated by using the 2013 &quot;Indecon Report on Support for Childcare for Working Families and Implications for Employment&quot; and  statistics provided by the Department of Social Protection in relation to children in receipt of child benefit.<br/><br/>The Indecon report concluded that the average cost of childcare per pre-school child per week was &euro;133 or &euro;6,916 per annum in 2013.  According to DSP figures on the numbers and ages of children in receipt of child benefit in 2013, there were approximately 489,500 children under 6.<br/><br/>If tax relief at the standard rate of 20% were provided on the costs of childcare in respect of these children, it would result in a cost to the Exchequer of in the region of &euro;680 million per annum.  However, it must be borne in mind that these figures are extremely tentative and the real cost could be much higher. <br/><br/>I have no plans to introduce such a tax relief as it could be seen to unfairly discriminate against those individuals who stay at home and look after their children.  While wanting to encourage participation in the workforce, equally we cannot say to individuals who stay at home to mind children that they are making a less valuable contribution to society. <br/><br/>In addition, tax relief is only of benefit to those in the tax net and it is estimated that in 2014, 39% of income earners will be exempt from income tax.  It could also be argued that any tax relief would most likely be absorbed by childcare providers in the form of higher prices.<br/><br/>Having said this, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government acknowledges the continuing cost pressures on parents, particularly those with young children. In recognition of these cost pressures, a number of support measures are in place to ease the burden on working parents.  These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to qualifying parents, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which provides free childcare places to qualifying Solas and VEC trainees and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for a free pre-school year for children in the year before commencing primary school.  Generous entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave as well as child benefit payments are also provided. <br/><br/>The Department of Social Protection provides financial support to families on low pay by way of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) and additionally to one-parent families through the one-parent family payment. <br/><br/>Furthermore, a Single Person Child Carer tax credit of &euro;1,650 is available as well as an additional standard rate band of &euro;4,000.  This credit and band is payable to any single person with a child under 18 years of age or over 18 years of age if in full time education or permanently incapacitated.  The primary claimant may relinquish this credit and<b></b>the increase in the rate band to a secondary claimant with whom the child resides for not less than 100 days in the year.<b></b>To claim the Single Person Child Carer Credit a claimant must not be married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting.<br/><br/>In relation to exempting childcare costs from tax when the service is provided by an employer, a relief did exist in the form of a benefit-in-kind exemption.  However, this relief was abolished in Finance Act 2011.  The Commission on Taxation recommended its abolition, citing equity issues in relation to those parents whose employers did not provide such facilities.<br/><br/>As the Deputy will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones.  In considering these, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the current budgetary constraints.  Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

Retail credit firms are a regulated category of entities which are authorised to provide credit (in the form of cash loans) directly to individuals.  Some firms authorised in this category are mortgage lenders.  Retail credit firms have been subject to regulation by the Central Bank since 1 February 2008. A register of all Retail Credit Firms is available on the Central Bank website at the following link: .<br/><br/>I am informed by the Central Bank that, at end-June 2014, six of these firms had a total of 17,986 primary dwelling (PDH) mortgage accounts of which 5,047 were classified as restructured; four had a total of 772 buy to let (BTL) mortgage accounts of which 96 were classified as restructured.  Regarding the level of outstanding debt on these accounts, there was a total of &euro;3.323bn in outstanding PDH debt and a further &euro;0.171bn outstanding in BTL mortgage debt.  Of that outstanding debt, mortgage accounts amounting to &euro;1.732bn (PDH) and &euro;0.099bn (BTL) respectively were in arrears of over 90 days.  The Central Bank has advised that it does not publish the interest rates applied by regulated entities.<br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank's Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) announced in March 2013 set time bound and measurable targets for the 6 main banks requiring them to systematically address their arrears book.  The Central Bank has informed me that retail credit firms are not subject to the prudential standards set out in the Central Bank's MART.  However, the same consumer protection framework applies to retail credit lenders as to other regulated lenders including the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA).  As such the Central Bank engages with these firms in relation to their treatment of borrowers under the mortgage arrears resolution process as provided for in the CCMA.  In particular, the CCMA sets out requirements for all mortgage lenders, including retail credit firms, dealing with borrowers facing or in arrears on a mortgage secured on a primary home and provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their co-operating borrowers in mortgage difficulty.  <br/><br/>The Central Bank has informed me that retail credit firms were also included in the scope of the Central Bank's review of the 'Implementation of the Revised CCMA' by mortgage lenders, the purpose of which was to ensure that mortgage lenders achieved full implementation of the requirements of the revised CCMA by end December 2013.<br/><br/>The Central Bank has advised that during 2012, retail credit firms reported that 59 properties were repossessed following a court order, accounting for 24% of total properties repossessed following court orders.  During 2013, these lenders reported that 53 properties were repossessed following a court order, accounting for 15% of the total.  In Quarter 2 of 2014, retail credit firm lenders reported that 12 properties were repossessed following a court order, accounting for 11% of total properties repossessed following court orders.<br/><br/>The Central Bank continues to engage with all mortgage lenders, including retail credit firms, in relation to lenders' mortgage arrears resolution strategies and approaches to dealing with borrowers in or facing arrears.  Early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving cases of mortgage difficulty.  Where there is effective and meaningful engagement regarding a mortgage difficulty, the data shows that an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures is being put in place.</p></reply>

However, it is planning to test compliance with the CCMA later this year.

The Central Bank has informed me that where a concern arises that a prescribed contravention has been or is being committed, the Central Bank may investigate.  Following an investigation an inquiry may be held where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a prescribed contravention has been or is being committed.  The inquiry shall decide if the prescribed contravention has occurred and determine the appropriate sanctions.  <br/><br/>A prescribed contravention could be a breach of:<br/><br/>- a provision in legislation<br/><br/>- a code, or a direction, given pursuant to legislation<br/><br/>- a condition or requirement imposed on a regulated financial service provider<br/><br/>- any obligation imposed on a regulated financial service provider by the Central Bank <br/><br/>Following an inquiry, the Central Bank, for example, can impose one or more of the sanctions below:<br/><br/>- caution or reprimand;<br/><br/>- direction to refund or withhold all or part of money charged or paid, or to be charged or paid, for the provision of financial service by a financial service provider;<br/><br/>- a direction to pay the Central Bank a monetary penalty (not exceeding the greater of &euro;10,000,000 or 10% of turnover where the financial service provider is a body corporate or an unincorporated body and not exceeding &euro;1,000,000 where the financial service provider is a natural person and for persons concerned in the management of a financial service provider);<br/><br/>- disqualification of a person from being concerned in the management of a regulated financial service provider;<br/><br/>- revocation or suspension of an authorisation;<br/><br/>- direction to the regulated financial service provider to cease committing the contravention;<br/><br/>- direction to pay the Central Bank all or part of its costs incurred by the Central Bank in the investigation of the matter and the holding an inquiry.  <br/><br/>The Central Bank has advised that to date, it has not imposed a sanction on a mortgage lender in relation to breaches of the CCMA.  More information on the Administrative Sanctions procedure can be found at the following link: ).  <br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank monitors compliance with the statutory consumer protection requirements through its on-going engagement with firms, reviews and research, themed inspections, mystery shopping, and advertising monitoring.  The Central Bank regularly conducts themed inspections to ensure compliance with all of its codes of conducts, including the CCMA.  Themed inspections examine issues across a sector.  Where a specific compliance issue arises with an individual firm, this is addressed directly with the firm and where appropriate, regulatory action may be taken.  Breaches of regulatory requirements are dealt with in accordance with the Administrative Sanctions procedure.  To promote compliance, the Central Bank provides feedback on themed inspections and publish the main issues on its website.  The Central Bank has conducted a number of themed inspections on the CCMA since its introduction in 2009.  Details of these themes and the feedback issued can be found at the following link: .<br/><br/>The Central Bank's plan for themed inspections in 2014 ) includes an inspection of mortgage lenders to test compliance with the revised CCMA.  Compliance with the CCMA is also a Central Bank enforcement priority for 2014.<br/><br/>Where a borrower believes that their lender has not complied with or in any way disregarded the CCMA, he/she may make a complaint to their lender.  The lender must seek to resolve the borrower's complaint in line with the complaints handling process set out in provisions 10.7 to 10.12 of the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code.  Each lender must also establish an Appeals Board to consider and determine any such appeals submitted by borrowers.  If the borrower remains dissatisfied following the outcome from the complaints or appeals process, he/she may then refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO) who deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all regulated financial service providers.  <br/><br/>I have been informed by the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO) that in relation to Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) complaints, where issues of sustainability/repayment capacity are in dispute, the FSO is only in a position to investigate a complaint as to whether the provider, in handling a mortgage arrears issue, correctly adhered to its obligations pursuant to the CCMA.<br/><br/>Details of the number of findings where the issue of CCMA/MARP was raised and the findings issued are detailed below:<table><tr><th>Reporting Period</th><th>Finding Issued</th><th>Upheld</th><th>Partly Upheld</th><th>Not Upheld</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>11</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>69</td><td>1</td><td>14</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td>2014<br /><br />[to 30.10.14]</td><td>88</td><td>2</td><td>19</td><td>67</td></tr></table>These statistics relate to complaints made/referred to the FSO only and do not include complaints in relation to non-compliance which may have been made directly to the Central Bank of Ireland and which may have been dealt with by the CBI.</p></reply>

It is not clear however that any of these deaths are directly attributable to famine causes and cannot therefore be definitively described as such.  While the figure would seem low compared to the number of deaths throughout the country at the time, it possibly reflects that, bad though the conditions were in the Gaol in the 1840s, they still offered subsistence levels of food and shelter which at least kept inmates alive while the population outside the Gaol was sustaining much higher mortality rates.   </p><p>  The Office of Public Works (OPW) has no information in relation to interrals within the Gaol in this period, though there are, clearly, graves on the Kilmainham site which have arisen because of the various executions that took place there.  We cannot therefore with any assurance of complete historical accuracy ascribe any of the deaths at the Gaol during this period exclusively to the Great Famine.</p></reply>

Rather, front-line managers in individual Government Departments and bodies will have greater autonomy in managing staff resources to meet service needs, including hiring staff where warranted, subject to remaining within agreed pay ceilings, and meeting reform and efficiency objectives. There will be restrictions and controls to prevent unwarranted grade drift and unsustainable recruitment, and recruitment will be carried by the Public Appointment Service in the normal course of events.  In general terms, the number and location of vacancies filled  will be determined by such factors as retirement rates and Departments and Offices deciding on their service priorities and optimal grade mix over the period ahead, with reference to their pay ceilings.  The approach is for the Public Appointment Service to create panels of suitable candidates from which Departments and Offices can draw down as the need arises.</p></reply>

Such exempt buildings would principally include those used for public worship, education and health care provided on a not-for-profit basis, and charitable purposes. In general, the Act maintains the long-standing position that all commercial properties - including all private childcare facilities such as play schools, preschools, cr&egrave;ches and Montessori schools - are liable for rates.  </p><p>  Certain childcare and preschool facilities can be exempt from rates under the terms of paragraph 16 of Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act, 2001, where the organisation is a charitable organisation, that uses its property exclusively for charitable purposes and otherwise than for private profit. The organisation claiming charitable status for the purpose of qualifying for exemption from rates must comply with the definition of &quot;charitable organisation&quot; as stated in PART 1 section 3 of the Valuation Act, 2001.</p><p>  Similarly certain preschool facilities can be exempt from rates where  the conditions detailed in paragraph 10 of Schedule 4 are met.  </p><p>  As a matter of course, the Valuation Office examines all claimant cases on their individual merits by reference to the relevant statutory provisions governing the operation of the Valuation Act as it relates to childcare facilities and all other categories of properties.

Minister of State Simon Harris, who is taking the Bill through the Seanad on my behalf, undertook to consider what could be done in this regard before the Bill returns for Report Stage (expected to be in late November).

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.  It would be a breach of the EU rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds such as nationality, organisational size, etc. and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. <br/><br/>The Government acknowledges the significant role that SMEs play in the Irish economy and is committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement and the opportunities presenting.  DPER Circular 10/14 is aimed at opening up opportunities for small businesses that want to tender for public contracts and also to ensure that engaging with government procurement is easy and low cost.  The key initiatives are as follows: buyers are advised to undertake market analysis prior to tendering in order to better understand the range of goods and services on offer, the competitive landscape, including the specific capabilities of SMEs; the circular promotes transparency in procurement by requiring supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 to be advertised on the Government's electronic tendering portal, e-Tenders; the circular encourages suppliers including SMEs to fully use e-Tenders and avail of its facilities in relation to registration, e-tendering and automatic alerts in relation to future tendering opportunities; buyers are encouraged not to set turnover thresholds at more than twice the estimated contract value and puts limits on insurance levels for suppliers where possible; the circular promotes greater use of &quot;open&quot; tendering and less use of &quot;restrictive&quot; tendering; the circular  encourages SMEs to consider using consortia where they are not of sufficient scale to tender in their own right or where they may lack certain capabilities necessary to provide a compelling proposition; the circular encourages Contracting Authorities to break large contracts down into lots where reasonable to do so and where it does not expose the State to undue risk or significant management overheads.<br/><br/>The OGP also supports the work of Enterprise Ireland and InterTrade Ireland in building awareness of public procurement and supporting training for small suppliers in bidding for public contracts.  Last year the OGP, for example, supported two &quot;Meet the Buyer&quot; events in Belfast and Dublin last year attended by approximately 1,000 suppliers.  Approximately 1,700 are expected to attend similar events this year.  In addition, the OGP supported the 'Go 2 Tender' programme run by InterTrade Ireland which was attended by 317 SME's last year.This year InterTrade Ireland are also  delivering a programme on Consortia Building to assist SME's in developing understanding to enable them to jointly bid for state contracts.<br/><br/>The OGP will continue to work with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that Government procurement policies are business friendly.</p></reply>

Taking away trade barriers and making markets more open, as we have done in other trade negotiations, brings increased competition, lower prices and more opportunities for our exporting sector. The stimulus effect of TTIP on jobs, while difficult to estimate precisely, is expected to be positive in terms of more and better paid, sustainable jobs in the exporting sector of the economy.  </p><p>  My Department has engaged international expertise to examine the economic and other impacts and related potential opportunities for Ireland of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership [TTIP].  The focus of the study is to identify key areas and sectors of the economy that will be impacted by the TTIP.  This will help to inform Ireland&rsquo;s position in the negotiations.  It will also help in identifying appropriate policy responses to be deployed to maximise the potential of this agreement and provide an assessment of the longer term implications for enterprise policy.

The mandate is available on the EU Council&rsquo;s website at <br/><br/>.  <br/><br/>I believe that ISDS is a valid mechanism.  But I also believe that the experience of ISDS internationally shows us there is room for much improvement in how the system works.  And that, I believe, is the reason why ISDS has raised some concerns.  <br/><br/>The TTIP gives us a valuable opportunity to make improvements and create a new generation ISDS model that would respect and address legitimate concerns that have been raised.  Such improvements include having safeguards against claims that are clearly unwarranted and making sure that ISDS does not serve to constrain the rights of governments to take measures for legitimate public policy reasons.  Important features in any system would also include greater transparency in the operation of tribunals and ensuring the independence of arbitrators.  <br/><br/>The EU Commission is currently analysing the results of a public consultation on ISDS, carried out in response to concerns raised.  Ireland was one of a number of EU member states that wrote to the new EU Commissioner for Trade, Cecelia Malmstrom, expressing the view that the consultation was an important step in ensuring that we strike the correct balance to ensure that governments retain their full freedom to regulate.  We also pointed out that it would be important that the outcome of this consultation would run its course and that the views expressed by our stakeholders would be carefully considered before reaching firm decisions on the way forward. <br/><br/>It is important to underline that the EU and the US follow the same principles that guide investment and seek to ensure a level playing field for investors.  These principles recognise the right of Governments to regulate for legitimate public policy objectives.  I will be seeking to ensure that we learn from the experience of the past and that any ISDS provisions in a future Agreement would represent a fair and reasonable option to which investors would have recourse for legitimate reasons.</p></reply>

If a company subsequently engages in illegal activity, then the State&rsquo;s enforcement processes would be set in train to pursue any law-breaking. <br/><br/>I am aware of the very serious anonymous cyber bullying issues which are alleged were associated with users of the former Ukrainian-based social network site, <i>Ask.fm</i>.<br/><br/>In August last, <i>Ask.fm </i>was acquired by another Internet company, <i>Ask.com</i>, which is headquartered in New York.  Ask.com was formerly known as AskJeeves.com and is a well-known mainstream internet site which connects a user's question to multiple and diversely sourced answers.Despite the similarity in name, there was no prior connection between the two companies.  The founders of <i>Ask.fm</i>are no longer involved in its operations and do not retain any equity in the company.  <i>Ask.fm</i>is now a subsidiary of <i>Ask.com</i>and the parent company have decided that it should be legally based in Ireland.  <br/><br/><i>Ask.com</i>has committed to restructuring <i>Ask.fm</i>and has publicly stated that it will initiate a comprehensive safety strategy, with the adoption of moderation and intervention technologies to protect younger audience from inappropriate content and to catch and remove violent, illegal, threatening or harassing content.  They have engaged eminent digital safety experts to pursue this agenda.  It would obviously be a source of serious concern if this or any other Irish registered company were not to actively discourage instances of cyberbullying.  The new parent company of <i>Ask.fm</i>has also stated that it intends engaging with relevant Irish Regulatory Authorities. <br/><br/>I am very conscious of the need to preserve our national reputation, in terms of good corporate behaviour, by companies based here, especially in the Digital sector, which has brought such benefits to the Irish economy.  The Internet poses particular enforcement challenges, but it is reassuring that in this specific case, significant commitments for change have been made by the new owners. The matter of internet safety and the legality of online operations on an ongoing basis is one for which the Minister for Justice and Equality has primary responsibility.</p></reply>

Its aim is to achieve the greatest possible improvement, from genetic and other factors, in the profitability of the national sheep flock for the benefit of Irish farmers and the sheep industry.  Sheep Ireland was formed as a sister company to ICBF, based on the recommendation from the Malone report which proposed a way forward for sheep breeding in Ireland along similar lines to that achieved by ICBF for cattle breeding.  This included an industry based decision making structure and a database to meet the information needs of the sheep breeding sector and the wider industry. </p><p>  Sheep Ireland commenced operations in 2009. Key developments in that year included the following:</p><p>- The creation of the Sheep Ireland database and the establishment of breeding objectives and selection criteria for sheep in Ireland;</p><p>- The establishment of LambPlus, which is the performance recording scheme for ram breeders, the formation of the maternal lamb producers programme, and a central progeny testing system.   </p><p>  My Department has been providing funding towards the establishment of the infrastructure necessary to establish a world class breeding programme since the inception of Sheep Ireland. A permanent representative Board structure for Sheep Ireland was put in place. Following extensive industry consultation in 2011 and 2012 an agreement was reached with stakeholders on a voluntary levy of seven cents per head on all sheep slaughtering as a co-funding mechanism. </p><p>  Sheep Ireland is leading the development of a National Sheep Breed improvement programme, working with pedigree breeders to improve the quality of rams being supplied to commercial farmers. Sheep Ireland has managed to increase the number of pedigree breeders participating in performance recording to almost 500, thereby identifying the most profitable breeding stock. Usage of these highly selected genetically superior males and females has had a major positive effect in commercial flocks across the country. </p><p>  Sheep Ireland also plays a central role in providing breeding values for rams for the Sheep Technology Adoption Programme, rams that eventually end up in commercial flocks.</p></reply>

I understand that Coillte's practice is to sell, lease or develop a limited area of non-strategic land, for purposes other than forestry.  Notwithstanding that land transactions are operational matters for the company, the company has outlined the procedures it follows in relation to the sale of lands. I am advised that all sales must be approved by Coillte&rsquo;s General Manager Operations with potential sales also discussed with the Head of Property Sales and consideration given to a number of factors. The company advise me that the property is valued internally to establish its forestry value and by a competent auctioneer and valuer to establish its commercial valuation in order to determine the Advised Minimum Value prior to offering the property for sale and that the method of sale appropriate to the property is also selected &ndash; tender, auction or negotiation - which is designed to ensure that Coillte can maximise the value received. The company further advise that all sales (except cases where there is no independent access and the only potential purchasers are adjoining landowners) are advertised. I am advised that the next stage in the process is that proposed sales are presented to an internal Signing Off Committee which determines the reserve price and confirms the method of sale with any sale greater than &euro;2m needing Board approval.  Such sales are discussed and approved initially by the Signing Off Committee.  I understand that all sales of property to current or retired Coillte staff members must be approved by the Chief Executive in addition to the normal signing off procedure. When negotiations with the potential purchaser are completed, the sale is returned to the Signing Off Committee for price agreement and &ldquo;Signing-Off&rdquo;.  I am advised that the negotiations are monitored by Head of Property Sales and monthly reports, listing properties sold and relevant details, are prepared for senior management.  </p><p>  I note that the Deputy also refers to the sale of leaseholds. I understand that while these principles and procedures are generally applicable to sales of land and leaseholds, the actual process may vary depending on the circumstances of the case.     </p></reply>

The outcome of the discussions held by this group was the publication, earlier this year, of the Draft Bioenergy Plan. This plan is available on the DCENR website at the following address: <br/><br/>Biomass is defined in the Draft Bioenergy Plan as the &ldquo;biodegradeable fraction of products, waste and residues of biological origin from agriculture, forestry and related industries including fisheries and aquaculture, as well as the biodegradeable fraction of industrial and municipal waste. Biomass can be used in all three energy sectors: electricity, heat, and transport&rdquo;. The vast bulk of biomass in this country is, and will continue to be, provided by the forestry sector. <br/><br/>The Draft Bioenergy Plan identifies the opportunity for the sustainable development of Ireland's bioenergy resources and will be implemented through a number of policy and enabling actions. The Plan recommends the continuation of the REFIT3 scheme which is designed to incentivise the addition of 310 MW of renewable electricity capacity to the Irish electricity grid. The scheme was designed,<i>inter alia</i>, to complement the Bioenergy Scheme by offering a premium tariff for electricity generated from energy crops. The Plan also recommends, subject to State Aid clearance and further Government approval, the introduction of a renewable heat incentive for larger heat users to change to renewable heating solutions. The introduction of such a scheme would further increase the demand for biomass.<br/><br/>Furthermore, a range of measures is recommended to underpin the supply of Irish biomass including continued support for the Bioenergy Scheme and the Afforestation Programme, both of which are administered by my Department. There is also scope for small-scale energy generation from, for example, pig manure and poultry litter. Research on this type of project has been funded by my Department in recent years. Grant aid has also been provided for the installation of biomass boilers to heat glasshouses and mushroom tunnels operated by horticultural producers. <br/><br/>Reflecting the cross-sectoral nature of bioenergy, implementation of the actions arising from the Plan will be coordinated by a Bioenergy Steering Group which will draw on the relevant government departments, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, agencies and stakeholders as appropriate.</p></reply>

As the remit of the Department requires a broad ranging and multifaceted investigative capacity, I decided earlier this year to establish a new Investigations Division, which brings all of the Department&rsquo;s investigation capability, which heretofore existed in a number of areas, into one Division.  I would point out that this new Division incorporates and includes the functions previously undertaken by the Special Investigations Unit. It is headed by a Senior Superintending Veterinary Officer, supported by a team of investigators, some of whom are core members of the team and others to be drawn from areas where their expertise will be beneficial to the conduct of particular types of investigations.  The new Investigations Division reports to an Investigations Steering Group chaired by an Assistant Secretary General. </p><p>  I can assure you that animal welfare remains within the remit of the Investigation Division which will continue to support local inspectorate staff in the implementation of official controls relating to animal welfare.</p></reply>

However I have on-going contact with Minister Noonan to ensure that tax policy reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture.  In this regard I am pleased that the Minister and I could facilitate the Agri-taxation Review, which was published as part Budget 2015.  It gave us a unique opportunity to examine a critical element of Government support to the agriculture sector in the context of the strategy of expansion and increasing exports under Food Harvest 2020.  The Review provides a strong evidence base for continued assistance to the primary sector through taxation measures and it is a clear strategy with specific policy objectives for the future.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture is evidenced by the immediate implementation of the majority of the Report&rsquo;s recommendations in Budget 2015, including 12 new measures, which form part of a strategic policy response to the opportunities and challenges ahead.   </p><p>  One of the taxation policy objectives identified by the Review is to assist succession.  The age profile of Irish farmers is increasing and it is recognised that there are many social and economic reasons why succession management is a challenge for farmers. Assisting succession and the transfer of farms has been a central part of the Government&rsquo;s agri-taxation policy and Budget 2015 included a number of measures to maintain and strengthen that support, specifically:</p><p>- The retention and targeting of Agricultural Relief from Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) to active farmers or to those who lease out land long-term;</p><p>- The retention and enhancement of Retirement Relief from Capital Gains Tax, including two new measures:</p><p>- The extension of the eligible letting period of a qualifying asset to 25 years;</p><p>- For transfers other than to a child under Retirement Relief, as a once-off measure until the end of 2016, the inclusion of conacre lettings as eligible.  I believe that this measure to allow famers who have been engaged in conacre to avail of Retirement Relief if they transfer or move to long-term leasing before the end of 2016 is significant, and will give exit options to a large cohort of farmers.</p><p>- The retention of the current stamp duty exemptions on transfers of land, including the extension of Stamp Duty Consanguinity Relief, i.e. relief to related persons, on non-residential transfers to the end of 2017.   </p><p>  The new measures will be implemented by way of the Finance Bill, which was published recently.  The Bill does not make any reference to farm size but currently makes reference to individuals being eligible if, &ldquo;for a period of not less than 6 years commencing on the valuation date of the gift or inheritance spends not less than 50 per cent of that individual&rsquo;s normal working time farming agricultural property (including the agricultural property comprised in the gift or inheritance) on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profits from that agricultural property&rdquo;.  Alternatively, the land owner may lease out the land long-term (at least 6 years) and still benefit from the Relief. </p><p>  The Minister and I are working closely to ensure that the legislation will cover as many active farmers as possible.</p></reply>

The Environmental Analysis Report on Food Harvest 2020 found that the adoption and use of high technology and best production methodologies at farm production level will yield the best environmental outcomes and result in the most effective mitigation measures.  The new Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014-2020 is being informed by the findings and recommendations in this report and the &lsquo;<i>Marginal Abatement Cost Curve for Irish Agriculture&rsquo; </i>(September 2012 prepared by Teagasc), which identified a number of measures for the abatement of greenhouse gases.<br/><br/>The RDP 2014-2020 has been designed to support the smart green growth message of Food Harvest 2020 and thus encompass the themes of technology, efficiency and sustainability. The main elements of the programme include:<br/><br/>- a substantial new agri-environment/climate scheme (GLAS), which will build on the progress made under REPS and AEOS;<br/><br/>- incentives for on-farm capital investment, which will incorporate support for investments with clear sustainability benefits;<br/><br/>- knowledge transfer and innovation measures including support for the European Innovation Partnership, which are aimed at underpinning farm viability, sustainability and growth through the adoption of best practice and innovative solutions;<br/><br/>-a new beef data and genomics programme will have a range of benefits in terms of sustainability, profitability, animal health and welfare, quality assurance, and herd quality; and<br/><br/>-other supports aimed at collaborative farming, artisan producers and organic farming.<br/><br/>My Department chairs an Agriculture Climate Change Committee, under the auspices of the Food Harvest High Level Implementation Committee which undertakes work on important and urgent issues in the development of national and EU policy on agriculture and climate change.  The Committee comprises representatives of Teagasc, Bord Bia and the Environmental Protection Agency, and has helped to inform the development of a discussion document as part of the low carbon roadmap process under the Heads of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2014.  The discussion document will be made available for public consultation shortly. <br/><br/>Following this public consultation, the agriculture sector low carbon roadmap will be developed and it will take into account the targets in the industry&rsquo;s Food Harvest 2020 strategy as well as existing mitigation commitments.  The roadmap will also outline a longer term view and seek to balance the objectives of allowing the food industry to grow so as to meet the food security challenges that face the world as well as the need to meet future climate change ambition. <br/><br/>While removals of greenhouse gases resulting from the LULUCF sector are not counted towards the European Union&rsquo;s 20% greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for 2020, they are still counted under international agreements and, as such, Ireland has a target to expand forest cover from the current 11% of the land area of the country to 18% by mid century, with all of the expansion coming from agricultural land.  The current forestry programme envisages an annual afforestation programme of 8,000 ha by 2020 with an estimated cost to the state of the afforestation programme since 1990 and out to 2030 of &euro;3.5 billion.  This very significant investment towards climate action will remove an estimated net 5.2 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>per annum over the period 2021-2030.<br/><br/>My Department will continue with its positive engagement with the Commission in seeking a coherent approach to agriculture and land use.</p></reply>

The project is modelled on the well known Greenfield dairy demonstration farm in Kilkenny which annually attracts large numbers of farmers and discussion groups. The Greenfield model involved the establishment of a company to operate and finance the dairy farm. It is highly regarded, and provides a public good demonstration service to all farmers in the dairy sector.  It is envisaged that the Athenry project would operate along similar lines with the aim of demonstrating to farmers, the profit that can be obtained from a well run suckler beef farm.    </p><p>  The Athenry project is an operational matter for Teagasc and its governing Authority, which is representative of the main stakeholder groups in the agri-food sector, including representatives of the farming organisations.   </p><p>  I understand that Teagasc is in discussions with the company in question which is the only meat company to have expressed willingness to assist in the project. It is anticipated that the company would be responsible for managing and financing the demonstration farm similar to the Greenfield project. As a member of the project steering group, Teagasc&rsquo;s role is to provide expert technical advice and to disseminate the research results to farmers. Teagasc is also making available rented lands in Athenry for the project. My Department has only recently been approached by Teagasc to see if some Department owned land in Athenry could be made available and this matter is currently under examination. </p><p>  Teagasc is satisfied that the Athenry suckler demonstration farm will provide very valuable information to all beef farmers and will be a major focal point for discussion groups.   </p><p>  In establishing the beef roundtable discussions, it was identified that more could be done to improve transparency throughout the beef sector. My Department collates the prices paid for domestic cattle on a weekly basis and reports this data to the European Commission in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1249/2008 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 148/2014. To ensure price transparency, results for Members States are published on the DG Agriculture &amp;amp; Rural Development website. The published weekly data includes market prices for carcases and live animals as well as information on production and herd inventories. This publicly accessible information allows stakeholders to monitor the evolution of the market situation in each Member State. </p><p>  There is also a wealth of information available to farmers under the Beef PriceWatch section on my Department&rsquo;s website, including the prices for Steers, Cows, and Heifers across the classification grid, for each DAFM approved factory. </p><p>  My Department recently launched the Beef PriceWatch app which brings together the above information in an easy to use format direct to farmers Smartphone&rsquo;s, tablets and Pc&rsquo;s. The app includes grid prices on a per factory basis for young bulls adding another degree of transparency to the sector.   </p><p>  With regards to slaughter figures, my Department publishes the Meat Market Report weekly within the Beef Pricewatch area of our website which gives details of number of animals slaughtered broken down by category of animal. </p><p>  Finally on the question of livestock breeding and production research I have provided &euro;33m in 2014 for a beef data and genomics scheme to improve breed quality in the suckler herd, in addition to the substantial funding provided to Teagasc, ICBF and AHI. In 2015, the funding provision will be increased to &euro;52m as part of an overall provision of &euro;300m for beef data and genomics over the lifetime of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.   </p></reply>

While the Department employs Inspectors to protect its interests, an applicant employs a forestry company to protect his/her interests and this includes submitting an accurate claim on the applicant&rsquo;s behalf. In line with this, the applicant employed his forestry company, which prepared the claim form in respect of his plantation, together with the species map with the &ldquo;Area Certified by&rdquo; a company professional. This certified claim was submitted in November 2001.   </p><p>  With regard to the applicant making the Department aware of the over-claim, he informed the Single Farm Payment Division in his 2013 application that the over claimed area should be included in his claim for Single Farm Payment. He made the request &ldquo;Move boundary to ditch along forestry&rdquo;. It was this request to increase his Single Farm Payment that led to the discovery of the forestry over-claim. Given the circumstances, there are no mitigating factors to support a reduction in the amount of the overpayment that had to be recouped. (There was no penalty or fine imposed for over claiming.)   </p><p>  The applicant has recently discussed his case with a Department official; and he has undertaken to forward a map outlining what he believes are the correct boundaries of his plantation. On receipt of this map, the matter can be reviewed.   </p></reply>

The person in question was discharged at his own request, not on medical grounds, after 12 years service on 22 June 1989. The question of a medical discharge did not arise. As he had less than the required minimum service in the PDF he was not eligible for a pension under the rules of the Schemes. On his discharge from the PDF, he was paid a gratuity appropriate to his service and rank.</p><p>  Under the Army Pensions Acts a wound (disability) pension may be granted to a former member of the PDF in respect of a permanent disablement due to a wound or injury attributable to military service. Under the Acts, an application for a wound pension must be made within one year of discharge from the PDF. The person in question was discharged from the PDF in June 1989 and first made an inquiry regarding a wound (disability) pension in February 1997. As this was outside of the statutory time limit it was not open to the Department to accept an application.    </p></reply>

The Service has been provided by the Gulfstream IV and Learjet 45 aircraft, which were specifically acquired for that purpose. The Gulfstream IV has the capacity to carry 14 passengers and is tasked with long haul missions whilst the Learjet 45 has a capacity to carry seven passengers and is tasked with short and medium haul missions.  On the 27<sup>th</sup>of July last, the Gulfstream IV aircraft, which has been in service for 23 years, travelled to the Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation facility in Georgia, USA, for its annual maintenance inspection.

UNDOF was established on 31 May 1974 under UN Security Council Resolution 350 (1974).    The current Defence Forces contingent, the 46th Irish Infantry Group UNDOF, comprises 130 troops and consists of a Force Reserve Company and support elements. Their role includes the provision of a Quick Reaction Force which is on standby to assist with on-going operations within the UNDOF Area of Responsibility. </p><p>  In addition to the Force Reserve Company, there are eight (8) other Defence Forces personnel based in UNDOF Headquarters, Camp Ziouani, including the Deputy Force Commander Brigadier General Anthony Hanlon, who took up his appointment on 20 September 2014. </p><p>  Fighting between Syrian Arab Armed Forces and Anti Government Armed Elements has recently escalated in the UNDOF area of responsibility. In August 2014 and in response to the hostilities, the Irish contingent, in its capacity as the Force Reserve Company, dealt with several incidents as requested by the Force Commander UNDOF, including assisting with the safe extraction of members of the Philippine Battalion. </p><p>Given events on the ground and at my request the UN undertook a review of the mission, particularly the capacity of the mission to fulfill its mandate in light of the civil war in Syria. Since then there has been a fundamental realignment of the UNDOF mission with a view to minimising unacceptable risks to peacekeepers, while continuing to implement the mission&rsquo;s mandate.   The Headquarters of the UNDOF mission, including the Irish contingent, has now been relocated from Camp Faouar on the Syrian side of the area of separation to Camp Ziouani on the Israeli side of the area of separation. Movement in the area of responsibility is also restricted. </p><p>  In September 2014, the Presidency of the UN Security Council issued a strong statement, reaffirming the Council&rsquo;s unconditional support for the UNDOF mission and emphasising the importance of maintaining UNDOF as a vital contributor to peace and security in the Middle East. </p><p>  On 12 September, the UN Secretary-General reported to the UN Security Council on recent activities in the UNDOF mission area and the mission was further discussed at a meeting of the Security Council on 20 October. The UN continues to review the mission and the UN Secretary-General will provide regular updates on the mission to the Security Council in this regard. </p></reply>

Tender competitions for defensive equipment for the Defence Forces are conducted by the Department of Defence in accordance with EU procurement guidelines and are open to any individual or country in accordance with the terms of all UN, OSCE and EU arms embargos or restrictions. The matter of barring any country engaged in conflicts contrary to the UN Charter from entering tender competitions would be covered in this context. </p><p>  The principle of competitive tendering for Government contracts is used by the Department of Defence for the acquisition of defensive equipment for the Defence Forces. Central to those procedures is the requirement to allow fair competition between suppliers through the submission of tenders following advertising of the tender competition usually on the e-tenders site in line with the EU Directive on the procurement of Defence and Security equipment. In following the required procurement guidelines and codes, the Department of Defence must deal impartially with all companies that are entitled to enter its procurement competitions and must evaluate tenders on the basis of objective criteria. </p><p>  Investment in new equipment for the Defence Forces, including the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, and the on-going maintenance support of and training on that equipment, is provided for under various Subheads of the Defence Vote. The main particular Subheads involved relate to defensive equipment, military transport, aircraft, ships and naval stores, communications and information technology equipment. </p><p>  Taking into account the level of expenditure involved over the years, a wide range of military equipment is in operational service with the Defence Forces at home and on overseas missions. In that context, it is not the practice to provide any itemised manifest of such equipment purchased as to do so could, in particular circumstances, compromise operational and security factors for the Defence o rganisation.   </p></reply>

Garda actions under the Plan include dedicated high visibility patrols in key commercial and public thoroughfares including Temple Bar. These patrols are informed by crime trends, demand studies and footfall in the areas in question. I am also aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engages extensively with business and community interests in the city centre area with respect to crime prevention, enforcement and policing concerns.</p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the deployment of Garda resources. From my discussions with the Garda authorities I am assured that Garda management in the Dublin Metropolitan Region keep this deployment under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, including with respect to concerns about public order and anti-social behaviour, so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of policing resources.</p><p>  The Garda approach includes focusing resources on specific areas of the city according to need. As part of this, a number of targeted city centre policing operations are in place.</p><p>  These operations include Operation Pier, which concentrates on the South Quays and Temple Bar area. This operation includes the designation of certain areas as &quot;hotspots&quot; for anti-social behaviour and regular uniformed and plain clothes patrols. Other Garda Operations in the city centre include Operation Spire which is focussed on the O&rsquo;Connell Street and North Inner City areas, and Operation Stilts which is an ongoing overt policing operation targeting anti-social behaviour and drug-related crime in Dublin city centre locations.</p><p>  I am conscious of the perspectives of business and community interests about the effects of certain types of crime and anti-social behaviour on the environment for business and leisure and on the overall quality of life for residents. Some of the problems faced are linked to disorder associated with abuse of alcohol and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work closely with a wide range of businesses involved in the entertainment and nighttime economy to address these issues so that people can enjoy themselves without concern for their welfare.</p><p>  Other challenges have their origin in even more complex social phenomena which go well beyond the capacity of criminal justice agencies to address on their own. Dealing with these matters requires a coordinated approach from state agencies involved in social, housing, health and drug treatment services, as well as through partnership with business, community and voluntary groups. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is already a long term partner in a range of local consultative and representative structures in Dublin and elsewhere. I am considering how we can step up this cooperation with a view to developing collaborative solutions to the range of issues which affect policing and the overall quality of the environment in our urban centres, and I intend to engage further with the Garda authorities in that regard.</p></reply>

There are a wide range of issues involved which require consideration and any proposals will be brought to Government in the usual way.<br/><br/>In terms of the trafficking of persons for prostitution and sexual exploitation, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the existing legislative provisions addressing the trafficking of persons for the purposes of exploitation (including sexual exploitation) which can attract significant penalties.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 prohibits trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  Any person found guilty of such an offence shall be liable to imprisonment for life or a lesser term, and at the discretion of the court, to a fine.It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years and-or a fine.<br/><br/>There are also provisions in our criminal law directed at the public nuisances and exploitation associated with prostitution.  Solicitation, by both the client and the prostitute, living on the earnings of prostitution, organising prostitution and running a brothel are all offences under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993.  <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p></reply>

Currently, there are over 4,330 residents in 34 centres across the State under contract to RIA.  Details of all of these centres and the companies or persons RIA has contracted to provide accommodation services are published in RIA's Annual Reports avialable on its website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie. </i><br/><br/>In fulfilling its general accommodation responsibilities, RIA does not own, lease or rent premises from commercial contractors. Rather, it contracts in a comprehensive range of services and facilities, including accommodation, housekeeping and so on, for a fixed sum over the period of a contract.  It is a condition of contract with the RIA that the contractor has good title to the centre, but this does not specify either owning, renting or leasing the building concerned. <br/><br/>From RIA's perspective, the critical criteria is that the contractors can fulfil the terms of their contracts with RIA and are in good standing with the Revenue Commissioners.  There is no contractual requirement for companies providing services to RIA that they be registered in Ireland, although RIA understands that all contracting companies are so registered.  In certain cases, it may well be that the company concerned is unlimited or that the beneficial owners or part-owners include companies registered in off-shore jurisdictions but those are business decisions for the contractors concerned.  It is a condition of the contract that a valid Tax Clearance Certificate from the Revenue Commissioners is provided every year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-11a.590.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014111100071#WRO01400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 291 and 303 together.<br/><br/>The direct provision system is managed by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department.  For the most part, this represents a cashless system with the State assuming responsibility for providing suitable accommodation for asylum seekers on a full board basis.  Currently, there are approximately 4,300 residents in 34 centres across the State under contract to RIA.<br/><br/>Prior to 2003 payments to management companies in the State-owned sector and contractors in the commercial sector were made by the relevant local authority which in turn recouped that expenditure from the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  From 2003 on, RIA has paid the contractors directly. Below is a list showing RIA's expenditure outturn for each of the years 2003 to 2014 inclusive:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Amount</th></tr><tr><td>2014-</td><td>&euro;51.9 million (Estimate)</td></tr><tr><td>2013-</td><td>&euro;55.228 million</td></tr><tr><td>2012-</td><td>&euro;62.329 million</td></tr><tr><td>2011-</td><td>&euro;69.459 million</td></tr><tr><td>2010-</td><td>&euro;79.073 million</td></tr><tr><td>2009-</td><td>&euro;86.509 million</td></tr><tr><td>2008-</td><td>&euro;91.472 million</td></tr><tr><td>2007-</td><td>&euro;83.262 million</td></tr><tr><td>2006-</td><td>&euro;78.728 million</td></tr><tr><td>2005-</td><td>&euro;84.382 million</td></tr><tr><td>2004-</td><td>&euro;83 million (rounded)</td></tr><tr><td>2003-</td><td>&euro;77 million (rounded)</td></tr></table><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>RIA's Annual Reports from 2007 to 2013 inclusive further break down yearly expenditure into the broad headings of 'Commercial', 'State-owned', 'Self-catering', 'Additional Costs', 'Transport' and 'Miscellaneous'.  These Annual Reports are published on RIA's website - www.ria.gov.ie<br/><br/>As has been stated in answers to previous D&aacute;&iacute;l Questions, for commercial reasons, details of current contract rates are not provided.  The policy is that the updating of the table of contracts will take place only at the end of January each year in respect of all financial information up to the end of December two years previously e.g. at the end of January, 2014 the records are updated to end of December 2011.  This policy has been upheld by the Office of the Information Commissioner. <br/><br/>I will forward a more detailed table directly to the Deputies under separate cover showing expenditure details on all RIA contracts for accommodation for the period 2000 to the end of 2011  This will also indicate the names of the contractors concerned.  Contracts RIA has with providers are 'staggered' so that they end at different times of the year.  This allows for flexibility to close centres gradually should numbers begin to decline.  The table being provided to the Deputies will show individual contracts and payments from their beginning to end dates and these do not usually coincide with the calendar year.</p></reply>

Direct provision provides for full board accommodation supports while a final decision is awaited by a person on their protection or any related leave to remain application. Currently, approximately, 4,300 persons are residing in 34 asylum accommodation centres under contract to RIA. <br/><br/>I and previous Ministers have explained before in detail to this House how direct provision came about in  response to a major accommodation crisis that existed at the time of its establishment.  At its high point in 2005, the number of persons residing in direct provision was 8080.  <br/><br/>The existence of the direct provision system over the last 14 years has ensured that the State has been able to ensure that those who claim international protection in this country - and do not have the means to support themselves - have been provided with accommodation and a range of ancillary services including health care and education.  During this period, no asylum seeker has ever been left homeless, and over 52,000 people have been provided with accommodation under the direct provision system since its establishment in 2000.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the Government is committed to making real improvements to the protection process, including direct provision.  We made a number of commitments to this end in the Statement of Government Priorities 2014 &ndash; 2016.  This included a commitment to establish an independent Working Group to report to Government on improvements to the protection process, including Direct Provision and supports for asylum seekers. The terms of reference and membership of the Working Group, under the chairmanship of former High Court Judge Brian McMahon, is published on RIA's website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie</i>.<br/><br/>The first plenary meeting of the Group took place yesterday with both myself and Minister of State &Oacute;'R&iacute;ord&aacute;in in attendance and a work programme was agreed.  I recognise that the issues to be examined by the Working Group are complex and require thorough consideration to ensure that any recommendations are practical and sustainable from a budgetary perspective and do not interfere with existing border controls and immigration policies. The agreed terms of reference do not indicate any timeframe for the Working Group's deliberations but I would welcome a report by Easter.  </p></reply>

Under section 17(3) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, it is an offence for a licensee, with intent to evade the conditions of the license, to take intoxicating liquor from the licensed premises for the purpose of its being sold on the account or for the benefit or profit of the licensee, or to permit any other person to do so. </p><p>  The Government Alcohol Advisory Group considered specific issues relating to distance sales of intoxicating liquor in its 2008 Report. The Group drew attention to the requirement that payment must be made as part of the transaction in such cases, e.g. on-line shopping, and not later on delivery of the product. The Group noted that sales of intoxicating liquor which had been ordered by telephone or otherwise and which were paid for on delivery were illegal transactions and recommended that the Garda&iacute; should target such delivery services with a view to prosecuting the offending licensees.</p><p>  The Government Legislation Programme provides for future publication of the Sale of Alcohol Bill which will update the Licensing Acts and replace them with provisions more suited to modern conditions. This Bill will provide an opportunity to further consider the difficulties arising in relation to the control of distance sales of intoxicating Liquor and the enforcement of such controls.   </p></reply>

The Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency is a statutory service supporting regular school attendance for all school age children and young people. Formerly, this service was carried out by the National Educational Welfare Board. </p><p>  The Agency has advised me that the information the Deputy has sought is not readily available. </p><p>  Where school attendance problems arise for a child, the Agency concentrates on finding solutions within a collaborative intervention framework involving children and their families, schools and other relevant agencies.  This involves an ongoing, evolving and dynamic process of engagement by Educational Welfare Officers of the Child and Family Agency with schools, parents and other support agencies where a child is out of school.  The Agency has advised that this work results in a significant level of positive outcomes for children, which is not readily amenable to data-analysis.  Given the impact of absence from school on a child's learning, this process is always prioritised within the range of Educational Welfare Officers&rsquo; responsibilities.  It is a task that is student-focused and solution-driven, sometimes prolonged and sometimes involving short-term or temporary outcomes.  The primary outcome sought in all cases is a placement in a recognised school or centre for education.</p><p>  According to the Agency, there are a number of reasons why a student may not have a school place at a particular time.  These may include capacity issues in individual schools or in areas of increasing population and correspondingly high demand for school places.  Issues of school capacity generally are a matter for the Department of Education and Skills.  Parents have a right of appeal under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 where a school place has been refused and Educational Welfare Officers are frequently and successfully involved in seeking and achieving alternative placements where schools' decisions to refuse enrolment have been upheld.</p><p>  In cases of expulsion of a student from a school, and where all efforts to resolve matters at school level or through the Section 29 process have failed, there is a statutory obligation on an Educational Welfare Officer to make all reasonable efforts to ensure that provision is made for the continued education of the student concerned.  The first solution sought will always be a placement in another recognised school. Temporary solutions may include home-tuition sanctioned by the Department of Education and Skills, in exceptional circumstances.  In some cases, where all other solutions have failed, the student may engage in an alternative education programme provided by non-statutory or voluntary agencies or organisations. </p><p>  The Agency advises that in the case of students who have difficulty in securing a school place and who have a diagnosed special educational need, Educational Welfare Officers work in close collaboration with the Special Education Needs Organisers of the National Council for Special Education, with the National Educational Psychological Service, with the Special Education Section of the Department of Education and Skills and with Special Schools and other specialist support agencies and providers, to identify and put in place effective solutions to the placement needs of such students.</p></reply>

The majority of children in care, some 93%, are in foster care, and one third of those are placed with relatives.  The budget for Foster Care and Other Allowances is reported by the Agency as &euro;115.2 million for the full year.</p><p>  The Child and Family Agency receives a child into care where it appears that a child requires care and protection that he/she is unlikely to receive unless he/she is taken into care.  If a foster placement is assessed as being appropriate, then every effort is made to match the needs of the child to a suitable placement with a foster family.  In these cases, the child has an allocated social worker who is there to plan and follow up with the necessary reviews.  </p><p>  The Agency is seeking to recruit more foster carers, most recently in particular, foster carers from different ethnic backgrounds and carers interested in caring for teenagers, children with challenging behaviour or children with disabilities. Where a person is interested in becoming a foster carer they must apply to the Agency, through their local office, which will provide advice initially.  If the application is pursued further, the Agency will undertake a rigorous assessment of the person's suitability, a process which includes Garda vetting.  If the applicants are to be placed on a Foster Care Panel, support and training is provided by the Agency.  The carers are provided with a link worker for supervising training and other ongoing supports.  I would also note that the Agency provides funding to the Irish Foster Care Association which provides additional supports to carers.  When a child is placed with a foster family there is a payment made that is intended to support the child's expenses, including activities appropriate to that age group.  </p><p>  The numbers of children who are taken into care can vary from area to area and this is apparent from the statistics that are made available on the Agency's website.  This variation across the country is not unexpected and is co-related with the under 18 years old population and the reported deprivation score by Haase Pratschke (Pobal, 2012).  </p></reply>

Those exempted include childminders taking care of not more than three pre-school children from different families in the childcare provider's own home.  Childminders in this category are not, therefore, required to notify their services and are not subject to the further requirements of the 2006 Child Care Regulations, which include the requirement to ensure appropriate vetting of all staff, students and volunteers in the service who have access to children</p><p>  Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991 was amended under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, and revised Child Care Regulations as required under those amendments are currently being developed.  Part VII as revised retain the exemptions in the original Part VII, including those exemptions applicable to childminders.  </p><p>  The exemption provided to childminders with fewer than three children recognises parental choice to place children with friends and neighbours, and the challenges of the over-regulation of the more informal arrangements chosen by parents.  Such childminders are encouraged to voluntarily register their service with their local City or County Childcare Committee.  Both registered and voluntarily registered childminders can avail of the Childminders Tax Exemption which exempts childminding earnings of up to &euro;15,000 from income tax.  My Department will continue to promote the voluntary registration of childminding services and the participation of childminders in quality and training programmes.  However, the Department is not in a position to prevent parents from entering into informal arrangements with childminders who are outside the scope of the Regulations. </p><p>  Some &euro;10 million of funding, allied to the childminders supports, was invested over a period of 10 years to encourage childminders to notify their service.  This was seen as a potential first step to ensuring that non-family childminders were subject to all of the requirements of the Regulations.  This stepped approach has worked in some countries, such as Scotland.  However, only 1,250 childminders voluntarily notified in this country and a further 2,000 to 3,000 participate in training.  It is clear that there are barriers specific to Ireland in bringing childminders under the regulatory framework.  </p><p>   The Early Years Strategy will include consideration of how this complex issue might be addressed in the future.  </p></reply>

Recent examples include a consultation for the appointment of the new Ombudsman for Children, input for the Department of Education and Science Digital Strategy for Schools, and the development of a participation structure for the GAA.<br/><br/>I would also point out that the participation of children and young people is a core value in how Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, discharges its statutory functions under the 2013 Act.  In that regard I would refer the Deputy to the information on the Tusla website , which outlines the resources available to Tusla staff to support the participation of children and young people in decision-making.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-11a.693.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014111100073#WRQ02000"><p>My Department administers five childcare funding programmes: the universal free preschool year, known as the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), and four targeted programmes, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and three Training and Employment Childcare Programmes, Childcare Education and Training Programme (CETS); Community Employment Childcare (CEC) and Afterschool Childcare Programme (ASCC) which provide childcare supports to eligible parents returning to work or to education.  These programmes developed on an adhoc basis and were introduced at different times but in general very quickly.  My Department has therefore been running these programmes without a strong ICT infrastructure.  This means that systems are not efficient and in particular that payments can be slow to respond to changing circumstances.  It also means that there is limited access to information from the programmes.  It has always been the Department's intention to move to an integrated approach to support the programmes, and after considerable analysis work, my Department and Pobal are in the process of implementing a new management platform for the early years programmes &ndash; called the Programmes Implementation Platform (PIP).  PIP is an online system which will streamline the administrative processes across childcare funding programmes.  <br/><br/>The objectives of PIP are to reduce paperwork and duplication of effort and to simplify administration to enhance the service experience of childcare service providers and the other stakeholders involved; City/County Childcare Committees, Pobal and DCYA.  This new development will provide a more comprehensive, integrated set of management processes, more efficient work practices, greater visibility and control of funds and commitments and will substantially improve the capacity of the Department, City and County Childcare Committees and services on the ground to dynamically manage service by service and case by case approvals and changes in each of the programmes.<br/><br/>PIP is being rolled out incrementally. The launch of the first stage of PIP, &lsquo;Child Registrations&rsquo;, began on the 6 October 2014.  To date, childcare service providers have registered over 60,000 children for the ECCE Programme and the local City/County Childcare Committees have registered over 3,500 children for the various TEC Programmes.<br/><br/>The introduction of new ICT infrastructure tends to result in issues emerging and PIP has been no exception.  Technical issues, such as those specifically detailed by the Deputy, did result in service providers experiencing delays in registering children on the system.  On 15 October, while over 30,000 children had already been registered on the system for the ECCE Programme, my Department took the decision to issue a further advance payment to service providers to allow for those service providers who had experienced delays or difficulties to complete their registrations.  While acknowledging the inconvenience for service providers not receiving accurate balancing payments as early as possible, the decision was taken to ensure that all service providers were to receive sufficient advance funding to honour any financial commitments, rather than to delay all payments until the technical glitches on PIP were resolved.  <br/><br/>Three of the issues raised by the Deputy to the PPSN checker, which is the responsibility of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The introduction of immediate checking of the validity of PPS Numbers is a key element of the improvements introduced by PIP, as it will mean instantaneeous validity checks.  This replaces the previous unwieldy and long process that involved my Department sending batches of PPS numbers to the Department of Social Protection for checking.  This was a major cause of delays in validating eligibility and therefore payments.  On the PIP Child Registration Form, during the first few weeks of the launch a number issues arose with the PPSN Checker.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform speedily addressed issues as they emerged and service providers continued to get updates on the PIP Homepage, which is hosted on the Pobal website (), on how to manage these issues while registering.<br/><br/>I can assure the Deputy that both my Department and Pobal are working together to address issues as PIP develops, and I am confident that once the system is fully operational the Childcare &lsquo;Programmes Implementation Platform&rsquo; will prove to be extremely beneficial and efficient for all users for years to come and in particular will significantly improve the situation for service providers.</p></reply>

The policy framework adopts an outcomes approach based on five national outcomes for children and young people, the first outcome is &lsquo;Active and Healthy&rsquo;. One of the aims under this outcome is that all children are physically healthy and able to make positive health choices.  The Framework includes a range of government commitments, with responsibility across a number of Departments, to tackle this issue of childhood obesity. <br/><br/>My Department is represented on the Special Action Group on Obesity which has progressed a range of measures to tackle this issue.<br/><br/>The Area Based Childhood (ABC) programme 2013-2016 is a &euro;29.7m programme which is being co-funded by my Department and the Atlantic Philanthropies, to improve outcomes for children in some of our most disadvantaged areas.  Some of the initiatives are encompassing empowering healthy choices for children and families, in relation to diet and exercise, as part of a holistic approach to improving children&rsquo;s lives.<br/><br/>It is widely accepted by researchers that there is a strong link between physical activity and overweight, and habits formed in youth tend to carry over into adulthood. The Growing Up in Ireland Study also clearly confirms this finding.  Young people who took more exercise were less likely to be <i>overweight </i>or <i>obese</i>, especially in comparison to those who never exercised.  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I have responsibility for Play and Recreation Policy which has been set out in &lsquo;READY, STEADY, PLAY! A National Play Policy&rsquo; and the &lsquo;National Recreation Policy for Young People&rsquo;, both of which seek to actively promote the participation of children and young people in play and exercise.</p></reply>

The HSE's Integrated Audiology Programme is overseeing a number of developments that will reduce these numbers shortly. Included in these developments is the validation of all waiting lists to produce a more accurate assessment of priorities, the recruitment of nine new graduates in mid 2014 and the establishment of otitis media screening clinics run by public health nurses and area medical officers. A prioritisation system has been put in place to ensure that the more urgent cases are seen sooner. </p><p>  More specific accurate data regarding waiting times should be available in January 2015.</p></reply>

The cumulative effect of a reducing allocation, cessation of NTPF funding and reduction in income in 2014 has limited surgical capability.</p><p>  Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital has a total of 7 operating theatres. I have been advised that, while there is sufficient consultant staff available to provide services to meet demand requirements, not all theatres have been in use in 2014. This is a factor of both financial capability and availability of suitably qualified nursing staff for theatre.  In terms of access, urgent patients continue to be prioritised and Cappagh Hospital has advised that due to strict chronological booking policies, all patients attending the hospital are being offered dates for surgery based on their waiting time to surgery with due regard to clinical categorisation.</p><p>  I understand that the HSE is in active engagement with Cappagh hospital to examine and agree options for optimising the available theatre resources and to ensure patients have timely access. I have also been advised that day case and outpatient 2014 activity targets will be achieved this year and it is expected that Cappagh will be in a position to carry out additional activity before year end. I am also meeting with the Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson of Cappagh Orthopaedic Hospital shortly to explore with them mechanisms to ensure optimal use of resources at the hospital. In relation  to the query raised I have asked the HSE to provide you with the number of orthopaedic procedures by type that have been carried out at Cappagh Hospital for the years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and projected for 2014 and the amount of funding provided to the hospital for each of those periods.

The current wait time on the placement list is at about 15 weeks which is of course a matter of concern for me, and my Department and the HSE are working to ensure that the resources that are available are deployed in the most effective way possible and deliver the best outcomes for older people. This will require an integrated approach across community, residential and other service areas. </p><p>  The HSE controls the release of funding to manage the funds that are available across the course of the year. Funding is released to approved applicants according to their place, in order of their approval date, on the National Placement List. Over the course of the year to date, demand for funding has exceeded what could be released and the National Placement List has grown as a result. </p><p>  In July this year, the HSE allocated &euro;5m for an initiative to improve access to appropriate care for older people.  To date this has funded over 300 transitional care beds for patients in acute hospitals who are on the NHSS National Placement List and over 200 home care packages to assist patients in the acute hospitals who require a home care package to be discharged. </p><p>  In Budget 2015 a further &euro;25 million has been allocated to alleviate the problem of delayed discharges.  This will be applied across community and residential services to improve Placement List waiting times and to relieve the pressure in acute hospitals resulting from beds being taken up by those who no longer require acute care.</p><p>  The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, which will be completed in the coming months, will include consideration of the future balance between community and residential services and the longer-term sustainability of the Scheme.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable. It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need. Patients with the greatest level of need are provided with treatment by the HSE. Information on waiting times is collated by the HSE by region. The most recent information on waiting lists relates to the third quarter of 2014. In the Dublin Mid Leinster region, which includes Co.

The first stage in the designation process, involving a detailed consultation with the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, is now underway.</p><p>  The Health and Social Care Professionals Council and the registration boards established under that Act are responsible for protecting the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training  and competence  amongst the professions designated under the Act. The 12 professions currently designated under the Act are clinical biochemists, dietitians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists. </p><p>  Psychotherapists and counsellors are not currently regulated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005. However, the Act provides that the Minister for Health may, under section 4(2), designate a health and social care profession not already designated if he or she considers that it is in the public interest to do so and if specified criteria have been met.</p><p>  My predecessor, Deputy James Reilly, wrote to the The Health and Social Care Professionals Council in May of this year advising it of his intention, in the public interest, to designate by regulation the profession or professions of counsellor and psychotherapist under the Act. The Act provides that the Minister for Health is obliged to consult with the Council in the first instance concerning a proposed designation and to give interested persons, organisations and bodies an opportunity to make representations to the Minister.  The Council has been asked to advise on a number of issues concerning the proposed designation and requested that it take into consideration the recently published report of Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) on the academic standards necessary for the accreditation of courses in Counselling and Psychotherapy.  This is an essential element as it will inform, for the purpose of registration, the assessment by the registration board, when established, of the qualifications of those currently in practice.  </p><p>  This is the first stage in the consultation process under the Act and I expect to receive the Council's report in the coming weeks. I will proceed to the next stage which will involve a much wider consultation when I have fully considered the Council's report.  While a number of issues remain to be clarified including decisions on whether one or two professions are to be regulated, on the title or titles of the profession or professions, and on the minimum qualifications to be required of applicants for registration, I intend to progress the regulation of counsellors and psychotherapists as a priority.  I hope to be in a position to make the necessary designation regulations next year.  I will then seek expressions of interest from qualified persons available for appointment to the new registration board that will be established to regulate counsellors and psychotherapists.</p></reply>

Taking account of the &euro;35m  announced in the recent Budget, and including specific funding allocations since 2012, a total of &euro;125m additional ring-fenced funding has been been provided by the Government for mental health since coming coming into office.  This funding has been allocated towards upwards of 1,100 new staff for the ongoing re-configuration of community mental health teams, in particular, and to underpin the development of a recovery-focussed and community-centred service. Bearing in mind the many competing demands on both the wider Health budget and Exchequer funding generally, this represents a substantial ongoing commitment to our mental health services. <br/><br/>Historically, funding for the mental health services constituted a high proportion of overall health spend in Ireland. In part, this reflected the traditional emphasis on an institutional model of service delivery with a clinical care focus. While funding may have been a higher than the recent percentage of 6.1% quoted by the Deputy, much of this funding would have been spent on what was considered a staff-intensive and relatively expensive model of service. In addition, historically other areas of the overall health budget in Ireland may not have received an adequate level of funding appropriate to a modern community-focussed health service.  This has been rectified in recent times in, for example, the primary and community care areas, whose development is also important for users of social care services such as people with mental health issues. <br/><br/>In line with A Vision for Change, the HSE mental health service is now moving towards a more person-centred recovery model of care, with an increasing focus on community delivery. This model of service is widely agreed to be more focussed on the needs of the service user in the first instance. It is also considered to be more cost effective and aims for a planned greater integration of services across the primary and community care sectors over time.  Therefore, while every effort will be made to maximise resources for mental health, the promotion and resourcing of positive mental health extends on a much broader range of HSE service areas.  In this context, a certain degree of caution is recommended when comparing mental health spent with that in other countries as the structure and funding of wider health and personal social care systems can vary significantly from country to country. </p></reply>

Only those who are formally diagnosed with a mental disorder by a Consultant Psychiatrist may be detained under the Act.<br/><br/>Section 8(2) of the Act specifically prohibits the detention under the Act of individuals who suffer from a personality disorder, are socially deviant, or are addicted to drugs or intoxicants.  Where individuals with such conditions are also diagnosed with a mental disorder, then they may be subject to detention but only because of the presence of a mental disorder.<br/><br/>While the Expert Group review of the Mental Health Act is to be completed in the coming weeks, I have no expectation that a change along the lines proposed will be recommended in the review.  I would not accept that individuals with addiction problems should be treated without their consent unless there is also a diagnosis of a mental disorder by a Consultant Psychiatrist. <br/><br/>Treatment is of course available to individuals with addiction in the normal way.</p></reply>

I am aware too of the difficulties with the infrastructure at the Rotunda but as the Deputy will be aware, it is intended to relocate the hospital.  The 2008 KPMG Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin Area recognised that for optimal clinical outcomes, maternity services should be co-located with adult acute services, and specifically, that the Rotunda should be moved to the Mater site, the Coombe Hospital to Tallaght Hospital and the National Maternity Hospital to St Vincent's University Hospital.  With the decision to develop the new Children's Hospital at the St James's campus and the relocation of the National Maternity Hospital already underway, the previous plans in respect of the Coombe and the Rotunda must be reviewed.  That review has now commenced and will be completed in early 2015. </p><p>  Pending the redevelopment of the Rotunda, there is provision in the HSE's Capital Plan for upgrading the electrical distribution system, the boundary wall and the hospital mortuary.

Over the course of the current Strategy, the focus of the national addiction services has been broadened to provide a comprehensive substance treatment service capable of dealing with all substances.   Opiate treatment services are now widely available outside the greater Dublin area and overall waiting times for opioid substitution treatment have been reduced.  More generally, there have been  improvements in access to substance misuse treatment.  The latest figures available from the HSE at the end of September 2014 indicate that 97% of substance misusers over 18 years accessed treatment within one calendar month of assessment and 97% of those under 18 accessed treatment within 1 week. In addition, through the Pharmacy Needle Exchange Programme,  accessible harm reduction services have been expanded outside Dublin and 130 community pharmacies have been recruited and trained to provide needle exchange services. </p><p>  A National Drugs Rehabilitation Implementation Committee (NDRIC),  chaired by the HSE and including representation from relevant Government departments and agencies and the community and voluntary sectors,  is overseeing the roll out of a national integrated model of care.   This model is based on an interagency approach to the delivery of rehabilitation and shared care planning to ensure that service users access the range of supports required to assist them in their recovery.  This model has been piloted in 10 sites across the country and following evaluation is being rolled out nationally. </p><p>  The Report of the HSE Working Group on Residential Treatment &amp;amp; Rehabilitation (Substance Misuse) published in 2007, provided a detailed analysis and overview of known residential treatment services at the time and advised on the future residential requirements of those affected by drug and alcohol use.  The report indicated that current provision was 672.5 beds comprising 38 residential detoxification beds and 634.5 residential rehabilitation beds.  The most recent figures available from the HSE indicate that there are now 804 residential beds, comprising 23 inpatient unit detoxification beds, 117 community-based residential detoxification beds, 4 adolescent residential detoxification beds, 642 residential rehabilitation beds and 18 adolescent residential rehabilitation beds.  This represents a substantial increase of almost 20% on the 2007 figure. </p></reply>

The introduction of smoke free campuses is a matter for the HSE. </p><p>  One of the principles outlined in  Tobacco Free Ireland, is the denormalisation of tobacco use.  Making smoking less attractive to children and young people, and increasing its social unacceptability are essential elements of this policy. The development of further smoke-free areas as recommended in Tobacco Free Ireland, including tobacco free playgrounds, education campuses, child care and health care facilities, will play a part in this regard. The Department of Health is in the process of preparing legislation which will prohibit smoking in cars where children are present. </p></reply>

There is a link between consumption and harm and evidence that affordability is one of the drivers of increased consumption.  The Government has approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse, to be incorporated in a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  These measures are based on the recommendations contained in the <i>Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy</i>, 2012.The package of measures to be implemented will include provision for minimum unit pricing, regulation of the marketing and advertising of alcohol, regulation of sports sponsorship, structural separation of alcohol from other products in mixed trading outlets and labelling of alcohol products.  <br/><br/>The Government has decided that minimum unit pricing is the most effective policy measure to deal with the sale of alcohol at cheap prices.  Minimum unit pricing is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels per gram of alcohol that must be legally observed by retailers in both the on and off trade sector.  This is a targeted measure, designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices.  It is mainly aimed at those who are higher risk, such as adolescents and people who have a harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption pattern.  It should therefore only have a marginal effect on moderate drinkers.  It is not expected that minimum unit pricing will affect the price of alcohol in the on-trade sector or the majority of alcohol products sold in the off-trade sector.  Work on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation is continuing and it is hoped to publish a General Scheme of a Bill shortly.  <br/><br/>My colleague, Frances Fitzgerald, Minister for Justice and Equality has responsibility for the Licensing Acts 1833 - 2011.  A 3-step approach to provide for the structured separation of alcohol from other products in mixed trading outlets has been agreed between our Departments.  This involves replacing the current Responsible Retailers of Alcohol in Ireland voluntary code of practice on the sale and display of alcohol in mixed trading premises with a statutory code under Section 17 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 and after 2 years both the Department of Health and the Department of Justice and Equality will review its effectiveness in achieving the policy objectives of Section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008.  I understand that Minister Fitzgerald hopes to be in a position to launch a consultation process of the draft statutory code of practice shortly.</p></reply>

However, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda continued to use the procedure until 1984, almost twenty years after it had largely ceased elsewhere in Ireland.  <br/><br/>Spontaneous symphysiotomy may occur during childbirth at any time, but this is not covered under the terms of this Scheme as it is not a deliberate surgical intervention.  The reference to 1992 may relate to such cases.  <br/><br/>Government's advice, based on the evidence available, is that the procedure of surgical symphyiotomy ceased around 1984.  The time period for the Surgical Symphysiotomy Payment Scheme was extended to 1990 in order to be certain to catch any case that may have occurred after 1984.  If the Deputy is aware of  a surgical symphysiotomy case in 1991 or 1992, I would welcome the details.<i></i></p></reply>

The latest phase on &lsquo;treats&rsquo; launched on 19th September 2014.  Other measures include a choice of healthy foods and drinks in vending machines in post primary schools; Treatment Algorithms for adults and children and opportunistic screening and monitoring for earlier detection of overweight and obesity in children. The Department of Health has worked with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, with regard to the marketing of food and drink to children for the revised &quot;Children&rsquo;s Code to Restrict Marketing of High Fat, High Salt and High Sugar Foods and Drinks.&quot; <br/><br/>Ireland has been  involved in the World Health Organisation European Region Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative since Round 1 in 2008 and we are encourages by recent results of Round 3 which show a plateau in high levels of obesity in 7 year olds.<br/><br/>Progress has also been made with the publication of Healthy Eating Guidelines, the calories on menus initiative and the Report on the Recommendations to reduce consumption of high fat, salt and sugar foods and drinks from the Top Shelf of the Food Pyramid.  As part of our EU Presidency in 2013, Ireland led on the development of an EU Childhood Obesity  Action Plan which is now in the implementation phase. We are also leading a Work Package in the forthcoming EU Joint Action on Nutrition and Physical Activity.  We are gathering evidence across the European Union on the cost and the impact of childhood obesity and forecasting the social and economic burden for 2020 and 2025.<br/><br/>My Department is also in the process of developing an Obesity Policy which will include measures to tackle overweight and obesity in adults, with special emphasis on children, as prevention is a primary objective in tackling obesity.</p></reply>

The European Centres for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), in its latest risk assessment has concluded that the risk of a case in the EU is considered to be low; however the increase in cases in the affected countries means that the risk of a case being imported into Europe has increased.  Environmental conditions in Ireland however do not support the natural reservoirs or vectors of any of the viruses that cause VHF.  Consequently, the risk of transmission of Ebola in Ireland is considered very low.  The HSE has confirmed that there have been no confirmed cases of Ebola in Ireland. <br/><br/>The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) is the forum for managing the interface between the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive during the planning and response phases of a public health emergency.  NPHET has met five times since 10 October to coordinate health services response.  It now intends to meet every two weeks reflecting the greater level of preparedness that has been put in place in recent weeks.  <br/><br/>The EVD Coordination group meets to coordinate preparedness on cross-sectoral issues.  It includes representatives from a number of Government Departments and State agencies.  It has met eleven times since 15 August.  The EVD Transport Sub-group, which coordinates preparedness in the transport sector, is meeting regularly to resolve issues at ports and airports.<br/><br/>The HSE has developed a communications strategy for dealing with Ebola.  It was developed in the context of the media protocol developed in conjunction with the Government Information Service.  It will be regularly updated as the situation evolves and lessons learned.<br/><br/>The HSE has established a cross directorate group to fast track the training of front line health care staff.  Additionally the Acute Hospitals Directorate has established an Ebola response management group to increase preparedness across all Hospitals<br/><br/>All hospitals have been instructed to have on-going training in PPE, targeting specific groups.  An assessment on training and deadlines for training completion was completed by all hospitals and is being analysed to guide the development of training.<br/><br/>Extensive information has been provided for hospital clinicians, general practitioners and other healthcare workers, to enable rapid identification of suspected Ebola patients, in other settings, and their urgent management by the Health Protection and Surveillance Centre (HPSC).<br/><br/>A number of hospitals have or are planning shortly to undertake simulation exercises, building on the recent exercise held by the National Isolation Unit in the <i>Mater Misericordiae</i>Hospital.<br/><br/>An interagency exercise is being planned based on exercises undertaken in other EU countries.  This will be tailored to improving preparedness in the Irish context.<br/><br/>The HSE has distributed has Emerging Viral Threats pack sent to all GPs, Co-ops and Balseskin refugee centre GPs.  The PPE contained in the distributed packs continues to be fit for purpose.<br/><br/>The HSE is liaising with the airports and ports to provide information for staff, including holding information sessions.  The HPSC has published guidance for Airport Managers and Airlines, Port Managers and for educational settings.  It is also liaising with the Revenue Commissioners concerning guidance for customs officers.  The HPSC have produced specific information for travellers and people who have returned recently form affected areas.  Advices have also been produced for people intending to work with aid agencies in the affected countries.  Information posters have also been produced, and are on display in airports.  Advices have also been produced for airports and ports and for educational settings.<br/><br/>The National Isolation Unit (NIU) located at the <i>Mater Misericordiae</i>Hospital, Dublin, is the national referral centre for high risk suspected and confirmed cases of Ebola.  The self-contained unit has 12 beds and is designed to admit, isolate and treat patients suspected or diagnosed with highly infectious diseases that are referred from all over Ireland who have both hazardous and highly infectious diseases.  There are no plans to treat Ebola cases in other acute hospitals.<br/><br/>In Ireland, all VHF diagnostic tests will be carried out in the BioSafety Level 3 facility at the National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL), Dublin.<br/><br/>All elements of the Irish response to date  are based on best practice and take account of national and international best practice, and will be reviewed when new information becomes available as the situation evolves.  My Department continues to work closely with the HSE, other government departments, the WHO, the ECDC, the EU Commission, Member States and other partners to coordinate measures to tackle the Ebola epidemic and to protect Irish citizens.  </p></reply>

This is an increase of 3,736 or 7.5% on August 2013.  </p><p>  In August 2014 the number of patients waiting in excess of 12 months for an outpatient appointment has decreased from 84,167 to 41,604; a reduction of 51% when comparing the same periods in 2013 and 2014. Furthermore, the percentage of patients waiting more than 12 months has decreased from 22% in August 2013 to 11% in August 2014.  Up to the end of August  there has been a 3% increase in outpatient attendances compared to 2013; this equates to 64,289 additional patients seen. Although the increased provision and uptake of outpatient appointments is positive, it is likely to result in some additional demand for in-patient and day cases.</p><p>  The trends indicate that waiting lists are likely to continue to increase in to next year. The capacity to provide services for these patients has been curtailed by increased emergency admissions and delayed discharges.  The HSE continues to seek improvements in the provision of elective surgery, medical and outpatient services through reform, facilitation of local level initiatives, strict adherence to the National Waiting List Protocol and relevant HSE Clinical Programme guidelines and networking of services between hospitals in the new Hospital Groups. The Government has provided additional funding of &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges and thereby improve timeliness for admissions from Emergency Departments and waiting lists.  The plans to address in-patient and day-case waiting lists are being considered in the 2015 Service Planning process which is currently underway and progress in this area will be a priority for hospital groups throughout next year.  </p></reply>

However, given the need to ensure delivery of essential services, arrangements have been in place in the HSE to allow the recruitment of staff where it has been established that there is an urgent service requirement. In addition the moratorium did not extend to consultant recruitment and more recently NCHD recruitment was facilitated given the need to progress EWTD compliance. This policy has resulted in overall medical/dental numbers increasing by 700 since the end of 2007. In the current calendar year the fall in nursing numbers has been reversed with an increase of about 150 nurses in the period to from January to the end of September.</p><p>  In order to mitigate the impact on frontline services of the overall reduction in employment numbers, the priority was and is reform of how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.  The revised working arrangements provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement are a pivotal element in this regard. In addition, while it is necessary to continue to control public sector employment, the focus in 2015 will be on budgetary control,enabling the health services to appoint staff where more efficient and economical delivery of services can be achieved.</p></reply>

In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government to a significant strengthening of primary care services, the HSE's National Service Plan 2013 provided for additional funding of &euro;20m to support the recruitment of prioritised front-line primary care team posts and enhance the capacity of the primary care sector (&euro;18.525m for 264.5 front-line Primary Care posts and &euro;1.475m to support Community Intervention Team development).<br/><br/>The breakdown of the 264.5 posts by Region is as follows:<table><tr><th>HSE REGION</th><th>Public Health <br /><br />Nurses</th><th>Registered <br /><br />General Nurses</th><th>Physiotherapists</th><th>Occupational<br /><br />Therapists</th><th>Speech and Language Therapists</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin Mid-Leinster</td><td>38.5</td><td>8.5</td><td>24</td><td>12.5</td><td>23</td><td>106.5</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North East</td><td>12</td><td>9.5</td><td>14.5</td><td>9</td><td>14.5</td><td>59.5</td></tr><tr><td>South</td><td>12</td><td>8.5</td><td>7</td><td>18</td><td>6.5</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>9.5</td><td>14</td><td>2</td><td>13</td><td>8</td><td>46.5</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>72</td><td>40.5</td><td>47.5</td><td>52.5</td><td>52</td><td>264.5</td></tr></table><br/><br/>At the end of October 2014, a total of 232.5 posts (88%) have been filled.  A further 4 posts have start dates agreed and the remaining 28 posts are still going through the recruitment process.  In addition, 17 WTE Primary Care based Clinical Diabetes Nurse Specialists posts have been recruited, enabling better support and integration of diabetic patients in the community and supporting General Practitioners in the delivery of diabetic care.  In 2014, more than half of the total health expenditure on operational services is in the community healthcare sector.  The 2014 gross current Budget Day Estimate for the Health Service (including Children and Families) is &euro;13.120bn.  Based on the above, the proportion of the health budget aligned to primary care in 2014 is approximately 25%.  <br/><br/>The HSE recently published the report, <i>&lsquo;Community Healthcare Organisations &ndash; Report and Recommendations of the Integrated Service Area Review Group&rsquo;</i>, which sets out how health services, outside of acute hospitals, will be organised and managed.  Community healthcare services include primary care, social care (involving services for older persons and for persons with a disability), mental health and health &amp;amp; well-being.  The establishment of nine Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) and 90 Primary Care Networks will see the further reconfiguration of staff to front line integrated services.<br/><br/>I am confident that the resources outlined above along with the implementation of the CHO Report will facilitate the delivery of the Government's commitment to refocus health care away from the hospital setting and into the community, which is an essential component of the health service reform process.</p></reply>

I believe that was achieved in Budget 2015, with an increase in the exchequer allocation of &euro;305 million. When taken together with once-off increased projected revenues of some &euro;330 million and savings and efficiencies of &euro;130 million ,the HSE will have over &euro;750 million more to fund services in 2015 that it did when preparing its Service Plan in 2014.<br/><br/>This does not mean that all areas of concern across the health service can be addressed immediately but it does make the funding situation more manageable.<br/><br/>Despite this additional spending power, next year remains a real challenge: our rising and aging population, the increase in chronic conditions with our progress in screening for cancers and chronic diseases means more people requiring treatment driving up demand and costs.<br/><br/>I aim to ensure that the existing level of services is maintained in 2015 and that some targeted enhancements are introduced.<br/><br/>I have already signalled that Programme for Government commitments on the extension of BreastCheck and investment in mental health will be honoured. Extra funding of &euro;25million will be provided to tackle the issue of delayed discharges, which is having a detrimental knock on effect on waiting times and emergency department overcrowding. In 2015, we will deliver on the first phase of Universal Health Care and some 240,000 children under 6 years and approximately 10,000 seniors over 70 years, who currently neither have a medical card non a GP visit card will be provided with a GP service without fees. <br/><br/>I want to continue the work of my predecessor Minister Reilly in further developing and building the Hospital Groups by putting in place Boards, CEOs and senior management teams and strategic plans.<br/><br/>I also want to take an active role in promoting healthy living. Changes in lifestyle can prevent many diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and lung disease. Other priorities for the remainder of the Government term include the following:<br/><br/>1 Stabilise cost of health insurance<br/><br/>2 Reduce cost of medicines<br/><br/>3 Retaining doctors and nurses<br/><br/>4 Five Major Capital Projects<br/><br/>5 Universal Patient Registration.<br/><br/>It is of course of the utmost importance that patient safety remains an overriding priority across the health service and this will be reflected in the 2015 service plan. </p></reply>

Eligibility for health services in Ireland, as set out in the Health Act 1970 as amended, is based primarily on ordinary residence and means. All people ordinarily resident in the State are eligible for publicly-funded hospital services. In addition, about two-fifths of the population are eligible for publicly-funded primary care services. </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Director-General of the HSE established an Expert Panel to examine and recommend the range of medical conditions that would be considered as a basis of eligibility for health services.  The Expert Panel was chaired by Prof Frank Keane, Past President of the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland and Clinical Lead, National Clinical Programme for Surgery. The panel included a range of 23 clinical experts from primary care, specialist services and therapies. It also included a patient representative. The work of the Expert Panel was also informed by on-line public consultation and the convening of a patient representative forum to consider the issues.</p><p>  The Keane report was received by my Department last month and I am considering its findings. The Keane report acknowledged that eligibility is a complex and challenging issue. It is widely known that the report concluded that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions for medical card eligibility.</p><p>  This is a very detailed report and when I have finished considering its conclusions, discussed them with the HSE and consulted as necessary with the Minister for Public Expenditure and the Attorney General, I will be reporting to Government on the matter.</p></reply>

The current pharmacy based model results in over 70 million items being dispensed annually through local pharmacies across the State, including low population centres in rural areas. It enables pharmacies to receive deliveries each day from multiple wholesalers ensuring that all patients have continued access to essential medicines without delay. Under this model, as the drugs are purchased by individual pharmacies with no direct input by the HSE, there is no scope for the type of  central procurement arrangement envisaged by the Deputy. </p><p>  Establishing an alternative centralised distribution centre capable of distributing 70 million items across the State would be extremely difficult to achieve and would absorb any potential savings available to the HSE from directly purchasing medicines. </p><p>  Under the Memorandum of Understanding with the Troika, Ireland committed to increasing the share of generic drug usage in the medium-term. In Quarter 2 2014 generic products accounted for 64% of the total off-patent market by volume.  My Department has set a target of achieving 70% generic penetration of the off-patent market by volume by 2016.</p><p>  A number of enabling measures are being implemented to achieve this target, in particular, the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  </p><p>  In October 2012 a  new agreement on the pricing and supply of generic drugs was reached with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry.  Under this Agreement the maximum price the HSE pays for generic products was 50% of the initial price of an originator medicine, this was further reduced to 40% from 1 May 2014.  This has resulted in the price differential between off-patent drugs and most generic equivalents increasing from 5% to approximately 20%.</p><p>  The Medicines Management Programme within the HSE has introduced the preferred drugs initiative which facilitates more cost-effective prescribing particularly in relation to high-cost medicines.  It continues to engage with general practitioners to reinforce the message around safe, effective and cost-effective prescribing including generic prescribing.</p></reply>

These services and supports which are co-ordinated by the HSE National Advocacy Unit are intended to provide that individuals receive tailored assistance to address their specific requirements, where appropriate.  It is acknowledged that treatment and individual medical needs may need to be reassessed over time to take account of changes in their condition or circumstances.  </p><p>  The ex-gratia health supports include clinical care pathways to ensure access to rapid diagnosis and treatment, multidisciplinary assessments led by clinical experts, counselling services for both the individuals and their families, discretionary medical cards for those who have been diagnosed have been provided to allow unlimited access to GP care and any prescribed medication, ex-gratia reimbursement of vouched expenses incurred in the process of diagnosis and treatment, including travel expenses for attending medical appointments; physiotherapy, occupational therapy assessments, dental  assessments and dietary services all on a needs basis.

These include special education home tuition, the provision of supplemental learning support/resource teaching support on a needs basis and the provision of Special Needs Assistants (SNA) support if required.  Furthermore, reasonable accommodations, including special examination centres and rest breaks were provided for students who sat state exams in June this year.  Similar arrangements will be available on a needs basis to students sitting state exams in future years.  The Department of Education and Skills issued circulars providing information to schools on the nature, likely symptoms, possible effect of the condition of narcolepsy on students and the supports available for students.</p><p>  With regard to third level, students diagnosed with narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination can access the Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) scheme, which is a college/university scheme which offers enhanced access routes to third level education.</p><p>  All health and educational services and supports will continue to be provided on an ex-gratia basis.

Our concern at the conviction and sentence was first conveyed by the Irish Ambassador accredited to Pakistan (from Ankara, Turkey) to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Islamabad in 2013. The Ambassador also expressed our disquiet at the nature of Pakistan&rsquo;s blasphemy law. Last week, on 6 November, our Ambassador to Pakistan visited Islamabad. In the course of his meetings there, he raised this case with a senior Foreign Ministry representative, noting that her case is a matter of grave public concern in Ireland.Officials in my Department also keep in regular contact with the Embassy of Pakistan on this and other issues. We recently raised the case, and our concerns regarding the blasphemy laws and persecution of Christians generally, with the Embassy of Pakistan.<br/><br/>Pakistan underwent a &lsquo;Universal Periodic Review&rsquo; of the human rights situation in the country at the United Nations Human Rights Council in October 2012.  At this review, concern was expressed about this case and calls were made for Pakistan to consider adopting an official moratorium on the death penalty.  During the process, Ireland recommended that Pakistan take all appropriate measures to combat and prevent discrimination against religious and other minority groups, including by removing educational material which could serve to perpetuate discrimination.<br/><br/>At EU level, freedom of religion or belief and freedom of opinion and expression play a central role in the EU&rsquo;s dialogue with Pakistan.  The High Representative for Foreign Affairs of the European Union, Catherine Ashton has expressed her concerns at the judgment, and others like it, on numerous occasions, and has called on Pakistan to respect human rights as guaranteed under international conventions.<br/><br/>In June 2014, the EU issued a Declaration on violence against women in Pakistan, expressing deep concern at the wide-spread violence perpetrated against women there.<br/><br/>The fifth meeting of the EU-Pakistan Joint Commission, which reviews EU-Pakistan bilateral relations annually, met in Islamabad on 24 June 2014. On human rights, the EU, while acknowledging efforts of the Government of Pakistan to strengthen human rights infrastructure in the country, expressed its concern on a number of issues including freedom of the media, freedom of religion and belief and the situation of women.<br/><br/>On 18 October last, a spokesperson for the European External Action Service expressed sadness and deep concern at the High Court decision to uphold this person&rsquo;s conviction, and called on Pakistan to ensure for all its citizens, full respect of human rights as guaranteed by international conventions to which it is party. The spokesperson further noted that the EU considers the death penalty a cruel and inhumane punishment and expressed the hope that the verdict would be appealed to the Supreme Court and struck down swiftly.<br/><br/>The issue of the death penalty in Pakistan and this case were also the subject of a statement made on behalf of the EU High Representative/Vice-President Catherine Ashton at a plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg on 22 October last. In the course of that Statement, it was noted that the EU, and particularly its Delegation in Islamabad, would continue to follow the case closely and would continue to advocate for the verdict to be overturned and for the person concerned to be released. While not trying to intervene in an ongoing court case, the Statement noted that the EU would use any opportunity to raise this case and the wider issues of the death penalty and blasphemy law, with Pakistan.<br/><br/>The EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Mr Stavros Lambrinidis also visited Pakistan at the end of last month,  where he held an in depth dialogue with the Pakistan authorities on key human rights issues.<br/><br/>Ireland attaches great importance to the fundamental human rights of freedom of thought, conscience, religion or<font color="#FF0000"> </font>belief.  We are aware of the vulnerable situation of persons belonging to religious minorities in Pakistan and will continue to raise this case and others bilaterally with the Pakistan Government as well as through the framework and mechanisms of the European Union and the United Nations.  </p></reply>

The Travel Advice pages provide relevant information on a vast range of countries and issues that people travelling should be aware of, and pages are updated frequently.  On the Travel Advice webpage for Turkey, as is the case with all other country-specific pages, citizens are strongly advised to obtain comprehensive travel insurance before travelling.  The separate &lsquo;Know Before You Go&rsquo; section of the Department&rsquo;s website also gives detailed information about the type of cover that we would recommend in travel insurance. Having such insurance ensures that citizens have best prepared themselves for unfortunate eventualities like illness and hospitalization abroad, and the costs that can arise in such cases.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the internal medical or health care systems or costs in another country.</p></reply>

In common with other Departments, the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade has sustained substantial staff reductions under the moratorium on recruitment.  Permanent Departmental staff numbers have fallen approximately 200, or about 13%, since 2009.  In order to try to ameliorate the impact of the ongoing reductions in staffing, a major re-structuring of the Department&rsquo;s Headquarters operations was completed in early 2012.  Other functions and staff are routinely reorganised or reallocated to maximize continuity of work output and minimise disruption to service delivery to the citizen.  For succession planning reasons, and on foot of comprehensive workforce planning exercises undertaken by my Department, exceptional sanction was received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform over the last two years to promote a number of officers to the grades of Counsellor and First Secretary to fill gaps created mainly by retirements. Sanction was also received to recruit a number of Third Secretaries, the entry grade to the diplomatic service, to fill existing and emerging vacancies in the grade at home and abroad.  The first appointments from this competition were made in April 2014 and a total of 27 new Third Secretaries are now in situ, with a further 2 to join the Department over the coming weeks.  These promotions and recruitment have constituted the main steps to counteract the loss of talent and experience from the diplomatic grades which has taken place over the last number of years.   I acknowledge that retirements at senior level represent a significant loss of experience and talent for the Department. In this regard, it is important that we recognise the contribution this outgoing generation of officials has made to the advancement of our country at home and abroad, including through active involvement in the Northern Ireland peace process, promoting our trading and cultural links, ably representing Ireland at the EU and UN and other international fora, and building our globally-acclaimed development cooperation programme.</p><p>  However, the recent recruitment and promotion of very high-calibre officers is helping to offset this tangible loss of experience, and is bringing an infusion of talent into the various grades and functions across my Department.  In addition, focussed training opportunities are being provided to staff at all levels so as to ensure that the service provided by our officials remains at a very high level.</p><p>  My Department will continue to assess its staffing requirements in the period ahead as part of its ongoing workforce planning process, in tandem with the setting of strategic priorities through the forthcoming Foreign Policy Review and Statement of Strategy.  </p></reply>

The Inspectorate has, in recent years, given students a greater voice in the evaluation process. As a result:<br/><br/>- Inspectors interact with students during inspections, and in whole-school evaluations at post-primary level they meet with a focus group of students<br/><br/>- To strengthen the voice of students in evaluations, the Inspectorate introduced confidential learner questionnaires as part of whole-school evaluations in primary and post-primary schools in 2010. These questionnaires collect information on the views of students about the work of the school and their experiences at the school.<br/><br/>- Between September 2010 and December 2012, over  35,900 learner questionnaires were administered by the Inspectorate in primary schools and over 26,500 learner questionnaires were administered in post-primary schools. <br/><br/>- The learner questionnaires are confidential. They are processed in the Evaluation Support and Research Unit (ESRU) of the Inspectorate and a copy of the analysed statistical data from the questionnaires is made available to the inspectors conducting the evaluation and to the school. The data is used as an important source of evidence by the inspection team. <br/><br/>Other examples include:<br/><br/>The establishment of student councils in primary and post primary schools to give students a voice.  Data from latest Lifeskills survey (2012) indicate that 14% of primary and 97% of post primary schools have established student councils.My Department will continue to encourage the establishment of student councils in schools<br/><br/>The work by the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) to ensure that the voice of the child contributes to the development of policy and service delivery in relation to the provision of psychological services to schools and children<br/><br/>On-going consultation with children and young people as part of the revision of curricula, including the Primary School Curriculum and the Junior Cycle  Curriculum.<br/><br/>Children and young people were consulted on the Digital Strategy for Schools.  As part of the  internet safety awareness initiative of the PDST Technology in Education initiative, the views of young people are sought through the Webwise Youth Advisory Panel.<br/><br/>Young people working as apprentices have their views represented on the National Apprenticeship Advisory Committee through their union representation.  The views of apprentices also informs the work of the Education and Training Boards, the Institutes of Technology and SOLAS.<br/><br/>My Department's continued commitments to the voice of the child will form part of the strategy on Children and Young People's participation in Decision Making which is being developed by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. </p></reply>

My Department's opinion is that the level of investment required would be greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. However, a total estimate of this amount has not been quantified. Further consideration of this issue would also have to take account of pricing adjustments in the period since the publication of the NCSE report.<br/><br/>In light of the very difficult economic situation and the significant costs involved in fully implementing the EPSEN Act, the previous Government deferred the full implementation of Act.<br/><br/>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.<br/><br/>These reports include the NCSE policy advice on Support Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools (2013) and The Report of the Working Group on a Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for pupils with Special Educational Needs (2014). <br/><br/>It is intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.</p></reply>

This Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. </p><p>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice are respected.</p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.

Under these arrangements schools that are given provisional approval for a teaching post on the basis of provisional enrolments in September 2014 must hold open one vacancy to cater for the redeployment of any surplus permanent teachers that arise later in 2014 (either in the school with the provisionally approved post or in a neighbouring school).  Holding open a vacancy means that the teaching post can only be filled on a fixed term basis up to Friday 24 October, 2014. The post to which the Deputy refers was such a post, i.e., a developing school post approved on a provisional basis. Following the recent staffing appeals process the post was affirmed on a permanent basis. However, the post was required for the redeployment of a surplus permanent teacher in a neighbouring school.

Where children have significant care needs whereby they may need additional support to be able to attend school, the NCSE may make an allocation of SNA support to the school to assist that child.</p><p>  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>  The Circular explains that a key goal of SNA support is to help children to develop their independent living skills, and that continued and ongoing access to SNA support is generally not desirable for post-primary students, unless essential, as it can impede their independence and socialisation needs at an important developmental stage of their life.</p><p>  Accordingly, whereas SNA support will be provided to post primary schools when required, only pupils with chronic and serious care needs will normally be allocated SNA support in post primary schools. In considering applications for SNA support from post primary schools the NCSE will take into account the importance of the requirement to allocate necessary care supports with the right of a child to acquire personal independence skills.</p><p>  I understand that resource teaching support is still being provided for the pupil referred to in the Deputy's question.</p><p>  Should the school wish to appeal their SNA allocation or to make a new application for SNA support on behalf of this child the school may make such an application to the NCSE. All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or on the basis of some other criterion. The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves.</p><p>  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to publish its enrolment policy.</p><p>  Equality legislation, which also outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values. The legislation provides that any school that has this objective may admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students.</p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Educational Training Board or to the Secretary General of my Department.</p><p>  The Child and Family Agency, is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The Agency can be contacted at 01 6352854 or by E-mail at info@tusla.ie.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that Government gave approval in March of this year for drafting the Education (Admissions to Schools) Bill 2014 and drafting is currently underway.</p><p>  The objective of the Admissions to School Bill is to provide an over-arching framework to ensure that how schools decide on who is enrolled and who is refused a place in schools is more structured, fair and transparent.</p><p>  A key objective in designing the framework is to create greater confidence for parents that the admission criteria laid down by schools are legitimate, reasonable and fair.</p></reply>

The establishment of a high performance utility will lead to lower costs and improved services in the future, providing much better outcomes for customers and the environment.  Details of Irish Water&rsquo;s costs are outlined in its revenue and water charges plan which was reviewed by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). Details of the review and the CER&rsquo;s decision are available at <font color="#0000FF">.</font><br/><br/>Irish Water&rsquo;s costs in the coming years will be funded through a mix of revenue from the domestic and non-domestic sector, third party finance (such as the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, EIB, bank lending and capital markets facilities) and State support which may be in the form of both equity and subvention. The CER announced its decision on water charges on 30 September 2014. The amount billed to domestic customers for the year 2015 based on the charging structure announced by the CER will be in the order of &euro;300 million and the amount billed to non-domestic customers would be some &euro;230 million. The Government also decided to provide the following funding to Irish Water in 2015 and 2016:<br/><br/>- An average subvention of &euro;537m in each of the two years, conditional on the annual average domestic water charges to end 2016 for households with both supply of water and treatment of waste water not exceeding &euro;240; and<br/><br/>- Provision of just over &euro;400m in 2015 and 2016 to support increased investment in public water services, including the provision of a &ldquo;first fix scheme&rdquo; by Irish Water.<br/><br/>This funding package for 2015 and 2016 builds on the funding being provided to Irish Water in 2014, which includes &euro;239 million in capital funding by way of a capital transfer (&euro;185m) and a convertible loan (&euro;39m,) which will be used to primarily fund the core capital expenditure programme of Irish Water.<br/><br/>In addition, Irish Water will receive a subvention of some &euro;440m million from the Local Government Fund in 2014 which will fund water related expenditures incurred heretofore by local authorities and met by local authorities from their own resources, non-domestic water charge revenues and general purpose grants from the Fund. It is anticipated that Irish Water will finance other costs from non-domestic water charge revenues and from borrowing. <br/><br/>In relation to the 2013 finances of Irish Water, details are set out in the 2013 Annual Report and Financial Statements of Bord G&aacute;is which are available online at <font color="#0000FF">.</font></p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. <br/><br/>The approach to charging was outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan which it submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act.  On 30 September 2014 , the CER issued a determination on the plan and full details and associated documentation are available on the CER website at the following link:.<br/><br/>No changes have been made to the water charges plan since the CER determination.  Consideration is currently being given to measures to bring the necessary certainty and clarity to the charging structure to ensure water charges are modest and affordable. </p></reply>

The report concluded that the best way of ensuring increasing efficiency and effectiveness of operations and capital investment and accessing new finances for the water sector, was to establish Irish Water as a public utility.

This includes, in accordance with section 94 of the Electoral Act 1992, the provision of a sufficient number of polling stations, conveniently distributed for the accommodation of the electors entitled to vote there.  Guidance issued to Returning Officers by my Department in advance of electoral events advises that when schools are used as polling stations, every step should be taken to ensure that schools are not closed unnecessarily and that disruption of school work should be kept to a minimum. The Guidance advises that, where possible, school halls should be used instead of classrooms and that voting compartments and other equipment should be fitted up and dismantled after school hours. The Guidance also advises that it is open to returning officers to hire a hall or other premises if they consider it to be appropriate. Electoral law provides that a returning officer may, for the purposes of taking a poll and counting the votes, use a school or any room in a school free of charge.   </p></reply>

The rates of duty applicable for half yearly and quarterly options are 55.5% and 28.25% of the annual charge respectively.  This additional cost element takes account of the extra workload for staff in motor tax offices and the National Vehicle and Driver File unit, and the resultant administrative costs and printing costs that arise, including the issuing of renewal notices.  The estimated annual income from the increased charges for half-yearly and quarterly vehicle licences is in the region of &euro;50m. A loss in income from this source would have a negative impact on revenue and would have to be borne elsewhere in the motor tax system   or through the taxation system generally.</p><p>  I have no plans to adjust the basis for paying motor tax on a half-yearly or quarterly basis currently.   </p></reply>

The <i>National Inspection Plan 2013: Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems</i>was adopted and published by the EPA in February 2013.  The Plan provided for a minimum of 1,000 inspections to be carried out by the local authorities in the 12 month period up to July 2014.  The EPA subsequently informed the local authorities that a further 500 inspections on a pro-rata basis should be carried out during the period July to December 2014. Details of the minimum number of inspections to be carried out in each county are included in the Plan.<br/><br/>My Department does not have any direct role in monitoring the implementation of the EPA&rsquo;s Plan by the local authorities.  However, the EPA has conducted an interim review on the implementation of the National Inspection Plan for the period from July 2013 to February 2014. The report, which is available on the Agency&rsquo;s website at , contains a breakdown by county of inspections that have taken place and the number of non-compliant treatment systems for which advisory notices were issued.<br/><br/>On 4 November 2014, the EPA informed the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht that of 987 inspections carried out, 476 of the treatment systems failed the inspection.  The Agency has indicated that it intends to carry out a review of the first year&rsquo;s operation of the inspection plan and I understand that a public consultation regarding this review will be undertaken with the aim of developing a new inspection plan for the three years commencing in January 2015.  The number of inspections to be carried out under the new plan is a matter for the EPA.<br/><br/>Applications for grant aid in respect of remediation works are submitted to, and processed by, the local authorities who then seek recoupment of the amounts paid from my Department.  There is no specific fund set aside for the grants scheme.  Grants are recouped to the local authorities, on a demand - led basis, from my Department&rsquo;s Rural Water Programme.  Details of thegrants recouped by my Department to date are set out in the following table. <br/><br/><b>SEPTIC TANKS 2014</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>No. of Grants</th><th>Amount Drawn</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>4</td><td>15,300.06</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry </td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>2</td><td>6,500</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>1</td><td>4,000</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>1</td><td>4,000</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>7</td><td>25,714.32</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>1</td><td>3,161.75</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>3</td><td>6,360.40</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>19</td><td>65,040.53</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This is in line with the &ldquo;polluter pays principle&rdquo; which is a firmly established feature of both domestic waste policy and legislation.  This will require an overhaul of existing structures, but I believe that this can be achieved without distorting the tyres market in Ireland, without encouraging customers to buy tyres outside of the jurisdiction and without widespread job losses.  Moreover, I believe that such a scheme could be provided for without introducing any new costs, but rather by effectively formalising the existing charge that is already applied to almost all tyre purchases.</p><p>  Arising from the work of the Tyres Working Group, which includes representatives from across the waste and tyres industries, my Department has now received proposals for the future management of waste tyres from the Independent Tyre Wholesalers and Retailers Association (ITWRA) and the Irish Tyre Industry Association (ITIA).  While it would have been my preference for all sides within the industry to come together in support of a single proposal, the separate proposals are being considered by my Department.  I expect to receive recommendations arising from this consideration very soon and, once I have made my decision, I will engage once more with all sides of the tyre industry to collaborate in putting in place the detailed legislative underpinning for the operation and enforcement of the new system.</p></reply>

Under the Decision, emissions in the year 2013 should be no more than the average of those same emissions in the years 2008 to 2010.  In the year 2020, the target is that emissions should be 20 per cent below their value in 2005.  The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020.  Over-achievement in any one year can be used in any other year where there is under-achievement.  Furthermore, there are various other flexible mechanisms available to Member States to reach their targets such as Certified Emissions Reductions, that is, the unit of the Clean Development Mechanism as defined under the Kyoto Protocol, along with the inter-Member State trading of units.<br/><br/>The EPA has recently projected that Ireland's cumulative distance to target for the period 2013-2020 will range between 1 and 17 Mt CO2e for the period as a whole.  In the event that the units currently held in the national portfolio are not sufficient to meet any deficit, it is possible that Ireland may acquire additional compliance units from other Member States or through the carbon markets.  Analysis by my Department suggests that this eventuality, should it arise, will not arise until 2020 or thereafter.<br/><br/>The extent of the challenge posed by these emission reduction targets is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development and the General Scheme of the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill, both of which were published in April this year.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by the Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy.  Proposed statutory authority for the plans is set out in the General Scheme of the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill.<br/><br/>In anticipation of the planned legislation, work is already underway on developing a low-carbon plan - the National Low-Carbon Roadmap to 2050 - the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures and identify additional measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low-carbon transition agenda.  As I am satisfied that Ireland is on course to comply with the annual mitigation targets in the first half of the 2013 to 2020 compliance period, the immediate focus of the national low-carbon road - mapping process will be the compliance challenge in the years 2017 to 2020.</p></reply>

Along with the direct support for economic activity in rural areas, the Programme has increasingly provided support for community activity which ensures the maintenance of vibrant communities that are a critical component of a healthy rural economy.  Funding under the LEADER elements of the 2007-2013 Programme is now fully committed.  However, I expect that the LEADER element of the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme will commence during 2015 and there will be potential to fund community projects where they are identified as a priority in the Local Development Strategy for the area.<br/><br/>My Department supports the Community and Voluntary Sector in its contribution to an active, democratic and pluralist society.  There is a particular focus on supporting communities that are vulnerable, disadvantaged or under threat through a suite of schemes.  A community organisation may qualify for inclusion under one or more of these schemes, should it meet the terms and conditions of a particular scheme managed by my Department.<br/><br/>Pobal, a not-for-profit organisation, manages a significant proportion of this funding on behalf of my Department under both the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP) and Dormant Accounts Measures.<br/><br/>In addition, my Department also provides funding directly to a number of other organisations under the LCDP.  The LCDP is one of my Department&rsquo;s main social inclusion programmes, aimed at tackling poverty and social exclusion in disadvantaged communities.  It is a key tool of Government in providing employment supports, training, personal development/capacity building and other supports for the harder to reach in the most disadvantaged areas in society.  There are 50 Local Development Companies (LDCs) contracted through Pobal on my Department&rsquo;s behalf to deliver the LCDP, with 35 of those also delivering the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 (RDP) throughout the country.  The current LCDP officially ended at the end of 2013 having operated for four years with funding of &euro;281m over that period.  It is being implemented on a transitional basis for 2014 with a budget of &euro;47m pending the roll out of the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) in April 2015.<br/><br/>The SICAP is one of my key priorities.  The Programme&rsquo;s target groups are:<blockquote>- Children and Families from Disadvantaged Areas;<br /><br />- Lone Parents;<br /><br />- New Communities (including Refugees/Asylum Seekers);<br /><br />- People living in Disadvantaged Communities;<br /><br />- People with Disabilities;<br /><br />- Roma;<br /><br />- The Unemployed (including those not on the Live Register);<br /><br />- Travellers;<br /><br />- Young Unemployed People from Disadvantaged areas.</blockquote>In accordance with the Public Spending Code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of services to clients, the Programme is subject to a public procurement process, which is currently underway.  Stage one (Expression of Interest) has been completed.  Stage two (Invitation to Tender), got underway on 20 October and involves the successful applicants from Stage one being invited to apply to one or more Local Community Development Committees, in Local Authority areas, to deliver the programme.  Contracts for SICAP will be determined following the outcome of the procurement process.<br/><br/>The procurement process for SICAP is open to Local Development Companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new Programme.<br/><br/>In addition, the Seniors Alert Scheme is a community-based initiative that promotes independent living for older people in their own homes.  The Scheme is administered by more than 900 local community and voluntary groups, full details of which are available at </p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it.  The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.</p><p>  The Act defines a customer as the occupier of the premises in receipt of water services.  As such, third level students who have moved away from home to an alternative primary residence will be liable for water charges.  Management companies of student accommodation are already categorised as non-domestic customers for water services.  Local authorities, acting as agents of Irish Water, continue to bill non-domestic customers and therefore continue to bill such companies who recover this cost via the fees charged for the accommodation.  Students who are tenants in private rented accommodation will be liable for water charges, similar to other utility supplies, but will also be eligible to claim the household allowance being provided by Irish Water.</p><p>  Irish Water is currently undertaking a customer verification exercise to obtain the details of customers in receipt of services from Irish Water.  This process gives tenants, including students, the opportunity to apply and avail of their relevant allowances and this will continue until the deadline date for applications which has been extended to 30 November 2014.  After this date Irish Water has advised my Department that it intends to initiate a further campaign to allow landlords to provide proof that their property is occupied by a tenant and that they are not the occupant.  This will remove liability from the landlord in compliance with Section 21(5) of the Act.</p></reply>

Like other commercial semi-state bodies, pay models are negotiated between management and unions and are then subject to a ballot as necessary.  This occurred in Ervia&rsquo;s case and the pay model was implemented in 2011.<br/><br/>The Government will shortly consider proposals to establish a unified board arrangement for Ervia and Irish Water.

The overall aim of the Directive is to maintain high and good status waters where they exist and to restore waters that do not currently support aquatic ecosystems adequately. River basin management planning, structured in 6-year cycles, is the tool prescribed by the Directive for achieving these aims.  In July 2010, the first cycle River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) for Ireland were published, covering the period up to 2015. The RBMPs describe the measures planned to protect and improve Ireland&rsquo;s water environment covering rivers, lakes, groundwater, transitional (estuaries) and coastal waters.</p><p>  My Department is currently conducting a public consultation in respect of the second cycle of River Basin Management planning in Ireland. In accordance with the requirements of the Directive, an economic analysis will be carried out to estimate the potential costs of implementing the second cycle in Ireland. This will allow for informed decision-making on the programme of measures to be undertaken in the second cycle to achieve the most cost-effective and best possible outcomes for the investment in measures.</p><p>  I published in July 2014 a consultation document setting out the timeframe for the implementation of the second cycle and the consultation period remains open until 31 January 2015. In mid-2015, I intend to publish, and engage in consultation on, an interim overview of the significant water management issues in Ireland and this will provide context for the measures to be undertaken as part of the second cycle RBMPs. As outlined in the consultation document, it is likely that finalised second cycle RBMPs will be published by end-2017.</p></reply>

An extensive public consultation process was undertaken in 2012 to inform the development of the revised building control regulations which came into effect on 1 March 2014.

This is to ensure households in this sector receive equivalent support, while allowing for any transitional issues, to sustain improvements in quality in the group water sector. There has been an initial formal engagement in relation to the future subvention of the group water sector with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes.    The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has proposed to continue to treat public group water schemes in the interim regulatory period as non-domestic customers. As such, current tariff arrangements, as applied by local authorities prior to 1 January 2014, will continue to apply for the foreseeable future. </p><p>  The Government remains committed to continuing to support the sector as an important element of the water industry in Ireland, founded on co-operative community and voluntary engagement, and to invest in the sector to sustain and improve quality standards and performance. Against this background, the future approach to the supervision of the group water sector and funding in relation to both capital and operational subsidies will be determined by my Department in due course, in consultation with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes. </p></reply>

It was a policy decision of the Government to establish Irish Water as a public utility and this is reflected in Water Services Acts 2013.  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and that the CER must perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of customers of Irish Water. Section 32 of the Act provides that Irish Water shall submit a code or codes of practice to the CER for approval and the CER may modify any such code. A code of practice made under section 32 can include, inter alia, a provision for customer complaints to Irish Water in relation to provision of water services, the standards for the performance by Irish Water of its functions and any other matter the CER considers necessary and appropriate to secure the interests of customers of Irish Water. In discharging its functions, the CER may consult with Irish Water, the public, or any other person it considers appropriate.  Irish Water also has a statutory obligation to comply with any direction from the CER in relation to the approved codes. Irish Water&rsquo;s approved codes of practice can be found on its website, at .<br/><br/>Similar to the approach it has taken in the electricity and gas industries, the CER has required Irish Water to submit a Customer Handbook outlining the minimum requirements of customer service standards they will provide to their customers. The Customer Handbook comprises Irish Water&rsquo;s Customer Charter, Codes of Practice and the Terms and Conditions of supply. Following a public consultation on the document earlier this year, the CER have recently published the approved Irish Water Customer Handbook on their website , at.<br/><br/>The CER and Irish Water have also agreed to enter into a voluntary 'Dispute Resolution Agreement' which will set out agreed working arrangements and processes to deal with customer disputes. The Irish Water Code of Practice on Complaint Handling has been updated to reflect this agreement. In addition, the CER will be engaging with both Irish Water and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop complementary complaints processes to ensure customers are directed in an efficient manner to the appropriate organisation with their complaint or query. In this regard, it should be noted that Irish Water is also subject to statutory supervision by the EPA and the Health Service Executive in respect of any environmental and human health aspects of its water services provision.</p></reply>

This will include a national tender for the supply and installation of personal monitored alarms, which was publicly advertised on eTenders on 20 October 2014. A panel of regional suppliers will be contracted to provide the equipment within specific regional areas. </p><p>  Monitoring has always been the responsibility of the beneficiary and this is not changing. There are no implications for existing installations in respect of the Pobal tender competition, however, under the new arrangements, Pobal are also providing a facility for beneficiaries to choose from a panel of monitoring companies or to continue with their current monitoring company. In this regard Pobal will also set up a panel of pre-qualified telecare service providers, who provide monitoring services and this was publicly advertised on eTenders on 6 November 2014. </p><p>  This new approach will reduce the administrative burden for the many hundreds of community and voluntary groups registered under the Scheme and it will enable the groups to concentrate on the main purpose of the Scheme, namely to interact with the elderly in the local community. </p></reply>

The Act also provides that the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) will be responsible for the economic regulation of Irish water and the charges to be levied by Irish Water will be subject to the approval of the CER.  The Act provides specific mechanisms for the issue of Ministerial policy directions to the CER.  A direction was issued to the CER under Section 42 of the Water Service s (No. 2) Act 2013 in July 2014 in relation to a number of matters relating to domestic water charges, including that for social and environmental reasons, there should be no standing charge for domestic customers. A copy of the direction is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Group Water Schemes that are supplied by way of a connection to the public water supply network will have previously been non-domestic customers of the relevant local authority and will therefore now become customers of Irish Water. Under the arrangements determined by the CER, the existing charges for non-domestic customers will remain in place pending a further consultation. My Department understands that there may be some Group Schemes where local arrangements may have applied; the future arrangements in relation to these schemes will be resolved as soon as possible. There are other Group Water Schemes that have their own water sources - these will not be customers of Irish Water and will continue to operate as before.</p></reply>

This is to ensure households in this sector receive equivalent support, while allowing for any transitional issues, to sustain improvements in quality in the group water sector.  There has been an initial formal engagement in relation to the future subvention of the group water sector with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes.  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has proposed to continue to treat public group water schemes in the interim regulatory period as non-domestic customers.  As such, current tariff arrangements, as applied by local authorities prior to 1 January 2014, will continue to apply for the foreseeable future.</p><p>  The Government remains committed to continuing to support the sector as an important element of the water industry in Ireland, founded on co-operative community and voluntary engagement, and to invest in the sector to sustain and improve quality standards and performance.  Against this background, the future approach to the supervision of the group water sector and funding in relation to both capital and operational subsidies will be determined by my Department in due course, in consultation with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes.</p></reply>

These grants are in addition to the vehicle registration tax (VRT) reliefs of up to &euro;5,000, and it was the early policy ambition in Ireland that 10% of the vehicle fleet would be electric by 2020.<br/><br/>However, the extent to which EVs are adopted in the short-to-medium term will depend on a range of factors including,<i>inter alia</i>, the strength of the economy, the overall numbers of new cars being purchased, the cost of purchasing and running electric vehicles compared to fossil fuel comparators, and the number of different electric vehicle models available to purchase.  Overall within the EU, demand for EVs has been lower than originally anticipated.<br/><br/>To date in Ireland, grant support has been provided for the purchase of 532 new vehicles of which 250 were grant aided in 2014.  The grant scheme will remain open for this year and, subject to finalisation of the budgetary arrangements, continue into next year.</p></reply>

Better Energy Homes provides a financial incentive to private homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their homes.  Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying Building Energy Rating (BER).  Since its commencement in March 2009 the scheme has delivered energy efficiency measures to almost 161,000 homes around the country.  It is anticipated that &euro;10m will be drawn down by the scheme in 2014.  Whilst there has been a decline in grant applications for the Better Energy Homes scheme this has been largely offset by a surge in applications under the Better Energy Areas and Communities Schemes which provide grant funding for locally and community-based projects, including homes.  The Government has committed a total of &euro;57million in Exchequer capital funding for the Better Energy Programme this year.</p><p>  My Department is currently examining a range of options with regard to the future to the Better Energy Homes scheme.  The options under active consideration include simplifying procedures to make the scheme more accessible to householders and engaging with local actors including energy suppliers, credit unions and local authorities to promote and initiate action at a community level.</p><p>  In addition, a project team is examining the scope for introducing a Better Energy Financing (BEF) model in Ireland.  This will be centred on introducing consumers to a journey of successive home improvements leading from shallow to deeper retrofit in a manner and over a timeframe that is suited to individual circumstances.  This approach will take account of economic realities, while also providing assurance that even the smallest job is done to specification and with the full protections of the BEF scheme&rsquo;s governance arrangements.</p><p>  The BEF project team is currently engaged in reviewing the design and development of the necessary technical, administrative and financial pillars that are required to underpin the scheme, as well as carrying out a detailed analysis of similar schemes in other jurisdictions.  Under the umbrella of the Better Energy programme a number of BEF pilot projects will be undertaken next year alongside the current grant based supports which will be continued in 2015.</p></reply>

The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5bn in network upgrades and at least 1.6m of the 2.3m addresses in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next number of years.  In the last month alone, two companies have announced projects to deliver direct fibre connectivity to approximately 500,000 homes and businesses in every county in Ireland including Ballina, Westport and Castlebar in County Mayo.  These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>  The purpose of the National Broadband Plan is to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of where they are located, benefits from a high quality, high speed broadband service.  This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments, such as those I have already mentioned, and a State-led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.</p><p>  Under EU State Aid Guidelines Member States cannot intervene where commercial investors have plans to roll out services.  My Department is currently finalising a national map which will identify those areas that require a State intervention.  An initial examination has already identified a significant number of areas that will require State intervention.  It includes 104 areas in County Mayo including Hollymount.</p><p>  I understand that at least one operator has published a programme to roll out fibre based broadband networks in 39 locations in County Mayo by July 2016.</p><p>  As part of the mapping process, a stakeholder consultation was launched in June.  32 submissions have been received and non-commercially sensitive versions of these responses were published by my Department last month.</p><p>  I expect to publish the map shortly.  Those accessing this map will be able to identify their own house or premises and see whether it is in the proposed intervention footprint.  Where a house or premises is not in the proposed intervention area it means it either currently, or will in the near future, have access to commercial high speed broadband services.  The map will be subject to change as new information becomes available or commercial investments are announced in the future.</p><p>  A further public consultation on a detailed intervention strategy will be launched in mid-2015.  My Department is also working closely with the European Commission with a view to obtaining State Aid clearance for the programme.</p><p>  A detailed procurement process will be undertaken in order to select a potential preferred bidder or bidders towards the end of 2015.</p><p>  This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government.  It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland.</p></reply>

To that end, the Internet Content Governance Advisory (ICGA) Group was established in December of last year to review existing policy and practice across the full range of issues that arise in this space and to make recommendations on same.  The ICGA Group&rsquo;s report was brought to Cabinet and published this summer and makes several recommendations aimed at protecting children and young people without unduly limiting their opportunities and rights online.  Along with changes to institutional, administrative and legal structures, the report makes four specific recommendations on cyberbullying aimed at providing stronger supports for tackling this issue through primary and post-primary curricula and additional training and awareness measures.  An Implementation Group has been established, and its Final Report, which I expect will be completed by year end, will set out the full set of measures to be introduced on foot of this process.  This Report will also be made publicly available once approved by Cabinet.</p><p>  In terms of dealing with cyberbullying, our most immediate and important task is to help educate children, young people and parents as to the risks that can be found online, to support parents and teachers in explaining these issues to children and to identify the optimal solutions to mitigate these risks and protect children.  In this regard, the Department of Education and Skills, who are represented on the Implementation Group, have a number of ongoing actions in place, for children of a variety of different ages.</p><p>  This is a complex and rapidly developing area, and Government, industry and parents all have a role to play in ensuring that children can take full advantage of the opportunities offered online in a safe environment.  The ongoing work across Government in this area will bring significant improvements to our regulatory system.  Given the rate of change in online behaviour, clearly these are issues that we will need to refer to again in the future, but I am confident that the outcome of this implementation process will be an important and useful step forward.</p></reply>

The Group conducted a public consultation on the emerging issues arising from widespread access to online content and its impact on society as a whole, taking particular account of issues of online safety arising from children and young people&rsquo;s use of the Internet.  59 responses were received during this period from citizens, industry, not for profit organisations and representative groups.  The Group then used these responses to inform their policy recommendations.  The Group also met with a number of the major international companies based in Ireland who operate in this space.</p><p>  The Report of the ICGAG was approved by Government and published on 24th June.  It contains 30 structural, legislative and administrative recommendations, the responsibility for which fall across a number of different Departments.</p><p>  Following the publication of the ICGAG Report, a cross departmental implementation group was established.

The Group have held several meetings to date and will conclude their work and submit a report to me which I will bring to Cabinet following consideration.</p></reply>

I understand that this channel is monitored by OPW and also that the lower section of the stream is scheduled for drainage maintenance in 2015. I am further advised, as regards the concerns now expressed, that water levels in the Corrib catchment reached exceptionally high levels over the Winter / Spring of 2013/14 &ndash; and remained at that level due to high rainfall well through Spring 2014.</p><p>  The in-stream structure upgrades were carried out by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) in partnership with OPW.</p><p>  I understand that the Lough Beag stream was identified by IFI as a channel with potential for improvement works aimed at increasing its productivity for wild brown trout production. This was part of the ongoing development programme of the Corrib catchment in conjunction with the Corrib Angling Federation and local angling clubs. I am advised that the works commenced in 2012 and were completed in 2013. These works focussed on upgrading existing in-stream structures with a view to improving fish habitat together with the introduction of gravel for trout to spawn in. </p><p>  I understand that the work included rock deflectors and pools with stones for trout habitat designed to retain water only during low flow periods and to flood out in higher water. I am advised that the structures have no impact when the stream is in flood as the water drowns out the structures. This channel is indexed in the OPW drainage programme as C25 and as the stream is at lake (Lough Corrib) level it will consequently be directly influenced by the water levels in the Lake. I am advised that In-stream structures in this case are incidental in terms of flooding in times of high lake level.</p><p>  It is understood that that the lands in question are in the ownership of an individual who had given consent for the works to take place. I am also advised that during the programme of works the landowner reguarly visited the site and engaged with staff on the porgramme.</p><p>  In July, 2014 IFI were made aware of certain concerns in relation to the works &ndash; and an on-site meeting of relevant parties was arranged. IFI are keen to ensure that the responsibilities of the state (OPW and IFI) and the the concerns of all involved including local landowners are addressed. I have asked IFI to liaise with the OPW to ascertain if the concerns raised by the Deputy are manifest in any deterioration in the ability of the river to discharge as designed. </p></reply>

In particular, the format for the Irish and English language text has been in place since 1978 and was retained in the 1996 and 2010 updates of the Manual. The resulting text, format and imaging were based on research, road safety considerations and on the practical understanding of Ireland&rsquo;s road network.</p><p>  This had led to a clear set of rules in respect of the design of traffic signs that convey an intuitive understanding of bilingual destinations for both residents and visitors alike and I understand that we do not receive complaints from the motoring public regarding any lack of clarity or difficulty with legibility of text on our road traffic signs in either the English or Irish languages.</p><p>  I am aware that my predecessor saw some merit in having a small number of signs, in a format proposed in a report commissioned by Conradh na Gaeilge, erected at a few high profile locations around the country in order to test public perceptions. The Deputy will appreciate that my priority at all times is focused on road safety and therefore before that suggestion can be advanced any further, I wish to review the position to ensure that any modification to the display of text on our road signs will not compromise road safety in any way.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.<br/><br/>As I outlined to the Deputy in my response to PQ 41626/14 of 4 November 2014, the economic reality of recent years has meant significant reductions in roads budgets across the board and this has resulted in some grant programmes being curtailed, including the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes, in order to protect funding for road maintenance and repair.<br/><br/>In 2012 Meath County Council submitted 10 applications for approval under the Specific Grant scheme.  Those projects are listed below and where an allocation was made it is also listed in the table.<table><tr><th>1.</th><th>Navan-Balrath R153 &euro;400,000</th></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Kells Town Centre&euro;250,000</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>Dunboyne to Summerhill&euro;200,000</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Rossnaree</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>Navan Road Trim</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td>Corkery Culvert&euro;110,000</td></tr><tr><td>7.</td><td>Balrath Cross Bridge &euro;  60,000</td></tr><tr><td>8.</td><td>Oakleypark Bridge&euro;110,000</td></tr><tr><td>9.</td><td>Duleek Bypass</td></tr><tr><td>10.</td><td>Moygaddy Junction</td></tr></table>Details of the regional and local road grant allocations and payments to County Councils including Meath County Council are outlined in the regional and local road grant booklets for 2012 and 2013 and grant allocation booklet for 2014 which are available in the D&aacute;il Library.<br/><br/>While my Department did not seek applications under the Specific Grant programme in 2013 or this year (except for bridge rehabilitation works) due to the curtailment of the programme, Meath County Council did submit a Specific Grant application to continue works on the R156 Dunboyne to Summerhill scheme and an amount of &euro;600,000 was allocated in 2013. The Council also applied for a Laytown to Bettystown Link Road scheme during 2013.  As explained in response to the Deputy's previous question I am not in a position to make grant funding available for this project at present.<br/><br/>It is important to reiterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement local authorities in their spending in this area and it is open to the Meath County Council to fund this project from its own resources.</p></reply>

As I stated in that reply, the sale of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta's shares in Arramara Teo to a Canadian company was approved by the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s on 1 March 2013, subject to Ministerial approval being obtained and legal details being agreed. Following an assessment of the proposal, Ministerial approval was granted for the sale on 29 July 2013, subject to a number of specific conditions being fulfilled. I am advised that the sale of Arramara Teo was concluded on 7 May 2014 and that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is satisfied that the conditions laid down have been fully complied with.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the best value that could be obtained for Arramara Teo was achieved through this course of action. As a multinational company based in Nova Scotia, Canada with significant experience in the seaweed processing sector, I am satisfied that the company in question has the expertise to develop Arramara Teo and secure its long-term future for the benefit of its stakeholders. I believe that this strategic partnership will secure Arramara's future in Connemara and will result in the development of the seaweed processing sector here.</p><p>  While I am unable to give the complete details with regard to the terms of the sale of Arramara Teo because of the confidentiality provisions of the contract, I am advised by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta that continuity of supply to Arramara's existing Irish customers is assured. One of the conditions of the sale agreement between &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the company in question related to existing Irish customers of Arramara Teo being guaranteed supply of product on reasonable terms and conditions into the future. In that regard, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has confirmed that the sale agreement provides for the protection of future supply to existing Irish customers of Arramara Teo, with no increase in price for Year 1 and with prices advantageous to the Irish customers as against international customers being secured. It is also understood that the company in question has covenanted to continue to supply the Irish customers. In the event of a breach of covenant, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has advised that penalties would apply.</p><p>  In overall terms, it is envisaged that the sale of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta's shares in Arramara Teo will benefit the State through a cash consideration to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, through a significant investment in Arramara Teo and through the development of the seaweed sector into the future with benefit accruing to the State as a result of increased economic activity.</p></reply>

However, the National Famine Commemoration Committee, which I chair, has considered the possibility of exhibiting a collection dedicated to the Irish Famine. The Committee was given to understand that much of the evidence relating to the Great Famine is statistical and pictorial and that there is insufficient material to support a dedicated exhibition as there are very limited numbers of artefacts that could be exhibited.  There are of course many local museums and other entities around the country that include displays relating to the Famine period. The Irish National Famine Museum at Strokestown Park, Co Roscommon, is an excellent example of such initiatives.</p></reply>

This has included intense engagement with turf cutting interests, farmers, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission. A long term compensation scheme was introduced to compensate cutters for their loss.  The draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan was published in January. It sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed into the future and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed. The draft Plan sets out the demanding tests which must be met before turf cutting could be consented to within the provisions of the Directive. The final Plan will clarify whether the relevant provisions of the Directive could be applicable for any particular special area of conservation and will seek to establish whether sufficient consensus can be achieved at a national level to make a successful case to the European Commission for flexibility in accordance with Article 6(4) of the Directive.</p><p>  This National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan responds to the central recommendation of Mr. Justice Quirke arising out of the 2012 Peatlands Forum and as requested in the resolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of 7 March 2012 which called on the Government to &quot;engage actively with the European Commission to seek a resolution within the terms of the Habitats Directive, and to prepare and submit a National Raised Bog Restoration Plan to the Commission as a matter of urgency.&quot;</p><p>  Final resolution of all issues in relation to the protection of Ireland's raised bog Special Areas of Conservation will only be brought by everyone working together - within the law - with my Department and with the Peatlands Council, which was established with the purpose of ensuring the input from all stakeholders.</p></reply>
