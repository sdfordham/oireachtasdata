    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-04a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017070400059#WRA00800"><p>Parents need to act now &ndash; that&rsquo;s the message which I would encourage Deputies to bring back to their constituencies this weekend.  The best way to find out information is for parents to go on the website<i>www.affordablechildcare.ie,</i>The benefits are set out there in a way which is accessible and easy to follow. </p><p>Deputies we must get this message out so that the estimated 70,000 children eligible for supports will benefit from September.  Can I encourage you when on local radio or in your local newspaper to please draw attention to the website.  In addition to the website we have posted out information packs to over 4,000 childcare providers and my officials have been on the road holding special information events &ndash; each booked to capacity. </p><p>There is understandably a lot of interest from parents in the first instance but also from providers. From September a number of administrative measures will take place.  We are enhancing existing targeted childcare supports by as much as 50%.  There will be better access to subsidies for providers &ndash; with the traditional Community Childcare Scheme being extended to both community and private providers. </p><p>In order to encourage involvement in the schemes I have secured an extra &euro;3.5m for providers for non-contact time &ndash; this is on top of the &euro;14.5m secured in Budget 2017.  As I have outlined the technical, legal and technical work is also continuing to achieve the goal of genuine affordable accessible quality childcare.  There are a lot of figures to take in during the limited time today.  But the bottom line for families is the benefits available from September.  Some families will qualify for as much as &euro;145 per week, per child, in childcare subsidies, totalling approximately &euro;7,500 per child, per year. </p><p>Examples of the impact we will have: </p><p>-  A working family in receipt of Family Income Supplement and with a Medical Card, who currently benefit from a full-time CCS childcare subsidy of &euro;95 per week, will from September benefit from a subsidy of &euro;145 per week.  This represents an increase in childcare subsidy of up to &euro;2600 per child, per annum, or, for families who have not received the subsidy before, an annual saving on childcare, per child, of up to &euro;7540. </p><p>-  A family in receipt of One Parent Family Payment, with a Medical Card, working part-time, who currently benefit from a part-time CCS childcare subsidy of &euro;47.50 per week, will from September benefit from a subsidy of &euro;80 per week.  This represents an annual increase of  up to &euro;1,690 per child, or for single parents who have not benefitted from this subsidy in the past, a reduction of up to &euro;4,160  per child in their annual childcare costs. </p><p>There are many more examples which we are always happy to share. </p><p>I hope this information is useful for Deputies when explaining the changes to constituents.</p></reply>

They are a temporary solution as we, as a government get to grips with the devastating plight of homelessness in our country.  The hubs are a better temporary solution than hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation which I do not believe are suitable accommodation for homeless families.  </p>  <p>  I know Minister Murphy has as his target that any new family presenting as homeless will be accommodated in a hub and not in a hotel or bed and breakfast.  His other target is to move families that are currently homeless and living in hotels, out of those hotels.</p>  <p>  Hubs provide shared facilities and important supports that are difficult to organise in hotels.  They allow families to lead their lives in a way that is better for children and better for their parents.  They have additional space in hubs.  In a hotel setting, families are often cramped into one bedroom.  They have no privacy.  It is difficult for  children trying to do their homework.  It is restricted in terms of preparing meals.  In general it leads to untold amounts of stress.</p>  <p>  The hubs are custom developed to facilitate much better responses to the needs of homeless families.  They allow for on-site access to necessary services such as health, housing, cooking, and laundry facilities.  The hubs provide a better setting for supports such as homework clubs, meeting with support workers and activities that are being organised for children and parents. Importantly, while far from ideal, they have play areas, which allow children to be children, and parents some peace of mind.</p>  <p>  When I met with Advocacy groups a year ago, these were among the issues that they highlighted.  They also pressed me to provide free childcare for families that are homeless, which I have done. Initially this  was available in Dublin.  Many other counties have since signed up.  It is currently available in Limerick, Cork, Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Galway, Kildare, Kilkenny, Leitrim, Offaly, Westmeath and Wicklow. We will make arrangements also to support any cases that are brought to our attention outside of these counties.</p>  <p>  I have a budget of &euro;4m for this.  In my opinion it is a well- targeted and much needed support for families that are homeless.  It is good for children and good for parents.  At the moment the parents of 94 children are availing of this.  112 providers have signed up to be part of the scheme.  Child care providers get a  grant of &euro;110 per week to cover 25 hours of childcare.  Families with children aged 0-5 years inclusive are identified by Focus Ireland and encouraged to participate.  I will continue to support children and families with free childcare that move from hotels and B&amp;B accommodation into hubs.  </p>  <p>  These children will also continue to be prioritised in terms of the school completion programme.  The School Completion Programme identifies and supports children at risk of not reaching their potential in the educational system.  It does this through initiatives such as afterschool supports, homework clubs, mentoring programmes, therapeutic interventions and breakfast clubs.  </p>  <p>  Sadly, I am aware that families become homeless during the course of the year and may not be on the target list drawn up by the SCP at the start of the school year.   For this reason all SCP programmes are now engaging with their schools on an ongoing basis, and not just at the start of the year,  to ensure that children receive the appropriate supports.  The Education Welfare Office also prioritise the sourcing of an appropriate school placement for children who are homeless.  In DEIS schools where there is a Home School Community Liaison the Co-ordinator proactively engages with parents who are experiencing homelessness.  The HSCL also supports families to access any other services that can be of assistance to the family.  The Tusla Homeless Liaison officer will continue to work with these families until such time as they are moved to permanent housing. </p>  <p>  Tusla will offer &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; assessments at the hubs.  The agency will participate in respect of child protection and welfare services, educational welfare, and Domestic, Sexual and gender based violence services.  With the help of the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, Tusla has arranged an awareness and training session for homeless service providers on Domestic, sexual and gender based violence.  We will continue to offer services through the Family Resource Centres.  Families living in hubs can continue to avail of the services such as family fun days, play therapy and transport services.</p>  <p>  When developing the Government&rsquo;s response to our Homeless Crisis I advocated strongly for the plan Rebuilding Ireland to include a commitment to provide children in emergency accommodation with LEAP cards for school journeys.  While this did not happen as quickly as I would have liked, it did happen.  In my meeting with Minister Murphy this week I emphasised the need to continue providing these to children who are in hubs and need to use public transport to travel to school.  In addition five separate 24 hour family LEAP cards were provided to all homeless families in hotels during 2016.  I know that people found these helpful in terms of giving them family days out.  I wish to see this repeated this year.</p>  <p>  Children and Young People Service Committees have been established in each of the 17 Tusla areas with relevant coordinators in place.  They will contribute to greater interagency working and help to ensure that there is a coordinated approach on homelessness.  The Tusla Homeless Liaison Officer has contacted the 5 CYPSC coordinators in Dublin and attended briefing sessions with them.  They must each now consider the best approach and response within their specific area to homeless related matters.  This will include working with families living in hubs.  This briefing session is scheduled to take place in each of the 17 areas.</p>  <p>  At the end of May, there were 1,312 families homeless.  There are 2,777 children in these homeless families.  647 homeless families are being accommodated in hotels and B&amp;Bs in Dublin. These are shocking figures.  In my role as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I have concentrated my efforts around minimising the impact where and when possible.  I will continue to do this.</p></reply>

Aged between 13 and 17, they are all boys, and come from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Syria, and South Sudan.  20 are in care placements and 2 were reunited with family members.</p>  <p>  The French authorities are responsible for identifying and nominating separated children seeking asylum who are eligible to participate in the Irish programme.  The criteria for the programme, developed as a result of an all-party motion in November 2016, requires that separated children seeking asylum in Ireland were unaccompanied, living in a camp in or near Calais, were under 18 years of age and had an expressed wish to come to Ireland. </p>  <p>  Social workers from the Tusla Social Work Team for Separated Children and members of the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na travelled to the locations where the children were accommodated, to conduct initial needs assessments and security checks.  The children were then engaged in orientation activities in France and were accompanied to Ireland by staff from the International Organisation for Migration.</p>  <p>  On arrival the children  were granted refugee status by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Full intake assessments were completed by Tusla at this stage.  All of the children were allocated a social worker, and were placed in residential settings while their care, educational and medical needs were assessed.  To co-ordinate Tusla's role in this effort, Tusla established the Calais Special Project which is led by their Separated Children's Team.  Additional resources were allocated for the assessment and care needs of the young people.  The Team has expanded to include additional social workers, aftercare workers and administrative support.  Tusla have opened three new residential units specifically for separated children, which means there are now a total of 7 units available to separated children.  Tusla also continues to recruit and assess potential foster carers for this cohort of children.  Tusla liaises closely with the HSE, the Education and Training Boards and other State bodies to address each young person's identified needs, including educational, psychosocial and health supports.     </p>  <p>  I wish to acknowledge that the Calais Special Project has received  support and co-operation from national and international organisations and NGOs who have provided valuable information on young persons who expressed an interest in relocating to Ireland.</p></reply>

In addition to affordability and quality &ndash; our radical new approach to childcare must also ensure accessibility.  I am fully and absolutely committed to that.  One of my first official duties as Minister was to launch the Access Inclusion Model or AIM.  The model supports children with disabilities to attend main-stream pre-school education.  This includes children on the autism spectrum.</p><p>AIM is comprehensive &ndash; it offers seven levels of progressive support.  The degree of support provided depends on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school which they are attending.  The levels range from a new Inclusion Charter for all pre-schools, to support for equipment and upgrades, as well as training.  Indeed one of the great successes of AIM has been the huge interest in a newly developed Higher Education Programme in Leadership for Inclusion in Early Years Settings &ndash; known as LINC.  In the 2017-2018 year I can confirm that 978 people will take part in this leadership programme.</p><p>I met some of the 850 students currently taking part in the programme and due to graduate this Autumn when I recently attended the conference of Early Childhood Ireland.  They are passionate about their work and about offering the best possible service to all children.</p><p>Looking to the future, my Department and I are determined to further improve accessibility.  We have established a new Training Working Group to develop further courses under AIM Level 3.  This will not be a long process.

One of these  is the centre referred to by Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, which is based in Dublin city centre.  The young people receive a 24 hour seamless service.  For operational reasons, the service for the young people during the day is located nearby.  </p>  <p>  This dedicated service for the young people operates  during the day, at weekends and public holidays.  Its aim is to support each young person individually and to tailor the service to their unique needs.  Young people may continue to  attend school or training courses or, where this is not the case, a project worker will  work with them during the day.  The project worker will engage with all aspects of the young the person's needs including bringing them to meetings and other appointments, making contact, as appropriate, with their family and keeping in contact with the social work team from the child's home area. The aim of the services  is to ensure the young person's stay  in the emergency residential centre is for as short a period as possible. This approach, of individual support outside of the emergency centre, also means that if a young person is out of home for the first time, they do not spend all day with  other young people who are frequently out of home, or who have persistent problems.  This prevents the normalisation of a situation which should be, and usually is, exceptional.</p>  <p>  All children under 16 year old in the situation of being homeless without their parents are taken into care.  In some cases young people in the 16-17 year age group are resistant to this option, and they are offered full support care services appropriate to their needs. </p></reply>

This figure is amongst the highest internationally and something about which we should be proud.  I do not take this for granted and am aware that Tusla services must constantly be alert to the need for improvements, especially as children with increasing complexity are placed with foster carers.  When a child is received into care there is a full assessment of their identified needs and this includes a medical assessment.  A medical card is provided in respect of the child in foster care. </p>  <p>  Following this assessment, the child's statutory care plan should identify outstanding medical, emotional, psychological and educational supports required.  The Deputy will be aware that the HSE is responsible for the provision of medical and psychology services and children are referred to these services as needed.  Where an identified need cannot be met by the HSE, or the waiting time  is too long, Tusla have sourced the necessary service through the private sector.</p>  <p>  Children who are received into care at an older age, or where they have experienced significant trauma or attachment difficulties have particular needs.  It is important to note that the greatest need of all children in foster care is for stability in a loving nurturing family environment.  It is the role of Tusla, and other State services, to ensure that foster carers are supported in providing that care.  </p>  <p>  I am alert to the  National Review Panel whose reports have drawn attention to the heroic work of foster carers who care for babies with serious life limiting disabilities, and the need, in these and other situations for appropriate and timely supports. Foster carers also provide ongoing care for children with serious disabilities, and need all the supports available.   </p>  <p>  Following  recent concerns regarding children in care and leaving care with life long serious disabilities, I engaged  with both the  Minister for Health and the Minister for Disability.  The purpose was to make sure we  work in a better way  across Departments and on the ground, to provide safe and seamless services for these children/young adults and their  carers.  A detailed protocol was agreed between the HSE and Tusla with respect to their mutual responsibilities in the provision of care and disability services, particularly where a young adult will need ongoing intensive support.  </p>  <p>  I intend to closely monitor this situation and will work closely with the relevant  Departments to keep the medical and psychological needs of children in care to the fore. </p></reply>

The introduction of two weeks Paternity Benefit for the first time this year must also be welcomed. </p><p>The Government has provided additional support for stay-at-home parents through the home carer tax credit, which has been increased to &euro;1,100 per year.  I support an increase in the earnings threshold for this, and have raised this with the Minister for Finance. </p><p>A key responsibility of mine as Minister for Children is to make childcare costs more affordable for parents who need to work or who choose to work.  For this reason, I have focused on the delivery of the new Affordable Childcare Scheme and the delivery of interim measures this September to make childcare more affordable.  I hope that access to more affordable childcare will give families real choice as to whether they wish to remain at home to care for their children, or whether they wish to return to work or education and avail of childcare supports.</p><p>Delivering more affordable childcare is only one element of a broader set of commitments and supports aimed at parents and children that I intend to lead out on.  The provision of improved centre-based childcare services is very important, but I will not lose sight of the needs of children who do not attend them.  In this regard, <i>Better Outcomes Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People</i>contains a commitment to produce Ireland&rsquo;s first-ever National Early Years Strategy.  The intention is to deliver a cross-cutting strategy which will take a joined-up, whole of Government approach to the issue of supporting children and their families during the early years (0-6 years).  The drafting of the National Early Years Strategy is being advanced by my Department.  In December of last year I hosted an Open Policy Debate on the Strategy with a view to completion of the Strategy later this year. My officials will be engaging further with key Government Departments and other stakeholders in the coming months to bring it to a conclusion.</p></reply>

However, the available funding is very limited and is only benefitting a small proportion of schools.  I am retaining the grant in its current form for the present, pending a decision on alternative approaches. </p>  <p>  In 1994 the Department of Social Welfare opened a grant scheme to provide counselling supports to children who had experienced bereavement or loss.  This grant scheme then passed to the Family Support Agency (FSA) when it was established in 2003 and subsequently to Tusla on establishment in January 2014. </p>  <p>  Up until 2011 applications were invited through an annual public advertisement.  The scheme was then closed for financial reasons and no new applications have been accepted since that time.  Those who received funding in 2011 have continued to receive an annual grant equivalent to their 2011 grant.  This Counselling Grants Scheme is for a total of &euro;245,900 annually and currently there are only 64 grantees nationwide benefitting from it. With over 4,000 schools in Ireland 64 grantees means that less than 2% of schools are in receipt of support from this scheme currently.</p>  <p>  I have decided that until an alternative methodology for provision of counselling can be established, the grant should stay in place in its current format.</p></reply>

This is available to Community childcare services only);</p><p>-  Strand 3: Natural outdoor play area (&euro;500,000 is available, with a maximum of &euro;5,000 per grant).</p><p>The application process opened on Friday 24 March and closed on Thursday 27 April. </p><p>Additionally, under the Action Plan for School Age Childcare, a separate &euro;3 million is being provided in capital funding for services providing school age childcare.  This capital scheme opened on Friday 7 April and closed on Wednesday 17 May.  It will encourage expansion in the number of school age childcare places, along with enhancements to quality. </p><p>A large volume of applications was received under both programmes and in particular under the Early Years Capital 2017 programme.  Pobal has completed appraisal of applications under the Early Years scheme, and has provided the Department with its recommendations on Friday last, June 23.  Officials in my Department are  currently reviewing these recommendations, and an announcement regarding the successful applications will be made in the coming weeks.

Capital funding is allocated on the basis of need, and the level of application is reflective of the high level of demand within the sector.  I am committed to the continuous development and reform of the programme in respect of the needs of children and providers, with the aim of providing access to childcare facilities of the highest quality.</p></reply>

This figure currently represents 102,000 children.</p><p><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures </i>is a whole of government policy framework, which requires all Departments and Agencies to work collaboratively to improve outcomes for children and young people.  The Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Consortium, which I chair, has responsibility for whole of government implementation, and includes representatives from all government Departments and Agencies. </p><p>The Department of Social Protection has the lead role in coordinating government strategies on child poverty.  It also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion and has identified child poverty as a key cross-sectoral priority to be addressed.</p><p>Officials in my Department are working closely with the Department of Social Protection in informing the development of this cross-sectoral priority.</p><p>Officials in the Department of Social Protection have co-convened a subgroup with members of the Advisory Council for <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures </i>to progress solutions to child poverty. </p><p>In recognition of the fact that child poverty is a multifaceted problem, this group also includes officials from other Departments, including the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>Led by the Department of Social Protection, this group has developed a paper which outlines a whole of government approach to tackling child poverty.  This is based around the three pillars outlined in the EU Recommendation on Investing in Children:</p><p>-  Access to adequate resources</p><p>-  Access to affordable, quality services</p><p>-  Children&rsquo;s right to participate.</p><p>Key priorities arising from this include providing universal access to GP care for under 18s, reducing the cost of education, housing, affordable childcare, labour activation and provision of in-work benefits.</p><p>In line with this, my Department is developing a Single Affordable Childcare Scheme to provide families with quality childcare at a cost they can afford.  Budget 2017 provided additional funding for the scheme&rsquo;s development and initial roll-out, to include both a targeted and a universal element.  Subsidies will be available for children aged from 6 months up to 15 years and will meet families&rsquo; full-time and part-time childcare needs, including outside of school hours and during school holiday time.  The highest levels of subsidy will be provided to those on low incomes, helping families to overcome disadvantage and contribute to a reduction in child poverty.</p><p>The Advisory Council held a round table event on 22 June with a range of key experts and stakeholders.  The learning from this event will inform the further alignment of efforts across government and from civil society.</p><p>My Department has also established a Children&rsquo;s Equality Commission to ensure that the voices of children who experience or understand economic hardship or poverty are directly heard and acted on by policymakers.  The Commission will be comprised of Child Commissioners and Adult Commissioners.  The Child Commissioners are children who experience or have an understanding of economic hardship or poverty.  The Adult Commissioners will be senior policy makers from Government Departments, Stage agencies and other bodies relevant to the issues raised by children.</p><p>Consultations with relevant children and young people have been ongoing for some months.  The findings from the work with the children and young people were discussed in detail at a closed meeting held on 22 June 2017 between Child and Adult Commissioners.  The next phase of this process is now at design stage and details will be announced shortly.</p><p>I and my colleagues in Cabinet are committed to advancing these efforts and actions in our collective response to addressing child poverty.</p></reply>

The comprehensive scope of the Commission&rsquo;s remit ensures it can provide a full account of what happened to women and children in these institutions during the period 1922 to 1998. </p>  <p>  Article 1(II) of its terms of reference requires the Commission to examine the living conditions and care arrangements experienced by women and children during their period of accommodation in these institutions.  In addition to this broad requirement, Article 1(V) of the terms of reference refers specifically to the examination of vaccine trials in these institutions. </p>  <p>  The Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, which is the legal framework underpinning this investigation, provides the Commission with robust legal powers to compel persons to produce documents and answer questions.  With regard to records held by third parties, the Deputy may wish to note that section 31 of the 2004 Act requires that any person in possession of documents, or information in any form, relevant to the matters before the Commission shall preserve such information until the Commission concludes its work.  As the Commission is independent in the conduct of its investigations it should be understood that the precise timing and approach to the gathering and examination of evidence are matters for the Commission to decide and progress.</p>  <p>  For these reasons, I am satisfied that separate investigations are not required in relation to the matters raised by the Deputy.  The Commission already has sufficient scope and the necessary legal powers to examine these matters, and to make a determination on their relevance to the central issues in question, and where appropriate to make any recommendations to Government which the Commission deems necessary. </p></reply>

This honours a key commitment in the Programme for Government.  I can confirm that these measures will commence this September.  The measures are as follows:</p>  <p>  A new universal subsidy will be available for all children aged between 6 months and 3 years of age (or until they are eligible for ECCE e.g 3 years and 3 months) in Tusla registered childcare.  This will amount to as much as &euro;1,040 per year for children in full time childcare. </p>  <p>  In addition, subsidies provided under existing childcare schemes, specifically the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Schemes, have been increased significantly, in some cases by as much as 50%.  To illustrate the effect of this increase, the highest subsidy provided under the CCS scheme for full time childcare in 2016 was &euro;95 per week.  This will increase to &euro;145 per week from September. This should decrease the co-payment required by families who qualify and therefore make childcare more accessible and affordable to these families; assisting parents in their return to training or employment and lifting families out of poverty. </p>  <p>  These subsidies, both universal and targeted, will be available through childcare services who contract with my Department to deliver the schemes.  The schemes are open to 4,500 community (not-for-profit) and private providers across the country.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that parents and childcare providers are aware of the changes to the schemes this September, a comprehensive information campaign is underway. Information packs have been sent to over 4,000 registered childcare services and information events for services have been provided at eight locations throughout the country. </p>  <p>  A dedicated website has been launched (affordablechildcare.ie) and information for parents went live on this website on Monday 29 May to inform them of the various enhanced childcare supports they may qualify for this September.  A campaign via various media, including digital and radio, has also raised awareness among parents.</p>  <p>There are no IT issues which will prevent the roll-out of the September measures to all eligible families. Registrations of children for the various programmes will go live from August 21.  Work on the development of the new Affordable Childcare Scheme continues, in parallel to these September measures, and I will provide additional information on this in due course.</p></reply>

Existing targeted childcare supports provided under the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Schemes will be enhanced significantly from September, some by up to 50%. In addition, every child in Tusla-registered childcare services, between the ages of 6 months and eligibility for ECCE (3 years or over) will be eligible for some level of childcare support totalling as much as &euro;1,040 per year. </p>  <p>  I remain strongly committed to introducing the ACS and will do so at the earliest possible date.  My Department has made considerable progress in this regard.  The Government has approved the Heads of Bill for the Scheme, and officials are working intensively to plan for successful implementation of the Scheme.  However, I am conscious that this is a complex project which we must get right from the beginning.  We need to have the legislation, business processes and a new robust IT system in place.  We will need to test the Scheme rigorously to ensure that it works properly for families and providers. </p>  <p>  Whilst delivering the scheme as soon as possible remains a priority, I believe that it is prudent to take time to ensure we get the new systems right, so that they operate smoothly for everyone.  I want to build a system that will underpin childcare supports for children and investment in the childcare sector for years to come.  We are well on our way to introducing the ACS.  When fully operational it will be a state of the art system which will be capable of delivering, not just for this generation of children, but also for generations to come. In the meantime, I am satisfied that the September measures will honour the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering more affordable childcare to families.</p></reply>

At all times, Tusla&rsquo;s key priority is to ensure that the needs of victims of domestic and sexual violence are being met in the best way possible.  A network of 60 organisations provide services to victims of domestic, sexual and gender based violence in Ireland, including 20 services providing emergency refuge accommodation to women and children and 24 community-based domestic violence services.</p>  <p>  Tusla employs approximately 3,637 whole time equivalent (WTE) staff and the vast majority of these are focused on responding to the needs of children and families at risk.  I wish to assure the Deputy that with the current available staff, all urgent and emergency cases, such as in situations of abandonment, allegations of physical and sexual abuse, parental ill-health and the need to find an immediate placement, or a threat to the safety or life of a child by a third party, are dealt with immediately.   </p>  <p>  I am aware also that to ensure Tusla staff are able to support children and families, it is the organisation's policy to ensure that all staff are trained in child protection and Children First guidelines and staff attend a broad range of child protection training including:</p>  <p> - Core Court Room Skills</p>  <p>- Introduction to Court Skills</p>  <p>- Domestic Sexual &amp;amp; Gender Based Violence (DSGBV) &ndash; Awareness and Response</p>  <p>- Practice Development for Newly Appointment Social workers</p>  <p>- Supervision - Making the most of Supervision for Supervisees</p>  <p>- Supervision - Staff Supervision Skills Training for Supervisors</p>  <p>- Foundations for Assessment</p>  <p>- Evidence Informed Practitioner Programme</p>  <p>- Legal Briefing Seminar</p>  <p>  I am very mindful of the correlation between recruitment and cases where a child does not have a dedicated social worker and the need for Tusla to closely link its recruitment programme with operational decisions to effect improvements.  As part of my regular engagement with the Tusla Board, I have requested that the Agency provides me with an assessment of recruitment for the remainder of 2017, linked to specific targets to reduce the number of children awaiting allocation of a dedicated social worker.  I have requested that Tusla develop a robust workforce plan which addresses succession planning, retention, career pathways, training and development, future workforce needs, priority gaps and a strategy for tackling the priority gaps and reducing unallocated cases. </p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s 2017 recruitment target is 369 additional staff across its grades.  Tusla&rsquo;s social work target for the end of 2017 is 1,520 whole time equivalent and Tusla appears to be on track to meet this target.  However, it is unlikely that 1,520 WTE social workers will be sufficient to execute Tusla&rsquo;s current and future responsibilities without changes to the composition of Tusla social work teams.  Accordingly, Tusla is evaluating management and staff skills mix with a view to service enhancement, including reviewing the roles of family support workers; social care workers in the community; and administrative structures to support the delivery of more efficient and cost effective services.  Part of the evaluation also includes looking at enhanced job roles, increasing multidisciplinary team-working in an effort to alleviate pressure; redesigning tasks; and promoting greater efficiency in working.</p>  <p>  Tusla has also appointed a dedicated Workforce Planner to work closely with Tusla services / operations with a view to identifying the areas&rsquo; required resource mix reflecting the on-going challenge of  recruiting social workers and the potential for more social care workers and family support workers. </p>  <p>  Consideration is being given to the current and future issues with social worker supply in Ireland, and the challenges this poses for Tusla, and discussions are ongoing between my Department and the Higher Education Authority to examine how this might be addressed.  </p>  <p>  I am confident that the Exchequer funding of &euro;713m in 2017 will provide Tusla with significantly increased capacity to respond to areas of identified risk and anticipated demand and to progress a number of key service developments which will ensure better outcomes for vulnerable children, and families, who need our services and support. </p></reply>

This honours a key commitment in the Programme for Government.  I can confirm that these measures, which will benefit the families of tens of thousands of children, will commence this September. </p>  <p>  These measures are being put in place to ensure that parents of up to 70,000 children due to benefit under the Affordable Childcare Scheme will be given the opportunity to avail of increased childcare subsidies from September.  This will be achieved by significantly increasing the subsidy rates for the Community Childcare Subvention and the Training and Employment Childcare Schemes, in some instance by as much as 50%.  There will also be a new universal, non-means tested childcare subsidy that will benefit parents with children aged between 6 months and 36 months.    </p>  <p>  These measures mean that the families of up to 70,000 children can look forward to benefitting from increased childcare subsidies starting from this September. </p>  <p>  Following on from a coordinated online and postal information campaign targeting both childcare providers and parents with key information about the measures, my Department along with Pobal and the City/County Childcare Committees are currently hosting public information &ldquo;roadshows&rdquo; to build awareness and encourage providers to sign up the September measures.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have recently announced a payment for non-contact time to services who sign up to the September measures.  The payment to providers is intended to make a contribution towards the administration and non-contact costs involved in providing my Department&rsquo;s childcare programmes.  In particular, the new funding recognises the time providers need to spend familiarising themselves with the new affordable childcare measures, signing contracts, meeting regulatory and compliance requirements and assisting parents with understanding how they can most benefit from the various childcare programmes available.</p>  <p>  The measure provides for a payment equivalent to an additional seven days&rsquo; funding for services. &euro;3.5m has been allocated for this purpose.</p>  <p>  I am very aware that delivering these enhanced childcare supports is only possible because of the commitment and co-operation of more than 4,000 childcare providers throughout the country.  I want to acknowledge their continuing support and, in recognition of their invaluable contribution, I will be asking for extra funding during Budget 2018 negotiations so we can address some of the issues raised by childcare providers.</p></reply>

The ACS is a complex scheme that includes both universal and targeted supports, as well as additional supports for vulnerable children, which will involve Tusla and other Government Departments and Agencies in application procedures.

However, the available funding is very limited and is only benefitting a small proportion of schools. I am retaining the grant in its current form for the present, pending a decision on alternative approaches. </p>  <p>  In 1994 the Department of Social Welfare opened a grant scheme to provide counselling supports to children who had experienced bereavement or loss.  This grant scheme then passed to the Family Support Agency (FSA) when it was established in 2003 and subsequently to Tusla on establishment in January 2014. </p>  <p>  Up until 2011 applications were invited through an annual public advertisement.  The scheme was then closed for financial reasons and no new applications have been accepted since that time.  Those who received funding in 2011 have continued to receive an annual grant equivalent to their 2011 grant. This Counselling Grants Scheme is for a total of &euro;245,900 annually and currently there are only 64 grantees nationwide benefitting from it.  With over 4,000 schools in Ireland 64 grantees means that less than 2% of schools are in receipt of support from this scheme currently.</p>  <p>  I have decided that until an alternative methodology for provision of counselling can be established, the grant should stay in place in its current format.  Any increase to Tusla Education Welfare Service will have to be considered in the context of the estimates process for Budget 2018.</p></reply>

Implementation of the Programme for a Partnership Government requires a new relationship between the Government and Oireachtas.  This is reflected in significant D&aacute;il reforms which are being implemented, providing a significantly greater role for members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  </p>  <p>  In the last few weeks two Private Members Bills have been passed by the Oireachtas.  The Competition (Amendment) Act 2017 was originally published by Senator Ivana Bacik in January 2016 and the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Prohibition of Onshore Hydraulic Fracturing) Act 2017 was originally published by Deputy Tony McLoughlin in June 2016. </p>  <p>  These arrangements require greater collaboration and sharing of information by the Government with the Oireachtas .  </p>  <p>  Central to our approach for delivering on this ambitious programme is the concept of &lsquo;good faith and no surprises&rsquo;.  </p>  <p>  This Government, and the previous Government, played a crucial role in the process of D&aacute;il Reform including the first election of a Ceann Comhairle by secret ballot and the selection of Oireachtas Committee Chairs under a D'Hondt system among others.  Following the General Election in 2016, the D&aacute;il established an All Party D&aacute;il Reform Committee.  The Committee issued a Report in May 2016 and a number of the recommendations it made have since been introduced.  The new structures are now in place a year and the Government along with the other Parties and Groups in the D&aacute;il are currently reviewing the changes and making a number of proposals including reform of the way Private Members Bills are dealt with, the proportionality of speaking time in the D&aacute;il and the amount of D&aacute;il time provided to debate Government legislation among other issues.</p>  <p>  Within my Department, there is an expanded role for the Chief Whip's Office, alongside the new Parliamentary Liaison Unit, to support these arrangements including supporting good communication between Departments and the Oireachtas, particularly in relation to progressing Government legislation through the Oireachtas.  </p>  <p>  The new arrangements include more pro-active communication between Ministers and their Departments and Opposition spokespeople and Oireachtas Committee Chairpersons and Members.  It requires greater sharing of information with the Oireachtas to inform its deliberations, for example through the new Budgetary procedures, use of pre-legislative scrutiny by Committees, and more briefing on significant developments or issues.</p>  <p>  There is a new D&aacute;il Business Management Committee established to discuss and agree on the D&aacute;il Schedule, more time for Private Members Business, new arrangements for Topical Motions and reformed structures for Parliamentary Questions.  These all require a new approach from Ministers and their Departments and this Government is committed to ensuring it works effectively.  </p>  <p>  As regards Seanad Reform, in the Programme for a Partnership Government the Government restated its intention to reform Seanad Eireann and committed to pursuing implementation of the Report of the Working Group on Seanad Reform (the Manning Report).  That Report was published in 2015 and it is available on my Department's website.   </p>  <p>  One of the recommendations of the Report was the establishment of an Implementation Group to oversee implementation of the reforms contained in the Report.  The former Taoiseach agreed with a suggestion made in the D&aacute;il some time ago by Deputy Martin that this Group should be based in the Oireachtas and should comprise members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad from all parties and groups, with access to independent expert advice as required.  The former Taoiseach wrote to Party Leaders in September last year seeking their agreement to the setting up of the Implementation Group and seeking nominees for same.  This process is ongoing with a small number of nominees awaited.  I hope this process is concluded as soon as possible and the Joint Committee is established in the very near future.</p></reply>

Provisional application is a standard part of EU trade agreements and allows only those parts of the agreement for which the EU has competence to be provisionally applied, pending the completion of each Member State&rsquo;s internal procedures for its ratification.</p>  <p>  Provisional application will include the all-important reductions in tariffs on our exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, easing regulatory barriers and ensuring more transparent rules for market access.  The provisions relating to investment protection, investor-state dispute settlement and the Investment Court System are excluded from provisional application.  The provisional application of this Agreement shall be by the Union only.  This means Ireland or the other Member States will not be bound by these provisions until they are ratified by all Member States in accordance with their national procedures.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Articles 29.5.1 and Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution, and pursuant to a Government Decision, CETA will be laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with a motion to approve the Agreement.  In addition to the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the authority of the Government will be required in order for Ireland to notify of the completion of its internal procedures. Relevant Government Departments will be consulted to ensure that all legislative or administrative steps that may be required have been taken.</p>  <p>  The means by which Ireland notifies the completion of its internal procedures is by way of a written letter, delivered in hardcopy, from the Permanent Representative of Ireland to the EU addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of the European Union.</p>  <p>  Canada is currently finalising its internal implementation procedures to allow for its ratification of the Agreement.  This process is expected to be completed in the near future and should facilitate provisional application by Autumn this year.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Article 30.7.2 of CETA, the Agreement shall enter into force on the first of the second month following the date the EU and Canada exchange written notifications certifying that they have completed their respective internal requirements and procedures or on a date agreed by the EU and Canada.  Once all the Member States notify the General Secretariat of the EU that their internal procedures are complete, the General Secretariat of the Council of the EU may then submit a notification to Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development.</p></reply>

Such engagement is a prerequisite for Ireland to become a global innovation leader. </p>  <p>  Ireland is a long-standing member of the European Space Agency, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, the European Molecular Biology Conference, EUREKA, COST and CECAM.  As part of the ongoing implementation of Innovation 2020, Ireland joined ELIXIR, the European data infrastructure for the life sciences, in July 2016 and Ireland will join the International LOFAR Telescope, the European radio astronomy collaboration, in July 2017.</p>  <p>  Innovation 2020 contains an action to initiate negotiations with CERN on Ireland's membership options.</p>  <p>  In January 2016 the then Minister for Skills, Research and Innovation, Damien English T.D, wrote to the President of the CERN Council, Professor Sijbrand de Jong, in order commence the process.  Discussions between my department and CERN have been ongoing, at both official and Ministerial level, ever since.</p>  <p>  Senior officials from my department, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland visited CERN in July 2016.  The Director-General of CERN, Dr Fabiola Gianotti, visited Dublin in October 2016 and met with my predecessor as Minister for Enterprise and Innovation, Mary Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor.</p>  <p>  The information gathered during these engagements has provided my officials with a comprehensive understanding of the potential benefits of membership of CERN.  However, while the potential benefits of membership of CERN are significant, the cost of membership is also significant.</p>  <p>  The cost for Ireland to become a full member of CERN would be approximately &euro;15 million per annum.  Alternatively, Ireland could become an Associate Member for 10% of this of cost (&euro;1.5 million per annum).  However for Associate Membership, there would be a commensurate reduction in the benefits available, for example, access to contracts for enterprise.</p>  <p>  The case for membership of CERN is being assessed in the context of other investment priorities and no conclusion can be reached before the national budget discussions for 2018 are concluded.  My objective is to ensure that we obtain the best overall return on our investment in research and innovation.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the case for membership of CERN has been considered in the overall context of the Mid-Term Review of the Capital Plan, which covers the period 2018-2021.  The Mid-Term Review will be completed before the end of 2017 at which point I expect to be in a position to make a recommendation regarding Ireland's membership of CERN.</p>  <p>  In the event of a positive assessment and recommendation, a Government decision would be required in order to progress membership of CERN.</p></reply>

The arrangements that will apply after Brexit will depend on the outcome of negotiations between the EU and UK.   The Government is clear that any manifestation of an economic border would have very negative consequences.  A key priority is to ensure the continued free flow of trade on the island and the need to avoid a hard border. Clearly in this regard the closer the trading relationship between the UK and EU is more generally the better.</p>  <p>  I would point out that the guidelines for the EU 27 Article 50 negotiation framework specifically refer to the need to support and protect the achievements, benefits and commitments of the Peace Process.  In this regard the guidelines recognise the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, outlining the need for flexible and imaginative solutions, including the aim of avoiding an economic border, while respecting the integrity of the Union legal order. </p>  <p>  The Government has welcomed the EU&rsquo;s negotiating guidelines as reflecting Ireland&rsquo;s unique concerns and priorities. They express the EU&rsquo;s continued support for the Peace Process and the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement. They acknowledge the need for flexible and imaginative solutions to avoid an economic border on the island of Ireland. They agree to the recognition of existing bilateral agreements and arrangements between the UK and Ireland, which are compatible with EU law, such as the Common Travel Area.  It is clear, however that the withdrawal of a Member State from the Union is a situation without any precedent, in either political or practical terms. That said we are looking at other border situations which may offer possible guidance on how we address the unique situation found on the island of Ireland.</p></reply>

This proposal will be considered as part of my deliberations for Budget 2018. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, a working group was established in early 2017 to examine and report on the tax treatment of landlords (or rental accommodation providers) and to put forward options, where appropriate, for amendments to such treatment.  This working group was established as part of the &lsquo;Strategy for the Rental Sector&rsquo; which was published by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in December 2016.  The working group is chaired by the Department of Finance and its membership consists of officials from the Department of Finance; the Revenue Commissioners; the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government; and the Residential Tenancies Board.  As part of the group&rsquo;s work, a public consultation lasting for four weeks was conducted from March to April 2017 which received almost 70 written submissions from a wide range of interested parties, including individual landlords, representative bodies and charitable organisations. </p><p>The report of the working group is due to be presented to me by the end of July 2017, to allow for consideration of any of the options put forward, as part of my deliberations for Budget 2018.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that in order to improve the stability of housing supply to tenants in receipt of social housing supports a new relief was introduced in Finance Act 2015. The relief allows a full 100% mortgage interest deduction against rental income (increased from 75% in 2016 and from 80% in 2017) where a landlord undertakes, for a period of at least three years, to provide accommodation to such tenants and registers such undertakings with the Residential Tenancies Board within certain time limits.

Consequently the sale of any shareholding in AIB does not count as general government revenue.  Thus there will not be an increased capacity to spend on capital projects as a result of the sale of shares in AIB without affecting the general government balance.</p>  <p>  While not improving the deficit, the cash proceeds arising from the sale of AIB shares, which have been transferred to the Exchequer, reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement and result in lower general government net debt initially and gross debt in time.  A lower level of debt is not only beneficial in terms of the fiscal sustainability of the State but will also result in reduced interest payments in future years.  The strategy of reducing the national debt is consistent with the Government policy of repaying the borrowing previously undertaken to finance the recapitalisation of the banking sector during the financial crisis.  As previously stated, it the Government's position that the proceeds from the sale of the State's shareholdings in Irish banks, including AIB, will be used to reduce the outstanding level of public debt.   </p>  <p>  I have previously acknowledged the need for increased public investment.  The current Capital Plan sets a baseline from which this Government intends to increase investment in critical infrastructure, and in areas such as housing and health, as the Deputy has identified into the future. As outlined in the 2017 Estimates, gross voted capital expenditure will increase to &euro;4.5 billion in 2017.  This represents an increase of &euro;325 million in comparison to the 2016 outturn. By 2021 it is envisaged that Gross Voted Capital Expenditure will reach &euro;7.3 billion, an increase of over 100 per cent in comparison to its level in 2014.  These increases in investment over the coming years will be allocated to identified priorities on the basis of the outcome of the review of the Capital Plan currently under way.</p>  <p>  I would also point out that it is not just because of the fiscal rules that the Government is using the proceeds to reduce debt - as the Taoiseach has stated, it is the right thing to do. </p>  <p>  Finally, it should be further noted that the SGP also includes flexibilities that are designed to promote capital investment.  For instance, within the expenditure benchmark, capital formation increases are smoothed over four years with the result that only one quarter of the increase in public investment must be funded in the first year from within the fiscal space.  This provision, which means increases in capital spending for housing and other purposes can be front-loaded within the EU rules, has been utilised in Ireland's budgetary plans.  With regard to Brexit and other external risks to the outlook, the best way to deal with such risks is through competitiveness oriented policies and prudent management of the public finances.  That is what this Government will continue to do.</p></reply>

However, the Bank will publish an aggregate figure (due to statutory confidentiality requirements, the Central Bank can, generally speaking, only disclose information in relation supervisory work in summary or aggregate form so that individual firms cannot be identified) for its third party professional services costs at the conclusion of the Tracker Examination. In addition, as signalled by Governor Philip Lane at the meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on 4 April 2017, these costs will be charged back to the firms. </p></reply>

DJEI made contact with my Department and the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General ("C&amp;AG") regarding the implementation of statutory audit obligations in the 2014 revised EU Audit Directive and Regulations prior to their transposition into Irish law via SI 312 of 2016 and the Companies Act 2014. </p>  <p>  My Department engaged over a number of months with DJEI, the Office of the C&amp;AG and NAMA on this matter.  My Department also sought legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General regarding this Directive.  The Directive requires that certain companies, including NAMA, must be audited by a Statutory Auditor within the meaning of the Directive.  This audit requirement is separate from and in addition to the audit requirements set out in the NAMA Act which remain in effect.  It was also confirmed that the C&amp;AG  was not a Statutory Auditor within the meaning of the Directive.  </p>  <p>  I understand that both NAMA and the Office of the C&amp;AG each obtained separate legal advice which concurs with this position.  Hence, the C&amp;AG's audit of the statutory financial statements of the NAMA Group entities from the financial year ended 31 December 2016 onwards does not fulfil the requirements of the Directive. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the C&amp;AG believes that, at a minimum,  a change in legislation would be required in order to become a 'statutory auditor'.</p>  <p>  In this regard, cognisance would also need to be given to the particular features of the Constitution which safeguard the independence of the role.</p>  <p>  As a consequence, the NAMA Group entities were required to appoint a Statutory Auditor to satisfy the Directors&rsquo; obligations under Section 333 of the Companies Act 2014 for the year ended 31 December 2016 and all years thereafter.  NAMA launched a tender for the services of a statutory auditor and, arising from this, Mazars were appointed by the NAMA Board in May 2017. I am advised that the tender documentation for this appointment are publicly available on the e-tenders website, should the Deputy wish to review them in detail.</p>  <p>  The appointment of a statutory auditor does not override, nor breach, the C&amp;AG's obligation to audit NAMA and NAMA Group Entities for each year end in accordance with Section 57 of the NAMA Act.  However, it does mean that there will be a dual audit of NAMA&rsquo;s accounts &ndash;by both its statutory auditor, Mazars, and separately by the C&amp;AG. </p>  <p>  In this regard, the Deputy will note that NAMA&rsquo;s tender document requests that tenderers &ldquo;should seek to maximise audit efficiency for NAMA and in this regard consideration should be given to making use of the working papers of the C&amp;AG (if available) and similarly the Statutory Auditor should consider the provision of their working papers to the C&amp;AG for their audit&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  I understand that NAMA and the C&amp;AG have worked constructively together to address these changing audit requirements while remaining faithful to their respective obligations under various pieces of legislation.</p></reply>

The forum to have these appeals resolved is the Tax Appeals Commission (TAC), an independent body tasked with hearing tax appeals.   </p>  <p>  I am advised it is proposed by the TAC to take a test case. There is a provision in Section 949AN of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which allows the TAC, where cases involve common or related issues, to have regard to a determination made by them in one case, to determine other appeals without the necessity of holding a hearing for those other cases. It is a matter for the TAC to apply this provision.  The timing of any appeal is also a matter for the TAC.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that agents acting on behalf of appellants have proposed a case they believe is suitable for application across all appellants.  Revenue has expressed its view, on the request of the TAC, on the suitability of this proposed case as a representative case. The decision on whether to take the case as a representative case is one for the TAC. I am assured by Revenue that it remains committed to facilitating the proposal for a test case approach.</p></reply>

The rollout and extension of the Personal Microcredit Scheme, which is providing simple microloans to members and helping to combat the use of moneylenders.</b></p><p>The Personal Microcredit Scheme was commenced on a pilot basis in November 2015, involving 30 credit unions providing individual loans of between &euro;100 and &euro;2,000 with a maximum interest rate of 1% per month.  The initiative is being led by the Department of Social Protection in conjunction with the Department of Finance and other interest groups.  The It Makes Sense loan is designed to make short-term credit available on a low-cost basis to the people who need it most, and is designed specifically as an alternative to high-cost money-lenders.</p><p>As at 17 May 2017 there were 106 credit unions in 219 locations providing loans under the Personal Microcredit Scheme. Involvement in the scheme is voluntary and as such is a matter for individual credit unions themselves</p><p><b>2. Assisting credit unions in making successful applications to retain members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000 (CP88), recognising the independence of the Registrar of Credit Unions.</b></p><p>The Central Bank implemented the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016 (the Regulations) on 1 January 2016. It set out an individual member savings limit of &euro;100,000.  The Regulations also provided that credit unions could apply to the Central Bank to retain individual members&rsquo; savings in excess of &euro;100,000, which were held at commencement of the Regulations and that Credit unions with total assets in excess of &euro;100m could apply to the Central Bank for approval to increase individual member savings in excess of &euro;100,000.</p><p>The Central Bank consulted with the Department of Finance on the application process and accepted the Department&rsquo;s observations, making the application process less onerous.  Separately, the Registrar met with the representative bodies to obtain their feedback on the application process.</p><p>The Central Bank developed application processes to facilitate credit unions in seeking the approvals as outlined above.  As provided for in the Regulations, in order for approval to be granted an applicant credit union must demonstrate that the granting of such approval is consistent with the adequate protection of the savings of members and effective and proportionate having regard to the nature, scale and complexity of the credit union.  The submission deadline for applications to retain savings in excess of &euro;100,000 was 27 June 2016.  The application form to increase savings in excess of &euro;100,000 does not have a submission deadline and will be accepted on an ongoing basis.</p><p>Under the process, applications to retain individual members&rsquo; savings in excess of &euro;100,000, which were held at commencement of the Regulations, were assessed primarily by reference to objective financial criteria related to the excess reserves and liquid assets held by the credit union.  In addition, applicant credit unions were required to outline a rationale for seeking to retain such savings.</p><p>At commencement of the Regulations, there were 196 credit unions reporting on the Prudential Return (PR) that they held individual members&rsquo; savings in excess of &euro;100,000 and the total amount of such savings held was c.&euro;165 million.  Just over one third of these credit unions applied for permission to retain the individual members&rsquo; savings in excess of &euro;100,000.  The Central Bank informs me that the majority of these applicants met the financial criteria (on reserves and liquidity levels set out in the application process) and have been approved to retain such savings.</p><p>For those credit unions not approved to retain individual member savings in excess of &euro;100,000, transitional arrangements set out in the Regulations apply, meaning that all individual member savings in excess of &euro;100,000 held by these credit unions had to be returned to individual members by 1 January 2017.</p><p><b>3. Asking the Central Bank of Ireland to instigate a review of the continued appropriateness of the savings limit within a year of the formation of the new Partnership Government.</b></p><p>The Central Bank committed to a review of the savings limit, three years from commencement of the regulations (1 January 2016).  A letter issued to the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank from the Minister for Finance on 25 November 2016 requesting the Central Bank of Ireland to instigate a review of the continued appropriateness of the savings limit on credit union members.</p><p><b>4. Working with the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank to gradually lift current lending restrictions as appropriate, including for housing.</b></p><p>In February 2015 the Central Bank commenced a lending restriction review initiative, whereby credit unions that are subject to a lending restriction, but are satisfied that they have made the necessary improvements and have embedded these improvements in robust risk sensitive lending practices, could apply for a review of their lending restriction.  The closing date for receipt of applications under this initiative was 30 September 2015.  This review has reduced the number of credit unions with lending restrictions. Currently 60 credit unions, approximately 22% of credit unions by number, have a lending restriction compared with 52% of credit unions at the start of the review process.  The Central Bank has informed the Department that there is ongoing engagement with credit unions to lift lending restrictions. The Department will continue to monitor the situation.</p><p><b>5. Credit unions' move towards more electronic and online services, including the rollout of debit cards and enhanced online banking services.</b></p><p>We continue to support credit union initiatives to develop services while protecting members&rsquo; savings. In certain circumstances, the provision of new services must be approved by the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank prior to their introduction. </p><p>The Central Bank informs me that in October 2016, a number of credit unions were approved for a new service Members Personal Current Account Services (MPCAS) which provides for a current account and a range of services which includes payment instruments such as debit cards.  Approval was granted under additional services provisions (sections 48 to 52) within the Credit Union Act 1997 (as amended).  There has been strong interest in this service and the Central Bank is currently processing a significant number of applications, which are at different stages of assessment with the majority currently at an advanced stage.  Details and applications forms for the MPCAS service are available on the Central Bank website.</p><p>The Central Bank has also indicated that it is open to applications for alternative debit card proposals and recommends the MPCAS framework as a template for such alternative proposals.</p><p>Separately, an Implementation Group consisting of members from the four main credit union representative bodies, the Central Bank and a CUAC member, chaired by the Department of Finance was established earlier this year to implement all recommendations in CUAC&rsquo;s 2016 Report.  This Implementation Group will review CUAC recommendations relating to business model development in credit unions. </p><p><b>6. Asking the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) to conduct a review, and report by the end of June 2016, on the implementation of the recommendations outlined in the Report of the Commission on Credit Unions.</b></p><p>In December 2015 the Minister for Finance invited the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) to carry out a review of the Implementation of the Recommendations set out in the Report of the Commission on Credit Unions.  The review was presented to the Minister on 29 June 2016 and is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  The Review of Implementation of the Recommendations in the Commission on Credit Unions Report made recommendations in a number of areas including: Tiered Regulation; Section 35; Consultation and Engagement; Governance; Restructuring; Business Model Development; and Additional Policy Matters.  An Implementation Group has been established to oversee and monitor implementation of all recommendations.</p><p>As indicated above, an Implementation Group was established earlier this year to oversee, monitor and ensure implementation of all recommendations and has met five times to date.</p></reply>

The Government has initiated a number of important and practical initiatives which have the potential to improve the position of mortgage holders, including variable rate mortgage holders. Firstly the Government wishes to maintain and promote the level of competition in the supply of mortgage finance.  To that end, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) was asked to set out options to improve the degree of competition and consumer protection in the mortgage market.  As the Deputy will be aware, the CCPC has recently produced its report and set out a number of short, medium and long term action points for consideration. My Department will now liaise closely with CCPC, the Central Bank and other relevant Departments/agencies as appropriate on these action points to further consider their practical potential to enhance competition.</p>  <p>  Secondly, the Government considers that measures to encourage and promote a greater level of switching in the mortgage market would also boost the level of competition in the market for existing mortgages.  This point was also recognised by the CCPC report and the Central Bank has also carried out work in this area.  For example, last April the Central Bank published research on the experience of consumers in switching mortgage providers.  That research found that many consumers who have switched had a positive experience.  However, it also found that lenders could do more to facilitate mortgage switching. Dedicated mortgage switching staff, the ability to better compare mortgage products, a less time consuming process and clarity around timelines were highlighted as potential stimulants to mortgage switching.  </p>  <p>  Following on from this research, the Central Bank will publish a consultation paper in Q3 2017 proposing additional measures to facilitate mortgage switching for those consumers minded to switch.  Specific proposals to be explored will include:</p>  <p>  - lenders providing greater clarity to consumers on the switching process itself, including as to timeframes and potential costs of switching;</p>  <p>  - the benefits of lenders having dedicated switching contact points;</p>  <p>  - further disclosure rules at trigger points in the mortgage life cycle (e.g. end of a fixed interest-rate term); and</p>  <p>  - the scope for increased co-operation amongst lenders during the mortgage switching process.</p>  <p>  This will be an important development as previous Central Bank research had show that borrowers could make savings by switching their mortgage.  It should be noted that there has been some downward adjustment in mortgage rates.  Recently published Central Bank data on retail interest rates indicated that, in respect of new standard variable rate PDH mortgage business, rates had declined by 19 basis points to 3.38 per cent over the year to March 2017.  Fixed rate PDH mortgage rates also declined, with rates fixed for 1-3 years falling by 26 basis points over the same period.</p>  <p>  In overall terms, therefore, the Government is of the opinion that increased competition rather than administrative controls is the best way to ensure that retail lending rates are driven down in a sustainable way for the market as a whole and to that end it will continue to advance measures which encourage greater competition and switching in the mortgage market.</p></reply>

The sector has undergone fundamental change since 2011, managing many complex and challenging issues.  For example, following the establishment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo), there have been 82 mergers involving 156 credit unions resulting in an overall reduction of credit unions from 406 at September 2011 to 277 now.  Over the same period loan arrears have fallen from 18% to 9% and the number of credit unions with reserves less than 10% has fallen from 51 in September 2011 to 5 at September 2016.  Average reserves now stand at 17%.  Lending growth has recently returned with a 6% increase to &euro;4.2 billion in the year to March 2017 which followed a large decrease from peak in 2008.  </p>  <p>  In December 2015 the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) was invited to carry out a review of the Implementation of the Recommendations set out in the Report of the Commission on Credit Unions.  The final report was published on 6 July 2016.  This was a significant report providing an in-depth analysis of the sector from a financial perspective and having met with a range of stakeholders also ensured a balanced report providing focused and effective recommendations.</p>  <p>  The recommendations are provided under seven specific headings; tiered regulation, section 35, consultation and engagement with the Central Bank, governance, restructuring, business model development and additional matters.</p>  <p>  An Implementation Group was established to oversee and monitor implementation of these recommendations, which will support Credit Unions in developing their business model.  The Group consists of members from the four main credit union representative bodies: ILCU; CUDA; CUMA; and NSF as well as a CUAC member, a representative from the Central Bank and is chaired by the Department of Finance.  It has met on five occasions since February 2017 and is focused on implementing all recommendations at the appropriate time.</p>  <p>  CUAC's Report also fulfils one of the key credit union objectives as outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government which states that the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) conduct a review on the implementation of the recommendations outlined in the Report of the Commission on Credit Unions.</p>  <p>  In addition my officials regularly engage with all key credit unions stakeholders in relation to credit union policy matters which are not part of the remit of the Implementation Group.   </p>  <p>  The Government recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in this country.  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.  </p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to review individual cases nor to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in particular cases. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will note that the Cost of Insurance Working Group looked at this issue in the context of its work on motor insurance and made a recommendation about the need for insurers to inform consumers of the reasons for large increases in quotations.  Notwithstanding that this will apply only to motor insurance business, it may also have an impact on other lines of business.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the cost of home insurance, the Central Statistics Office reports on price movements in relation to insurance connected with dwellings as part of their Consumer Prices Monthly Series.  According to the official data from the Central Statistics Office, the cost of insurance connected with dwellings has remained largely stable over the last five years increasing and decreasing at various times.  At the beginning of this year it was 6.2% higher than it had been at the beginning of 2012.  February 2017 saw increases month-on-month of 2.5% and this has been followed by three months without a price movement. Comparably, for the same period the cost of motor insurance was 48% higher in January 2017 than it had been in January 2012, and at times early last year had been close to 60% higher.  There is also anecdotal evidence that the cost of employer liability insurance and public liability insurance has risen at a significantly higher rate than that of home insurance.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, therefore, on the basis that there is a need to prioritise the implementation of the cost of insurance motor report and also complete the public liability and employer liability review, I do not propose to look at the issue of the cost of home insurance at this point in time within the context of the Cost of Insurance Working Group's work.  </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department will continue to monitor the cost of home insurance as part of its general oversight of the insurance sector.  </p></reply>

Total employment, which has passed the two million mark, is at its highest level since 2008.</p>  <p>  Encouragingly, the labour market recovery remains broad based with gains recorded in all sectors and at all levels of occupational status last year.  The composition of growth also remains strong driven by gains in full-time positions.  In fact, according to the latest employment data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), annual increases in full-time employment of 5.5 per cent were seen in the first quarter of 2017, while over the same time period, part-time employment fell by 3.4 per cent. </p>  <p>  As part of the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) release, the CSO publishes a measurement of underemployment.  The following criteria are used to derive underemployment:</p>  <p>  1. Working part-time</p>  <p>  2. Willing to work additional hours</p>  <p>  3. Available to work additional hours</p>  <p>  Using these criteria, the CSO data show that part-time underemployment has fallen by 6.4 per cent over the year to Q1 2017, representing less than 5 per cent of all employees while over three-quarters of people who work part-time do so by choice. </p>  <p>  In parallel to these significant employment gains, unemployment continues to fall.  The unemployment rate stood at 6.4 per cent in May, the lowest rate of unemployment since mid-2008.  Crucially, the fall in unemployment is broad-based with substantial declines recorded in short-term, long-term and youth unemployment.</p>  <p>  Both average hourly and average weekly earnings have also increased in the year to Q1 2017.  Importantly, these increases are broad-based.  In the first quarter of 2017, average hourly earnings increased in 9 of the 13 sectors reported by the CSO, year on year, while average weekly earnings increased in 11 of the 13 sectors. </p>  <p>  The average number of hours worked over the same period also increased.  Like earnings, the increase in the average number of hours worked is broad-based with increases in 9 of the 13 sectors.  Importantly, the average number of hours worked increased in sectors such as the Accommodation and Food Services sector, which has a high concentration of part-time employment.</p>  <p>  In relation to the tax base, I assume the Deputy is referring to income tax.  Income tax has performed steadily in the first six months of 2017, up 3.1 per cent or &euro;274 million on the same period last year.  However, income tax receipts of &euro;9,045 million were slightly behind profile, down 2.3 per cent or &euro;214 million.  This shortfall against target is across a range of income tax components. </p>  <p>  Income tax encompasses a broad range of elements, some of which are not directly impacted by employment or wage developments.  These include Deposit Interest Retention Tax, Life Assurance Exit Tax, Dividend Withholding Tax and Back Duty.  Some of these components are having a drag on overall income tax receipts in the first half of 2017.  </p>  <p>  However, it is worth pointing out that the key component, i.e. income tax (PAYE), which accounts for around &euro;13 billion or 65 per cent of total income tax receipts is broadly in line with profile at end-June.  This is consistent with the increases in employment and earnings in the labour market which we have witnessed in the year to date. </p>  <p>  Overall, the continued momentum in the labour market of late is underlined by broad-based, full-time employment gains coupled with significant reductions in short-term, long-term and youth unemployment.  The solid performance of PAYE receipts in the year to date is indicative of these positive trends. </p></reply>

This basis of taxation makes no distinction between rental income from property let for residential occupation and property let for commercial occupation.</p><p>While the same computational rules to calculate taxable rental income are generally applied to both individuals and companies, income earned by individuals from the letting of residential or commercial property situated in Ireland is taxable under self-assessment income tax, while rental income earned by companies is assessable for corporation tax.</p><p>Each property must have a separate tax computation in which the rental expenses for each property are deducted from the related rental income for the same property in order to arrive at a surplus (i.e. income greater than expenses) or a deficiency (i.e. expenses greater than income) of taxable rental income in respect of the property.  The total of surpluses and deficiencies are then aggregated to arrive at Case V profits or gains arising in the year.</p><p><b>Rates of income tax</b></p><p>Rental income forms part of the landlord&rsquo;s total taxable income for the relevant tax year and is liable to tax at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax &ndash; the standard rate of 20% if total income is below the standard rate band and the higher rate of 40% if above.  PRSI and USC are in general, also chargeable on rental income.</p><p><b>Rent-a-Room relief</b></p><p>Under the &lsquo;Rent a Room&rsquo; scheme provided for in section 216A of the TCA 1997 an individual who lets a room (or rooms) in his or her sole or main residence as residential accommodation may be exempt from income tax, PRSI and USC in respect of income from the letting where the aggregate of the gross rents and any sums for meals or other services supplied in connection with the letting does not exceed the threshold for the year in question, which is &euro;14,000 for 2017.  Although the income is exempt it must be included in the individual&rsquo;s tax return for the year in question.</p><p>This relief does not apply to companies or partnerships.</p><p><b>Non-resident individuals</b></p><p>As noted above, non-resident individuals are liable to Irish tax in respect of rental income from Irish property.  Where rents are paid directly to a non-resident individual, the tenant is obliged to deduct income tax at the standard rate from the payment, as per section 1041 of the TCA 1997.  Credit can be claimed for the tax withheld on the income tax return of the landlord.</p><p><b>Partnerships</b></p><p>For the purposes of taxation each partner is regarded as individually carrying on a separate trade; this concept is referred to as the partner&rsquo;s &ldquo;several trade&rdquo; and each partner is liable to income tax on his/her share of the partnership profits or gains, including Case V rental profits. </p><p><b>Companies</b></p><p>A company, whether resident or non-resident, is chargeable to tax in respect of rental income arising in the State.  Such rental income is chargeable at the higher 25% rate of corporation tax.  If the company is a &ldquo;close company&rdquo; (that is, a company under the control of 5 or fewer participators or participators who are directors) it may also be liable to the 20% close company surcharge on undistributed estate and investment income if the rental profits are retained within the company.</p><p><b>REITs </b></p><p>Finance Act of 2013 introduced the regime for the operation of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in Ireland.  A REIT is a collective investment vehicle designed to hold properties in a tax neutral manner.  The function of the REIT framework is to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply on property investment via a corporate vehicle.</p><p>Rental profits arising in a REIT are exempt from corporation tax.  However, profits from any other activities are subject to corporation tax in the normal way.  A REIT is subject to strict conditions including an annual requirement to distribute 85% of its property income by way of property income dividend.  It must not be a &ldquo;close company&rdquo; and it must be a listed company.</p><p>Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT) at the standard rate is withheld on distributions to an individual from a REIT.  An Irish resident individual is taxable on the distribution received at their marginal rate of income tax, plus USC and PRSI, with credit for the DWT suffered.  The tax treatment of the distribution for a non-resident individual will depend on where the individual is resident, whether Ireland has a Double Taxation Agreement with that country, and what the terms of the Double Taxation Agreement are.</p><p><b>Working Group on the Tax and Fiscal Treatment of Rental Accommodation Providers</b></p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, a working group was established in early 2017 to examine and report on the tax treatment of landlords (or rental accommodation providers) and to put forward options, where appropriate, for amendments to such treatment.  The establishment of this group was one of the commitments contained in the &lsquo;Strategy for the Rental Sector&rsquo; which was published by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in December 2016.  The working group is chaired by the Department of Finance and its membership consists of officials from the Department of Finance; the Revenue Commissioners; the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government; and the Residential Tenancies Board.  As part of the group&rsquo;s work, a public consultation lasting for four weeks was conducted from March to April 2017 which received almost 70 written submissions from a wide range of interested parties, including individual landlords, representative bodies and charitable organisations.  The report of the working group is due to be presented to me by the end of July 2017, to allow for consideration of any of the options put forward as part of my deliberations for Budget 2018.</p></reply>

This was identified by a survey of SMEs for the report.</p><p>The central purpose of the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit is to encourage companies to undertake high-value add R&amp;amp;D activity in Ireland, thereby supporting jobs and investment here.  The principal benefit of the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit is that it provides a tax credit at a 25%, entailing that for every &euro;4 spent on qualifying R&amp;amp;D, a tax credit of &euro;1 will be provided to the company.  </p><p>I would note that the R&amp;amp;D tax credit is a standard measure available to all companies. However, I am cognisant that the administration process may be an issue for some smaller companies.  In this regard, the Revenue Commissioners, in conjunction with relevant stakeholders, have established an R&amp;amp;D discussion group which will look at the administrative burdens faced by those engaging with the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit. </p><p>Furthermore, with a view to streamlining the audit of R&amp;amp;D claims for small businesses, the Revenue Commissioners have stated in a recent e-Brief that they will not challenge the claim under the &quot;science test&quot; in certain circumstances.  The new practice will apply to small or micro businesses where:</p><p>- an IDA / Enterprise Ireland R&amp;amp;D grant has been approved in respect of the project;</p><p>- the credit claim in any year is no more than &euro;50,000;</p><p>- the project is undertaken in a qualifying field of science or technology.</p></reply>

This proposal is part of a project to modernise the VAT regime of the European Union.  It allows Member States to charge the same reduced rates of VAT to electronic publications as they would apply to non-electronic publications.</p><p>The second proposal dealt with the General Reverse Charge Mechanism and is essentially a measure to combat VAT fraud by making the customer responsible for the payment of the tax rather than the supplier as under the present system.</p><p>No agreement was reached on these two tax proposals and the matter will now fall to the Estonian Presidency to address.</p><p>Ministers also discussed a number of legislative proposals that dealt with strengthening the Banking Union and also dealt with risk-reduction measures.  Two of the proposals &ndash; namely a draft directive on the ranking of unsecured debt instruments in insolvency proceedings (bank creditor hierarchy) and a draft regulation on transitional arrangements to phase in the regulatory capital impact of the IFRS 9 international accounting standard &ndash; were agreed by Minsters.  This means that the Presidency can commence discussion on these draft proposals with the European Parliament as soon as the Parliament has approved its own negotiating stance.</p><p>The Council noted the progress made by working parties on the remaining four draft proposals.  These are:</p><p>1. proposal for amending the existing regulations and Directives on bank capital requirements;</p><p>2. proposal for a directive amending the directive on bank recovery and resolution as regards the loss-absorbing and recapitalisation capacity of banks;</p><p>3. proposal for a regulation amending regulation 806/14 on the EU's single resolution mechanism as regards the loss-absorbing and recapitalisation capacity of banks;</p><p>4. proposal for a regulation establishing a European deposit insurance scheme.</p><p>The first three proposals - issued by the Commission in November 2016 - are aimed at reducing risk in the financial system by making banks more resilient to external shocks.  They are designed to incorporate into EU law standards agreed at the global level by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board.  The final proposal sets out to establish an EU-level insurance scheme (European deposit insurance scheme) to strengthen the protection of bank deposits.  Work will now continue at a technical level on these proposals.</p><p>Ministers were also debriefed on the state of play of current legislative proposals in the field of financial services.</p><p>On the remaining portion of the agenda, Ministers were also informed on the state of play as regards:</p><p>1. work aimed at tackling high levels of non-performing loans in Europe;</p><p>2. the Midterm review of the Capital Markets Union action plan; and</p><p>3. progress made on the implementation of the action plan for strengthening the fight against terrorist financing.</p><p>The Council will return to the first two topics in July with a view to adopting draft Council conclusions.</p><p>The Council also held a discussion on the 2017 European Semester and the corresponding Country-Specific Recommendations (CSRs).  The Council approved the CSRs for onward transmission to the June European Council for endorsement with a view to final adoption at the July ECOFIN Council.</p><p>Finally, Ministers made decisions under the Stability and Growth Pact to abrogate the Excessive Deficit Procedures for Portugal and Croatia.  Also, a recommendation was made to Romania to correct a significant deviation from the adjustment path towards its medium-term budgetary objective.</p></reply>

This decision was based on the application of the public interest assessment (PIA), which concluded that neither of these banks provide critical functions, and that their failure is not expected to have significant adverse impact on financial stability.</p>  <p>  As a result, the winding up of both banks is taking place under national insolvency proceedings launched by the Italian authorities.  This is in line with the principles of the BRRD.</p>  <p>  Outside the BRRD, EU rules foresee the possibility for governments to seek EU Commission approval for the use of national funds to facilitate liquidation by mitigating negative regional economic effects.  In this case as the two aided banks will exit the market the EU Commission found that there should be no distortion of competition in European banking markets.  Liquidation is largely a national competence and powers and procedures can vary by EU Member State.</p>  <p>  Consequently, the Italian Government received approval from the EU Commission to provide support to facilitate the liquidation or these two banks, part of which involved the sale of certain assets to Intesa Sanpaolo.  The measures enable the sale of parts of the two banks' activities to Intesa, including the transfer of employees.  The measures will also enable the wind-down of the remaining liquidation entity, financed by loans provided by Intesa.  The Italian State will grant the following measures:</p>  <p>  - Cash injections of &euro;4.78bn; and</p>  <p>  - State guarantees of a maximum of &euro;12bn, notably on Intesa's financing of the liquidation process.  The State guarantees would be called upon if the liquidated estate were insufficient to pay back Intesa for its financing of the liquidation process.</p>  <p>  In both banks, shareholders and junior creditors have fully contributed, reducing the costs to the Italian Government, whilst depositors were protected.</p></reply>

The State also granted an additional over-allotment option over a further 3.75% of AIB's ordinary share capital as part of this transaction.  Hence unless some of these shares are bought back in the market by our stabilisation agent in the period post floatation, the State will recoup around &euro;3.4 billion from the IPO.  This transaction was strongly supported by a broad range of international institutional investors with all of the top investors being categorised as longer term investors and sovereign wealth funds.</p>  <p>  Following the AIB IPO the State's remaining shareholding in the bank is in a 'lock-up' period of 180 days.  This is standard market practice.  I would therefore expect no further sale of AIB shares in 2017.  After this period elapses, officials in my Department will revert to monitoring the performance of the bank, its share price and equity markets more generally to determine the next sensible opportunity to realise value from our investment.  It is important to point out that exiting our full investment in AIB in a measured way that maximises proceeds is likely to take a number of years but I am confident that we will recoup all the money that we invested in the bank over time.</p>  <p>  Under the Programme for a Partnership Government any future sale of AIB shares contemplated before the end of 2018 would need to be approved by the Government.</p></reply>

In terms of monitoring the credit requirements for SMEs, officials from my Department collate and examine data from AIB and Bank of Ireland on a monthly basis, including data pertaining to the various sectors.  Furthermore, my officials meet the banks on a quarterly basis to ensure an informed understanding of the wider SME bank lending environment which assists the development and implementation of policies aimed at ensuring SME access to finance and increased competition in the SME lending sector.</p>  <p>  My Department also commissions biannual surveys to ascertain the demand for credit by SMEs.  This survey series, most recently conducted by Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes on behalf of my Department, is the most comprehensive survey of SME credit demand in Ireland, covering 1,500 respondents and involving over 6,000 direct telephone calls to SMEs.  SMEs of all sizes trading in all sectors, excluding property development and speculative activities, are included.  The survey covers demand for credit from both bank and non-bank sources.</p>  <p>  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the most recently published Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey, covering the period October 2016 to March 2017 available on www.finance.gov.ie.  The results of this survey show that, when pending applications are excluded, 88% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved.  Working capital/cash flow requirements are now provided as the main reason for applying for bank finance with 31% stating this is why they requested bank finance.  When asked about sources of finance for working capital, internal funds/retained earnings were the main finance source of working capital with 78% of working capital coming from this source (up 5%).  The survey also showed that the number of businesses reporting a profit has increased for the fourth year in a row, and a higher proportion of SMEs than ever are pursuing a growth strategy.</p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth.

Revenue&rsquo;s focus is on protecting the various income streams to the Exchequer across all tax heads, including VAT, customs duties, income tax, USC and corporation tax.  Revenue conducts a full range of interventions to combat tax evasion.  These include risk management interventions, Revenue Audits and Investigations, in addition to site visits.  This process is aided by Revenue&rsquo;s Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling (&ldquo;REAP&rdquo;) system and other third party data sources.</p>  <p>  Of particular interest in the context of the Deputy&rsquo;s question is that in 2016 Revenue carried out a comprehensive programme of site visits in the construction sector.  This involved 2,126 site visits during which 11,699 interviews were undertaken.  The programme resulted in 345 reclassifications from self-employed contractors to employees, 848 employee registrations and 84 employers registering to operate PAYE.</p>  <p>  In addition, in the course of a range of Revenue outdoor activities outside of the construction sector during 2016, Revenue activity resulted in 184 re-classifications from self-employed to employees and 1,192 employee registrations.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware also, the consultation process on "the use of intermediary-type employment structures and self-employment arrangements and their impact on tax and PRSI&rdquo; invited submissions from interested parties on possible measures to address the loss to the Exchequer that may arise under two sets of arrangements:</p>  <p>  - where an individual, who would otherwise be an employee, establishes a company to provide his or her services, and</p>  <p>  - where an individual, who is dependent on, and under the control of, a single employer in the same  manner as an employee, is classified as a self-employed individual.</p>  <p>  I understand that officials from my Department and the Department of Social Protection, together with Revenue, are currently in the final stages of completing a report on the consultation.  As soon as the report on this process reaches me, and my colleague the Minister for Employment and Social Protection, we will consider its contents and then I expect we will publish it.</p></reply>

Specifically these provisions allow for temporary deviations from the required structural budgetary adjustment, subject to strict conditions.</p>  <p>  The harmonised methodology for calculating the economic cycle used in the implementation of the SGP remains an area with limitations within the fiscal rules.  My Department has secured useful changes to this methodology over the years by consistently raising concerns and objections at European level.  These changes have partially compensated for the reality that the harmonised methodology is not suitable for small open economies.  My Department continues to advocate for improvements in the harmonised methodology and will continue to engage constructively on this and other relevant technical issues.</p>  <p>  The Government has repeatedly acknowledged the need for increased public investment.  The current Capital Plan sets a baseline from which this Government intends to increase investment in critical infrastructure, and in areas such as housing and health, as the Deputy has identified into the future.  As outlined in the 2017 Estimates, gross voted capital expenditure will increase to &euro;4.5 billion in 2017.  This represents an increase of &euro;325 million in comparison to the 2016 outturn.  By 2021 it is envisaged that Gross Voted Capital Expenditure will reach &euro;7.29 billion, an increase of over 100 per cent in comparison to its level in 2014.  These increases in investment over the coming years will be allocated to identified priorities on the basis of the outcome of the review of the Capital Plan currently underway.</p>  <p>  It should be further noted that the SGP has a feature designed to promote capital investment in the expenditure benchmark.  Capital formation increases are smoothed over four years with the result that only one quarter of the increase in public investment must be funded in the first year from within the fiscal space.  This provision, which means increases in capital spending for housing and other purposes can be front-loaded within the EU rules, has been utilised in Ireland's budgetary plans.</p>  <p>  To date, Ireland has not been eligible to apply for the use of the investment or structural reform clauses.  While this remains the case in relation to the investment clause, Ireland is moving into a position where it could apply for use of the structural reform clause.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should also be aware that any decision to increase capital expenditure over and above already planned levels would need to balance the danger of potentially over-heating in the economy with the need to address infrastructure priorities and risks such as Brexit.  The rainy day fund is one measure announced by the government which would provide a prudent counter cyclical buffer to the economy.  This is currently under review and further information will be provided in the Summer Economic Statement (SES) to be published in July.</p></reply>

The arrangements that will apply after Brexit will depend on the outcome of negotiations between the EU and UK.  The Government is clear that any manifestation of a hard border would have very negative consequences.  A key priority is to ensure the continued free flow of trade on the island and the need to avoid a hard border.  Clearly in this regard the closer the trading relationship between the UK and EU is more generally the better.</p>  <p>  I would point out that the guidelines for the EU 27 Article 50 negotiation framework specifically refer to the need to support and protect the achievements, benefits and commitments of the Peace Process.  In this regard the guidelines recognise the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, outlining the need for flexible and imaginative solutions, including the aim of avoiding a hard border, while respecting the integrity of the Union legal order.</p>  <p>  The Government has welcomed the EU&rsquo;s negotiating guidelines as reflecting Ireland&rsquo;s unique concerns and priorities.  They express the EU&rsquo;s continued support for the Peace Process and the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement.  They acknowledge the need for flexible and imaginative solutions to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.  They agree to the recognition of existing bilateral agreements and arrangements between the UK and Ireland, which are compatible with EU law, such as the Common Travel Area.  It is clear, however, that the withdrawal of a Member State from the Union is a situation without any precedent, in either political or practical terms.  That said, we are looking at other border situations which may offer possible guidance on how we address the unique situation found on the island of Ireland.</p></reply>

I also believe that the Setanta judgment, by finding that MIBI is not liable to meet third party claims, removes a major uncertainty from industry, which I would expect to be reflected in pricing in the short to medium term.</p></reply>

However, using Income Tax returns information it is possible to identify the incomes of individuals used to assess USC liability, which is an individualised tax.  On this basis, using information for the year 2015, the latest year for which data are available, 81,794 individuals had annual income for the purposes of USC of over &euro;100,000.</p><p>As regards the 3% USC surcharge applicable to self-employed income in excess of &euro;100,000, 12,299 persons were subject to the charge in 2015, the latest year for which data are available.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the estimated first and full year yields to the Exchequer of increasing the self-employed levy on income over &euro;100,000 as set out by the Deputy are outlined in the table below.  These estimates have been developed on the basis that the proposed levies would replace the existing 3% USC levy on self-employed income earners who earn in excess of &euro;100,000.<table><tr><th>USC levy on self-employed with income in excess of &euro;100,000</th><th>First Year (Millions &euro;)</th><th>Full Year (Millions &euro;)</th></tr><tr><td>3%</td><td>No Change</td><td>No Change</td></tr><tr><td>4%</td><td>23</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>5%</td><td>46</td><td>82</td></tr><tr><td>6%</td><td>69</td><td>123</td></tr><tr><td>7%</td><td>92</td><td>164</td></tr><tr><td>8%</td><td>115</td><td>205</td></tr><tr><td>9%</td><td>138</td><td>246</td></tr><tr><td>10%</td><td>160</td><td>287</td></tr></table></p><p>As regards the cost of abolishing the 3% USC surcharge on the self-employed with income over &euro;100,000, I am advised by Revenue that the estimated first and full year cost to the Exchequer of this measure is &euro;69 million and &euro;123 million respectively.</p><p>As regards introducing a new USC levy on all income earners with individual income over &euro;100,000, the estimated first and full year yields to the Exchequer of introducing the measures as set out by the Deputy are outlined in the table below.  These estimates are net yields derived on the basis that the proposed USC levies would replace the existing 3% levy on self-employed income earners who earn in excess of &euro;100,000.  The estimates therefore incorporate both the cost of abolishing the current 3% levy on self-employed income and the yield from introducing a new levy at the specified percentage on all income in excess of &euro;100,000.<table><tr><th>USC levy on all individual income in excess of &euro;100,000</th><th>First Year (Millions &euro;)</th><th>Full Year (Millions &euro;)</th></tr><tr><td>2%</td><td>84</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>3%</td><td>160</td><td>180</td></tr><tr><td>4%</td><td>236</td><td>280</td></tr><tr><td>5%</td><td>312</td><td>381</td></tr><tr><td>6%</td><td>388</td><td>482</td></tr><tr><td>7%</td><td>465</td><td>583</td></tr></table></p><p>In relation to the number of persons liable for PAYE that have employer PRSI applied on an individual basis on annual income of over &euro;100,000, I would point out that PRSI is applied to earnings on a weekly basis and not by reference to cumulative annual income.  I am informed by the Department of Social Protection that, in 2016, there were 197,902 employments which had a weekly income of over &euro;1,923 in at least one week of the year.  However, this does not necessarily mean that annual income was over &euro;100,000 for each one of these employments, as to reach this amount annually would require 52 weeks of employment at this income.</p><p>These above figures are estimates from the Revenue tax forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2014, adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim.  They are estimated by reference to projected 2017 incomes.  They are provisional and may be revised.</p></reply>

Revisions to Ireland's GDP level for 2015, published by the CSO, highlight that the ratios based on public expenditure as a percentage of GDP must be interpreted with very significant caution.</p>  <p>  2. Furthermore, given Ireland's relatively young population, adjusting for the demographic profile of the population also impacts on comparisons with other European countries.  This is illustrated on page 14 of the Mid-Year Expenditure Report 2016 which shows adjusted public expenditure in Ireland in 2014 (as a % of GNI) being above the EU average when account is taken of defence and age-related expenditure.</p>  <p>3. Analysis of public spending on a per-capita basis can also provide a different perspective.  A recent analysis by the Nevin Economic Research Institute found that Ireland ranks 10th amongst 11 high-income EU countries when public expenditure, excluding interest, is ranked on a per capita basis.  This analysis placed Ireland's public expenditure per capita ahead of per-capita expenditure in the UK.  A comparison based on expenditure as a percentage of GDP would place Ireland's spending below the UK.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 marked the third year in succession that gross voted expenditure has been increased.  Over the period 2015 to 2017 gross voted expenditure has increased by an annual average of 3 per cent.  The focus over the coming years must remain on sustainable increases that are affordable both now and in the future. </p>  <p>  There is also a requirement to examine not only the amount of resources allocated towards expenditure but also the impact of this expenditure.  In this fiscal context, the ongoing review and evaluation of existing programmes and expenditure, rather than targeting a certain expenditure to GDP ratio, can better support effective delivery of public services.</p></reply>

The operation of the Expenditure Benchmark is set out very clearly in the Vade Mecum of the Stability and Growth Pact, published by the European Commission. </p>  <p>  As set out in the Vade Mecum, the only means by which to increase expenditure beyond the limits set out in the Expenditure Benchmark is through the introduction of a Discretionary Revenue Measure (DRM), which would cause revenues to permanently increase.  The use of a fund surplus does not count as a DRM and cannot therefore be used to fund additional expenditure over and above the limits set out in the Expenditure Benchmark. </p>  <p>  However, the introduction of an increased employer PRSI contribution to go directly towards the NTF would constitute a DRM, as this is a policy decision to permanently increase revenue flows into the fund.  The additional revenues raised by such a measure could then be used to fund additional NTF expenditure and provision of services.  </p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy's question on the justification to ask employers to contribute more to the NTF while the Fund carries a significant surplus.  Firstly, I would stress that the Fund, including its surplus, as set out in the legislation, can only be specifically used to raise skills of those in employment, to provide training to those who are wishing to acquire skills to take up employment or to provide information on the existing and future skills need of the economy. </p>  <p>  Regarding using the NTF for capital expenditure; as previously indicated the implications of using the fund for any other purpose, including capital expenditure, requires consideration of whether the utilisation of the surplus would be in conformity with the Expenditure Benchmark rule since as set out above, use of the surplus would consume fiscal space.  To increase expenditure from the NTF, as the Deputy suggested, requires a policy decision to permanently increase revenue flows into the fund - in this instance a proposed increase in the NTF levy.  It is the additional revenues of this policy change that can then be used for future funding needs.  The current surplus in the Fund does not represent additional revenues.</p></reply>

A total of &euro;362 million has been available annually over the last number of years from the NTF for training for employed and unemployed people.  In 2017, funding of &euro;366 million will be provided for training activities from the NTF.</p>  <p>  While the NTF does not form part of the Vote of the Department of Education and Skills (DES), the allocation for each scheme is determined as part of the annual Estimates process.  The NTF is included as an annex to the published Estimates of the Department and such funding is included in the overall expenditure ceiling for DES since 2011.  This means that overall expenditure from the Fund cannot be increased, even where receipts increase, without a corresponding drop in voted expenditure.  The surplus remains available for investment in education and training programmes to meet skills needs.</p>  <p>  I am reviewing the allocation of funding to programmes in the Further Education and Training and Higher Education sectors as between NTF and Exchequer sources in terms both of the emphasis required on training for employment and training persons in employment and of satisfying the needs of enterprise to meet strategic skills requirements.  One objective of this review is to direct NTF allocations in a manner that best reflects enterprise priorities as identified through the revised national skills architecture.</p></reply>

The Education Act 1998, subject to the provisions of that Act, provides that there is made available to each person resident in the State a level and quality of education which is appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of that person. </p><p>My Department's policy is that children with special educational needs should be included in mainstream placements with additional supports provided, unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or in the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated, as is provided for under Section 2 of the Education of Persons with Special Needs Act 2004. </p><p>Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services including additional teaching and/or care supports.  Some children may be supported in mainstream with additional supports or in a special class attached to a mainstream school.  Students in a special class have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.  In special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios.  My Department, therefore, provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools, which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs, in order to ensure that wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to an appropriate education.  </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), which is an independent statutory agency, is responsible, through its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports as required.  The NCSE operates within the Department's criteria in allocating such support, as set out in various Departmental circulars. </p><p>Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are provided to assist recognised schools to cater for pupils with disabilities, who have additional and significant care needs, in an educational context and where the nature of these care needs have been outlined in medical and other professional reports as being so significant that a pupil will require additional adult assistance in order to be able to attend school and to participate in education.</p><p>The NCSE allocates SNA support to schools in accordance with the criteria set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014, which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie, in order that students who have care needs can access SNA support as and when it is needed.  My Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure that every child who is assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to such support. </p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools, as a school based resource.  The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually, taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of all of the children concerned, rather than solely by reference to a pupil&rsquo;s disability categorisation.</p><p>The provision of a quantum of support to schools gives schools the autonomy and flexibility to manage their allocation of SNA support in order to utilise this support to the best possible effect.  It allows schools to target support to those pupils who have the greatest degree of need at any given time, recognising that the level of need that a child may have may be variable over time.  The school is in a position to use their educational experience and expertise to manage the level of support which has been allocated to them to provide for the care needs of identified children as and when those needs arise and to provide access to SNA support for all children who have been granted assess to support.</p><p>Where a school or parent wishes to appeal the SNA support allocation which has been made, they may do so through the NCSE appeal process, details of which are set out at www.ncse.ie.</p><p>All schools have the contact details of their local SENO and parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p><p>From September 2017, a new Special Education Teaching allocation process will be introduced, replacing the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.</p><p>The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.  Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. </p><p>No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year. </p><p>DES Circular 0013/2017 for primary schools and 0014/2017 for post primary schools were published and allocations based on the school profiles were issued to all schools on 7th March 2017.  Details of the special education teaching allocations have also been published on the NCSE website.</p><p>Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs have also now been published and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special educational needs.  The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants. </p><p>The total profiled allocation which is being made to each school is designed to ensure that all schools have a set level of special education teaching support in order to provide additional teaching support for all pupils in their school, including those who may enrol in future, who have identified needs. </p><p>Pupils under the new allocation model will be identified by schools for additional teaching support in accordance with the Continuum of Support Guidelines, and the Guidelines which accompany the Circulars 0013/2017 and 0014/2017.  Teachers and School Principals will use their professional judgement in applying the principles and practices set out in the Continuum of Support Guidelines: .</p><p>In circumstances where a parent is dissatisfied as to the extent of additional support teaching time which has been allocated to their child from within a schools allocation, the normal course of action open to a parent would be to raise this matter with the school Principal in the first instance, and to request that additional teaching be provided to their child.</p><p>In the event that a parent raised an issue in relation to the allocation of additional support for their child with the school Principal, and remains dissatisfied with the manner in which the school Principal addressed their complaint, the next course of action open to the parent would be to raise this matter directly with the Board of Management of the School, who are the body which has responsibility for the management of the school.</p></reply>

The issue of promoting healthy eating is addressed in schools through subjects such as Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE), and Home Economics as well as in Physical Education.  The aim is to equip students with such skills and knowledge to enable them to make appropriate choices for healthy lifestyles.  This informed approach will help to reduce the incidence of obesity in our young people.  Many post-primary schools have a number of food outlets, including school shops and vending machines.  My Department acknowledges that the sale of food and beverage products often represents a revenue stream for schools and it is not the intention to end this practice.  Rather the intention is to ensure that there is a greater proportion of healthier alternatives to some of the less healthy products that are currently on offer for sale in schools.  Boards of Management and Principals are encouraged to provide as far as possible that only healthy products are available for purchase on school premises. </p>  <p>  Schools are strongly encouraged to have a formal healthy eating policy that has been developed in consultation with students and parents. </p>  <p>  Guidelines are available to schools on Developing a healthy eating policy in Post-Primary Schools, which have been developed by the Department of Health and HSE.  The healthy eating policy should outline how the school supports healthy eating practices through the promotion of healthy lunches and healthy snacks and other means.</p>  <p>  My Department issued a circular to all post primary schools in September 2015 on the Promotion of Healthy Lifestyles in Post Primary Schools (Circular number 0051/2015).</p></reply>

It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance and counselling services, and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally.  Schools also engage in a wide range of sport and cultural co-curricular activities which provide an important opportunity for students to experience success and personal growth. </p>  <p>  Wellbeing Guidelines for Post-Primary and more recently for Primary Schools have been produced by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive.  The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research.  They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. </p>  <p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process.  Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services. </p>  <p>  The Headstrong Help Seeking Schools Programme initiative is one of a range of external resources and initiatives that are available to assist, among others, schools in supporting various aspects of a positive mental health process.  My Department is not in a position to endorse each individual initiative, and it is a matter for individual schools to determine which of these resources they choose to access.  My Department's advice is that schools in the first instance should implement the guidelines document effectively and when considering collaborating with external agencies in doing work in the area of mental health promotion, schools should be particularly cognisant of my Department's circulars 0022/2010 and 0023/2010 which provide advice on best practice in this regard. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. </p>  <p>  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.</p>  <p>  Budget 2012 increased the appointment and retention ratios for small schools (i.e., schools with up to four classroom teachers). Improvements to the staffing of these schools were announced for the 2015/16 school year.  These improvements are improved retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher and also the improved appointment and retention thresholds for one-teacher schools situated 8km or more from the nearest school of the same type of patronage and/or language of instruction.</p>  <p>  In addition, Budget 2016 announced a 1 point improvement to the primary staffing schedule.  The improved staffing schedule which is available on the Department website has been implemented for the 2016/17 school year.</p>  <p>  Following a review of the staffing allocation for Small Primary Schools, Budget 2017 announced two adjustments in relation to one teacher schools.  Where the school is the sole primary school on an island the school will be able to appoint a second teacher.  In relation to single teacher schools generally with an enrolment of 15 or more pupils the school can apply to the staffing appeal board for a second post where the single teacher has children across 6 or more class groups.  The detailed arrangements have been set out in the staffing schedule circular for the 2017/18 school year. </p></reply>

There will then be discussions between individual ETBs and the existing patrons/landowners concerning the possible transfer of schools to accommodate this demonstrated demand for diversity.</p>  <p>  Each ETB will prepare a report for my Department outlining the levels of demand within their functional areas and the responses of the existing patrons as to how this might be accommodated through the reconfiguration of existing school provision.  In the subsequent and separate implementation phase, where the level of demand for multi-denominational schools is sufficient to justify transfer of a school from denominational to multi-denominational patronage, a process will commence to give effect to that.  There will be a role for the existing patron/landowner in consulting with local community and school interests, including parents and taking into account proposals from different prospective multi-denominational patrons.  It is envisaged that transfers will largely be by way of voluntary transfer of live schools by existing patrons.</p>  <p>  This new process for supporting transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local families is based around principles of transparency and cooperation.  Therefore, there will be a very substantial level of consultation of local communities in the process, both with the ETBs in the initial phase to establish evidence of demand by consulting pre-school parents and subsequently through the requirement for the existing patron to consult with local community and school interests in proposing to transfer patronage of an existing school to an alternative patron body.  In that process, the existing patron will also take into account proposals from all prospective multi-denominational patrons that wish to be considered. In the final instance, an application for a formal transfer of patronage will have to be made by the existing patron under the Education Act 1989, which will require Ministerial approval.</p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge the voluntary nature of these transfers, given that the current patron is in most cases the owner of the land on which the school stands.  My Department will develop protocols on patronage transfer with existing patrons to ensure that school and local communities and prospective patrons are fully consulted before a decision is made.  I am confident that this process will respect the views of all parties - parents, local schools and communities and patrons.</p>  <p>  While these new structures are being introduced, my Department will continue to work with the main stakeholders to progress delivery of diversity in areas already identified, in 2017 and beyond.  I would point out that the previous model of divestment yielded only a very limited number of schools for transfer to multi-denominational patrons (10 since 2013).  I believe that the new schools reconfiguration for diversity process has the potential to significantly increase patron diversity in our school system with a target of reaching 400 multi-denominational and non-denominational schools by 2030.  In addition to progressing the reconfiguration of existing school provision to provide greater choice to parents in areas of stable population, the Government is committed to ensuring that parental preferences will continue to be key to patronage decisions on new schools established in areas of demographic growth.</p>  <p>  I look forward to working constructively with all education stakeholders and patron bodies in this important endeavour and I would ask all parties to put aside sectional or self interest in pursuing the national objective of providing greater diversity of school provision in line with the choices of parents, families and school communities.</p></reply>

This included:</p><p>- more comprehensive annual governance reporting requirements,</p><p>- the introduction of signed financial memoranda between the HEA and HEIs setting out respective responsibilities,</p><p>- new guidelines on timeliness of reporting,</p><p>- regular reporting and liaison with the Office of the C&amp;amp;AG and</p><p>- a new accountability and risk mechanisms in place with the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>This culminated in the establishment and communication of a new Governance Framework for the Higher Education System, which is available on the HEA website.

My Department&rsquo;s policy is that, in general, complaints about teachers should be made to the school and matters resolved in the first instance at a local level. This is also the Teaching Council&rsquo;s policy.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Council that, where a complaint has been referred to the Council&rsquo;s Investigating Committee and the Committee is satisfied it relates to a Fitness to Teach matter, the Committee will communicate with the school to ascertain whether procedures under Section 24 of the Education Act or any other relevant procedures are underway.</p>  <p>  If Section 24 procedures are neither completed, underway nor contemplated the Committee will decide if there are good and sufficient reasons for considering the complaint. If there are not good and sufficient reasons the Committee will refuse to consider the complaint in accordance with section 42(5)(b) of the Teaching Council Acts and will indicate in its reasons that the refusal is based (in whole or in part) on the absence of Section 24 procedures having been exhausted.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Programme for a Partnership Government provides that the Government will introduce a stronger complaints procedure and charter for parents.</p>  <p>  On 5 December 2016, I published the General Scheme of an Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill 2016. The Government have approved the draft outline of a new law, which will require every school to consult with parents and students, and publish and operate a Parent and Student Charter.</p>  <p>  The draft Bill went to the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills for pre-legislative scrutiny. Pre-legislative scrutiny began on 7 March with officials, NGOs and certain of the education partners, followed by a session on 21 March with some more of the education partners. The Committee recently held a further session with the remaining education partners on 30 May. It is expected that the Oireachtas Committee will publish a report after the completion of the pre-legislative scrutiny process.</p>  <p>  The Fitness to Teach provisions of the Teaching Council Acts were commenced in July 2016 and the Teaching Council is still at the early stages of dealing with Fitness to Teach complaints. The Council is developing and refining its procedures in that regard and I will, where possible, support the Council in their effective implementation.</p></reply>

The proposal under consideration seeks to deliver up to an additional &euro;200m per annum by 2020 through an increase in the National Training Fund levy. </p>  <p>  Proposals to develop a more sustainable funding model for the higher education system are contained in the Cassells report that is currently being considered by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  I referred the Cassells report to the Joint Committee in order to build political consensus around the most appropriate future funding model for higher education.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Higher Education Authority (HEA) are currently reviewing the Recurrent Grant Allocation Model (RGAM) in order to ensure that the means by which funding is allocated by the HEA to Higher Education Institutions is as efficient and effective as possible. </p>  <p>  In relation to student supports, my Department is investing in a significant programme of supports in order to assist students from under-represented groups to participate in and complete higher education. In total my Department will invest approximately &euro;450 million in access supports in the 2017/18 academic year. This will benefit approximately 80,000 disadvantaged students through the student grant scheme.

In schools, the Croke Park hours are additional hours worked by teachers (33 additional hours a year at post-primary and 36 hours at primary).  They are a valuable resource within the school system which allow certain essential activities involving the entire teaching staff or groups of teachers to take place.  These include staff meetings, parent-teacher meetings, school planning, subject planning and mandated Continuous Professional Development.</p>  <p>  Before the Croke Park hours were introduced, these activities ate into tuition time.  This meant that schools closed for full days or half days in order to carry them out, causing interruption to tuition and significant inconvenience for parents, as well as child care costs &ndash; particularly for primary parents.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that many public servants committed significantly more hours than this under the public service agreements.  Across the public services &ndash; education, health, local authorities, civil service etc. - the additional time being provided represents about 450,000 additional hours per annum or the equivalent of between 12,000 and 13,000 public service posts.  That is a serious productivity benefit for the Exchequer. Replacing those hours would cost hundreds of millions of euro.</p>  <p>  In response to concerns expressed by teacher trade unions regarding the use of the Croke Park hours, my Department agreed to carry out a review of their usage under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  This review, which also involves the school management bodies, is under way and will have regard to teacher professional judgement, system and school requirements and experience to date of best practice in the use of the hours.</p>  <p>  The review provides for an up-front increase in the quantum of time allowed for planning and development work on other than a whole-school basis.  The original Croke Park Agreement provided that all Croke Park hours would be worked on a whole-school basis.  The Haddington Road Agreement provided that up to 5 of the hours could be worked on a less than whole-school basis (e.g. small groups of subject teachers).  The recent agreement increased this maximum to 8 hours in September 2016 and increases it again to 10 hours in September 2017.</p></reply>

These included</p>  <p>  - a 10% reduction in the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades with effect from 1 January 2011;</p>  <p>  - that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale; and</p>  <p>  - a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.</p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide allowances review, qualification allowances for new teachers were withdrawn.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. </p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreements have, to date, restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for new teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.  </p>  <p>  As a result of these changes and taking into account the proposed pay measures under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the starting salary of a new teacher (2012 entrant) from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.  The comparable starting salary for a pre-2011 entrant post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 (i.e. if full equalisation to pre-2011 pay rates for teachers was achieved) would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511.</p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;85 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  However there are other types of equality that we must also bear in mind, for example equality between public servants and people who work elsewhere or don&rsquo;t work at all.  It would also not be equal or fair for us to do unaffordable deals with particular groups of public servants that mean that we do not have the money left in the public purse to provide increases in social welfare payments for vulnerable groups, tax reductions for people at work, or investments in improvements in public services that people rely on.</p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectorial issue, not just an issue for the education sector.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the recently concluded draft Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 includes a provision in relation to new entrants which states that an examination of the remaining salary scale issues in respect of post-January 2011 recruits at entry grades covered by parties to the Agreement will be undertaken within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement.  </p></reply>

There will then be discussions between individual ETBs and the existing patrons/landowners concerning the possible transfer of schools to accommodate this demonstrated demand for diversity.  My Department is currently working with the Education and Training Board sector and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to develop the process for the identification of demand for diversity at pre-school level.</p>  <p>  Each ETB will then prepare a report for the Department outlining the levels of demand within their functional areas and the responses of the existing patrons as to how this might be accommodated through the reconfiguration of existing school provision.  The location of these schools is therefore unlikely to become available until after the reports have been submitted. </p>  <p>  In the subsequent implementation phase, where the level of demand for multidenominational schools is sufficient to justify transfer of a school from denominational to multi-denominational patronage, a process will commence to give effect to that.  There will be a role for the existing patron/landowner in consulting with local community and school interests and taking into account proposals from different prospective multi-denominational patrons.  It is envisaged that transfers will largely be by way of voluntary transfer of live schools by existing patrons.</p>  <p>  While these new structures are being introduced, my Department will continue to work with the main stakeholders to progress delivery of diversity in areas already identified, in 2017 and beyond.  </p>  <p>  In addition to progressing the reconfiguration of existing school provision to provide greater choice to parents in areas of stable population, the Government is committed to ensuring that parental preferences will continue to be key to patronage decisions on new schools established in areas of demographic growth.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-04a.508.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017070400067#WRJ03900"><p>Last September, I launched the first ever Action Plan for Education, covering the period 2016- 2019.  The central vision of the Plan is that the Irish Education and Training System should become the best in Europe over the next decade.  The Plan&rsquo;s high-level goals are based on the five policy areas which I believe will help us to achieve this ambition. The goals are:</p>  <p>  1. Improve the learning experience and the success of learners</p>  <p>  2. Improve the progress of learners at risk of educational disadvantage or learners with special educational needs</p>  <p>  3. Help those delivering education services to continuously improve</p>  <p>  4. Build stronger bridges between education and wider community</p>  <p>  5. Improve national planning and support services</p>  <p>  The basic aim of this Government is to sustain our economic progress and use it to build a fair and compassionate society.  Education is the best means of delivering a fairer society, breaking down cycles of disadvantage and ensuring that all our people, in particular those with special educational needs, are able to participate in that progress and fulfil their potential.  Excellent and innovative education and training are the pivot around which personal fulfilment, a fair society and a successful nation should revolve.  It is central to sustaining economic success and in converting economic success into building a strong community.  Having the best education and training service in Europe will allow us to provide better opportunities for more people from disadvantaged groups, as well as ensuring that we create more sustainable well-paying jobs.</p>  <p>  Our approach to special education has undergone a huge transformation with a growing proportion of children with special educational needs being educated with their peers in mainstream schools.  The participation and progress of learners with special educational needs across the whole education system remains a key focus with an emphasis on improving whole-school and whole system approaches.  The Action Plan 2017 sets out a range of measures which will be undertaken during this year.  These include allocating teachers to schools under the new allocation model to support children with special educational needs, publishing the outcomes of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme, and consult with partners on the implementation of sections of the EPSEN Act and on the provision of services to children with Down Syndrome. </p>  <p>  Quality of provision is the cornerstone to the success of the education and training system.  We recognise the fundamental roles that leaders, teachers and support staff play and we want to strengthen the system&rsquo;s capacity to continuously improve and to deliver the highest quality education and training services for learners.  The Action Plan 2017 details actions which will ensure that leadership, management, quality frameworks, teaching methods, and initial and continuing training are all operating to the highest standards across the continuum of education and training provision.  These actions include expanding the range of supports available through the Centre for School Leadership, providing dedicated professional support to teachers to support the implementation of curricular and policy change, and developing and introducing a new postgraduate qualification for aspiring school leaders.  Work is also under way on developing a model of supply of both primary and post-primary teachers, following the launch of a report on the subject last month. In the medium- to long- term, this will support schools through helping to match teacher supply with demand.  </p>  <p>  To become an innovation leader and to build a strong talent base, we as a nation must effectively engage with enterprise.  We must work to address identified skills needs in critical areas, and recognise the shifting global economic and political climate in which services are delivered and jobs are created.  Successful enterprise engagement is the foundation of much of the planned activity detailed in the Action Plan 2017.  This includes driving the growth of traineeships and apprenticeships, ensuring the relevance of work placements and work-based projects, and increasing the diversity of opportunity in learning beyond school.  To advance this agenda, together with Minister Halligan, I recently launched the National Skills Council and the Regional Skills Fora.  The Council&rsquo;s members are from senior levels within the public and private sectors, and they will oversee research, advise on the prioritisation of identified skills needs and on addressing those needs, and have a key role in promoting and reporting on the responses of education and training providers to the identified needs.  The nine Regional Skills Fora will provide a cohesive education-led structure for employers and the further and higher education system to work together in addressing the skills needs of their regions, help employers to better understand and access the full range of services available across the system, enhance links between education and training providers in planning and delivering programmes, reduce duplication and inform national funding decisions.</p>  <p>  Recently, Minister Halligan and I also announced the provision of over 6,400 free higher education places under Springboard+ 2017.  This programme is specifically aimed at getting people back to work in areas of identified skills needs.  To that end, courses will be available in the following areas:</p>  <p>  1. ICT</p>  <p>  2. Manufacturing which includes the Biopharma/Med tech sector</p>  <p>  3. Entrepreneurship,</p>  <p>  4. Hospitality</p>  <p>  5. Financial Services</p>  <p>  There will also be some courses in Marketing (including digital marketing), specialist management courses (Food Business, Aviation and Technology Management), Animation and specialist Construction related courses.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that progress is made in all of these areas, updated annual Action Plans will be published each year, detailing the actions that will be implemented during that year.  As part of this process, actions will be monitored against published timelines and progress reports will be published on a quarterly basis.  Recently, the 2016 End of Year Review and the 2017 Quarter 1 Progress Report were published.  They are both available on the Department&rsquo;s website (www.education.ie), with full details of the actions already achieved in these three important areas. </p></reply>

Between December and January the Unit oversaw extensive engagement that I and Minister of State John Halligan TD had with the education sector in the form of four Brexit consultation fora for the higher, further education and training; and primary and post-primary education sectors.  This was supplemented by a joint Skills Brexit stakeholder consultation on 3 July 2017 at which both I and Minister of State for Higher Education Mary Mitchell O'Connor participated.</p>  <p>  The EU/International Unit has also supported my engagement at political and institutional level on our Brexit agenda. I have met counterparts Peter Weir and Simon Hamilton of the NI Executive, and most recently met with the UK&rsquo;s Secretary of State for Education, Justine Greening.  Meetings were also held with the Minister of State for Exiting the EU, David Jones, the UK&rsquo;s Opposition Spokesperson on Brexit, Keir Starmer, as well as members of the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain.  Meetings have also taken place with Ministers from other EU Member States and with representatives of the EU Commission including Commissioner Navracsics.</p>  <p>  The EU/International Unit of my Department has been given overall responsibility for co-ordinating our response to Brexit.  This Unit has been prioritising Brexit work to date and will keep staffing requirements under constant review.</p>  <p>  In discharging its Brexit-related functions, the EU/International Unit participates in the Inter-Departmental Senior Officials Group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, which coordinates the whole-of-Government response to the outcome of the UK referendum, and supports the Cabinet Committee on Brexit.  This is further underpinned by the Unit's active engagement with other Departments in Brexit Workgroups on the Economy and Trade; the Common Travel Area; and European Union Programmes - three of the six sectoral workgroups established to provide key sectoral or thematic advices to the Cabinet Committee and Government.  The Unit also chairs the Education and Research Subgroup under the Economy and Trade strand of co-ordination.  The Subgroup includes relevant areas within the Department and relevant Agencies of the Department and other Departments/Agencies.</p>  <p>  As specific issues on the negotiations agenda emerge, the Department will ensure timely, focused inputs from the relevant policy areas and external stakeholders, through appropriate consultative mechanisms.  </p>  <p>  Significant additional resource requirements are not envisaged for the negotiation phase, but for those that will arise, it is anticipated that costs arising can be provided for from within existing Departmental budgets.</p></reply>

Staff employed on these schemes are paid directly by my Department and are not paid via grant funding.  The 1978 and 1979 schemes are being phased out and have been superseded by a more extensive capitation grant scheme. </p><p>The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme now receive capitation grant assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services. Capitation related grants are issued to the majority of primary and post-primary schools to employ such staff.  Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs.  Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a secretary or caretaker, such staff are employees of individual schools.  My Department therefore does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged.  These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities.  My Department has no plans to develop an alternative scheme for schools to employ secretaries or caretakers separate to the current system of capitation grant assistance. </p><p>Notwithstanding the above, in 2015 my Department agreed to engage with the union side in relation to the pay of school secretaries and caretakers who are employed using grant funding and to enter an arbitration process.  The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries and caretakers comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.  My Department has recently published circular letter 0025/2017 for voluntary secondary schools and circular letter 0026/2017 for primary schools, setting out the application of the second phase increases of the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendations.  The circulars are available at: </p><p>Circular 0025/2017:  <i></i></p><p>Circular 0026/2017  <i>: </i></p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrators recommendation applies.  The circulars issued by my Department set out the revised rates of grant funding for schools and an application process whereby schools can apply for additional funding in order to enable them to pay the revised rates set out in the circulars.</p></reply>

My Department uses also CSO data as one of the key data sources used in the DEIS identification process. </p>  <p>  The criteria used for the allocation of teaching posts in primary and post primary schools is published annually on my Department's website.  The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.</p>  <p>  The Staffing Schedule includes the provision where schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds.  The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.  This process includes a provision in which schools that are not gaining an additional teaching post under the developing schools criterion can submit an appeal to the independent Appeals Board.  This appeal criterion is targeted at those schools that make a significant contribution to the provision of school places and so assist the response to demographic growth within their area.</p>  <p>  My Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.  The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p></reply>

This document sets out the approach of the Government to the EU-UK negotiations, which began formally on 19 June, following the successful campaign to have key Irish issues recognised in the EU negotiation position.</p><p>Following on from this publication, the Government is currently preparing a further paper on economic implications of the Brexit challenge.  This will draw on the work to date across Departments, which will be developed to mitigate emerging sectoral challenges.  These plans will build on ongoing cross-Government research, analysis and consultations with stakeholders, especially through the government&rsquo;s All-Island Civic Dialogue process, and will be important in informing Ireland&rsquo;s domestic response as well as our approach to the EU-UK negotiations.</p><p>Accounting for 17% of Ireland&rsquo;s total exports, the UK is one of our most important trading partners.  The potential impacts of Brexit are therefore profound, with specific sectors such as agrifood particularly challenged.  The Government has consistently made it clear that Ireland wishes to achieve the closest possible trading relationship with the UK.  This is that a number of our EU partners also share, as does the UK itself. </p><p>Future tariff arrangements will be a key focus, as will the need to minimise any burdens of customs or transit costs.  Our hope is that a largely or wholly tariff-free arrangement will be possible. </p><p>In the longer term, we are also conscious of the risk posed by potential regulatory divergence between the UK and EU standards and another priority will be to ensure that the future agreement or agreements on the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK ensure a level playing field. </p><p>In its contacts with the EU Taskforce and EU partners, the Government has consistently stressed the unique impacts that the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal will have on Ireland.  In this context, the strong acknowledgement in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating directives of the need to also <i>&ldquo;address issues arising from Ireland&rsquo;s unique geographic situation, including transit of goods (to and from Ireland via the United Kingdom)&rdquo; </i>in the first phase of negotiations is most welcome. </p><p>The Government has made it equally clear that Ireland&rsquo;s overall economic interests lie firmly in a strong and well-functioning EU with continued membership of the Single Market and the Customs Union.  As an EU Member State, and in line with our EU rights and obligations, Ireland will be negotiating as part of the EU27 with the UK on the future EU-UK relationship, including with regard to trade and customs arrangements. </p><p>Ireland fully supports the phased approach that has been adopted by the EU, which foresees that discussions on the future EU-UK relationship will get underway as soon as sufficient progress has been made on the EU&rsquo;s key priorities under the withdrawal process &ndash; notably citizens&rsquo; rights, the UK&rsquo;s financial settlement and border issues, including in relation to Ireland. </p><p>My immediate focus &ndash; and that of my Government colleagues &ndash; will therefore be on working with our EU partners to ensure the negotiations continue in a positive and constructive manner with a view to ensuring that swift progress can be made on the withdrawal issues.  This will be vital in ensuring that the parallel discussions on the future EU-UK relationship, including in relation to trade, can begin as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In this context, we are of course also guided by the aspiration contained in Article 3 of the Constitution as amended by the people in 1998.</p>  <p>  The principle of consent and the possibility of change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland is a fundamental part of the Good Friday Agreement, endorsed by the people of this island North and South.  The trigger for a referendum in this jurisdiction is connected with the calling of a border poll, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, in Northern Ireland.  This occurs when the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland considers it likely that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland.  At present, the Government does not believe it likely that such a border poll in Northern Ireland in the near future would result in constitutional change.  In these circumstances such a poll might only increase uncertainty and division at an already difficult and sensitive time.</p>  <p>  In the absence of any prospect of a referendum in the near future, the Government has no immediate plans for a white paper on this issue.  My immediate priority is to secure the future of the devolved power-sharing institutions, which are at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement.  I am currently representing the Government at the ongoing talks process in Belfast to support the formation of an Executive and the implementation of commitments from previous agreements. </p>  <p>  In the event of a future referendum within the consent provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government would of course make all necessary preparations in accordance with the terms of the Constitution and the principles and procedures of the Agreement.  </p>  <p>  There are of course aspects of this constitutional issue which relate to my Department&rsquo;s ongoing work.  In the context of Brexit, the Government has made clear its determination to ensure respect for all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, including those relating to a possible change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, regardless of the UK&rsquo;s status within the EU.</p>  <p>  As a result of intensive political and diplomatic engagement by the Government, our EU partners are fully aware and supportive of the importance of respecting the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and protecting the gains of the peace process.  On 29 April, the European Council adopted Guidelines for the EU-UK negotiations which include a strong acknowledgment of the unique circumstances of the island of Ireland and explicitly recognize the importance of preserving the achievements, benefits and commitments of the Good Friday Agreement.  This is further strengthened by the statement agreed by the European Council on the same day, acknowledging that the Good Friday Agreement provides for an agreed mechanism whereby a united Ireland may be brought about and that, in accordance with international law, the entire territory of such a united Ireland would thus be part of the European Union.  </p></reply>

At the United Nations General Assembly Ireland consistently condemns all forms of persecution, intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief.  We also raise our concerns at the Universal Periodic Review, a unique peer mechanism of the Human Rights Council under which the human rights records of all UN Member States are reviewed.  At the most recent session, which took place in May this year, we raised the issue of the harassment, intimidation and persecution of religious and other minorities in Indonesia.</p><p>Last month, at the 35th session of the Human Rights Council, Ireland strongly condemned all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief, irrespective of where they occur or who the victims are.  We also expressed our deep concern at the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East region and Eritrea<b>.  </b>Ireland consistently supports the EU-led resolutions on freedom of religion or belief at the UN, most recently at the UN General Assembly in November 2016 and during the 34th  session of the Human Rights Council in March 2017.  The EU is a strong supporter of the mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, an independent expert appointed by the UN Human Rights Council. </p><p>During the Irish Presidency in 2013, Ireland played a key role in the development and adoption of the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief.  The Guidelines provide a framework for the promotion of freedom of religion or belief in the EU&rsquo;s external human rights policy and reaffirm the EU&rsquo;s determination to promote freedom of religion or belief as a right to be exercised by everyone everywhere.  </p><p>In 2015 Ireland pressed for the inclusion of a reference to the promotion of freedom of religion or belief in the EU Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy 2015-2019.  In May 2016, on the basis of a European Parliament resolution, the EU established the role of Special Envoy for the promotion of freedom of religion and belief outside the EU.  The mandate aims to address the growing restrictions on religious freedom internationally.  In May 2017, the Commission extended the mandate of the special envoy for an additional year. </p></reply>

EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Syria at their April Council meeting.  </p>  <p>  They adopted a new EU Strategy for Syria which sets out the EU&rsquo;s main lines of action in Syria including continued support for and direct assistance to the UN-brokered talks in Geneva, the next round of which is due to resume on 10 July.  This includes, in particular, an EU-led initiative, in coordination with the UN, to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground for the end-state in Syria and the conditions for the reconciliation and reconstruction process.  Named the EU Syria Peace Process Support Initiative, it aims to develop a concrete platform to support the peace process and ceasefire, strengthen the opposition parties and civil society, and support for the efforts of the UN Special Envoy for Syria to include civil society in his work through the Civil Society Support Room and the Women&rsquo;s Advisory Board.</p>  <p>  It also includes support for transitional justice initiatives to help ensure accountability for war crimes, human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law and restrictive measures against Syrian individuals and entities supporting the regime as long as the repression of civilians continues.  The sanctions currently in place include notably an oil embargo, restrictions on certain investments, a freeze of the assets of the Syrian central bank within the EU, export restrictions on equipment and technology that might be used for internal repression as well as on equipment and technology for monitoring or interception of internet or telephone communications.  In addition, over 200 persons and 70 entities are targeted by a travel ban and an asset freeze over the violent repression against the civilian population in Syria.  In March, the EU added four high-ranking Syrian military officials to the sanctions list for their role in the use of chemical weapons against civilians.  The EU keeps the sanctions regime under constant review and will expand and adjust it as appropriate.</p>  <p>  The EU and its Member States are also playing a leading role in the humanitarian response to the crisis.  More than &euro;9.4 billion has already been mobilised for humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance to support Syrians inside the country and in neighbouring countries, making the EU the largest single donor to the effort. At the Brussels conference in April 2017 which was co-hosted by the EU, a further &euro;3.7 billion for 2017 was pledged by the EU and its Member States, representing nearly 67% of the pledges. </p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the EU assistance to the UN-led peace talks in Geneva, the EU&rsquo;s focus on justice and accountability, and the EU sanctions regime.  We have also made a significant contribution to the humanitarian effort.  Since 2012, Ireland has contributed &euro;78.6 million to the humanitarian effort in response to the conflict in Syria.  This is Irish Aid&rsquo;s largest response to a single crisis in recent years.  At the Syria conference in Brussels in March, Ireland pledged to provide at least &euro;25 million in humanitarian assistance to the region during 2017.  &euro;11.1 million of this pledge has already been fulfilled so far this year.  Through our annual contributions to EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the Syria crisis, from which &euro;445 million was contributed in 2016.</p></reply>

The crisis in the Kasai regions has reached an exceptional level in security, humanitarian and human rights terms. In a recent statement, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned the appalling human rights abuses and called for an international investigation into the situation. </p>  <p>  Ireland expressed concern at the UN Human Rights Council in June about the Kasai regions, in particular in relation to reports of the recruitment of children by militias and excessive use of force by state services against civilians.  Ireland also co-sponsored a resolution calling on the High Commissioner to appoint a team of international experts to investigate alleged human rights violations, and violations of international humanitarian law.  We also remain concerned about ongoing violence and human rights violations in eastern DRC. </p>  <p>  In parallel, the political situation caused by the blockage in implementing the inclusive political agreement of 31 December 2016 is also cause for serious concern.  EU Foreign Ministers adopted Conclusions in March calling for the full implementation of the agreement as the only way to establish the necessary institutional legitimacy to manage the transition and facilitate credible and democratic elections. </p>  <p>  In May, the Foreign Affairs Council adopted restrictive measures against nine individuals who hold positions of responsibility in the State administration and in the DRC security forces.  They join the seven people on whom the EU imposed sanctions in December 2016 in response to the obstruction of the electoral process and related human rights violations. </p>  <p>  The mandate of the UN&rsquo;s Stabilisation Mission in DRC (MONUSCO) was renewed in March, with a specific focus on implementing the 31 December political agreement.  Four Irish Defence Forces personnel are currently serving with the Mission. </p>  <p>  Ireland has a clear focus on forgotten crises in our humanitarian response and has maintained consistent humanitarian support to the DRC.  In May, we provided an additional &euro;3 million to the UN-managed Humanitarian Fund for the country.  This 2017 allocation brings our total humanitarian assistance to DRC since 2012 to over &euro;32 million.</p></reply>

During their brief conversation the Taoiseach raised a number of issues including the situation of the up to 50,000 undocumented Irish in the US.  The Taoiseach looks forward to having an opportunity to discuss this, and other matters, with President Trump in more detail in due course. </p>  <p>  I am aware of the understandable concerns among members of the Irish community in the U.S., in light of recent developments under the new Administration.</p>  <p>  The Department has therefore funded the provision of factual legal advice, for information purposes, for undocumented Irish citizens in the U.S., which has been disseminated among Irish immigration centers in the United States and is available online.  In addition, in advance of the recent Global Irish Civic Forum in Dublin, Minister Joe McHugh hosted a discussion in Iveagh House, with relevant stakeholders, on the issue of our undocumented citizens in the US. </p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Washington DC is in close and ongoing contact with the U.S. authorities and has reported that, to date this year, the number of deportations of Irish citizens from the United State has not increased compared to recent years.  While this is reassuring, it does not assuage the concerns of our undocumented citizens caused by the recent measures taken by the US Administration and their reporting in the media.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, in May the Government announced an additional &euro; 50,000 funding from the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme budget for the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers, which provides advice and vital services to our citizens in the US. </p>  <p>  The issues of immigration reform and the welfare of undocumented Irish citizen in the US are a central element of the work of Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic representatives in the US.  Our Embassy in Washington DC and our six Consulates across the United States work with Irish immigration centers on a daily basis in providing support to Irish citizens. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy of the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to pursuing these matters on behalf of our citizens in the US. </p></reply>

Migration has featured on the agenda of almost every European Council in the same period, including the recent June European Council.</p><p>The EU has responded to the crisis by adopting a range of measures to deal with this mass movement of people.  These have included engaging with countries of origin and transit to address the root causes of migration including through the Migration Partnership Framework; agreeing a plan to relocate migrants from Italy and Greece across the Union; the launching of Operation Sophia to disrupt people smuggling in the Mediterranean; and substantial financial assistance to countries hosting large numbers of migrants.  EU Heads of State and Government concluded a landmark migration deal with Turkey in March 2016, which has resulted in a very substantial reduction in the number of migrants risking their lives at sea to enter the EU from Turkey.</p><p>In the past year or so the migration focus has shifted from Turkey to the so-called Central Mediterranean Route, with more than 70,000 migrants crossing from Libya to Italy so far this year.  In March 2017, EU leaders issued the Malta Declaration, which sets out the EU&rsquo;s commitment to assist Libya, with a strong focus on capacity building.  </p><p>The June European Council made clear that continuing migratory flows on the Central Mediterranean route leading to an ongoing loss of life remains an issue of urgent concern.  It agreed that the EU and its member states had to step up coordination and delivery on all the elements contained in the Malta Declaration, the Partnership Framework and the Joint Valletta Action Plan, underpinned by sufficient financial resources.  Training and equipping the Libyan Coast Guard is a key component of the EU approach and the Council agreed that it should be speeded up.  Cooperation with countries of origin and transit is to be reinforced in order to stem the migratory pressure on Libya&rsquo;s and other neighbouring countries' land borders.  The European Council underlined in this context the importance of supporting the G5 Sahel Joint force (recently established to address the threat of terrorism, as well as the serious challenges posed by transnational organized crime in the region and made up of Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger).  There, as elsewhere, the disruption of the business models of human smugglers and traffickers remains a key objective, including by better controlling the trade in equipment used by them.</p><p>At the international level, last September's UN Summit in New York on large movements of migrants and refugees marked an important step in the global response to the crisis.  The Summit resulted in the unanimous adoption of a Declaration<font color="#004080">,</font>which was brokered by Ireland, and which contains a commitment to reach agreement in 2018 on Global Compacts on both migration and refugees.  Work on both Compacts is already underway and a number of other processes are also feeding into this work, such as the Global Forum on Migration and Development which held its Summit meeting in Berlin just last week.</p><p>Of course, the ongoing work of specialised agencies with mandates relating to refugees and migrants, notably UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), as well as others, constitutes an essential element of the international response.</p></reply>

Since the outbreak of violence in South Sudan in 2013, the population of the country have suffered death and injury, the destruction of livelihoods and widespread human rights abuses, in particular serious gender based violence against women and children.  Ireland has repeatedly condemned the violence and continues to support the efforts of international and regional partners to find an inclusive political solution to the conflict.</p>  <p>  At the EU level, Ireland supported Council Conclusions adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council in December 2016 which called on all parties to end violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.  At the UN level, Ireland condemned the continuing violence at Human Rights Council in March 2017, and called for an immediate end to the conflict. </p>  <p>  We also continue to support the efforts of international and regional actors such as the Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD), the African Union, and the United Nations, including the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), to bring an immediate end to the conflict.  The recent IGAD Summit held on 12 June was a welcome engagement of regional neighbours in renewing efforts to seek peace in South Sudan.</p>  <p>  Ireland is providing substantial humanitarian assistance to the South Sudan crisis, for work in the country and to assist South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries.  Since 2012, we have provided some &euro;48 million for victims of the crisis.  To date in 2017, we have provided &euro;9.2 million to our UN and NGO partners working on the ground to address the humanitarian needs, and in particular to address issues relating to food insecurity.  We will continue to monitor this ongoing crisis closely and to provide additional life-saving humanitarian assistance to those most in need.</p></reply>

My Department works closely with the Department of the Taoiseach in regard to NSMC matters and the Taoiseach co-chairs the NSMC Plenary meetings with the Northern Ireland First Minister and deputy First Minister.</p>  <p>  However, in the absence of a Northern Ireland Executive and specifically a First and deputy First Minister the North South Ministerial Council cannot meet.</p>  <p>  As the formal means for bilateral discussions between the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, the NSMC has a crucial role to play in the Brexit discussions and the negotiations ahead.  The most recent NSMC Plenary meetings on 4 July 2016 in Dublin Castle and on 18 November 2016 in Armagh saw the Government and the Executive agree on a number of important common principles for dealing with Brexit on an all-island basis, scoping out the sectoral implications of Brexit for Ireland, North and South, and agreeing to work together to optimise North-South planning in the phases preceding and following Brexit.  It was agreed that this work would be taken forward through continuing bilateral discussions within the NSMC at sectoral level, as well as through a high-level working group comprising senior officials from the Government and from the Northern Ireland Executive Office.</p>  <p>  At the Plenary meeting of the NSMC on 18 November 2016 in Armagh the Council considered an update by a group of Senior Officials from relevant Departments, North and South, on the progress being made on implementing the commitments set out in Section E of the Fresh Start Agreement, to provide support and funding for North-South infrastructure projects.  The review is ongoing and a further report will be presented at a future Plenary meeting.  The Senior Officials have since met in February 2017 and again in early June to consider progress on all of the Section E commitments. </p>  <p>  The Council also received an update in relation to the North West Gateway Initiative.  Ministers welcomed the establishment by Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council of the North West Strategic Growth Partnership which will aim to work with central government North and South to ensure the North West region can reach its full potential.   </p>  <p>  The NSMC Plenary meeting was advised that Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council had finalised the necessary arrangements for oversight and delivery of the North West Strategic Growth Plan and the associated &euro;5m North West Development Fund which was established under the Fresh Start Agreement.  I am pleased that the Irish Government has played a leading role in this regard &ndash; contributing &euro;2.5 million to the Fund.  The Inaugural meeting of the North West Strategic Partnership was subsequently held on 7 December 2016 and attended by senior officials from Departments, North and South, and I welcome that the second meeting of the Partnership was held last week.  </p>  <p>  The Government remains engaged with the political parties in Northern Ireland.  I am hopeful that meetings of the North South Ministerial Council will soon recommence to enable further important engagement on progressing all-island cooperation in general and in particular addressing the challenges of Brexit.  </p></reply>

The Agreements, and the principles and values underpinning them, are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s approach to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.  I am currently representing the Government at the ongoing talks&rsquo; process in Belfast to support the formation of an Executive.  I believe that an agreement is within reach &ndash; an agreement that would allow a power-sharing Executive to be formed on a sustainable basis.  All parties are committed to the successful operation of all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and everyone agrees that devolution is the best way to deliver for all of the people of Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  In terms of outstanding commitments, respect for linguistic diversity and the Irish language are important elements of the Good Friday Agreement.  An Irish Language Act in Northern Ireland, to be enacted by the British Government, was provided for in the St Andrews Agreement in 2006.  While to date there had been no agreement within the Executive to take this, now devolved, matter forward it is one of the issues currently under discussion at the talks in Belfast.  In that context I have made clear the Government&rsquo;s continued and clear support for a statutory basis for the Irish Language in Northern Ireland, as envisaged under the St Andrews Agreement.</p>  <p>  As reflected in the Programme for Partnership Government, the Government remains supportive of and continues to advocate for the advancement of a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.  Indeed, the continued value of a Bill of Rights in the context of Brexit was one of the themes which emerged from the All Island Civic Dialogue sectoral on Human Rights under the Good Friday Agreement which took place in February.</p>  <p>  A North South Consultative Forum is a further important outstanding element envisaged under the Good Friday Agreement.  In 2008, the then Government sent proposals for such a Forum to the Northern Ireland Executive, but there has been no substantive response.  Between 2009 and 2011, three consultative conferences were hosted in Dublin to support the establishment of the Forum.  While the issue remains on the agenda of the North South Ministerial Council, the Northern Ireland Executive has not been able to give its assent to the establishment of the Forum.</p>  <p>  The Government views as a solemn responsibility our role and mandate as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.  We will spare no effort to fulfil our duty as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and this includes working to ensure the effective operation of its institutions and the implementation of outstanding commitments.  We will continue to work to this end with the British Government to support and facilitate the parties in their efforts to reach agreement in the current talks process in Belfast.</p></reply>

At Headquarters the key Divisions are the European Union Division and the Ireland, UK and Americas (IUKA) Division.  Both divisions are headed at Second Secretary General level and both have been assigned additional resources.  The European Union Division contains a dedicated team focused exclusively on the EU-UK negotiations, led by a senior officer at Counsellor level.  Within the IUKA Division, there is a Brexit-specific policy co-ordination function in place and there are teams focused on Northern Ireland and on wider British-Irish Relations; their duties include Brexit related issues.</p>  <p>  Many business units of the Department at its headquarters in Dublin are involved as part of the strategic response to the UK exit and staff numbers have been augmented, for example in the Legal Division, the Trade Division and the Policy Planning Unit.  Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representation to the European Union in Brussels will also play a key role.  Resources for the Permanent Representation have therefore been reinforced along with increased resources for our Embassies in Berlin, Paris and London.</p>  <p>  It is clear that these exit negotiations will be complex and intensive.  To support the negotiation process, my Department received an additional &euro;3.2 million as part of the 2017 allocation.  This facilitated the transfer back to my Department from the Department of the Taoiseach of 14 staff to a new, enlarged European Union Division.  </p>  <p>  The Department has also allocated an additional budget of &euro;2 million.  This budget will be used to increase the number of staff assigned to the management and support of the negotiations and to increase the level of support provided to our colleagues across all Government Departments and agencies. </p>  <p>  The measures my Department put in place to manage the initial phase of our response to the UK decision to leave the EU remain under review.  The Department may require additional staff resources if it is deemed necessary to further augment our level of support across Government and across our network.</p></reply>

For some years Hamas has charged customers in Gaza for electricity supplied from Israel, but refused to pass these revenues to the Palestinian Authority, which pays Israel to supply the electricity.  No government can be expected to tolerate this situation indefinitely.</p>  <p>  The Palestinian Authority has decided to reduce the amount of electricity it pays Israel to supply to Gaza, and the reduction of supply by Israel to Gaza, which commenced on 19 June, is a consequence of that.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the basis for the problem, the humanitarian consequences for Gaza are potentially very severe.  The consequences not just for household supply, but for pumping of water and sewage, and supplies to hospitals, schools and other utilities, are obvious.  Mains electricity supply was already averaging only four hours per day following the shutdown in April of the only power plant in Gaza due to a dispute between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas over fuel supplies. </p>  <p>  Some additional power is being provided to key facilities by generators, but these are not designed to run full time and fuel is in any case short.  In recent days however, it is reported that the power plant in Gaza has been able to resume operations with fuel supplied by Egypt, thus allowing for an increase in supply to users.  It is not clear at this time how sustainable this arrangement is likely to be.</p>  <p>  I repeat the call of my predecessor for all sides who have a part in this issue &ndash; the Palestinian Authority, Hamas and Israel &ndash; to act promptly and realistically to resolve this dispute, in the interests of the people of Gaza.  Ultimately, full responsibility for electricity supply and billing in Gaza should be in the hands of the Palestinian Authority.</p>  <p>  I hope to visit the region later this month for initial meetings with local leaders.  While my primary focus on that occasion will be on the need to revitalise the overall peace process, I would expect also to be raising the problems of Gaza, both this particular issue of power supply, and the wider ongoing problems caused by the excessive Israeli restrictions on the territory.</p></reply>

Such applications are usually granted, where the Court so decides, on the date the application is made to the Court.  Therefore, there are no delays in dealing with these applications.</p><p>The Courts Service has also informed me that delays in the hearing of cases can occur for a number of reasons, many of which are outside the control of the Courts and the Courts Service, for example, the unavailability of a witness or vital evidence, delays in the furnishing of reports or because the parties and/or legal practitioners are not ready to proceed on allocated dates.  This gives rise to adjournments which can have a major impact on the time taken to complete the hearing of a case and on the number of cases which can be disposed of in a court sitting.  </p><p>In 2015 the Government introduced a range of new legislation in the family law area.  These developments required the Courts Service to provide additional courts facilities, particularly in Dublin, for the hearing of family law and child care applications.  In 2016 the Courts Service, following consultation with the President of the District Court, reconstituted the way District Court work was arranged to facilitate the provision of additional courtrooms for the transaction of family law business.  Overall the number of courtrooms dedicated to District Court family law in Dublin has increased from 5 to 7 since October 2016.  As a result waiting times in Dublin District Court family law have improved to the extent that hearings are now available within 5 weeks for private family law proceedings.  </p><p>The Courts Service has advised that the waiting times for family law in the District Court are collated on a Court office basis rather than on an individual court basis and that the current waiting times are as follows:</p><p><b><i>District Court Family Law - Waiting Times in weeks - June 2017</i></b><table><tr><th><div>-</div></th><th><div>Family Law  </div></th><th><div>Family Law  </div></th></tr><tr><td><div>Office</div></td><td><div>Domestic Violence Applications (1)</div></td><td><div>Maintenance/ Guardianship Applications (2)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Athlone</div></td><td><div>Next sitting </div></td><td><div>Next sitting</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Ballina</div></td><td><div>Next sitting </div></td><td><div>Next sitting </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Bray</div></td><td><div>1-3</div></td><td><div>3-6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Carlow</div></td><td><div>12</div></td><td><div>12</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Carrick on Shannon</div></td><td><div>Next sitting</div></td><td><div>Next sitting </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Castlebar</div></td><td><div>Next sitting</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Cavan</div></td><td><div>Next sitting </div></td><td><div>10-12 </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Clonakilty</div></td><td><div>2-4</div></td><td><div>2-4</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Clonmel</div></td><td><div>2-5 </div></td><td><div>4-12</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Cork</div></td><td><div>12</div></td><td><div>12</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Donegal</div></td><td><div>Next sitting </div></td><td><div>Next sitting </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Dublin</div></td><td><div>5 </div></td><td><div>5 </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Dundalk</div></td><td><div>Next sitting</div></td><td><div>3-4</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Ennis</div></td><td><div>Next sitting </div></td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Galway</div></td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>4-8</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Kilkenny</div></td><td><div>2-4 </div></td><td><div>4-8</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Letterkenny</div></td><td><div>Next sitting </div></td><td><div>13</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Limerick</div></td><td><div>9 </div></td><td><div>10</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Longford</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Loughrea</div></td><td><div>Next sitting </div></td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Mallow</div></td><td><div>Next sitting </div></td><td><div>Next sitting </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Monaghan</div></td><td><div>Next sitting </div></td><td><div>Next sitting </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Mullingar</div></td><td><div>Next sitting </div></td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Naas</div></td><td><div>2-4</div></td><td><div>12-14 </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Nenagh</div></td><td><div>2-4</div></td><td><div>11</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Portlaoise</div></td><td><div>Next sitting</div></td><td><div>8-10 </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Roscommon</div></td><td><div>Next sitting </div></td><td><div>Next sitting </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Sligo</div></td><td><div>Next sitting</div></td><td><div>Next sitting </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Tralee</div></td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Trim</div></td><td><div>6-9 </div></td><td><div>6-9 </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Tullamore</div></td><td><div>Next sitting </div></td><td><div>12 </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Waterford</div></td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>12</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Wexford</div></td><td><div>Next sitting </div></td><td><div>6-8</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Youghal</div></td><td><div>Next sitting </div></td><td><div>Next sitting </div></td></tr></table><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>(1) Time in weeks from receipt of application to listing for hearing in domestic violence matters</p><p>(2) Time in weeks from receipt of application to listing for hearing for other family law applications. </p></reply>

That review was undertaken with the objective of identifying opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation.  I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the closures have allowed front line Garda to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to targeted police operations. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  A cornerstone of this commitment is the Government plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  Revisiting the decisions made to close Garda stations is also part of that commitment. </p>  <p>  In this context, the Government on 24 June 2016 authorised the then Minister to request the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions, to identify 6 stations for reopening on a pilot basis to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order. </p>  <p>  On 13 June 2017, the Government considered the second interim report of the Garda Commissioner in relation to the exercise.  The Commissioner has indicated that, amongst other things, she is likely, subject to further analysis, to recommend the reopening of Leighlinbridge station in her final report. </p>  <p>  Following any decision to reopen the former station, the Garda authorities will work closely with the Office of Public Works in relation to any necessary preparatory works required to progress the reopening.</p></reply>

In determining whether to make a deportation order, in addition to the factors set out in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999, I must also consider all relevant constitutional and international human rights arising, including those enshrined in the Refugee Convention, the UN Convention Against Torture and the European Charter of Human Rights.  The question of not returning a person to a place where certain fundamental rights would be breached (or non refoulement as it is commonly referred to) is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order.  This involves consideration of whether returning the person would result in the life or freedom of that person being threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, or whether the person would be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. </p>  <p>  The process leading to deportation is extensive with many avenues of appeal, including judicial review in the High Court, open to persons subject to deportation orders.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This plan is progressing well.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.  </p><p>The strength of the Garda Reserve on 30 April 2016 and 31 May 2017 (the latest date for which figures are readily available) was 883 and 638 respectively.</p><p>It is regrettable that there has been a substantial reduction in the strength of the Reserve in recent years from a peak of 1,164 in 2013.  The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways - firstly some 200 serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointment Service have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last three years.  With the plan to reach 15,000 Garda members well on track it was possible for the Commissioner and the Public Appointments Service to undertake a new recruitment campaign for Garda Reserves.

For operational and capacity reasons, each person committed to prison for non-payment of fines is considered for temporary release (TR) in line with the Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended.  Factors considered in relation to this TR include the nature of the crime giving rise to the committal, the person&rsquo;s criminal history (if any) and the accommodation capacity of individual prisons on the day. </p>  <p>  For approximately 30 years prior to its cessation in 2010, it was a practice that persons committed to prison for non-payment of a fine could be released early upon payment of a portion of that fine.  Broadly speaking, the matter of who was recommended to the Minister for temporary release in these circumstances was subject to the discretion of the Governor concerned and on the particular circumstances of the case.  There was no standard approach to the operation of the system. The legislative basis relied upon for this was the Criminal Justice Act 1951, which allowed the Minister to mitigate punitive elements of a sentence handed down by the Courts.  In 2010, the Irish Prison Service ended the practice of the granting of TR based on the payment or part payment of a fine imposed by the Courts based solely on the individual discretion of the prison Governor concerned. </p>  <p>  Since 2010, persons sentenced to prison for non-payment of fines have had a number of options open to them, viz: (i) pay the fine in full; (ii) serve the sentence in full; (iii) be granted release only when the fine has been paid in full, through a combination of part payment of the fine and serving of the sentence imposed or (iv) be granted TR for operational reasons as outlined earlier - for example accomodation capacity in the prison.  </p>  <p>  In relation to option (iii), the IPS has standardised the system whereby a prisoner can be released early through a combination of part serving of the sentence and payment of a portion of the fine.  The system is now estate-wide, automated and based on a standardised sliding scale.  For example, setting aside the issue of remission, in circumstances where two days into a four-day sentence a prisoner seeks to pay a fine, he will be advised that as 50% of the sentence has been served, only 50% of the fine remains to be paid.  The 'sliding scale' methodology used to determine how much of a fine can be considered 'paid' when a portion of the sentence has been served operates uniformly throughout the entire prison system and dispenses with the element of individual governor discretion practised prior to 2010.  All monies collected as a result of fines paid by prisoners is lodged into an Imprest Account, is properly accounted for and then transferred to the Courts Service.  In 2016 the amount involved was &euro;29,864.72. </p>  <p>  Needless to say. the extent of the original fine imposed is entirely a matter for the Courts and cannot be altered by the IPS.  The IPS informs me that it is not aware that any prisoner or ex-prisoner is seeking a refund on the basis that the amount they paid on the sliding scale system explained above exceeded the fine determined by a Court.  The issue of refunds therefore does not arise. </p>  <p>  The IPS advise that, regardless of the fact that no-one has sought a refund, it has no information itself that any prisoner was overcharged on the system described above.  This could only be definitively established if the individual file of every prisoner ever committed to prison on a fine was manually checked to establish the amount of the fine imposed, the portion paid and the length of sentence served, in order to check whether any calculation error had ever occurred.  For obvious reasons, this is impractical. </p>  <p>  Due to the large volume of fines cases committed to prison on a yearly basis, any audit of the system would be a significant undertaking.  With the lack of any specific evidence that persons were overcharged, I do not believe that an independent audit of the system is justified at this time. </p>  <p>  Finally, I should mention that since the commencement of the Fines (Payment and Recovery) 2014 Act on 11 January 2016, where fines remain unpaid by the due date, the fined persons must be notified to return to court to enable the Judge to impose whatever sanction the court considers appropriate in default of payment.  The options available to the Judge are as follows: attachment of earnings; recovery order; community service; or, if none of these options are appropriate, imprisonment.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.  In addition, as you will appreciate, in order to deliver an effective policing service, it is essential that Garda management have the flexibility to deploy Garda resources to meet operational policing needs and address critical issues as they arise.  For this reason, the number of Garda available in any one Garda Station on a particular day is subject to the operational requirements of the overall Division. </p>  <p>  The Edgeworthstown Garda Station forms part of the Granard District and Roscommon/Longford Division.  I have been informed that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Division on the 31 May 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 303, of which 47 members were assigned to Granard District and 11 to Edgeworthstown Station.  There are also 9 Garda Reserves and 28 Civilians attached to the Roscommon/Longford Division. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that almost 1,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 5 of whom were assigned to the Roscommon/Longford Division.  I am also informed that another 200 trainee Garda will attest this Thursday 6 July and that a further four hundred are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across the organisation, including the Roscommon/Longford Division. </p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.

This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p><p>For the Deputy's information, I have set out in tabular form the strength of the Meath Division by station in December 2016 and as of 31 May 2017, the latest date for which figures are currently available from the Commissioner. <table><tr><th>Meath Division Strength 2016 -31 May  2017</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>DISTRICT</td><td>STATION</td><td><div>2016</div></td><td><div>2017</div></td></tr><tr><td>ASHBOURNE</td><td>ASHBOURNE</td><td><div>47</div></td><td><div>46</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DULEEK</td><td><div>5</div></td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DUNBOYNE</td><td><div>17</div></td><td><div>16</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DUNSHAUGHLIN</td><td><div>17</div></td><td><div>23</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>LAYTOWN</td><td><div>20</div></td><td><div>21</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL:</td><td><div>106</div></td><td><div>111</div></td></tr><tr><td>KELLS</td><td>BAILE &Aacute;THA BU&Iacute;</td><td><div>5</div></td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KELLS</td><td><div>36</div></td><td><div>33</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>OLDCASTLE</td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL:</td><td><div>44</div></td><td><div>41</div></td></tr><tr><td>NAVAN</td><td>NAVAN</td><td><div>86</div></td><td><div>90</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NOBBER</td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SLANE</td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL:</td><td><div>93</div></td><td><div>97</div></td></tr><tr><td>TRIM</td><td>BALLIVOR</td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ENFIELD</td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>LONGWOOD</td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SUMMERHILL</td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TRIM</td><td><div>34</div></td><td><div>36</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL:</td><td><div>43</div></td><td><div>45</div></td></tr><tr><td>MEATH TOTAL:</td><td>16 STATIONS</td><td><div>286</div></td><td><div>294</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Instead the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) liaises with local authorities and the Irish Red Cross, which organisations identify appropriate dwellings for those in the resettlement and relocated cohorts.</p>  <p>  In relation to the 399 persons who arrived in Ireland of their own accord and claimed asylum here, who have been granted leave to remain and who continue to reside in State provided accommodation, there is no dedicated place finder service but a number of measures have been put in place to have the same intention and result.</p>  <p>  Following on from the McMahon report, the Department of Justice and Equality developed a guide to independent living for persons with status to provide practical assistance for them.  The guide is available in all centres and on the RIA website (www.ria.gov.ie) in a number of different languages.  This was published in parallel with information sessions coordinated by the Citizens Information Bureau in accommodation centres which gave an opportunity for such persons to seek assistance and clarification on the services provided.  The Reception &amp;amp; Integration Agency (RIA), its centre managers, the Community Welfare Service (by way of provision of Rent Allowance), Citizens Information and those City and County Councils operating the Housing Assistance Payments link with such persons in accessing the appropriate supports and services, including in respect of sourcing and securing private accommodation.</p>  <p>  Following a call for proposals under the Asylum Migration and Integration Fund, a number of charities and NGOs have been successful in applying for funding for projects with the specific aim of providing assistance to those transiting from state provided accommodation to permanent homes in the community.  I am confident that it will prove of great assistance and benefit to all concerned.</p>  <p>  Once some form of status is granted, residents cease to be ordinarily entitled to the accommodation supports provided through RIA.  Notwithstanding this fact, we have always continued to provide such persons with continued accommodation until they secure their own private accommodation.  We are particularly mindful of the reality of the housing situation in the State and the pressures on the Community Welfare Service in respect of Rent Supplement or the City and County Councils in respect of Housing Assistance Payments and Housing Lists.  That said, the provision of housing for persons coming out of the protection process has been incorporated in the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  </p></reply>

I am informed that the Garda Cyber Crime Bureau (GCCB) was established on 1  September 2016 under the direction of the Detective Chief Superintendent, Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and Assistant Commissioner, Special Crime Operations.  The GCCB is headed up by a Detective Superintendent who was appointed in August 2016.  The GCCB has responsibility for the forensic examination of all seized computer media, international liaison with regard to cyber matters and the investigation of cyber crime matters including banking and financial crimes, and child pornography and exploitation.  The allocation of further resources to the GCCB including Garda members, specialist professional staff and support staff, is in train to support the further development of the GCCB. </p>  <p>  In addition, I am informed that the roll-out continues on a phased basis of regional triage units, which have been established in two regions to date - the Southern and South-Eastern Regions.  The triage model provides a tiered response and capability for computer forensic services on a regional basis, utilising locally-based and trained first-responders and cyber triage specialists.  The triage model also reduces demands on the GCCB, while remaining under the supervision of the Detective Superintendent of the Bureau.  The triage units currently in place are subject of review to inform and establish best practices and processes for the establishment of further such units in other regions. </p></reply>

These combine annual reporting obligations with the undertaking of a more comprehensive review of this area that will be open to all stake-holders including, on the delivery side, universities and other third-level providers of legal professional education.</p>  <p>  The relevant provisions of section 13(2) of the 2015 Act, as commenced under S.I. No. 383 of 2016, provide that the Legal Services Regulatory Authority may, and where required by the Act, shall, keep under review and make recommendations to the Minister for Justice and Equality in respect of the admission requirements of the legal professions, that is to say both barristers and solicitors, under their respective bodies and the availability and quality of such education and training.  This will also take into account the curriculum arrangements for the provision of clinical legal education and the teaching of legal ethics, negotiation skills, alternative dispute resolution and advocacy and the methods by which, and the persons by whom, such education and training is provided.  It will also review the policies of the Law Society in relation to the admission of persons as solicitors in the State and those of the Bar Council and the Honorable Society of the King's Inns in relation to persons entitled to practice as barristers.</p>  <p>  Under section 33 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, when commenced, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority will also report, within four months of the end of each financial year, on admissions to the legal professions.  This report shall specify the number of persons admitted to each of the legal professions during the given year.  It will also contain an assessment as to whether or not, having regard for the demand for the services of practising solicitors and barristers and the need to ensure an adequate standard of education and training for persons admitted to practice, the number of persons so admitted in that year is consistent with the public interest in ensuring the availability of such services at a reasonable cost.  A copy of this report will be laid, by the Minister, before each House of the Oireachtas and will be published and sent by the Regulatory Authority to each of the legal professional bodies concerned.</p>  <p>  In addition to this annual reporting cycle, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority has been given the specific task of preparing, with the support of a public consultation process, a comprehensive report in relation to the education and training (including on-going training) arrangements in the State for legal practitioners, including the manner in which such education and training is provided.  This report is to be provided to the Minister within two years of the Authority's establishment day, 1 October 2016.  Under the detailed parameters set out in section 34 of the 2015 Act as commenced under S.I. No. 383 of 2016, it will contain " a review of the existing arrangements relating to the education and training of legal practitioners" and make such recommendations as considered appropriate in relation to the arrangements that, in the opinion of the Authority, should be in place for the provision of such education and training.  This is also to include "the accreditation of bodies to provide such education and training and the reforms or amendments, whether administrative or legislative, that are required to facilitate those arrangements". </p>  <p>  In addition, Section 34 (3) (c) of the 2015 Act lays out the specific areas of recommendation that are to be dealt with under this review process.  These are to include, among other matters, the appropriate standards of education and training for legal professional qualifications; arrangements necessary to monitor those standards; the scope and content of the curriculum for the courses concerned; standards required for the award of legal professional qualifications, and, arrangements that would facilitate the minimisation of duplication and consequent expense incurred in the taking of overlapping examinations in legal subjects.</p></reply>

I am advised that this postponement arose because the ongoing Garda review is not yet complete and, therefore, it was not possible to conduct the normal CSO data verification process in advance of the publication of new crime statistics. </p>  <p>  I note that these issues are under close scrutiny by the Policing Authority, and that the Garda authorities have undertaken to provide further information to the Authority, as well as the CSO.  I also expect to receive further updates from the Garda authorities as this work is progressed.  Given the Policing Authority&rsquo;s important oversight role, which this Government established, I am sure the Deputy will agree that it is entirely appropriate that this matter is the subject of careful examination and inquiry by the Authority.</p>  <p>  We must bear in mind that issues with the consistent recording of crime data are not unique to this jurisdiction, and I am assured that there is continuing close engagement by the CSO with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to this matter and to support the ongoing improvements to our official crime statistics generally.  The CSO has already carried out two detailed reviews of crime data quality, in 2015 and 2016, and I understand that further general reviews of crime data quality are planned.  The CSO&rsquo;s work provides an important measure of re-assurance to support ongoing work to enhance the quality of the official crime statistics.</p>  <p>  As previously outlined to the Deputy, the CSO also chaired an Expert Group on Crime Statistics which has considered a number of the Garda Inspectorate&rsquo;s recommendations on crime statistics, including in relation to the crime counting rules.  I am advised that the Expert Group has prepared a report, and I expect this will be published in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

This represents an increase of 4.6% when compared to the final net outturn figure of &euro;1.440 billion for 2016.  This increase is mainly due to an additional provision in the Garda Pay Subhead to address the Garda Pay Deal under the Lansdowne Road Agreement as well as the recruitment of 800 new Garda&iacute;, some 500 new civilian staff and some 300 Reserve members in 2017.</p>  <p>  I would refer the Deputy to the post-reply correspondence in respect of Parliamentary Questions No. 858, 862 and 866 of 3 July 2017, wherein I indicated that the full first year payroll cost of recruiting 800 new Garda&iacute;, 500 new civilian staff and 300 Reserve is estimated at &euro;14,863,029, &euro;21,500,000 and &euro;690,000 respectively. </p>  <p>  The high proportion of resources allocated to the Garda Vote underlines this Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  Key to achieving this goal is the Government&rsquo;s decision to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p></reply>

As part of this greater co-operation, the matter of alignment of those States whose citizens are visa required is also being kept under review.  The greater the extent of alignment between the two jurisdictions, the greater the opportunity to increase the numbers of tourism and business visits to the CTA.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-04a.756.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017070400071#WRN02900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 300 to 303, inclusive, together.</p><p>The Commissioner of Valuation has responsibility under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 to maintain a valuation list for each Local Authority, of all commercial properties in that Local Authority area, which is used to calculate the rates due from individual ratepayers.  The Commissioner is independent in the performance of his functions and the statute does not accord me, as Minister for Justice and Equality, any role in this regard.  Revaluation is a process where all rateable properties in a Local Authority area are valued periodically by reference to a single valuation date.  Following the first revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area are then carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation (Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001). </p><p>The revaluation provisions in the Valuation Acts 2001 - 2015 provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as changes in the business environment or infrastructural changes in the vicinity of a property.  The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, the immediate objective of which is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 150 years is conducted across the country, as soon as possible, and on a phased basis.  Revaluation is an important instrument in redressing historical anomalies in relation to commercial rates.  The general outcome of revaluations finalised to date by the Valuation Office has been that about 60% of ratepayers have had their liability for rates reduced<i></i>following a revaluation and about 40% had an increase, a pattern which is most welcome and is expected to be replicated elsewhere as the programme advances. </p><p>The national revaluation programme currently underway is the first general revaluation of all commercial property in the State since the middle of the 19th century, involving the valuation of some 150,000 commercial rateable properties.  Completing the first revaluation and getting properties in every local authority area onto the 5-10 year cycle of revaluations provided for in the legislation represents a sea-change for the rateable valuation system.  All rateable properties in the Dublin, Waterford and Limerick local authority areas are now re-valued.  In addition, 13 public utilities representing some of the largest ratepayers in the State have been revalued on a global basis.  This represents approximately 57% of the national rateable valuation base in monetary value terms or 33% in numerical terms.  Significant progress is being made and the programme has established a momentum which is now being built upon as the current phase of work known as &ldquo;REVAL 2017&rdquo; is nearing a conclusion and which covers the following nine counties - Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon, Westmeath, Kildare, Offaly, Sligo, Carlow and Kilkenny.  A second revaluation of the commercial properties in the South Dublin county council area is also underway.  </p><p>The Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 which came into effect on 8 June 2015 has as its primary purpose, the acceleration of the national revaluation programme and it contains a number of measures in this regard.  The Act provided for the Commissioner to conduct a revaluation with the assistance of the occupiers of property using elements of self-assessment.  This provision &ndash; known as &ldquo;Occupier Assisted Valuation&rdquo; - is one of the express provisions intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme.  I understand that the Commissioner intends running a pilot project involving the revaluation of the approximately 2,280 commercial properties in County Laois rating authority area using &rdquo;Occupier Assisted Valuation&rdquo;.  The Valuation Office has conducted the necessary statutory consultations with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and with Laois County Council and is now embarking on development of appropriate technical and statutory systems of valuation to underpin the pilot project and allow for its initiation later this year.  Draft regulations are currently under preparation which when finalised will give effect to these new procedures set out in the 2015 Act. </p><p>The Occupier Assisted participative approach also involves the development and implementation of extensive information and communications technology facilities.  The provision of a wide range of on-line supports will be essential to the success of the pilot project, including use of video and audio technology to assist ratepayers in carrying out their elements of the process.  There will be extensive engagement with the ratepayers through an information campaign which will be undertaken to ensure maximum participation during the pilot.  Accordingly, at this stage the Commissioner cannot be precise about the date on which he will sign the statutory Valuation Order to formally commence the revaluation in County Laois.  However, I am informed that he expects to do so later this year.  Following the signing of the order, the Valuation Office intends to undertake a publicity and information campaign during which each individual ratepayer will be written to informing them of the commencement of the project and requesting information in relation to their property.  There will also be a programme of engagement with the various trade bodies and representative associations with the purpose of keeping them abreast of developments.  Regarding the allocated budget for the County Laois pilot, the costs for development work on information and communication technology and on-line supports and ancillary work are estimated to be in the region of &euro;60,000.</p><p>Similarly, the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 included an amendment which enables the Valuation Office to enter into contractual arrangements with external parties to outsource work in order to augment the in-house capacity of the Office.  This is another of the provisions intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme.  During the early months of 2016, the Office conducted an extensive procurement exercise, conducted in accordance with EU Public Procurement requirements, which resulted in an award of contract to CBRE, <font color="#2F2F2F">Connaught House, Burlington Road, Dublin 4</font>to carry out the revaluation of the Carlow County Council and Kilkenny County Council rating authority areas on its behalf.  This contractual work is still underway in these two counties and the new valuations will be published in September 2018. It is anticipated that appeals from these valuations will continue into 2018.  The total value of the contract awarded for this pilot project, as advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union is &euro;1.945 Million (excl. VAT). </p><p>Regarding plans to evaluate the performance of the revaluation pilots conducted by the external partner in Carlow/Kilkenny and by the occupier assisted valuation method in Laois, the position is that because of the independence of the Commissioner under the valuation legislation, I, as Minister, have no direct role in reviewing the work done as part of the revaluation programme, whether by direct assessment, external partners or by using the occupier-assisted method of valuation. I am informed by the Commissioner that such performance evaluations are undertaken as a matter of course following the completion of a revaluation project and evaluations of this nature will be conducted by the Commissioner and his senior officers following the conclusion of the pilots in Laois and in Carlow/Kilkenny.  It is intended that a review of the Carlow-Kilkenny pilot project will be conducted during the first quarter of 2018, in accordance with the Valuation Office&rsquo;s published Strategic Plan.  The timeframe for an evaluation of the County Laois pilot has not been determined as the project is currently at the advanced planning stage with the substantive work due to commence later this year following the signing of the valuation order which will signal the formal commencement of the project.  I have been informed that there are no plans at present to extend the pilot projects to other revaluations, pending the reviews outlined above.</p><p>Following the conclusion of the current phase of revaluation programme, i.e. REVAL 2017, attention will turn to the next two phases of the programme. I understand that the Commissioner intends to include seven rating authority areas in the next phase &ndash; known as REVAL 2019 - which will formally commence later in 2017 and will culminate in 2019 with the publication of a new valuation list for these areas.  The next and final phase of the programme - REVAL 2021 - will include 8 rating authority areas and will conclude in 2021 with the publication of new valuation lists for these areas.  The local authorities to undergo revaluation in each of these two phases are indicated in the following table:<table><tr><th><div>REVAL 2019<br /><br />Rating Authority</div></th><th><div>REVAL 2021<br /><br />Rating Authority</div></th></tr><tr><td>Cavan County<br /><br />Louth County<br /><br />Meath County<br /><br />Monaghan County<br /><br />Tipperary County<br /><br />Wexford County<br /><br />Wicklow County</td><td>Cork City<br /><br />Cork County<br /><br />Clare County<br /><br />Donegal County<br /><br />Galway City<br /><br />Galway County<br /><br />Kerry County<br /><br />Mayo County</td></tr></table></p><p>Subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area following the first revaluation are carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation (Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001).  The position in relation to second revaluations is contained in the following table.<table><tr><th>Local Authorities to undergo a 2nd revaluation in the period 2018 to 2021</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Rating Authority</td><td>1st Revaluation <br /><br />Completion Date</td><td>2nd Revaluation <br /><br />Completion Date</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council</td><td>31 December 2009</td><td>31 December 2019</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire- Rathdown </td><td>31 December 2010</td><td>31 December 2020</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Between 2001 and 2012, 63 Golden Eagles were released in Glenveagh National Park, Donegal.</p>  <p>  Between 2007 and 2011, a total of 100 White-tailed Eagle were released in Killarney National Park, Kerry and during the same period 160 young Red Kites were released near Avoca, Wicklow and two locations in north Co. Dublin.  At present, there are 5 territorial pairs of golden eagles, 85 territorial pairs of Red Kites and 10 territorial pairs of White-tailed Eagles being monitored.</p>  <p>  The Golden Eagles are the most difficult species to re-introduce, and fledged 12 wild bred chicks between 2007 and 2016; the red kites have fledged 192 chicks since 2010; and the white tailed eagles have fledged 14 chicks in the wild since 2013.  It is hoped that chicks of each species currently being monitored will fledge successfully this year.  Poisoning has hampered the success of the eagle projects and continues to be a threat.</p>  <p>  The geographical distribution of the reintroduced birds differs for the three species involved.  Golden Eagles have only been recorded as breeding in County Donegal though, in 2016, there has been some nesting activity recorded in Northern Ireland.  Individuals have been recorded as far afield as Co. Kerry and Scotland.  White-tailed Eagles have bred in County Kerry, where they were first reintroduced, and also in counties Clare, Cork and Galway.  A young territorial pair of White-tailed Eagles has also been recorded this year in County Longford.  The Red Kites have bred mostly in Wicklow, but also in counties Dublin, Meath and Wexford.  There are now territorial eagles in each of the four provinces and the red kite has established a strong presence along several areas on the eastern seaboard.</p>  <p>  Clare County Council reported that, in 2015, over 10,000 visitors came to view the pair of nesting white-tailed eagles in east Clare bringing important tourism revenue to the area.  The eagles have been of great interest to visitors coming to Glenveagh and Killarney National Parks.  This highlights that not only is there an intrinsic value in restoring, preserving and protecting our native species but that there exists a valuable opportunity for local businesses to benefit from biodiversity projects.</p>  <p>  My Department is compiling figures on the funds provided to the Golden Eagle Trust and will send them to the Deputy in accordance with the timelines set out in Standing Orders.</p></reply>

The purpose of this initiative was that no patient would be waiting more than 12 months for an endoscopy procedure by the end of December 2016.  The NTPF has advised that approximately &euro;1.7m was spent on procedures in 2016 and a further &euro;185,852 in 2017 so far.</p>  <p>  The NTPF Endoscopy Initiative for 2016 resulted in only 11 patients waiting for an endoscopy procedure for over 12 months at the end of the December, from 5,701 in June.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The legislation underpinning the Nursing Homes Support Scheme requires each private nursing home to negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme.  The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function, and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis.  The NTPF may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and the State.  In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:</p>  <p>  -  Costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money;</p>  <p>  -  Price(s) previously charged;</p>  <p>  -  Local market price; and</p>  <p>  -  Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015. A number of issues have been identified for more detailed consideration, including a review of pricing mechanisms by the NTPF, with a view to:</p>  <p>  -  Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p>  <p>  -  Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p>  <p>  -  Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p>  <p>  A Steering Committee has been established to oversee the review of the pricing system for private long-term residential care facilities.  This Steering Committee is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the NTPF, and work in this area is ongoing and well advanced.  This pricing review is a significant element of the overall Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, and as such it is important that sufficient time is given to the review to ensure that all relevant aspects of the current pricing mechanism can be considered and examined fully.</p></reply>

Budget 2017 made allowance for an additional &euro;35 million for services to be initiated in 2017.  Key priorities to be addressed in the HSE's 2017 Service Plan include youth mental health, further improvement to child &amp;amp; adolescent (CAMHS) and adult services, older people's services and further enhanced out-of-hours response for those in need of urgent services.  Recognising the time lag in new staff taking up posts and the completion of preparations for the introduction of these services, it is estimated that the revenue spend in 2017 associated with this increased allocation will be some &euro;15 million.  There will also be a further additional spend of &euro;9.5 million in mental health associated with increased pay rates, bringing the total budget to over &euro;850 million.</p>  <p>  The Mental Health Budgets for 2015 and 2016 were &euro;791.8 million and &euro;826.6 million respectively.

Consequently, BCG vaccination clinics in HSE Clinics and Maternity hospitals have been postponed.</p>  <p>  There is only one licensed supplier of BCG vaccine to Ireland.  The manufacturer has had difficulties in the production of the BCG vaccine.  Since this problem became apparent, the HSE National Immunisation Office has been in regular contact with the manufacturer to ascertain when the vaccine might be available.  The HSE also asked the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), which licenses and regulates all human medicines in Ireland, to source an alternate supplier of the BCG vaccine.  Efforts have been made to find a company who can provide the vaccine for use in Ireland which satisfies all the HPRA requirements on safety and efficacy but no suitable alternative BCG product has been found.  </p>  <p>  The supplier has indicated that supplies of the vaccine are not expected to be delivered into Ireland until early 2018.  When there is confirmation of the date of new supply, the HSE will be guided by the recommendations of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee on its administration.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-04a.943.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017070400074#WRQ03100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 366 and 434 to 436, inclusive, together.</p><p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has statutory responsibility for decisions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  The 2013 Act specifies the criteria to be applied in the making of decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. </p><p>Part 4 of the 2013 Act provides, inter alia, for the establishment and maintenance of a &quot;Reimbursement List&quot; for the purposes of section 59 of the Health Act 1970. </p><p>Section 18 of the 2013 Act allows a supplier of an item to apply to the HSE requesting the HSE to add the item to the Reimbursement List.</p><p>In considering an application, the HSE will also have regard to Part 1 and Part 3 of Schedule 3 of the 2013 Act. </p><p>Section 19(4) of the 2013 Act prohibits the HSE from making a relevant decision under section 18 &quot;except in accordance with the criteria specified in Schedule 3&quot;.  Schedule 3 sets out nine general criteria, of which one is the resources available to the Executive.</p><p>Under the 2016 Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines, in a situation where the HSE wishes to reimburse a medicine but cannot do so from within existing resources, it may inform my Department of its decision in this respect.  The Minister for Health may, as he deems appropriate, bring a Memorandum to Government in relation to the funding implications and requesting consideration of same. </p><p>Prior to the introduction of the Framework Agreement one treatment, Ibrutinib, was referred to my Department in 2016.</p><p>In line with the Framework Agreement and since its introduction in July 2016, the HSE has referred ten treatments to my Department for consideration, one of which was Orkambi (including Kalydeco). </p><p>Following consideration by my Department and Government of the funding implications, the HSE decided, in line with the 2013 Act to reimburse Ibrutinib and Orkambi (including Kalydeco).</p><p>The funding implications of the other nine treatments are currently under consideration by my Department.  These are outlined in Table 1.  </p><p><b>Table 1:  Treatments referred to the Department of Health </b><table><tr><th>Product </th><th>Brand</th><th>Indication </th></tr><tr><td>Vismodegib </td><td>Erivedge</td><td>Basal Cell Carcinoma</td></tr><tr><td>Vortioxetine </td><td>Brintellix</td><td>Depression</td></tr><tr><td>Sacubitril / Valsartan </td><td>Entresto</td><td>Heart Failure</td></tr><tr><td>Olaparib </td><td>Lynparza</td><td>Ovarian Cancer</td></tr><tr><td>Obinutuzumab </td><td>Gazyvaro</td><td>Follicular Lymphoma</td></tr><tr><td>Vedolizumab </td><td>Entyvio</td><td>Crohns &amp;amp; Ulcerative Colitis</td></tr><tr><td>Nivolumab </td><td>Opdivo</td><td>Renal Cell Carcinoma</td></tr><tr><td>Nivolumab </td><td>Opdivo</td><td>Hodgkins Lymphoma</td></tr><tr><td>Apremilast </td><td>Otezla</td><td>Psoriasis &amp;amp; Psoriatic Arthrithis</td></tr></table></p><p>Each of these treatments were referred to my Department because the HSE decided to support the reimbursement application but considered that this could not be funded from within its current budgetary envelope and also taking account of the cumulative costs over a 5 year period.  The HSE advise that the cumulative cost over 5 years of these treatments is approximately &euro;120 million.</p><p>It should be noted that the final decision in relation to the reimbursement of all medicines remains the statutory responsibility of the HSE.</p><p>The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducts health technological assessments on behalf of the HSE, a summary of which are available on the NCPE website www.ncpe.ie.  These assessments include details of the estimated patient numbers and costs associated with each of these treatments. </p><p>As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, within 180 days of receiving the application (or such longer period which may arise if further information is sought from the Company), the HSE will decide to either: </p><p>- add the medicine to the Reimbursement List / agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, </p><p>or, </p><p>- will refuse to reimburse the medicine. </p><p>While the HSE strives to reach a decision regarding drug approval in as timely a manner as possible and within the 180 days, because of the significant monies involved, there is an onus on the HSE to ensure that the best price is achieved as these commitments often feature multi million euro investments on an ongoing basis.  The achievement of more successful price negotiations also allows for further drugs to be approved within the finite budget available. </p><p>I have asked the HSE to refer directly to the Deputy in relation to the timelines for the individual medicines.</p></reply>

This includes protecting all the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, maintaining EU support for the Peace Process, having an invisible border on the island and supporting continued North-South co-operation.</p>  <p>  The acknowledgement of Ireland&rsquo;s unique circumstances by both the EU and the UK has been the result of a major Government campaign of engagement with EU partners and the EU institutions to ensure our specific concerns were fully recognised.  Our ongoing engagement with EU partners has shown that there is good understanding of our unique concerns, notably regarding the Peace Process and the Common Travel Area (CTA) and reciprocal rights. </p>  <p>  Both the Irish and British Governments have indicated their intention to maintain the CTA after the UK withdraws from the EU.  The CTA pre-dates Ireland and the UK joining the EU and is not dependent on EU membership.  The CTA is particularly important in the context of the Northern Ireland Peace Process and relations on the island of Ireland.  It facilitates the vast numbers of people who commute across the border and to and from Great Britain for work, business, trade, education, family, health or other reasons.</p>  <p>  There is close cooperation between Ireland and Northern Ireland in the area of health.  This cooperation occurs both within the framework of our common EU membership and on a bilateral basis, including at service-to-service level.  A key priority of the Department of Health in addressing the implications of Brexit is to ensure continuity of health services and to preserve and protect current co-operation arrangements on a cross-border, all-island and Ireland-UK basis.  This is being pursued on both a bilateral and EU-wide basis as appropriate.  Of course, Ireland will be part of the EU27 team and looks forward to working with our fellow Member States in delivering the best possible result for Ireland and for the EU. </p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies have been conducting detailed analysis on the potential impacts of Brexit.  Ensuring continuity in cross-border health services has been identified as a priority and forms part of wider contingency planning being undertaken to address the implications of Brexit in the area of health.  I would like to assure the Deputy that I am fully committed to preserving and protecting cross-border health co-operation and access to shared services.</p></reply>

In the short-term, cancer clinical trials are not impacted by uncertainties over Brexit. </p>  <p>  The Health Research Board, who part fund Cancer Trials Ireland, is planning an interim review of Cancer Trials Ireland in 2018.  This will look at the Irish and international context within which Cancer Trials Ireland can sustain and further develop its portfolio.

One of these reforms will see legislation brought forward which will support a culture of open disclosure within the health services.  This builds on the current HSE policy which has been in place since 2013, under which all employees, including medical staff, are required to disclose and report incidents in line with the HSE's Safety Incident Management Policy.  Provisions to support open disclosure to patients have been included in the Department of Justice and Equality's Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill 2017.  As the Deputy may be aware, this Bill is currently making its way through the Oireachtas, and was considered at Committee stage on 30 June last. </p>  <p>  Creating a culture of open disclosure and learning from the things that go wrong is the bedrock of making systems safer.  Open Disclosure is defined as 'an open consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in healthcare.  This includes expressing regret for what has happened, keeping the patient informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the adverse event'.</p>  <p>  We all know that when error or harm is experienced by a patient, the trust and confidence of that patient and their family are compromised.  That is why honest, open disclosure and communication, which demonstrate empathy and sensitivity, are so essential.  The intent of the legislation currently under consideration is to provide certain legal protections for healthcare staff for open disclosure.  This will give further support to those staff in their communications with patients and family members if an adverse event occurs.  The Ethical Code of Practice set out by the Medical Council also makes clear the responsibilities of doctors in relation to open disclosure, to support and promote a culture of candour, within which open disclosure can take place.</p>  <p>  Reporting of adverse events is also part of a strong patient safety culture.  The Department of Health and the HSE are working to strengthen the reporting of incidents when they occur, to ensure that the needs of patients who have been affected are catered for and to allow for the system as a whole to learn from the particular episode.  The Health Information and Patient Safety Bill, which is at an advanced stage, will contain provisions on mandatory reporting of a prescribed list of very significant adverse events in the public and private healthcare sector.</p>  <p>  The open disclosure provisions form part of a number of initiatives to improve the management of patient safety incidents.  HIQA and the Mental Health Commission have recently finalised new Standards on the Conduct of Reviews of Patient Safety Incidents which expand on the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare.  This set of standards along with the mandatory reporting of serious reportable events provided for in the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill and the provisions intended for open disclosure will provide a comprehensive patient-centred approach to preventing, managing and learning from incidents.</p></reply>

The out of hours consultant medical cover is provided on a rota basis and includes consultant general physicians and consultant cardiologists.  Patients in the South East have access to out-of-hours Primary PCI services at Cork University Hospital or St James's Hospital, Dublin.  Alternatively, thrombolysis can be performed at the nearest Emergency Department.  </p>  <p>  Following a targeted initiative, there has been a significant improvement in waiting times for cardiology procedures at UHW; the most recent data from the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which is for May 2017, indicates that a total of 296 patients were waiting for a cardiology inpatient or daycase procedure, with 189 of these waiting less than three months.  In his review of cardiology services at UHW, Dr Niall Herity recommended additional investment to increase capacity at the hospital.  An additional &euro;0.5m funding was provided to the hospital to enable it to provide two additional cardiac catheterisation laboratory (cath lab) sessions per week, equivalent to a 20% expansion in operating hours.  A tender was issued in June for the provision of a temporary mobile cath lab which will contribute, on an interim basis, to the further reduction in elective cardiology waiting lists at UHW.</p></reply>

Heart attacks may be ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or Non ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).  In general, hospitals will carry out a number of investigations and procedures to determine if there is a confirmed ACS and the extent of the ACS, and to treat the symptoms and/or the syndrome/disease.  STEMI diagnosis can also be done pre-hospital via a 12 lead ECG machine with ECGs transmitted to a hospital for interpretation and/or via interpretation by trained paramedics.</p>  <p>  The main investigation is the electrocardiogram (ECG).  ECGs are particularly useful in determining those patients with ST segment elevation that will benefit from early reperfusion either by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) or by the administering of thrombolysis.  PPCI is recognised internationally as the preferred treatment of STEMI in terms of morbidity and mortality outcomes.  Where PPCI cannot be delivered within an acceptable timeframe, thrombolysis is recommended with early transfer to a PPCI centre for angiography.</p></reply>

Indeed, the issue of anomaly scanning is a priority issue for the Programme and, accordingly, it will develop clinical guidance regarding routine detailed scans at 20 weeks.  In the meantime, the Programme will continue to work with the six Hospital Groups to assist in increasing access to anomaly scans for those units with limited availability. </p>  <p>  One of the current challenges to increase access to anomaly scans is the recruitment of ultrasonographers who are skilled in using these machines.

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE has extensive information concerning Lyme disease on its website www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/lymedisease/. </p>  <p>  Lyme borelliosis was made been statutorily notifiable in Ireland by the Infectious Diseases (Amendment Regulations) Regulations 2011 (S.I. no 452 of 2011).  The notifiable entity is Lyme neuroborreliosis, the more severe neurological form of Lyme borelliosis.  The HPSC of the HSE collects and collates surveillance data on notifiable infectious diseases.  The number of annual neuroborreliosis notifications over the last few years is as follows:</p>  <p>  - 2012 - 08 cases;</p>  <p>  - 2013 - 13 cases;</p>  <p>  - 2014 - 18 cases;</p>  <p>  - 2015 - 12 cases;</p>  <p>  - 2016 - 21 cases (provisional).</p>  <p>  The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC, the Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland, the Irish Society of Clinical Microbiologists, the Irish Institute of Clinical Neuroscience and the Irish College of General Practitioners agreed a Consensus Statement on the Clinical Management of Lyme Borreliosis, which endorsed the previously referenced, internationally recognised set of guidelines (those of the IDSA) to Medical Practitioners to ensure a standardised approach to the diagnosis and management of Lyme disease in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step.  Screening EIAs can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other similar bacteria, and certain other viral infections, including glandular fever.  In addition, blood samples from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results.  Samples giving positive or equivocal results in screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage immunoblot (Western blot) tests.  Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity.  Using this two stage approach will give a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme. All clinical (and other) laboratories in Ireland must undergo continuous quality assurance to ensure that the quality of the diagnostics they provide is maintained at the highest international level for human diagnostics. </p>  <p>  In Ireland, treatment by most clinicians is based on that laid out in evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis (formerly known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis), and babesiosis published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2006.  Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered.</p>  <p>  The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee, the aim of which is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency, an Environmental Health Officer and, very importantly, a representative from Tick Talk Ireland, the primary Support Group for Lyme disease in Ireland.  The Sub-Committee first met on 6 May 2015 and it is expected to report in 2017.</p>  <p>  There is significant support and extensive information for health professionals and the public on the HPSC website.  These supports include a fact sheet on tick borne diseases, including Lyme Disease.  This fact sheet gives information on clinical features, the disease, transmission routes, prevention measures, diagnosis, and management and treatment.  There is also an erythema migrans (EM) diagnostic tool to aid health professionals in the diagnosis of EM, which is frequently the earliest clinical manifestation of Lyme borreliosis.  Information for the public includes: </p>  <p>  - Lyme Disease Frequently Asked Questions; </p>  <p>  - Laboratory testing for Lyme Disease: FAQs for general public; </p>  <p>  - Lyme Disease Illustrations; and </p>  <p>  - CDC's instructions on how to remove a tick.</p>  <p>  Testing for Lyme borrelliosis is currently undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland.  As testing and treatment for Lyme borreliosis is widely available in Ireland there is no requirement for people to travel to other EU Member States to access these services.</p></reply>

The Group noted current challenges in respect of staffing of particular consultant-level posts and the onerous out-of-hours commitment and demanding rotas in some smaller hospitals.  The Group considered that the reconfiguration of services in the context of the Hospital Groups provided an opportunity to address this issue.  The establishment of Hospital Groups is a key enabler for reorganisation of services across hospitals.  Significant progress has been made in the implementation of Hospital Groups, with more co-ordinated approaches to the planning and delivery of services across all the hospitals within a Group.  Hospitals are now working together to support each other, providing a stronger role for smaller hospitals in delivering less complex care and ensuring that patients who require true emergency or complex planned care are managed safely in larger hospitals.  The potential for improved workforce organisation, as part of addressing the staffing challenges in some hospitals, is a key aspect of the continued development of Hospital Groups. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the continued development of GP capacity to ensure that patients across the country continue to have access to GP services, especially in remote rural areas and also in disadvantaged urban areas, and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.  I want to ensure that existing GP services are retained and that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly qualified GPs.  Several efforts to increase the number of practising GPs have been undertaken in recent years.  These include increases in the number of GP training places, which have risen from 120 places in 2009 to 171 places being formally accepted for the 2017 training intake as of 13 June, representing an increase of 43% in the last 8 years.  Changes have been made to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to facilitate more flexible/shared GMS contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme.</p>  <p>  An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices was also introduced in May 2016.  The new Rural Practice Support Framework includes improved qualifying criteria for rural support and an increase in the financial allowance from &euro;16,216 to &euro;20,000 per annum. Over 300 GPs now benefit from rural practice supports under this Framework.  This is a significant increase on the 167 GPs who received the Rural Practice Allowance prior to the introduction of the new Framework last year.  In addition, the GP contracts review process which is currently underway will seek to arrive at contractual arrangements which will ensure that general practice is an attractive, fulfilling and rewarding career option into the future.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to a decisive shift within the health service towards primary care in order to deliver better care close to home in communities across the country. The development of a new, modernised contract for the provision of general practitioner services will be a key element in facilitating this process. </p>  <p>  The aim is to develop a contract which will facilitate the shift within the health service away from hospital services towards an integrated primary care service in order to deliver better care close to home in communities across the country. I want to see a new contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions.  A new contract should be flexible and be able to respond to the changing nature of the GP workforce.  It should also include provisions in relation to service quality and standards, performance, accountability and transparency.  I think this will be key in making general practice a more attractive career.</p>  <p>  Since 2015, negotiations have resulted in a number of service developments including the provision of free GP care to under 6's and over 70's, the introduction of a Diabetes Cycle of Care for adult GMS patients with Type 2 Diabetes and enhanced supports for rural GPs.  The next phase of discussions on a new GP contract is under way.  The discussions taking place are wide ranging and ambitious in their scope.  While there will be challenges for all parties involved, I am hopeful that with the goodwill and cooperation of all parties, significant progress can be made in these discussions in the months ahead.</p></reply>

It is for this reason that &euro;20 million was allocated to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, I asked the HSE to develop Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient/Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient services.  These plans have been published and their implementation is ongoing.  </p>  <p>  The Inpatient/Daycase and Outpatient Plans focus on reducing the number of patients waiting 15 months or more for inpatient and daycase treatment or for an outpatient appointment by the end of October.  Under these plans over 14,700 patients have come off Inpatient/ Daycase waiting lists, and over 51,000 patients have come off the Outpatient waiting list, and 148 scoliosis surgeries have taken place.  The Department of Health will continue to work with the HSE and the NTPF to ensure the best use of public hospital capacity and the private hospital system to meet the needs of patients waiting for Inpatient, Daycase and Outpatient Services. </p>  <p>  Regarding capacity at St James's Hospital, all proposals to extend intensive care facilities will need to be considered in the context of competing priorities in the 2018 Estimates process.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

It is caused by a reaction to gluten which is found in wheat, barley and rye.</p>  <p>  The diagnosis is usually made in a hospital setting and involves a combination of blood antibody tests and intestinal biopsies.  The condition may make it difficult to absorb nutrients, minerals and fat soluble vitamins.  The management of Coeliac Disease involves lifelong gluten-free diet, which leads to recovery of the intestine, improves symptoms and reduces complications.  Dietician input will help to determine which foods contain gluten as well as in providing a balanced diet which is required for health and well-being.</p></reply>

Hospital Groups enable a better configuration of hospital services with benefits relating to safety, quality, access, cost and sustainable medical staffing and every hospital in the group, large and small, statutory and voluntary, will play a vital role within the Group.  Hospitals working together in a Group will be able to support each other, providing a stronger role for smaller hospitals in delivering less complex care, and ensuring that those who require emergency or complex planned care are managed safely in larger hospitals.</p>  <p>  The Smaller Hospitals Framework focuses in particular on the future role of smaller hospitals and outlines the wide range of services that can be provided within these smaller hospitals.  It also outlines the potential to expand the services delivered in smaller hospitals.</p>  <p>  As a Model 2 hospital, Monaghan does not have a 24/7 Emergency Department or critical care unit.  However, in line with the Framework, Monaghan Hospital has a Minor Injuries Unit located on site.</p>  <p>  I am committed to securing and further developing the role of our smaller hospitals with the expansion of services delivered in these hospitals, especially in services such as day surgery; ambulatory care; medical services and diagnostics.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government commits to a review of Medical Assessment Units, Urgent Care Centres and Minor Injuries Units, including the Unit at Monaghan Hospital. Work on this review is progressing in 2017.</p></reply>

Work is currently in train to develop population projections by gender and single year of age for each year, up to 2030, where assumptions can be altered to examine alternative scenarios (e.g., fertility, migration, life expectancy, health status) , and the impact on future health and social care demand by sector.  </p>  <p>  This Department has also commissioned a review of the current health capacity incorporating acute hospitals, primary care and social care sectors to be completed this year.

I understand that the HSE&rsquo;s objective was to develop more equitable arrangements for the provision of post-mastectomy products, wigs and hairpieces and to extend these supports to a broader cohort of patients.  Neither my Department nor I were involved or consulted in the course of this process.  At my request, the HSE has deferred introduction of the proposed changes.  I have asked the Executive to re-examine the matter with a view to devising a plan which will achieve an equitable outcome but not lessen the level of provision for patients who are already coping with serious illness.

The review looks at the associated costs and benefits for the funder, provider and patient, the criteria for accessing the public funded service and the basis for these criteria in different jurisdictions.  </p>  <p>  The review does not indicate a recommendation or preference for a specific funding model; rather it outlines the pros and cons of such funding models, the different aspects of models in different jurisdictions, as well as the different rationales underpinning such funding models.  </p>  <p>  The HRB evidence review will be analysed by officials in my Department in the context of considering policy options for a potential public funding model for AHR treatment.  It should be noted that, any funding model that might ultimately be introduced would need to operate within the broader regulatory framework relating to AHR.  </p>  <p>  Work on the General Scheme of an AHR Bill is well-advanced in my Department and I consider this and the development of policy on public funding for AHR treatment to be a priority for 2017.  </p></reply>

This independent clinical review was completed by Dr. Niall Herity, one of the foremost cardiologists on these islands and a doctor of international repute.  Dr Herity concluded that the needs of the effective UHW catchment population could be accommodated from a single cath lab.  However, he recommended investment to enhance cardiac services at the hospital to address waiting times and to provide improved access for patients.  Accordingly, an additional &euro;500,000 has been allocated to the hospital for 2017 to provide two additional cath lab sessions per week.  This entails an additional eight hours provision per week or a 20% expansion in operating hours.  It is expected that this capacity will facilitate the provision of an increased volume of scheduled cardiology care at the hospital.  I have asked the HSE to maximise the benefit for patients from that funding, in respect of both additional sessions at the existing cath lab and the temporary use of a mobile cath lab for a specific period.  The mobile cath lab is currently being procured in line with the normal HSE procurement process.</p>  <p>  Dr. Herity further recommended that the UHW cath lab should operate as an elective lab which provides all specialised cardiac services except interventional treatment for patients who are having heart attacks (PPCI), and that the current 9 to 5 provision of these services should cease in order to allow the hospital to focus on the much larger volume of planned cath lab work.  This is because highly specialised services such as primary PCI need to be carried out in a small number of hospitals where the volume of patients supports the provision of a safe service.</p>  <p>  However, as Minister for Health, I want to be sure that any service changes that are implemented will result in improved services for patients.  Therefore, I have asked my Department to address the implications of Dr. Herity's recommendations by undertaking a national review of all PPCI services, with the aim of ensuring that as many patients as possible have access, on a 24/7 basis, to safe and sustainable emergency interventions following a heart attack.</p></reply>

We are also insisting that the timing and content of any beef TRQ offer is handled appropriately, and in a manner that safeguards the interests of the Irish and European beef sector in particular.</p>  <p>  This must also take into account the findings of the Commission&rsquo;s recent cumulative impact assessment, which strongly reinforce Ireland&rsquo;s position in relation to beef.  They are also a very effective reminder of the need for great caution in our approach to the issue of beef TRQs.</p>  <p>  Of course the recent issues with Brazilian beef exports have been worrying.  However, I would point out that the Commission was quick to react as soon as the practices uncovered in Brazil came to light.  Its actions in seeking immediate suspension of certification for the establishments responsible, together with the rejection of consignments en route to the EU from those establishments, were appropriate and effective.  I also welcome the harmonised approach being taken to the more intensified checks that are now being carried out on product from Brazil at EU Border Inspection Posts, and in which Ireland is playing a full part.</p>  <p>  It is vitally important that meat and meat products being exported from any country to the EU fully comply with EU standards, and that there are robust and reliable systems in place to ensure that this is the case.  We cannot tolerate a situation in which EU requirements are flouted, given the potential risks for food safety and consumer health.</p>  <p>  These events demonstrate that we must remain vigilant at all times.  I believe that we must therefore continue to keep this situation under ongoing review, and be ready to take additional measures if the circumstances demand it.  </p></reply>

This effectively means that agricultural emissions are balanced by increasing carbon-sequestration, reducing emissions from the land sector, increasing fossil fuel and energy intensive materials displacement.  However, further elaboration of the concept of carbon neutrality and how it will be achieved over time is required.</p>  <p>  The 2012 Teagasc Marginal Abatement Cost Curve identified 1.1 Mt CO2 abatement potential by 2020.</p>  <p>  Agriculture accounts for about 33% of national emissions.  This figure reflects the importance of agriculture to the Irish economy, the significance of an efficient grass based livestock industry and Ireland&rsquo;s lack of heavy industry.</p>  <p>  The most recent EPA figues indicate that agriculture emissions are 5.5% below 1990 figures.  This overall reduction in emissions from agriculture has also been influenced by measures such as the Rural Environmental Protection Scheme, Agriculture Environmental Options Scheme, Green Low Carbon Agri Environmental Scheme, Organic Scheme, supports for manure management in line with the EU Nitrates Directive, and through development of renewable energy resources.  It is also of note that improvements in sustainable intensification, such as improved fertiliser use and grassland management, have occurred alongside the afforestation of 300,000 hectares of agricultural land since 1990, which has helped to maintain agricultural output.</p>  <p>  Over the period 2021 to 2030, afforestation since 1990 (i.e. all new forests planted since 1990 and up to 2020) will remove an estimated net 4.5 million tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere per annum based on the current method of accounting in EU Decision 529/2013.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware from my previous reply, my Department and its agencies have been strongly focussed on improving the efficiency of Irish farming which is fundamental to reducing emissions.</p>  <p>  Current analysis suggests that the emissions intensity per kcal of food output in 2013 is reduced approximately 14% relative to 2005 and early estimates project that the BAU 2030 emission intensity will be a quarter below the emission intensity in 2005.  Further, early estimates of agriculture with additional measures is approximately 35% below 2005, although absolute emissions remain reasonably stable.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that we are one of a small number of EU countries to have elected to report on grassland and cropland management activities for the 2nd commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (KP) (2013-2020) so we are endeavouring to improve our understanding of the drivers of emissions from these activities with a view to developing policies and measures to reducing the source of these emissions.

Donegal coast in the second week of October 2016.  The first tagging surveys took place between 9 and 12 October, with the second phase taking place between 22 and 26 October and 28 October and 1 November.</p>  <p>  Preliminary reporting from the Marine Institute indicates that the tagging operations were successful with 16 Wildlife Computers MinPAT tags deployed.  The data transmitted by these tags gives scientists information about the location of BFT and will help the partners involved in the project to construct migratory patterns using light, temperature and depth data.  A number of the tags are continuing to transmit data that will be useful in the broader context of the ICCAT scientific research to assess the abundance and distribution of blue fin tuna in the waters off the Irish coast.  In that context I have asked the Marine Institute to expand the tagging programme for 2017 and this is currently in the planning phase.</p>  <p>  In future, it may prove possible to extend the scope of this project and I am committed to actively pursuing any opportunity to improve the scientific knowledge base for the stock of bluefin tuna in the waters off Ireland.  I am hopeful that the gathering of such information could help build a case that might allow for an angling catch and release fishery in the future.</p>  <p>  Any such proposal would have to be based on a scientific assessment from the Marine Institute and would also need to be developed in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Inland Fisheries Ireland who have responsibility for recreational fishing.  Any such case will require the support of the EU Commission and approval of ICCAT.</p>  <p>  The current legal situation is that a recreational angling fishery in Ireland for bluefin tuna, even on a catch and release basis, is not possible in the absence of a national bluefin tuna quota.  We do not have such a quota and it is extremely unlikely that we could obtain one in the short term as it would involve reducing the share of the Total Allowable Catch of those EU Member States that do have quota and for whom bluefin is an important commercial fishery.</p>  <p>  A small bluefin by-catch quota is available to Ireland for use in our Northern Albacore Tuna fishery and Celtic Sea herring fishery.  This bycatch quota is also available to other Member States of the European Union without national quotas for bluefin tuna.  Under the TAC &amp;amp; Quota Regulation, it is specifically prohibited to utilize this by-catch quota for recreational and/or sport fisheries, even in the context of a catch and release programme. </p></reply>

The reflection paper points to the need to ensure that European Union budget adds value.  That is a principle to which Ireland can subscribe.  </p>  <p>  The CAP is a policy which has adapted over time to the needs of citizens and contributes to development in rural areas, employment creation, environmental sustainability and the provision of safe food that meets the high standards that EU consumers have come to expect.  It also plays a central role in delivering the smart, sustainable and inclusive growth sought under the Europe 2020 strategy.  It is important that the CAP continues to evolve in a way that supports the achievements of European priorities, particularly in the context of securing a strong CAP budget for the post-2020 period.  This can only be achieved by reinforcing the relevance and effectiveness of the policy in helping to achieve broader societal goals.  </p>  <p>  For now, it is worth noting that the amount of CAP funding per Member State for pillar 1, direct payments, and pillar 2, rural development, is fixed until 2020 in Regulations of the Council and European Parliament.  Any change to these figures will require a co-decided amendment to these Regulations.</p>  <p>  While formal discussions on the Multi Annual Financial Framework have not yet commenced, Ireland supports the retention of a strong and well funded CAP and its position on this matter has been articulated at official and political level and is well understood in other member States and in the Commission.  I will be working hard with my European counterparts to ensure that the CAP budget post 2020 provides a solid and effective foundation for the development of the sector into the future, when discussions do commence.  In addition officials in my Department are also working closely with the Department of Finance on the next MFF. </p></reply>

The public consultation has now concluded and that Department will conduct a thorough examination of all submissions received as part of its consultation phase.</p>  <p>  Within this context, the document which was drafted to inform the public consultation identified a number of issues in relation to air quality and emission sources.  It recognised that the spreading of slurry can, depending on the timing of the application and the weather conditions, result in nitrogen loss from slurry to the atmosphere through ammonia volatilisation.</p>  <p>  No decision has been taken on a total ban on splash plates.  My Department will continue to liaise closely with colleagues in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment on this matter.</p>  <p>  On foot of farmer demand to improve the utilisation of slurry as a fertiliser, my Department is assisting farmers under TAMS in the purchase of Low Emission Slurry Spreading equipment where to date 539 applications have been received for trailing shoe, 394 applications for the dribble bar and 14 applications for shallow injection. Overall across all low emissions technologies over 1,058 applications have been received which is above expectations.  There are no splash plate systems being grant-aided.  In addition more than 4,750 farmers have applied under the GLAS scheme to apply slurry using low emission equipment.</p>  <p>  This is being driven by farmers themselves wanting to maximise the value of the slurry on their own farms, rather than as a regulatory requirement.  Recently, the Association of Farm and Forestry Contractors of Ireland also identified their support for this technology.</p>  <p>  However, I fully understand that this technology is not suitable for all farms.</p></reply>

People living in rented accommodation are twice as likely to live in a home that is E, F or G rated on the Building Energy Rating (BER) scale.  Households living in relatively energy inefficient properties spend &euro;160-&euro;419 per annum more on energy than households in a home rated with a BER of B.  This leaves those living in rented accommodation more vulnerable to energy poverty.</p>  <p>  That is why the Government&rsquo;s Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty commits to piloting an initiative to allow landlords participating in the Local Authority led Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) schemes to receive free energy efficiency upgrades.</p>  <p>  My officials are currently working with Local Authorities to agree the terms and conditions for this pilot.  This would be trialled initially with a small number of Local Authorities and the findings from this would inform consideration of a wider roll-out.</p>  <p>  Regarding minimum energy efficiency standards for rented properties, the Government is considering such regulations as the typical residential tenancy in Ireland is short and hence tenants do not tend to invest significant sums in the property they are living in.  At the same time, landlords under-invest in energy efficiency works as the tenants are the ones who benefit from the consequent energy bill savings and in a constrained rental market there appears to be little value placed on the energy efficiency of a rented property.  These diverging incentives mean that energy efficiency investment is much lower in the private rented sector than among homeowners, even though Government grant schemes such as the Better Energy Homes scheme are open to landlords.</p>  <p>  My Department has worked with external consultants to examine the impact of introducing minimum energy efficiency standards to counteract this market failure but this must be balanced against the impact such regulations would have on the price and availability of rented properties.</p>  <p>  With the publication of the 2017 Census, my Department is working to update the research findings and incorporate this new data.  By the autumn I intend to present the findings of this updated research to a seminar of tenant and landlord interest groups, with a view to publishing the research shortly thereafter and engaging in a full public consultation.</p></reply>

The scheme supports private homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their home. Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating system upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying Building Energy Rating (BER).</p><p>The measures currently offered were selected as the best balance that could be achieved between the resources available to the scheme, the number of homes that can receive support and the energy savings that can delivered.  In short, the measures supported are those that can deliver the most energy savings at the lowest cost to the highest number of people.</p><p>The following table shows the cash impact if the level of each grant under the Better Energy Homes scheme (excluding the BER) were doubled and demand for grants was identical to that experienced in 2016.  However, it must be noted that it is not simply a case of multiplying the 2016 allocation.  Doubling the grants available would likely result in a significant increase in demand for grants, which would mean that it would be likely that the Exchequer resources devoted to the programme would also have to increase quite significantly to cope with this increased demand.</p><p>Broadly speaking the grants available are set at around 30-35% of the projected cost of each measure.  Doubling grant levels would certainly increase demand for grants but would result in a lower return of energy savings for each euro of Government investment and would thus represent poorer value for money for taxpayers.</p><p>Quintupling the grant level for solar heating would result in a grant that covers more than 150% of the cost of installing a solar heating system.  In other words, anyone who installed a solar heating system would receive a net benefit of approximately &euro;2,000.  This would be effective at promoting deployment of solar heating but again would not represent good value for money for the taxpayer and would place a considerable stress on the construction industry as they would have to adapt to what would likely be a very high spike in demand.<table><tr><th>Measure</th><th>Number of Grants Paid (Excluding BER)</th><th>Value of Grants Paid 2016 (&euro;)</th><th>Value of Grants Paid If Average Grant Doubled (&euro;)</th></tr><tr><td>Roof Insulation</td><td>5,279</td><td>1,595,393</td><td>3,190,785</td></tr><tr><td>Cavity </td><td>4,573</td><td>1,406,562</td><td>2,813,124</td></tr><tr><td>Dry-Lining Insulation </td><td>733</td><td>1,396,364</td><td>2,792,728</td></tr><tr><td>External Insulation</td><td>1,274</td><td>4,736,443</td><td>9,472,886</td></tr><tr><td>H.E Gas Boiler with Heating Control Upgrade</td><td>4,516</td><td>3,306,150</td><td>6,612,300</td></tr><tr><td>H.E Oil Boiler with Heating Control Upgrade</td><td>1,390</td><td>1,069,850</td><td>2,139,700</td></tr><tr><td>Heating Controls Upgrade Only</td><td>1,286</td><td>835,180</td><td>1,670,361</td></tr><tr><td>Solar Heating</td><td>1,588</td><td>1,980,500</td><td>3,961,000</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>20,639 </td><td>16,326,442 </td><td>32,652,884 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

My Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) are now testing out the channels for carrying out deeper renovation in homes across the country to inform future policy.  That is why support for a much broader range of technologies is made available through the Better Energy Communities scheme, the recently announced Deep Retrofit pilot scheme and the Warmth &amp;amp; Well-being scheme.</p>  <p>  In specific response to the Deputy's question, the cost of introducing a grant for a set percentage of the price of renewable technologies is impossible to estimate without conducting a comprehensive market survey of technology prices and considering likely demand scenarios for the introduction of such grants.  No such assessment has been undertaken by my Department.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that I have requested SEAI to undertake a review of technologies for consideration in home energy grant schemes.  The results of this review will inform any future measures that may be offered.  However, Government support for energy efficiency will continue to prioritise those measures which are cost effective to deliver and will always seek as the highest priority to reduce energy demand in the first instance.</p>  <p>  In the electricity sector the primary support mechanisms for renewable electricity are the Renewable Electricity Feed-in-Tariff schemes, paid for electricity exported into the national grid.  Micro-generation is not currently supported under any of these schemes.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS).  The design of the new scheme includes an extensive independent economic appraisal.  This economic appraisal involves comparing the cost of supporting a range of technologies &ndash; including micro-generation of various technologies, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.  A public consultation on key design elements of the new support scheme will be published shortly.</p></reply>

Meeting this specification will be challenging but the lessons learned will play a crucial role in determining how the State can effectively support homeowners who want to upgrade their homes to this standard on a wider basis.</p>  <p>  Undertaking a retrofit on this scale is a complex, demanding task and householders without any background or experience in energy issues would find it extremely difficult to undertake such an upgrade without support.  SEAI is not resourced to provide this degree of engagement to individual homeowners.  Therefore, requiring a counter-agent to co-ordinate and act on behalf of a householder ensures that a source of expert support and advice on deep retrofit is available to them throughout the upgrade process.  As the Deep Retrofit scheme develops and as undertaking these deep retrofits becomes more commonplace it may be that the need for this advice and support requirement is lessened and it may be appropriate to widen the eligibility to include individual homeowners.  This matter will be kept under review by my Department and SEAI.</p>  <p>  With regard to the rate of subvention, I believe that the current rates, 50% for homeowners and 95% for those in energy poverty, are appropriate.  This rate of subvention is considerably higher than the average grant paid under the Better Energy Homes scheme and reflects the reality that the scheme is trying to build and develop a market for deep retrofit in Ireland.  However, increasing the average support level above these levels would push it into a rate that is not sustainable in the long run, which in turn introduces regulatory uncertainty for scheme co-ordinators and contractors and would not represent good value for money for the taxpayers who are funding the scheme.</p>  <p>   &euro;5 million has been allocated to the scheme for 2017.  It is my intention that the deep retrofit scheme will run for several years and will test a variety of new and innovative ways of promoting deeper retrofits.  These learnings will then be incorporated into the design of future nationwide support schemes.  The budget for the programme will be reviewed by my Department on an annual basis and will reflect the anticipated level of demand for the scheme and the resources available to support energy efficiency support schemes generally.  As I noted in my speech to the recent SEAI conference on deep retrofit, the future of this scheme is in the hands of counter-party's, be they Local Authorities, community groups or private ventures.  I have made funds available for the scheme, the SEAI has published the scheme&rsquo;s principles and now we need to persuade homeowners to make the commitment to undertake deep retrofits.</p></reply>

The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that to date approximately 1.4 million or 61% of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second and this footprint is expanding.</p><p>In April, eir signed a agreement with me committing them to follow through on their commercial plans to provide new high speed broadband infrastructure to 300,000 premises in rural areas.  eir has committed to doing this work over a 90 week period with an average of 500 premises passed per day.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department's website .  The decision by eir to invest in infrastructure to deploy high speed broadband services to an additional 300,000 premises in rural Ireland was taken by eir on commercial grounds.  Neither I nor the Department have a statutory authority to direct eir in this regard.</p><p>Quarterly updates on progress of the eir 300,000 roll-out will be published on the Departments website.  The Q1 figures have been verified by my Department and the eir roll-out is in line with the Commitment Agreement.</p><p>In April I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie.</i>This map finalises the State Intervention Area for the procurement process and is an important milestone in the procurement process.  The Map shows the extent of  the State Intervention area and also the areas targeted for commercial services.</p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,</p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process.</p><p>The map shows that 21% of Tullycross in the townland of Gorteenannaglogh, Co Galway and the Eircode in Co Donegal referred to by the Deputy falls within an AMBER area and will be part of the State led Intervention under the NBP.  The remaining 79% of the townland of Gorteenannaglogh, Co Galway including the company referred to by the Deputy in Co Cavan falls within eir's plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and end 2018 (Light BLUE on map).  Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at <i></i>.  Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.</p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers.</p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.</p><p>With the finalisation of the map and following extensive dialogue with bidders, the procurement is progressing to the next stage.  On 20 June 2017 my Department wrote to the three bidders in the NBP procurement process inviting them to submit their &quot;Detailed Solutions&quot; by 26 September 2017.  The &quot;Detailed Solutions&quot; stage is the last stage of the procurement process before Final Tenders.</p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP, once contracts are in place.</p><p>The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.</p><p>The rate of demand for data services has increased exponentially in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for telecommunication operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and is available on both Departments' websites.</p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.</p><p>In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I established an Implementation Group to drive and monitor the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions.  I published the first such quarterly progress report on 13 June 2017, which is available on my Department's website at <i></i>and which shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017.</p><p>The work of the Task Force will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p><p>In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg recently announced the results of its auction for the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band, which means an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas.  The Regulator has awarded 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band which will provide a degree of stability and create future investment certainty.  Spectrum was also awarded in lots covering 9 urban and rural regions across the country.</p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.</p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.</p></reply>

Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy.  Good progress has been made to date, but the target remains challenging, particularly in light of economic growth and a growing demand for energy.  Latest figures by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) indicate that over 27% of our electricity came from renewable sources in 2016.  This progress, while welcome, will need to accelerate in pace in the coming years.</p>  <p>  The 2016 Programme for Government and 2015 Energy White Paper recognise that solar has the potential to provide a community dividend, thereby also enhancing citizen participation in Ireland's energy future and it is increasingly recognised that Solar PV has the potential to contribute to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy and climate change objectives.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing a proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which will be designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions out to 2030.  The design of the new scheme is underway, and includes an extensive independent economic appraisal.  This appraisal involves comparing the cost of supporting Solar Photovoltaics (PV) - both rooftop and ground mounted, offshore wind, onshore wind and a range of other commercial renewable technologies, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.  The assessment also includes analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.</p>  <p>  My Department will publish shortly a final public consultation on the design principles of the new RESS.  Following the outcome of this public consultation, and before any new scheme is introduced, it will need to secure Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission.  Subject to this, it is expected that the new scheme will become operational in 2018.</p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the level of interest in the solar PV sector in Ireland.  I am advised that nationally there have been over 600 applications, amounting to about 4,290 Megawatts of solar capacity, seeking a connection to the electricity grid in the last 24 months.  Within Tipperary, there have been 41 solar grid connection applications to date, with a combined capacity of 284 MW.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the level of solar applicants seeking connection to the grid, my stated position is that while solar has a role to play in Ireland's energy future, we cannot have a situation where a new support scheme leads to a disproportionate increase in people&rsquo;s electricity bills through the Public Service Obligation levy.  In designing the new RESS, the cost implications for people and businesses will, therefore be a high priority and I will ensure that the new scheme is designed in a cost efficient manner.</p></reply>

Inhalation of Particulate Matter (PM) can increase respiratory morbidity (including exacerbation of existing conditions such as asthma) as well as contributing to cardiovascular disease.</p><p>My Department has commenced work on the first ever National Clean Air Strategy which will provide an overarching strategic policy framework within which clean air policies can be formulated and given effect in a manner consistent with national, EU and international policy considerations and priorities.  The Clean Air Strategy will address priority air pollutants in Ireland, including vehicle emissions, in an integrated manner.  A public consultation on the strategy closed at the end of April and all submissions are currently being assessed.  I hope to have the Strategy finalised by the end of this year.</p><p>In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has undertaken a review of the current state of air quality monitoring and information provision in Ireland.  The outcome of this review was a decision to develop a new air quality monitoring programme which aims to enhance and build on the current arrangements.  The new national Ambient Air Monitoring Programme (AAMP) is being developed under Section 65 of the EPA Act, 1992 as amended.  Placing the programme on this statutory footing emphasises the importance that the EPA places on the monitoring of air quality in Ireland.</p><p>The AAMP covers the years 2017 to 2022, with the enhancement and expansion of the monitoring network to be prioritised in the first phases of the programme.  Further details on the timeframes for the expansion of the network will be released as they become available.</p><p>Insofar as noise is concerned, motorways, including the M50, fall within the scope of EU Directive 2002/49/EC (the Environmental Noise Directive, or END) relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise.  This Directive aims to provide &ldquo;a common framework to avoid, prevent or reduce, on a prioritised basis, the harmful effects of exposure to environmental noise&rdquo;.  A key source of noise covered under the END is road traffic noise.</p><p>The Environmental Noise Regulations 2006 transpose the END into Irish law.  The Regulations designate noise-mapping bodies and action planning authorities for the production of strategic noise maps and action plans.  Primary responsibility for both noise mapping and action planning is assigned to local authorities.  A number of other bodies also have noise mapping functions which are carried out on behalf of the local authorities concerned.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII - formerly the NRA &ndash; National Roads Authority) is a designated noise mapping body under the 2006 regulations.</p><p>The Regulations also designate the Environmental Protection Agency as the National Authority for the purposes of the Regulations.  The Agency's role includes supervisory, advisory and coordination functions in relation to both noise mapping and action planning, as well as the reporting requirements for the purpose of the Directive.</p><p>The Regulations set out a two-stage process for addressing environmental noise.  Firstly, noise must be assessed through the preparation of strategic noise maps every 5 years for areas and infrastructure falling within defined criteria, e.g. large urban areas (referred to as agglomerations), major roads, railways and airports.  The current third round of Noise maps are due to be updated this month and officials from my department have been actively involved in this process with the EPA and other national bodies.</p><p>Secondly, based on the results of the mapping process, the Regulations require the preparation of noise action plans for each area concerned.  The fundamental objective of action plans is the prevention and reduction of environmental noise.  Action plans based on the 3rd round Noise Maps will be prepared by designated action planning authorities in 2018. </p><p>For national road schemes, potential noise emissions are addressed as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process undertaken by, or on behalf of, the Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  TII have published Good Practice Guidance for the Treatment of Noise during the Planning of National Road Schemes which can be accessed at the TII website - <i>.</i></p></reply>

The scheme provides energy efficiency upgrades free of charge to people who meet the eligibility criteria.  Typical measures available under the scheme include attic and cavity wall insulation, draught proofing, lagging jackets and low energy light bulbs.  To date the scheme has provided energy efficiency upgrades to 120,000 homes.</p>  <p>  Since the scheme is 100% Exchequer funded it is designed to be available only to those in most need of Government assistance.  To determine this with complete accuracy SEAI would need to know the condition of a person's home, including its energy efficiency level and heating system, that person's family circumstances and their household income level.  However, it would not be practical or efficient for SEAI to perform this assessment for each applicant to the Warmer Homes scheme.  Therefore eligibility for the scheme is determined through the use of proxy indicators, principally the National Fuel Allowance.  These proxy indicators provide an acceptable approximation that allows SEAI to find and identify people in energy poverty without having to resort to a cumbersome, expensive and intrusive administrative regime.</p>  <p>  Eligibility for the National Fuel Allowance is determined by the Department of Social Protection through use of a means tested income assessment. Everyone in receipt of a non-contributory state payment is accepted as satisfying the means test.  In addition, if a person is on an employment support scheme or getting a Back to Education Allowance they are entitled to the Fuel Allowance.  Any household with a combined weekly income of up to &euro;100 above the maximum State Pension (Contributory) is also eligible for the Fuel Allowance.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Fuel Allowance, anyone in receipt of the Family Income Supplement, Job Seekers Allowance for over six months (and with children under 7 years of age) or anyone in receipt of the One Parent Family Payment is also eligible for the Warmer Homes scheme.</p>  <p>  These additional eligibility criteria were selected as there are health and well-being consequences to living in a cold and damp home and children can often be particularly vulnerable to these conditions.  In addition, lone parent families suffer from a particularly high deprivation rate in Ireland.  In the Government's Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty, I have committed to ensuring that the eligibility criteria for the Warmer Homes scheme remain consistent with the latest findings on deprivation in Ireland.  This is consistent with the aim of ensuring that the limited resources available to the scheme are targeted at those in most need.</p></reply>

Besides being a pollutant in its own right, ammonia also reacts with other substances in the atmosphere to produce further pollutants such as particulate matter.</p>  <p>  As Minister for the Environment, I am committed to examining ways of reducing pollution from all sectors.  In this regard, my Department recently completed a public consultation process as an initial step in producing the first ever National Clean Air Strategy. This Strategy will provide the framework for a set of cross-Government policies and actions to reduce harmful emissions and improve air quality and public health to meet current and future EU and international obligations.  A document entitled &lsquo;Cleaning Our Air&rsquo; was published as part of this process which explored the impact of a number of sectors, including agriculture. The purpose of the document was to initiate discussion and ascertain the views of the various stakeholders while providing a background to the numerous approaches to improving air quality. To facilitate a structured response, a series of questions were set out at the end of each chapter. At the end of the chapter on the agricultural sector the question was posed &lsquo;Should a future end date on the use of splash plate slurry spreading be considered following the completion of schemes to incentivise low emission alternatives?&rsquo;  This question should not  be construed as a &lsquo;suggestion&rsquo; or indeed a policy intent either by myself or my Department. It was simply asked as an enabler to ascertain the views of relevant stakeholders but has been mistakenly taken, by some commentators, to reflect a policy proposal.</p>  <p>  My officials are currently conducting a thorough examination of all submissions received through the consultation phase and are engaging in a series of detailed bilateral discussions to ascertain the views of the key stakeholders. I would stress that no changes to existing practices have been proposed at this point.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, I understand that as a result of farmer demand to improve the utilisation of slurry as a fertiliser, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is assisting almost 950 farmers in the purchase of Low Emission Slurry Spreading equipment under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS).  I also understand that more than 4,750 farmers have applied under the Green, Low-Carbon, Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) to apply slurry using low emission equipment. In addition, the Association of Farm and Forestry Contractors of Ireland have recently also identified their support for this technology.</p></reply>

If you have not received a further reply within 10 working days please contact my office.</p><p>The Programme for Partnership Government commits to making additional funding available for greenways into the future and I am pursuing this in the context of the mid-term review of the Capital Plan.  When the capital plan review is finalised and there is clarity on the totality of the funding that will be available for greenways in the coming years, my Department will issue further funding calls and local authorities would then be able to submit projects for funding.</p><p>My Department's advice to all local authorities wishing to progress greenway projects is to advance the planning and design elements to the greatest degree possible so as to be best placed in the event of future funding calls.  Clarity on land ownership and access is also very important. The Deputy may be aware that I recently launched a public consultation process to inform the development of my Department's new Strategy for the future development of greenways.  A public consultation paper is available on my Department's website http:<i>//www.dttas.ie/public-transport/publications/english/greenways</i>.  All interested parties are invited to make submissions by 14 July, 2017 and I would welcome your views as part of this process.</p></reply>

There is plenty of evidence available for the scale of drink driving, quite independently of the figures for preliminary breath tests, to which the Deputy refers.  RSA research, published in 2016, indicates that alcohol was a contributory factor in 38% of fatal collisions in the period 2008 to 2012.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's six-week campaign during the last Christmas period resulted in 961 arrests for drink-driving, representing a 35% increase in arrests over the same period in 2015.  This clearly illustrates that drink driving remains a significant road safety issue in Ireland that needs to be addressed urgently.</p>  <p>  For these reasons I am bringing forward a Bill to Cabinet for approval next week, which will ensure that all those detected drink driving receive an automatic disqualification from driving.  This means removing the privilege currently afforded to certain drivers of receiving penalty points as an alternative to disqualification under section 29 of the Road Traffic Act 2010.</p>  <p>  Last November I began a mid-term review of the Road Safety Strategy 2013-2020 to examine the Strategy to ensure its effectiveness is maximised in combatting the causes of road fatalities and serious injuries.  I expect to receive a draft of the review from the Road Safety Authority for my consideration shortly.  I have increased the frequency of meetings of the Ministerial Committee on Road Safety, from twice yearly to every couple of months, with the next meeting later this month when I will again review our road safety interventions including regarding drink driving to ensure everything possible is done to reduce the incidences of deaths and serious injuries on our roads.</p></reply>

A significant amount of on-road cycling facilities are also provided as part of the work on developing the bus network in the GDA.</p>  <p>  The NTA also manages a similar sustainable transport grants programme under the Regional Cities Programme in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the need for more and better cycling infrastructure and I am seeking additional funding for cycling initiatives under the mid-term review of the Capital Plan.</p>  <p>  However, infrastructure is only part of the solution.  How all road users behave is also important.  I understand from the Road Safety Authority (RSA) that the deaths of people cycling in recent years have been spread across urban and rural locations and on every type of road (National, Regional, Local).  While we all are free to use the road safely, we also all have the responsibility to ensure that our driving or cycling does not impact on that.  It is up to all road users to be attentive and the RSA have highlighted the dangers of distracted driving and the importance of passing cyclists at a reasonable distance.</p>  <p>  I intend, with the RSA, to further highlight the need for all road users to take account of the vulnerability of cyclists in the coming weeks, as I am conscious that the numbers of people cycling generally peaks at this time of the year.</p></reply>

The report of the Representative Group which was accepted by the Minister suggested that, if anything, the role of TII in respect of speed limits on national roads should in certain circumstances be strengthened with a view to better managing and protecting the national road network from, among other things, inappropriate development.  It should also be noted that TII maintain detailed records of traffic collisions, including fatalities and serious injuries, on the national road network and use them to identify where works are needed for safety reasons.

In such a scenario, the EU Commission have indicated that a business case, justifying the proposed higher aid rate, would have to be approved by them. Clearly, the EU Commission view any support above the 75% level as an exception, rather than the norm.</p><p>The airport authorities at Knock have indicated that, even at the maximum 75% level of capital support allowed for under the EU Guidelines, they believe that it will be difficult for them to finance the proposed project to upgrade and resurface the runway at the airport and they are seeking a 90% State aid contribution towards this project.</p><p>The final business case for this project that has been prepared by the airport authorities in Knock was received by my Department only last week and the relevant officials are currently engaging with their counterparts in the EU Commission as to how best to advance this application for approval for the higher funding rate.</p></reply>

The scheme seeks to avail of five categories under Commission Regulation (EU) No. 651/2014 of 17 June 2014 declaring certain categories of aid compatible with the internal market in application of Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty (the &quot;General Block Exemption Regulation&quot;).</p><p>The categories are:</p><p>- Regional Investment Aid;</p><p>- Culture and Heritage Conservation and Consultancy Aid in the Context of Culture and Heritage Conservation;</p><p>- Aid for Sport and Multi-Functional Leisure Facilities;</p><p>- Local Infrastructure Aid;</p><p>- Consultancy Aid to SMEs.</p><p>In May of this year the EU Commission announced amendments to the EU General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER). The revision of this Regulation was subject to two public consultations by the EU Commission with various stakeholders and Member States and Ireland participated in those consultations.  The GBER Regulation exempts certain categories of State aid from the requirement of prior notification to the Commission, if these are unlikely to distort competition in the Single Market.  The revisions will have limited impact for our regional airports since Ireland already received State-aid clearance from the EU Commission in 2015 for our current, five-year, Regional Airports Programme 2015-2019. However, one new concession (for airports that handle less than 200,000 passengers annually) in the revised GBER regime that would be relevant to the airports in Donegal and Waterford is that they would be eligible for aid towards operating losses, if incurred.  In practice, Waterford is already eligible for this kind of operational support under our current Regional Airports Programme.</p><p>As I outlined in a separate reply  today to the Deputy (Ref No: 31009/17), officials in my Department are also currently engaging with their counterparts in the EU Commission as to how best to advance an application by the authorities in Knock airport for approval for a 90% State aid contribution towards a project to upgrade and resurface the runway at the airport.</p></reply>

Cavan County Council also submitted an application for the Ballinamore to Belturbet greenway along the Cavan to Leitrim Railway.  Unfortunately these proposals did not secure funding at that time, due to the significant over-subscription for funding.  Leitrim County Council were also unsuccessful in their application for funding under the INTERREG VA ERDF Programme.</p><p>The Programme for Partnership Government commits to making additional funding available for greenways into the future and I am pursuing this in the context of the mid-term review of the Capital Plan.  When the capital plan review is finalised and there is clarity on the totality of the funding that will be available for greenways in the coming years, my Department will issue further funding calls and local authorities would then be able to submit projects for funding.  My Department's advice to all local authorities wishing to progress greenway projects is to advance the planning and design elements to the greatest degree possible so as to be best placed in the event of future funding calls. Clarity on ownership of routes and agreement on access is also very important in this regard.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that I recently launched a public consultation process to inform the development of my Department's new Strategy for the future development of greenways.  A public consultation paper is available on my Department's website, .  All interested parties are invited to make submissions by 14 July, 2017 and I would welcome your views as part of this process.</p></reply>

The matter has been discussed at the Early Years Forum which I chair, and in other fora with my Department.</p><p>We are working with the Department of Education and Skills to develop a new Early Years workforce plan.  This will examine workforce supply issues. </p><p>I am also aware that pay and conditions of staff is a significant barrier to retaining staff in the sector.  Whilst my Department is not an employer of childcare workers, we are a significant funder. I am committed to the development of high quality services in this country and it has been proven that high quality care is dependent on a workforce that feels valued.  My Department is working with the sector to explore how we can improve retention rates.  The Programme for Government contains 14 commitments to improving access to high quality, affordable childcare.  The Affordable Childcare Scheme, which is currently under development, will provide an important infrastructure for future investment in the Early Years sector.</p><p>  It is clear that we need to focus collaboratively on how best to make the early years sector a more attractive and personally rewarding place in which to work.  I think that pay is only one issue, although, clearly an important one.  The fact that we are investing considerably increased resources in the sector will also be important.  In Budget 2017 I secured a 35% increase in childcare funding, up by &euro;120m to &euro;466m.  This was on top of a 35% increase in Budget 2016 also. </p><p>  These increases reflect the emphasis I am placing on developing a quality service with appropriately supported staff.  In this regard, the City &amp;amp; County Childcare Committees are assisting services who experience difficulties in recruiting or retaining staff, and the Learner Funds are in place to support staff in achieving minimum qualification requirements, both regulatory and contractual. </p><p>  The existing workforce are a significant resource and substantial investment in upskilling and CPD opportunities for early years practitioners has been put in to the sector by my Department, e.g. through the Learner Fund, the National S&iacute;olta Aistear Initiative and the Leadership for Inclusion in Early Years Settings, known as LINC under the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM).  The Department of Education and Skills (DES) are undertaking a review of education programmes in Early Childhood Education and Care to ensure that the quality and content of further and higher education programmes prepare early years professionals for practice in the sector.  My Department welcomes this work including the recent establishment of a Working Group chaired by DES that has been tasked with the development of a draft set of Criteria and Guidelines for higher education programmes that offer Initial Professional Education for early years professionals, that will be available for wider consultation with the sector before the end of the year.  </p><p>  Childcare workers are part of a growing sector, which the Government is strongly supporting.  I believe that by working together we can ensure that it is a viable and strong sector which makes a significant contribution to the care and personal development of our children. </p></reply>

Through its Educational Welfare Service, the Agency responds to instances where children, including children from the Traveller community, are not attending school regularly, leading to concerns for their educational welfare. </p><p>I am advised that the Department of Education policy in relation to Traveller Education is informed by the Report and Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy which was launched in 2006 following wide ranging consultation with Traveller representative groups and other relevant stakeholders.  The principle of inclusion is at the core of the Strategy.  The focus of both current and future provision is on the development of an inclusive school environment through the whole school planning process, teaching practice, admissions policies, codes of behaviour and whole school evaluation.  In keeping with this principle, additional resources provided in the education system for children are allocated on the basis of identified individual educational need.  This includes Traveller children who require additional resources based on need and not on their identity as Travellers.  Segregated Traveller specific programmes such as the Visiting Teacher for Travellers were phased out in line with the principle of inclusion.</p><p>I am further advised by the Department of Education and Skills that funding for special education in provision in 2017 will amount to some &euro;1.68 billion, which is equivalent to approximately 19% of the gross overall current allocation for education and training and represents an increase in spending in this area of 12% over the last two years.  This funding provides for a range of supports and services including additional learning and resource teaching support, access to SNA support, special transport arrangements, building adaptations, enhanced capitation in special schools and special classes, specialised equipment, additional teacher training and the services of the National Educational Psychological Service.</p><p>There are currently over 12,500 learning support and resource teacher posts in mainstream primary and post primary schools.</p><p>School attendance is one of the critical building blocks of positive educational outcomes.  While educational outcomes for Traveller children continue to improve, in most areas attendance still falls well behind the national average and we are aware that there are still areas where attendance and participation among Traveller children is not improving consistently.  Following the launch of the 2017 National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy, my Department is committed to working with the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Justice and Equality, Tusla Educational Welfare Services and Traveller and Roma representative groups to examine ways in which Traveller children&rsquo;s attendance and participation may be further enhanced especially in areas where attendance is of greatest concern. </p></reply>

The schemes support the provision of youth services for young people who are at risk of drugs, alcohol misuse, early school leaving, homelessness or who are living in disadvantaged communities.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of a complex area to do with the impact youth service provision has in young people&rsquo;s lives.  Overall, the review found that the youth programmes can provide a significant contribution to improving outcomes for young people and should be considered for on-going public funding.  The review makes a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead to ensure an evidence-based and outcomes focussed programme designed to secure the optimal outcomes for young people. </p>  <p>  The implementation of the recommendations in the review have commenced over the course of 2015, 2016 and this year.  The National Youth Strategy Lead Team, established in July 2016, has a specific sub-group to support implementation of the VFMPR.  My Department has initiated a detailed consultation at national and regional level with the youth sector and providers of youth services about the review's findings and recommendations.  Consultations have taken place with the national youth organisation, local youth services and youth officers of the Education and Training Boards that administer funding on behalf of my Department, and with other youth interests.  A youth consultation process is also underway to inform the development of the VFMPR implementation.</p>  <p>  To facilitate the review&rsquo;s recommendations regarding the future development of a single targeted youth funding programme to replace the current schemes, I have given approval for funding to be provided for the establishment of several sample projects in 2016 and 2017.  These sample projects will provide youth services in areas of need as identified by the Education and Training Boards with responsibility for those regions.</p>  <p>  In implementing another of the review&rsquo;s recommendations, my Department embarked on an exercise, in conjunction with Pobal and each Education and Training Board Youth Officer, to map youth service provision across the State. This mapping exercise will assist my Department and the relevant Education and Training Board in developing a detailed social demographic profile in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels, particularly as the Census 2016 data becomes available. Following extensive work by those involved, this exercise is now in its final stage. It remains my intention that this mapping exercise will inform future development and investment in youth services. The map will available to view on Pobal's website from September.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-04a.1452.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017070400082#WRY02500"><p>The Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS) will be open equally to any Tusla-registered childcare provider, including both centre based providers and home based childminders. Facilitating parental choice of childcare provider is a key objective of the ACS, and the equal inclusion of childminders is therefore a central feature.  For this reason it is incorrect to say that the ACS favours day care over other childcare choices. </p>  <p>  I acknowledge that the number of Tusla-registered childminders is still small.  However, I established a working group to make recommendations on how to support the development of childminding in the short, medium and long term, and I hope to build on that group's work in supporting a larger number of childminders to become registered and to participate in the ACS over the years ahead. </p>  <p>  The Affordable Childcare Scheme provides financial supports for paid childcare rather than care by parents or relatives.  However, the specific purpose of the ACS is to reduce the cost of childcare to parents, and it must be seen in the wider context of other policy measures that are aimed at supporting parents who choose to care for their children at home. </p>  <p>  In this regard it should be noted that, according to the European Commission, childcare costs in Ireland are currently the highest in the EU for lone parents and the second highest for couples, and the European Commission has, for several years, been recommending action by the Irish Government to address the high cost of childcare, both to support labour market participation of parents and to help reduce child poverty. </p>  <p>  Supports for parents who choose to care for their children at home include the Home Carer Tax Credit, which was increased in the last Budget, as well as provisions for maternity benefit, parental leave and the recently introduced paternity leave.  It should be noted that the Programme for Government commits to extending paid leave for parents in the first year of a child's life, which will be a key financial support enabling parents to care for their children at home in the critical first year.</p></reply>

This additional investment is being provided in regions of the country where there is a pressing need for services to meet the needs of young people. </p>  <p>  Each of the sixteen Education and Training Boards, including Dublin and Dun Laoghaire ETB, was invited to nominate locations within their catchment areas for the establishment of new services and to nominate a project or service to be considered for augmentation.

This figure currently represents 102,000 children.</p><p><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>is a whole of government policy framework, which requires all Departments and Agencies to work collaboratively to improve outcomes for children and young people.  The Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Consortium, which I chair, has responsibility for whole of government implementation, and includes representatives from all government Departments and Agencies. </p><p>The Department of Social Protection has the lead role in coordinating government strategies on child poverty.  It also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion and has identified child poverty as a key cross-sectoral priority to be addressed.</p><p>Officials in my Department are working closely with the Department of Social Protection in informing the development of this cross-sectoral priority. </p><p>Officials in the Department of Social Protection have co-convened a subgroup with members of the Advisory Council for <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures </i>to progress solutions to child poverty. </p><p>In recognition of the fact that child poverty is a multi-faceted problem, this group also includes officials from other Departments, including the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>Led by the Department of Social Protection, this group has developed a paper which outlines a whole of government approach to tackling child poverty.  This is based around the three pillars outlined in the EU Recommendation on Investing in Children:</p><p>- Access to adequate resources</p><p>- Access to affordable, quality services</p><p>- Children&rsquo;s right to participate.</p><p>Key priorities arising from this include providing universal access to GP care for under 18s, reducing the cost of education, housing, affordable childcare, labour activation and provision of in-work benefits.</p><p>In line with this, my Department is developing a Single Affordable Childcare Scheme to provide families with quality childcare at a cost they can afford.  Budget 2017 provided additional funding for the scheme&rsquo;s development and initial roll-out, to include both a targeted and a universal element.  Subsidies will be available for children aged from 6 months up to 15 years and will meet families&rsquo; full-time and part-time childcare needs, including outside of school hours and during school holiday time.  The highest levels of subsidy will be provided to those on low incomes, helping families to overcome disadvantage and contribute to a reduction in child poverty.</p><p>The Advisory Council held a round table event on 22 June with a range of key experts and stakeholders.  The learning from this event will inform the further alignment of efforts across government and from civil society.</p><p>My Department has also established a Children&rsquo;s Equality Commission to ensure that the voices of children who experience or understand economic hardship or poverty are directly heard and acted on by policy-makers.  The Commission will be comprised of Child Commissioners and Adult Commissioners.  The Child Commissioners are children who experience or have an understanding of economic hardship or poverty.

This document sets out the approach of the Government to the negotiations, following the successful campaign to have key Irish issues recognised in the EU negotiation position.</p><p>  Following on from this publication, work is underway to prepare a further paper on economic implications of the Brexit challenge.  This will draw on the work to date across Departments, which will be developed to mitigate emerging sectoral challenges.  These plans will build on ongoing cross-Government research, analysis and consultations with stakeholders, and will reflect the core economic themes of the Taoiseach's speech to the IIEA on 15 February last.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests lie firmly in a strong and well-functioning EU with continued and unfettered access to the single market.  There is a lot of negotiation to be done around trading arrangements.  Our contingency work is examining all scenarios and we cannot pre-empt the outcome at this stage.  We are not under any illusions about the complexity of these negotiations and are engaged in detailed planning in relation to these.  That said, it has been a good start to the negotiations - which will, without doubt - be lengthy and difficult.</p><p>  In January of this year, I hosted a sectoral dialogue with children, young people and key stakeholders in Croke Park at which the views of all interested parties were captured. Since then, the Advisory Council to Better Outcomes Brighter Futures; the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014 - 2020 has considered the report of the event and work is ongoing in relation to the more detailed implications of Brexit.  Furthermore, matters in relation to Brexit were discussed by over 100 children and young people in April of this year as part of the annual regional Comhairle na n&Oacute;g Networking events.  This has enabled my Department to table those issues which may impact on children and young people, post-Brexit, and indeed identify those issues which resonate most strongly with our youngest citizens.  However, it must be stated that such matters are subsets of much larger items which will be considered, in the main, in conjunction with colleagues in the Departments of Finance, Justice and Equality, Education and Health as part of the wider negotiating process.  Accordingly, given the limited impact of Brexit on my Department, there is not the requirement to resource a dedicated Brexit Unit.  However, while a dedicated unit is not needed, my Department continues to engage with all relevant structures and communication channels &ndash; coordinated by the Department of An Taoiseach.</p></reply>

Much of this data will feature in my Department's forthcoming publication of an indicator set to track the progress for children and young people aged 0-24, across the five outcomes outlined in Better Outcomes Brighter Futures (BOBF) and some is already utilised as contextual data in the Department's biennial publication - State of the Nations Children.</p><p>As part of the Quality and Capacity Building Initiative (QCBI) my Department has invested in Tusla's Outcomes for Children Project.

The data hub will utilise all relevant published and other data including CSO, SAHRU, Pobal, HSE, TUSLA, DES, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na <i>et al</i>, to ensure system users have access to quality information that will inform children services planning.</p><p>It is envisaged that through the development of the open platform and the related extensive training and capacity building provided by Tusla, that CYSPC across the country will utilise the data gathered, including census data, to optimally plan children's services.</p><p>CYPSC, as part of their three year planning cycle also use socio and demographic data and census data to plan for delivery of services in their local area.</p><p>In 2016, my Department embarked on an exercise, in conjunction with Pobal and each Education and Training Board Youth Officer, to map youth service provision across the State.  This mapping exercise will assist my Department and the relevant Education and Training Board, in developing a detailed social demographic profile in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels; particularly as the Census 2016 data becomes available.  The exercise is now in its final stage and it is my intention that this mapping exercise will inform future development and investment in youth services.</p></reply>

I wish to assure the Deputy that with the current available staff all urgent and emergency cases, such as situations of abandonment, allegations of physical and sexual abuse, parental ill-health and the need to find an immediate placement, or a threat to the safety or life of a child by a third party, are dealt with immediately.  My Department also provides oversight to ensure that the quality and performance of social work service is maintained to deal with service demands.</p>  <p>  I am aware also that to ensure Tusla staff are able to support children and families it is the organisation's policy to ensure all staff are trained in Child Protection and Children First guidelines and staff attend a broad range of Child Protection Training including:</p>  <p>  - Core Court Room Skills </p>  <p>  - Introduction to Court Skills </p>  <p>  - Domestic Sexual &amp;amp; Gender Based Violence (DSGBV) &ndash; Awareness &amp;amp; Response </p>  <p>  - Practice Development for Newly Appointed Social workers </p>  <p>  - Supervision - Making the most of Supervision for Supervisees</p>  <p>  - Supervision - Staff Supervision Skills Training for Supervisors</p>  <p>  - Foundations for Assessment</p>  <p>  - Evidence Informed Practitioner Programme</p>  <p>  - Legal Briefing Seminar</p>  <p>  However, I am very mindful of the correlation between recruitment and cases where a child does not have a dedicated social worker and the need for Tusla to closely link its recruitment programme with operational decisions to effect improvements.  As part of my regular engagement with the Board, I have requested that the Agency provides me with an assessment of recruitment for the remainder of 2017, linked to specific targets to reduce the number of children awaiting allocation of a dedicated social worker.  I have requested that Tusla develops a robust workforce plan which addresses succession planning, retention, career pathways, training and development, future workforce needs, priority gaps and a strategy for tackling the priority gaps and reducing unallocated cases. </p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s 2017 recruitment target is 369 additional staff across its grades.  Tusla&rsquo;s social work target for the end of 2017 is 1,520 whole time equivalent and Tusla appears to be on track to meet this target.  However, it is unlikely that 1,520 WTE social workers will be sufficient to execute Tusla&rsquo;s current and future responsibilities without changes to the composition of Tusla social work teams.  Accordingly, Tusla is evaluating management and staff skills mix with a view to service enhancement, including reviewing the roles of family support workers; social care workers in the community; and administrative structures to support the delivery of more efficient and cost effective services.  Part of the evaluation also includes looking at enhanced job roles, increasing multi-disciplinary team-working in an effort to alleviate pressure; redesigning tasks; and promoting greater efficiency in working.</p>  <p>  Tusla has also appointed a dedicated Workforce Planner to work closely with Tusla services/operations with a view to identifying the areas&rsquo; required resource mix reflecting the ongoing challenge of recruiting social workers and the potential for more social care workers, family support etc.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the Exchequer funding of &euro;713m in 2017 will provide Tusla with significantly increased capacity to respond to areas of identified risk and anticipated demand and to progress a number of key service developments which will ensure better outcomes for vulnerable children, and families, who need our services and support.</p></reply>

Tusla	 provides a continuum of care supports and interventions for 'at risk' children and their families, including early intervention and prevention services, family support services and community based services, such as Meitheal.</p>  <p>  The State only intervenes in family life in exceptional cases.  However, if there is a child protection concern, Tusla can investigate and take the child into care if necessary.  The immediate safety of the child is the first consideration.  When necessary, an initial assessment will take place.  This assessment identifies the risk and protective factors in each given situation so that informed decisions and recommendations can be made. </p>  <p>  Based on the information available, the duty social worker, in conjunction with the team leader, gives the case a priority level of high, medium and low, depending on the risk identified in the information available.  Following the initial assessment, the case remains with the duty team, who monitor risk, while awaiting its allocation to a social worker.  The priority level may change where new information shows an increased or decreased risk to the child.</p>  <p>  If a report to the social work department indicates immediate and serious risk, urgent action must be taken to protect the child and in this instance a child may be placed in care.  The separation of children from their parents is only considered when all alternative means of protection have been exhausted.</p>  <p>  In 2017, Tusla has been allocated Exchequer funding of &euro;713 million to extend and improve the services it provides.  This represents an increase of &euro;37 million from 2016.</p></reply>

Each referral received by Tusla is assessed and dealt with on an individual basis by the relevant social work team.  In March 2017, Tusla informs me that there are 6,308 children in the care of the State.  Of these the vast majority, (5,819) are in foster care, while 489 are in residential care or other types of care.</p>  <p>  There are safeguards surrounding each child care placement, whether foster or residential care.  Placements are supervised by a professionally qualified social worker, and the provision of care services is monitored by Tusla management and is subject to inspections by the Health Information Quality Authority and by Tusla Registration Services.  Tusla is also aware of and  alert to the possibility of child on child abuse in care settings, and has processes in place to deal appropriately with such incidents. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should also be aware that children in care have access to independent advocacy supports, such as the organisation Empowering People in Care, or EPIC.  Children in care also have access to the complaints mechanism in Tulsa, and may make complaints, or be assisted to make complaints, about their care to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children . </p>  <p>  There is, however, no room for complacency about our safeguarding measures, and they are under constant review to ensure that they are effective.</p></reply>

This covers child welfare protection matters for children in emergency accommodation.  It is fully operational in the DRHE area and it is intended to extend it to Galway, Limerick and Cork this year. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the State only intervenes in family life in exceptional cases.  Children who are with their families in emergency accommodation remain in the care of their parent or guardian.  If there is a specific child protection concern, Tusla can investigate and take the child into care if necessary.  The reporting of any such concerns to Tusla is governed by Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children.  Where there are no welfare or protection concerns, Tusla&rsquo;s role is to provide family support, where this is required.</p>  <p>  Tusla is providing additional supports to assist families in emergency accommodation.  It funds child support workers for this purpose and has also appointed a Homelessness Liaison Officer.  My own Department is providing free child care for homeless children in the Dublin area for up to 25 hours a week.  Our Family Resource Centres (FRCs) are working with people who are experiencing homelessness.  Many FRCs have already developed a local response to the needs of families in emergency accommodation.  These include, for example, family fun days, homework support, after-school programmes, play therapy and transport services.  Tusla will be developing a reporting mechanism this year to record the extent of homeless work in the Family Resource Centres.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the difficulties associated with homelessness and school attendance, the Educational Welfare Office (EWO) offers a number of supports to children and their families.  The DRHE has also arranged Leap cards for homeless families in Dublin to facilitate family days out and for school journeys.</p>  <p>  It is of the utmost importance that we minimise the impact of homelessness on children and offer families comprehensive supportive measures, while ultimately working towards eradicating homelessness in Ireland.</p></reply>

Tusla also provides funding to voluntary organisations offering a range of counselling and support services to children and families, including marriage and relationship counselling, child counselling, bereavement counselling and peer support programmes. </p>  <p>  Key elements of the support provided to children at risk  may include referral and advocacy for access to specialist services to meet the child&rsquo;s identified needs as part of their care plan, such as speech and language therapy, counselling and psychology services.  Children may need to be referred to the child and adolescent mental health teams (CAMHS) and primary care psychology services provided by the Health Service Executive.

The Government has provided &euro;4.6 million for the scheme in 2017. </p>  <p>  There are currently approximately 3,100 persons in receipt of the diet supplement of which 15 are aged 22 years and under (of which 3 are aged 18 years and under).  Department records do not indicate the education status of these young people.  Diet supplement can be paid to a recipient in respect of a qualified child or qualified adult, however, statistics are not available on these cases, including details of their age or education status.   </p>  <p>  Following the outcome of a review of the costs of healthy eating and specialised diets by the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute commissioned by the Department during 2013, the scheme has been closed to new applicants from 1 February 2014.  This independent research showed that the average costs across all of the retail outlets of the diets supplemented under the scheme can be met from within one third of the minimum personal rate of social welfare payment, i.e. the SWA rate which was then paid at &euro;186 per week.  The weekly rate of SWA has recently increased to &euro;191 further to Budget 2017.  The diet supplement scheme was discontinued for new applicants on the basis of this evidence and I have no plans to reverse this decision.</p>  <p>  Existing recipients continue to receive the diet supplement at the current rate of payment for as long as they continue to have an entitlement to the scheme or until their circumstances change.  This measure ensured that nobody was immediately worse off by the closure of the scheme. </p>  <p>  In cases of particular hardship, officials continue to have the legislative power to award a SWA payment in cases of exceptional need.  Any person who considers that they may have an entitlement to financial support should contact the Community Welfare Service at their local Intreo centre who may be able to offer assistance.   </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

FIS is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.  The estimated expenditure on FIS in 2017 is approximately &euro;422 million and it is currently paid to almost 57,000 families in respect of some 126,000 children.</p><p>To qualify for FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria.  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p><p>The &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; eligibility criterion has been reduced significantly since the introduction of the scheme in 1984, from 30 hours per week to 19 hours per week in 1996. Further reducing the &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; requirement would have potentially significant expenditure implications. </p><p>For low income workers with less than the minimum hours of employment for FIS and working on a casual basis up to and including 3 days per week, jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes provide in-work income support through daily disregards and tapered withdrawal of payments.</p><p>The number of families who are working between 15-18 hours and are earning below the relevant FIS thresholds is currently unknown. </p><p>Reducing the numbers of hours worked required to access FIS from 19 to 15 could have a number of behavioural effects including:-</p><p>-  reducing the incentive to increase part-time hours;</p><p>-  resulting in recipients on the minimum 19 hours threshold reducing their hours of work; and</p><p>-  a reduction in the &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; criteria might attract new recipients currently on higher wages above the FIS threshold, who might decide to reduce their hours in order to qualify.</p><p>Under EU regulations FIS is defined as a family benefit and is exportable in cases where the claimant is working in Ireland but where the children are living abroad.My Department hasno way of predicting with any degree of accuracy the potential in-flow from this category.  </p><p>For all of the reasons above my Department has no way of accurately estimating the cost of reducing the numbers of hours worked required to access FIS from 19 to 15 hours.  </p><p>Reducing the &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; requirement would have implications for existing working age schemes.  Under jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance a person may, subject to scheme criteria, work for up to three days and continue to receive support under the schemes. </p><p>Lowering the &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; threshold could also create the risk that FIS would end up inadvertently subsidising unsustainably low earnings and contributing to an increase in the levels of precarious employment.</p></reply>

This policy objective prioritises resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments - Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit or Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance - that are conditional on the recipient being actively seeking and available for employment, as well as, in the case of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, meeting a means test.  The employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people. </p>  <p>  Many other services are also available to people who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.  For example, employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s Intreo offices regardless of their social welfare status.</p>  <p>  Unemployed persons not in receipt of qualifying payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through ETB training for unemployed people, but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course.  An unemployed person who does not qualify for a social welfare payment due to the assessment of their means may be eligible to sign for social insurance contribution credits.  Persons signing on for credits for 12 months or longer over the previous 18 months are entitled to participate on Momentum courses through Solas, provided that they have been actively seeking work, however they will not receive any payment.  Persons signing for credits for six months or more are entitled to participate on ETB-run VTOS courses subject to availability.  In the case of VTOS courses, participants do not receive a training allowance but may receive travel and lunch allowances.  Springboard and Skillnets courses for unemployed people, funded through the Department of Education and Skills, are also open to people regardless of their social welfare status.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Qualified Adult Dependent of a person in receipt of one of the qualifying payments for BTEA purposes may be approved for BTEA provided they establish an entitlement to a BTEA qualifying payment in their own right and subject to satisfying all other BTEA conditions.  Those in receipt of a number of other qualifying payments (including One-Parent Family Payment and Disability Allowance) may be approved for BTEA subject to satisfying all BTEA conditions.</p>  <p>  Action 26.5 of the current Pathways to Work Strategy commits to examining the supports required to facilitate greater participation by people with disabilities, single parents, qualified adults and individuals in need of greater support in education and training.  Having reviewed this action, the Department is satisfied at present that existing supports are sufficient but will continue to review the situation in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills and SOLAS.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to supporting as many people as possible to participate more fully in employment and to become more self-sufficient by providing supports that address barriers they may encounter in finding and sustaining employment.</p></reply>

This began in January 2014 with the standardising of State pension age for all at 66 years and the cessation of State pension transition.  The State pension age will increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.</p>  <p>  Where a person exits the workforce before reaching State pension age they may apply for either the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments are paid to eligible jobseekers aged 18 to 66 years and all recipients of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment are subject to the rules of the scheme.</p>  <p>  People in receipt of a jobseeker's payment must engage with my Department's activation measures and can face sanctions if they fail to do so.  However, from January 2014 these criteria were eased for people aged 62 and over, such that they are not obliged to engage with the activation process.  They are still able to voluntarily avail of an array of supports, which are available from my Department if they wish to return to work, training or education.  Furthermore the majority of these individuals will have to register with their local office only once a year and their payments will be paid directly into their bank accounts. </p>  <p>  Once a person has exhausted their entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit they may be eligible for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, subject to the means test and other qualifying conditions.  However, someone claiming jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit from a date after their 65th birthday continues to be eligible for that payment until reaching State pension age.</p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability.  Child Benefit is currently paid to around 626,525 families in respect of over 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of over &euro;2 billion in 2017. </p>  <p>  Budget 2009 reduced the age for eligibility for Child Benefit from 19 years to less than 18 years.  A value for money review of child income supports, published by the Department of Social Protection in 2010, found that the participation pattern of children in education supports the current age limit for Child Benefit. </p>  <p>  It is not possible to give the full year estimated cost of making Child Benefit payable to families with children over 18 years of age and still at secondary school as according to data from the Department of Education and Skills there are people still attending second level institutions up to 21 years and over.   </p>  <p>  Families on low incomes can already avail of a number of provisions to social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22 years, including: </p>  <p>  - qualified child increases (IQCs) with primary social welfare payments;</p>  <p>  - family income supplement (FIS) for low-paid employees with children;</p>  <p>  - the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for low income families (paid at the full-time second level education rate). </p>  <p>  These schemes provide targeted assistance that is directly linked with household income and thereby support low-income families with older children participating in full-time education. </p>  <p>  Given the universal nature of Child Benefit making Child Benefit payable to families with children over 18 years of age and still in secondary school would not be a targeted approach. Any decision to would have to be considered in the overall budgetary and policy context.

The 2017 payment rates have been increased from &euro;100 to &euro;125 for children aged 4 to 11 years and from &euro;200 to &euro;250 for children aged 12 years and over and attending secondary school.  The additional funding for the increase in rates brings the total allocation for the allowance this year to &euro;47.4 million, an increase of &euro;10 million on what was originally provided.  </p><p>Similar to arrangements in previous years, the majority of payments under this scheme will be paid with no application form required.

It is an educational opportunities scheme for persons in receipt of certain qualifying social welfare payments wishing to pursue second or third-level courses of education in order to improve their employment prospects.  </p>  <p>  Entitlement to BTEA is conditional on having an on-going entitlement to the qualifying scheme payment.  The scheme has been amended in recent years to ensure that the conditions are in line with the qualifying payment.  As a result, BTEA participants with eligibility based on jobseekers, transitional jobseekers or one parent family payments, who engage in part-time work, will be assessed in accordance with their primary payment.  This measure ensures that only participants who continue to satisfy the means test of their primary payment will continue to receive income support under the allowance and that resources are directed at those most in need of assistance.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the BTEA was never intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third-level education system.  The student universal support Ireland (SUSI) grant, payable by the Department of Education and Skills, represents the primary support for persons pursuing education. </p>  <p>  A new &euro;500 annual cost of education allowance will be made available to BTEA participants with children from the next academic year in September.  This will help parents, including lone parents, to return to education.  Additionally, the age-related payments will no longer apply to participants of the BTEA and, as a result, students who have a reduced payment on their primary scheme payment will now benefit from the maximum rate of payment from the new academic year.</p>  <p>  Overall, the priority for my Department is that the BTEA will be focused, targeted and suitable for the needs of jobseekers and of the future skills needs of the economy.  It is only in that context that changes to BTEA will be considered.  I have no plans to change the current rules for the Allowance. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company in a position to provide a high quality postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focussed network of post offices in the community.  My Department&rsquo;s support for An Post is equally apparent.  We anticipate this year that we will pay over &euro;50m to An Post under a contract for the cash payment services to welfare customers as well as an estimated &euro;9.7m for postal services.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection provides two main options for payment methods for its customers: payments in cash in post offices or payments direct to customer accounts in financial institutions.  The Department intends, where possible, to continue to offer its many clients the choice of being paid in cash at the post office or directly into an account in a financial institution.  </p>  <p>  Departmental staff were accordingly advised in July of last year that, when dealing with customers who are making new claims or seeking to change their payment arrangements, customers can choose between payment at the post office or by electronic funds transfer.  Customer wishes are to be facilitated where they choose to receive their social welfare payment at their local post office.

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability. Child Benefit is currently paid to around 626,525 families in respect of over 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of over &euro;2 billion in 2017. </p><p>Budget 2009 reduced the age for eligibility for Child Benefit from 19 years to less than 18 years.  A value for money review of child income supports, published by the Department of Social Protection in 2010, found that the participation pattern of children in education supports the current age limit for Child Benefit. </p><p>The current estimated annual cost of extending the upper age limit for payment for an additional year, i.e. for those persons who are 18 years and under 19 years of age and in secondary school, based on figures from the Department of Education and Skills, is over &euro;62 million.</p><p>Families on low incomes can already avail of a number of provisions to social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including: </p><p>- qualified child increases (IQCs) with primary social welfare payments; </p><p>- family income supplement (FIS) for low-paid employees with children; </p><p>- the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for low income families (paid at the full-time second level education rate). </p><p>These schemes provide targeted assistance that is directly linked with household income and thereby support low-income families with older children participating in full-time education. </p><p>Given the universal nature of Child Benefit extending child benefit payments to children for an additional year would not be a targeted approach.  The adoption of such a proposal would also have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context. </p></reply>

Recipients of this payment qualify for credits where they have at least one paid contribution in the two years prior to commencement of caring or have had credited contributions in that period.  Credits are also awarded to workers who take unpaid carer&rsquo;s leave from work.  </p>  <p>  Credits protect social insurance entitlements by bridging gaps in an employee&rsquo;s social insurance record, where they are not in a position to pay PRSI, such as during periods spent caring.  In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits can assist employees in qualifying for short-term schemes such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes such as the State pension contributory (SPC).  In the latter case, once someone has 520 paid contributions over the course of their working life &ndash; the first condition for eligibility for the SPC, credits have the same value as paid contributions when the calculation to determine the yearly average number of contributions paid or credited.  The year average determines the rate of pension payable. </p>  <p>  In addition, all carers, including those who are not on a welfare payment or who do not qualify for credits, may qualify for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme.  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for the SPC and applies to homemaking periods since 6 April 1994.  It equally applies to both men and women.</p>  <p>  The scheme provides that years spent working in the home while caring on a full-time basis for a child up to 12 years of age or an incapacitated person age 12 or over will be disregarded in calculating a person's yearly average number of contributions. </p>  <p>  It is not possible to cost, even on a tentative basis, the granting of contributions for periods spent on carer&rsquo;s allowance or on other homemaking periods as the impact on the rate of State pension which would be payable (and associated costs) would be largely dependent on periods spent in the paid workforce in the past and potential future periods in similar employment. </p></reply>

At present it is taking 20 weeks on average to finalise an application.  There are a number of factors that have contributed to the extended time required to process claims.  </p>  <p>  Firstly, there is a significant increase in the volume of applications being received.  The numbers applying for DCA have increased significantly since 2009, when the Department took over administration of the scheme from the HSE.  The year on year increase in volumes over recent years has consistently been in the 15-20% range due to an increase in population and more awareness of the scheme.  Over 1,000 claims were received in May, whereas the average would have been 400 per month a few years ago. </p>  <p>  Secondly, following a High Court ruling in 2016, there is now a need for the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors to provide the deciding officer with a more detailed opinion on the child&rsquo;s eligibility for the scheme and for the deciding officer in turn to provide more detailed reasons for their decision when communicating this to the customer.  These factors have resulted in the time taken to finalise applications increasing significantly and as a result the numbers being processed have reduced and the timescale to finalise each application has increased.</p>  <p>  Due to the priority being given to new applications, processing times for decision review requests and appeals are also affected at this time . However, the number of both review requests and appeals received has fallen in recent years due to the increase in applications awarded at initial decision stage, which is currently 75% of first time applications.</p>  <p>  In response to the current situation, additional deciding officers have been assigned to the scheme and  the extra processing capacity should allow for an improvement in processing times.  The position continues to be monitored closely.</p>  <p>  In relation to disability allowance (DA), the average time taken to process a new application in May 2017 was 12 weeks.  The processing times target for the DA scheme is to have 75% of new applications decided within 12 weeks and processing times have been consistent so far in 2017.  The number of new applications awaiting a decision has decreased slightly since the start of the year from 5,947 to 5,863 currently.  The number of DA appeals awaiting decision has also decreased, with 1,367 awaiting decision at the end of 2016, compared to 1,637 at the start of the year. </p>  <p>  When deciding entitlement to disability allowance, a deciding officer is required to consider the medical conditionality and the habitual residence condition, in addition to the means condition.  The failure of applicants to fully complete the application form and/or provide relevant supporting documentation, in respect of either their medical condition or their means, can contribute to delay in the processing of their application.</p></reply>

These factors have resulted in the time taken to finalise applications increasing significantly and as a result the numbers being processed have reduced and the timescale to finalise each application has increased.</p>  <p>  In response to the current situation, additional deciding officers have been assigned to the scheme.  This extra processing capacity should allow for an improvement in processing times. The position will continue to be closely monitored.  </p></reply>

A copy of the announcement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p>ttp://www.housing.gov.ie/planning/guidelines/wind-energy/coveney-and-naughten-announce-key-development-review-wind-energy-development-guidelines.</p><p>The &ldquo;preferred draft approach&rdquo; has been developed to address a number of key aspects of the targeted review which include: Sound/Noise, Visual Amenity and Setback Distances, Shadow Flicker, Consultation Obligations on Developers, Community Dividend and Grid Connections.</p><p>As part of the overall review, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) will be undertaken on the &quot;proposed draft approach&quot; to the revised Guidelines before they come into effect.  This is in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, the SEA Directive.  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process. </p><p>It is envisaged that the SEA process will take approximately 9 months.  In light of the SEA requirements, it is expected that the Guidelines will  be finalised and come into effect in Q1 2018.  In the meantime, the current Guidelines remain in force.</p><p>When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.</p><p>I am aware of a number of newspaper articles reporting a recent court case relating to wind turbine noise.  However, as this is a legal matter between the operators of a particular wind farm and a number of households living in close proximity to it, it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment on the matter.</p></reply>

Under this provision, each planning authority was required to examine all existing quarries in its functional area to determine whether EIA, a screening for EIA or an appropriate assessment (AA) should have been, but was not, carried out.  Where a planning authority determined that a quarry came within this category, the authority was required to make a further decision in relation to the planning status of the quarry, including registration status.  Following on from this, the planning authority had to either take enforcement action, requiring the quarry to cease operations, or direct the quarry operator to apply to the Board for substitute consent under Part XA of the Act, a process involving either EIA or AA, or both, as appropriate. </p></reply>

Proposals for individual solar farm developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, in the same manner as other proposed developments.  Planning applications are made to the relevant local planning authority with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development Act, each planning authority's development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned.  Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, inter alia, objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including energy facilities, and many local authorities have developed renewable energy strategies for their areas in this context.</p>  <p>  In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the local development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any relevant guidelines issued by my Department.  Planning authorities must then make their own decisions based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the planning code is sufficiently robust to facilitate the assessment of individual planning permission applications for solar farm developments.  However, the matter will be kept under review, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, and his Department - which leads on renewable energy policy - in the context of the Government's White Paper on Energy Policy, published in December 2015, the development of a Renewable Electricity Policy and Development Framework, as well as the finalisation of a new support scheme for renewable electricity by that Department.  I understand that, subject to public consultation and the need to secure Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission, it is expected that the new scheme will become operational in 2018.</p></reply>

The Programme further provides for consideration, with all stakeholders, as to how credit unions can support the delivery of social housing.</p><p>Credit Union bodies have set out proposed means by which funding could be provided by credit unions to Approved Housing Bodies for the development of social housing.  My Department and the Department of Finance have met with the credit union representative bodies on a number of occasions to examine how credit unions can assist in the area of financing social housing delivery.</p><p>Conscious of the independence of the Central Bank in its regulatory role in respect of credit unions, bilateral engagement has taken place between my Department and the Department of Finance to consider the potential regulatory and legislative implications of credit union involvement in the social housing sector.  Both Departments have also met with the Central Bank to provide information of a technical nature in relation to social housing funding arrangements.  This was with a view to assisting the Central Bank in understanding how these arrangements operate, as it deals with issues arising from proposals put forward for credit union investment in social housing.</p><p>I note the publication in May 2017 by the Central Bank of the <i>Consultation on Potential Changes for the Investment Framework for Credit Unions</i>.  The potential changes that are provided for would allow for investment by credit unions in the delivery of social housing by the larger Approved Housing Bodies which are categorised as &lsquo;Tier 3&rsquo; under the voluntary regulation framework for the AHB sector.</p><p>Ultimately, the funding mechanisms required will have to be put in place in the first instance by the credit union, with the support of their members and with the agreement of the Central Bank.  My Department will continue to contribute to this process by providing necessary technical advice and support.</p><p>The Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme provides a means whereby properties can be built or bought by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) with the combined use of State and private funding, and leased by AHBs and Local Authorities from private providers, for the provision of social housing.  This scheme is underpinned by a lease and other legal agreements.  These provide that rental payments are made by the State over an agreed long-term time period, typically 20 years.  In return, the housing unit is made available for social housing purposes.</p><p>Changes are now being proposed to this scheme in order to facilitate larger institutional private investors to become involved in the financing of social housing.  Subject to other regulatory requirements being met, this could include credit unions.</p><p>The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) is acting as financial advisor to my Department in this work and has undertaken market engagement in the development of the scheme.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority, as are the costs of collection. </p><p>Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities.  However, the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century.  Many of the provisions are outdated and not suitable for business trends in the modern era.  My Department has developed legislative proposals to modernise and consolidate the legislation governing commercial rates.  The Government approved the drafting of a Rates Bill at its meeting on 11 April 2017.  These proposals will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny in due course.</p><p>The Debt Management Project Implementation Board, on which my Department was represented, was established by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in February 2015, to progress the recommendations of the Debt Management Review, which was published in 2014.  The Project Implementation Board concluded its work in 2016 and recommended that a Central Collection Agency was not justified at this time.  This was due to the fact that the improvements which had been made by the Public Sector Bodies (PSBs) and the targets set for those PSBs for the period to 2018 were close to those that might be expected of a Central Collection Agency.</p><p>The funding system that applies to local authorities is a complex one, as authorities derive their income from a variety of sources including commercial rates, charges for goods and services, funding from my Department, and from other Departments and agencies for a range of activities.  While capital funding levels declined in line with national economic circumstances, they have now started to increase significantly again.  </p><p>The monetary amount of each income source to local authorities in the years 2010 - 2015 is set out in Table 1 while Table 2 sets out each revenue income source as a proportion of the total.  Table 3 sets out the total capital income over the same period.</p><p><b>Table 1.</b><table><tr><th>Revenue Income sources</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>Revenue Income sources</td><td>2010</td><td>2011</td><td>2012</td><td>2013</td><td>2014</td><td>2015</td></tr><tr><td>Goods &amp;amp; Services</td><td>&euro;1.52bn</td><td>&euro;1.482bn</td><td>&euro;1.352bn</td><td>&euro;1.38bn</td><td>&euro;1.394bn</td><td>&euro;1.304bn</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial rates</td><td>&euro;1.43bn</td><td>&euro;1.449bn</td><td>&euro;1.497bn</td><td>&euro;1.494bn</td><td>&euro;1.5bn</td><td>&euro;1.496bn</td></tr><tr><td>Income from local sources</td><td>&euro;2.95bn</td><td>&euro;2.931bn</td><td>&euro;2.849bn</td><td>&euro;2.874bn</td><td>&euro;2.894bn</td><td>&euro;2.8bn</td></tr><tr><td>Grants &amp;amp; subsidies</td><td>&euro;1.225bn</td><td>&euro;1.195bn</td><td>&euro;939m</td><td>&euro;850m</td><td>&euro;871m</td><td>&euro;878m</td></tr><tr><td>Other income*</td><td>&euro;923m</td><td>&euro;865m</td><td>&euro;791m</td><td>&euro;794m</td><td>&euro;355m</td><td>&euro;386m</td></tr><tr><td>Income from external sources</td><td>&euro;2.148bn</td><td>&euro;2.06bn</td><td>&euro;1.73bn</td><td>&euro;1.644bn</td><td>&euro;1.226bn</td><td>&euro;1.264bn</td></tr><tr><td>Total Income</td><td>&euro;5.098bn</td><td>&euro;4.991bn</td><td>&euro;4.579bn</td><td>&euro;4.518bn</td><td>&euro;4.12bn</td><td>&euro;4.064bn</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2.</b><table><tr><th>Revenue Income sources</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>Revenue Income sources</td><td>2010</td><td>2011</td><td>2012</td><td>2013</td><td>2014</td><td>2015</td></tr><tr><td>Goods &amp;amp; Services</td><td>30%</td><td>30%</td><td>30%</td><td>31%</td><td>34%</td><td>32%</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial rates</td><td>28%</td><td>29%</td><td>33%</td><td>33%</td><td>36%</td><td>37%</td></tr><tr><td>Income from local sources</td><td>58%</td><td>59%</td><td>63%</td><td>64%</td><td>70%</td><td>69%</td></tr><tr><td>Grants &amp;amp; subsidies</td><td>24%</td><td>24%</td><td>20%</td><td>19%</td><td>21%</td><td>22%</td></tr><tr><td>Other income*</td><td>18%</td><td>17%</td><td>17%</td><td>17%</td><td>9%</td><td>9%</td></tr></table></p><p>* Other income includes: the General Purpose Grants (GPG) which were paid to local authorities until 2014; Local Property Tax (LPT) allocations which commenced in 2015 and replaced GPGs; the County Charge which ceased in 2014 when local authorities and the former town councils  merged; and Pension Related Deductions which local authorities retained as income from 2009 to 2015.</p><p><b>Table 3.</b><table><tr><th>Capital   Income</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;2.898bn</td><td>&euro;2.516bn</td><td>&euro;1.805bn</td><td>&euro;1.396bn</td><td>&euro;1.154bn</td><td>&euro;1.311bn</td></tr></table></p><p>It is important to note that, while income from commercial rates in 2015 makes up an increased proportion of local authorities' income compared to previous years, the quantum of rates income has not increased significantly in monetary terms. </p><p>Central Government funding of local authorities similarly presents a complex picture, with transfers, both current and capital, coming from a wide range of Departments and Offices, not solely from my Department, for a variety of purposes.  Some streams of funding are delivered directly from funding departments to local authorities, while others are routed through departmental agencies. </p><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General reports on the Central Government funding of local authorities as part of his Annual Report.  This report provides an overview of the funds flowing from and through central government sources to local authorities and the purposes for which funds have been provided. The latest report, for 2015, is available at the following link; </p><p>www.audgen.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?/documents/annualreports/2015/Report/En/Chapter4.pdf.</p><p>I am satisfied that the current funding model is enabling local authorities to meet an appropriate level of service provision across the State, from the most rural and sparsely populated areas to the large urban centres.  As local authorities vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, public service demands, infrastructure and income sources, my Department keeps the funding system under constant review and works with all local authorities to ensure the local government sector can meet existing and emerging challenges.</p></reply>

It is only after their application for residency has been successfully assessed that they can be considered for SHS. </p>  <p>  The assessment of applications for SHS is the responsibility of the relevant local authority in accordance with the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated regulations.  There is a two pronged approach to the assessment that involves, firstly, an assessment of eligibility, followed by an assessment of need.

All applications, regardless of whether by an individual or a company, are assessed in accordance with the provisions of the Act and any environmental legislation in force at the given time.  In regulating this activity there is a need to ensure, in so far as possible, that the resource is managed appropriately with the twin aims of protecting the marine environment and allowing for a sustainable level of harvesting of seaweed. </p><p>The Deputy's questions relate to a specific license granted to an indigenous Irish company . In 2008, the company submitted a foreshore license application to harvest in Kenmare Bay.  No licence issued in respect of the Kenmare Bay application.  However, the Marine Licence Vetting Committee, a group of marine experts who advise the Minister of the day on the technical and environmental aspects of foreshore applications, recommended that any future application by the company, should focus on an area outside of a Special Area of Conservation and include a commitment to conduct a detailed programme of monitoring. </p><p>The license to harvest in Bantry Bay, originally received in June 2009, met with these and other criteria and was processed in the same thorough way as other foreshore lease and license applications received at that time.  Normal public consultation procedures were followed with the application being advertised in a local newspaper (The Southern Star) and it was also made available for inspection at a local Garda Station (Bantry) for a period of 21 days.  No submissions were received from members of the public during the consultation period. </p><p>In line with the usual procedures, the application was also circulated to various bodies for their views and input.  Submissions were received from the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Underwater Archaeology Unit of the then Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Marine Survey Office, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board, the Central Fisheries Board and the Marine Institute.  The Marine Licence Vetting Committee considered all material pertaining to the application and concluded that subject to compliance with specific conditions the proposed harvesting was not likely to have a significant negative impact on the marine environment.  This would include no significant impact on juvenile fish, lobster and other species. </p><p>The Marine Licence Vetting Committee recommended that a licence should issue and approval in principle was given by the then Minister in 2011. The final legal papers, the licence between the State and the company giving effect to the decision were completed by the then Minister in 2014. </p><p>The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive applies to a wide range of public and private projects.  It is a mandatory requirement for project types listed in Annex I of the Directive.  For project types listed in Annex II, it is up to the consenting authority to determine if an EIS is required by carrying out EIA screening based on criteria set out in the Directive.  An EIA may also be required where the thresholds set out in the Directive are not met (sub-threshold EIA) or where the project or activity is proposed to be carried out in a Natura 2000 site.  </p><p>If the consenting authority determines that the EIA Directive applies to a project, it requires that an applicant must prepare and submit an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), following which, the consent authority would carry out an EIA.  In this case, the proposed project was not within a Natura 2000 site, was not of a class set out in Annex I of the Directive nor does it fall into Annex II.  An EIS was not required and while it was open to the Minister at the time to carry out an EIA, it was not considered necessary.</p><p>The licence allows the company to harvest specific quantities of specific species of kelp seaweed on a rotational basis in Bantry Bay.  The licenced area is split into five distinct harvesting zones and not all of the seaweed in the bay will be harvested.  The total area licenced is 750 hectares (roughly 1,850 acres).  The licence provides for a four year rotation of zones with a stand by zone only to be harvested if weather is adverse (99 hectares/240 acres). On average, some 175 hectares/432 acres will be subject to harvest annually, less than 1% of the area of the bay. </p><p>The rotational harvesting plan, ensures that only a portion of the bay is harvested each year.  To strengthen the sustainability of the harvesting plan for the licenced area within the bay, the harvesting is also subject to a strict monitoring programme, and requires approval of a baseline study prior to commencement of operations.  All costs associated with the baseline study which was carried out in September 2016 and costs associated with the monitoring programme were or will be fully borne by the licensee.  </p><p>The monitoring programme includes comparisons between harvested and non-harvested areas in each zone for density and height of kelp together with quantitative measurements of flora and fauna prior to commencement of harvesting (2016) and in years 3 (2019) and 5 (2021) for 15 areas within each zone.</p><p>All details of the application and determination are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at .</p></reply>

This increase is in order to meet the continuing costs of existing HAP households, and the costs of supporting an additional 15,000 households to be supported by HAP in 2017.  The HAP scheme is funded through a combination of Exchequer monies and tenant differential rents collected in respect of HAP tenancies. </p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector.  The tenancy is between the tenant and the landlord and is governed by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended). </p>  <p>  While eligible homeless households may source accommodation for themselves, a dedicated placement team, the Place Finder Service, assists homeless households in areas where there is a high demand for properties but low levels of supply making the rental market very challenging, and where the provision of such a service is justified.  Currently, a Homeless Placefinder Service is operated in the Dublin region by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, and in Cork City Council area.</p>  <p>  The Place Finder Service seeks out potential properties suitable for households currently identified as homeless.  The service liaises with individual households to establish their specific needs and to ensure that any additional supports which may be needed are put in place, it establishes relationships with local property agents and landlords and it assists the household in securing the tenancy.  Additional discretion of up to 50% above HAP rent limits is available to the Dublin local authorities to assist in housing homeless households in the Dublin Region.  The Place Finder Services can also pay a deposit and rent in advance on behalf of the tenant, meaning that that homeless households are provided with the best chance of finding a new home with the security that HAP provides.</p>  <p>  In cases where a tenant, currently on a local authority waiting list, wishes to access rented accommodation with HAP support in another local authority area, I have directed local authorities to provide that HAP tenants continue to be dealt with by their originating local authority.  However, the rent limits will be those that apply in the local authority where the property is situated.  The originating local authority will engage with the relevant new local authority to facilitate eligible requests for inter-authority movement.  Where homeless households have sourced or been assisted by the Place Finder Service in sourcing accommodation outside the Dublin area, the relevant rate of support is based on the rent limits that apply in the local authority where the property is situated.  The DRHE have been advised to consult with the new local authority in relation to the appropriate level of support that should be provided.  However, the Place Finder Service can still pay a deposit and rent in advance on behalf of the tenant.</p>  <p>  In order to maintain the equitable treatment of all housing applicants, inter-authority movement for HAP applicants is based on the current Social Housing Eligibility Income Bands, i.e. movement will only be facilitated across local authorities with Income Bands that are equal or higher; or where shared areas of choice are already operated.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review, including the operation of inter authority movement.

The focus is the transitioning of qualified households from emergency accommodation into private rented tenancies. However, support is also provided to prevent households from entering emergency accommodation and homeless services.  In addition, a Homeless Placefinder Service is also operating in Cork City since May 2017 and is focused on moving households out of emergency accommodation, primarily.</p>  <p>  While eligible households may source accommodation for themselves, the dedicated placement team, the Homeless Placefinder Service, engages directly with property owners and supports qualified households to find suitable tenancies, and to ensure that any additional supports that may be needed are put in place.  Homeless specific HAP in Dublin encompasses additional flexibility to exceed the specific rent limit by up to 50%; in Cork this flexibility is up to 20% above the maximum rent limit.</p>  <p>  The Service has relationships with local estate agents and property owners and can identify properties quickly.  In addition, the Placefinder Service can support homeless households to secure a tenancy by providing upfront payments for deposits and rent.  The cost of these deposits is recouped by the Department of Social Protection in respect of eligible households, and the HAP Shared Service Centre (SSC) facilitates the payment of HAP rent payments to landlords, on behalf of local authorities, as is the case ordinarily in the operation of the HAP scheme. </p>  <p>  There are currently more than 1,600 formerly homeless households whose needs are being supported by the homeless specific HAP supports in the Dublin region, with an average of 32 additional households a week in 2017 being supported by homeless HAP in Dublin.</p></reply>

Funding will be provided to Local Authorities to build public infrastructure such as roads, bridges and public amenities through a public procurement process and these projects will be key to the delivery of 23,000 housing units over the next four years, with a longer term projection of up to 70,000 units as the associated sites are fully built out. </p>  <p>  The full list of approved projects, with the projected housing yield for each site, is available on my Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/housing/rebuilding-ireland/local-infrastructure-housing-activation-fund-approved-projects.  Under Part V provisions, some 10% of the housing to be delivered will be for social housing purposes.  Where sites are in public ownership, up to 30% may be for either social housing or potentially housing for the elderly or those with special needs, according to the particular needs of that Local Authority.</p>  <p>  The affordability dividend in relation to associated private housing is in the form of a cost reduction proportionate to the LIHAF contribution.  The developer may provide a percentage of the houses at a higher cost reduction or spread it out over all of the associated housing to be provided by 2021.   </p>  <p>  Following approval in principle, the relevant Local Authorities are engaging in negotiations with developers to obtain agreements in relation to land transfer, housing delivery timelines and cost reductions.  It is expected that the Local Authorities will conclude agreements with developers this month.  Drawdown of funding cannot occur until the grant agreements are in place.</p></reply>

At its heart, it aims to increase housing supply, across all tenures, to 25,000 homes per year by 2021.  The 25,000 target was the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) estimate of the housing requirement based on demographic change, household formation and a level of obsolescence of existing stock. </p><p>With regard to housing supply requirements over the coming 15 years and beyond, the new National Planning Framework (NPF), to be titled Ireland 2040: Our Plan, will address emerging trends such as a potential population increase of one million, more than a fifth of whom will be over 65 by 2040. </p><p>As was broadly indicated in the NPF Issues and Choices consultation paper published in February 2017, over 500,000 new homes will be required to support an additional projected population of one million people by 2040.

Projected national housing supply requirements for the draft NPF have been determined based on headship rates, demographic projections and a rate of obsolescence. </p><p>Published data from Census 2016 has also become available since April 2017 and coupled with the work of ESRI, is informing the drafting process.

Residential construction output reached unsustainably high levels, with peak output of 93,000 new homes in 2006, and  then dropped to 8,300 in 2013, including a large proportion of single houses.  As a result, the construction of starter and affordable homes at scale came to a virtual standstill. </p><p>The Government has made housing a top priority, bringing forward the range of measures under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness in July 2016.  The overarching objective of Rebuilding Ireland is to increase overall housing supply to a more sustainable 25,000 homes per year by 2021.  The 25,000 target was the ESRI estimate of the housing requirement based on demographic change, household formation and a level of obsolescence of existing stock. The longer-term objective is to create a functioning and sustainable housing system, where supply more closely meets housing demand over time.  </p><p>In order to directly influence and generate supply of new homes, Rebuilding Ireland contains a suite of actions that will increase housing construction and refurbishment, bringing forward the supply of thousands of extra homes.  Under Pillar 2 of the Action Plan, 47,000 new social housing units will be delivered by 2021, supported by &euro;5.35 billion in Exchequer funding. In terms of direct construction and refurbishment, 26,000 will be provided as part of the 2021 target.  So far, good progress has been made and there are now over 10,000 new homes in the social housing construction pipeline, details of which are available at the following link; .</p><p>Pillar 3 contains a set of actions targeted at increasing private housing supply.  The &euro;226m Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund has now been fully allocated and will fund key enabling infrastructure to open up 34 sites across 15 local authorities.  The LIHAF funding has the capacity to encourage the supply of 23,000 new homes by 2021. </p><p>Also under this Pillar, the State land bank is being actively targeted for the provision of new homes in the immediate term.  In April, the Rebuilding Ireland Map was published, containing details of over 2,000 hectares of land in public ownership, with the potential to deliver up to 50,000 new homes nationally.  As set out in the Strategy for the Rental Sector, the commitment to bring forward an affordable rental scheme is being progressed through kick-starting  supply on such lands held by local authorities. </p><p>In practical terms, the development of these public lands will mean accelerating social housing delivery and securing more homes for sale and rent at lower and more affordable price points.  Where local authorities have large sites in their ownership, there is a real opportunity to bring them forward for mixed tenure housing, at much more affordable price points, where the Council can directly influence the housing provision through the procurement process and development agreements.  All local authorities have been requested to prepare Strategic Development and Management Plans for residential lands in their ownership to ensure they are brought forward for development at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>A key factor in terms of housing supply at scale, of both houses and apartments, is the cost of construction and the associated issue of viability.  In this regard, a Working Group on housing delivery costs was established, led by my Department, to carry out a detailed analysis of housing delivery input costs with a view to identifying economies across a range of constituent areas such as finance, planning, design, land costs and levies.  The Group comprises representation from all key public sector and industry stakeholders and is scheduled to complete its Report in the coming weeks. </p><p>Recent housing activity reports, available on www.rebuildingireland.ie, show that strong supply-side measures under Rebuilding Ireland are beginning to have a positive impact with all output indicators showing steep upward trends.  However, it is crucial that we continue to focus on supply and particularly the supply of social and affordable homes at scale. </p><p>To this end, the Taoiseach signalled the Government&rsquo;s intention to carry out a focused review of Rebuilding Ireland, as we approach the completion of the first year of its implementation.  This work is now under way, with an emphasis on strengthening the measures already in place  and identifying new initiatives that add value and raise ambition.  As part of the review process, my Department will focus in particular on the broad issues of housing supply and affordability for different market segments, building on the measures already being advanced. </p></reply>

Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts. Neither I nor my Department has any direct role in relation to enforcement matters and cannot interfere in individual cases.</p>  <p>  In general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved: the homeowner, the builder, the developer and/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme.  It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including residential apartments, nor does it have a budget for such matters.</p>  <p>  In response to the many building failures that have emerged over the past decade, my Department introduced the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 (S.I. No. 9 of 2014), which require greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals and builders, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.</p>  <p>  A Certificate of Compliance on Completion is jointly signed by the builder and the assigned certifier.  This must be accompanied by plans and documentation to show how the constructed building complies with the building regulations and also the inspection plan, as implemented.</p>  <p>  At the end of May 2017, the Government approved the draft heads of a Bill to place the Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI) on a statutory footing and this Bill has now been referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government for pre-legislative scrutiny.  Once it is enacted the Bill will provide consumers who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator and will complement the reforms which have been made through the Building Control Amendment Regulations and contribute to the development of a culture of competence and compliance in the construction sector. </p></reply>

Delivery of social housing through acquisitions has increased in recent years in line with the Government commitment to accelerate the overall delivery of social housing through some &euro;3 billion provided over the period 2015-2017.</p>  <p>  Building on this investment, the funding framework for the implementation of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness provides &euro;5.35 billion in investment to deliver 47,000 social housing units through build, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing, over the period to 2021. </p>  <p>  While statistics for acquisitions completed in 2016 are being finalised, it is estimated that almost 2,000 houses and apartments were purchased by both local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) for social housing use last year.  Further significant acquisitions will be made this year, including through the allocation of &euro;70m for the Housing Agency to establish a revolving fund to acquire some 1,600 units over the period to 2020 for social housing use.  The fund will be replenished by the Agency through the sale of units primarily to the AHB sector.  </p>  <p>  Acquisition of new and previously-owned houses and apartments has resulted in important early delivery of social housing.  However, it is important that this activity is carried out with due regard to the impact it has on the local housing market.  This principle is set out in the funding arrangements put in place by my Department for local authorities and AHBs in respect of social housing acquisitions.  Also emphasised in these arrangements are that the acquisitions approach for new social housing should reflect the importance of mixed tenure, should not be overly-concentrated in any particular location, should represent reasonable value-for-money and that newly-acquired properties must comply with statutory building and fire safety regulations.</p></reply>

This additional investment in 2017 means that delivery under the scheme can be accelerated and up to 800 vacant properties can be brought back into use as new homes for families on local authority waiting lists this year.</p><p>Individual targets have been communicated to each local authority to ensure that the objective of 800 units for 2017 is achieved, and local authorities have been provided with delegated authority to enter into contractual arrangements in respect of that number of units.  If a local authority is in a position to secure more units through the scheme than their target, this is welcomed and funding will be provided accordingly. The RLS targets for each local authority are set out in tabular form below. </p><p>My Department will be closely monitoring this activity to ensure that the scheme works well; that the funding available is utilised effectively; and ultimately, that new social houses are delivered using the scheme in 2017.  The progress of individual local authorities will be reported later in the year.  </p><p>The Buy and Renew Scheme is also available to local authorities to complement the Repair &amp;amp; Leasing scheme, allowing local authorities and AHBs to approach owners of vacant, privately-owned houses in need of repair or remediation, with the option to either lease and repair, or to buy and repair, the unit.  An initial &euro;25 million has been made available in 2017 and may be increased to as much as &euro;50 million in 2018, which should result in at least 400 - 500 renewed houses &ndash; or a greater number if costs per unit prove reasonable.</p><p>In addition in 2017, a capital fund of &euro;70m is being provided to the Housing Agency to establish a revolving fund to acquire some 1,600 units over the period to 2020 for social housing use.  The fund will be replenished by the Agency through the sale of units primarily to the Approved Housing Body (AHB) sector.  </p><p>This is intended to be a short term to medium term initiative, targeting the vacant property portfolios of financial institutions and investment companies and is a direct response to the current shortage that would be designed to complement, not displace, ongoing targeted acquisition activity by local authorities and AHBs.</p><p>Under Actions 2.5 and 5.6 of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, the Housing Agency continues to actively and positively engage with banks and investment companies in relation to its acquisitions programme to deliver on the overall target of acquiring some 1,600 units by 2020.  In that context, since the launch of Rebuilding Ireland in July 2016 and as of 31 May 2017, the Agency has accepted bids on 489 dwellings from a range of vendors.  Of these, the Agency has signed contracts for 379 dwellings and 225 of these purchases have closed.  Bids are pending on a further 18 dwellings. </p><p><b>2017 RLS Targets per Local Authority</b><table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>RLS Target 2017 </th></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Council</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan County Council</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Clare County Council</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City Council</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal County Council</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown   County Council</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>Galway City Council</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Galway County Council</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry County Council</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare County Council</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County   Council</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Laois County Council</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim County Council</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City and   County Council</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Longford County   Council</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo County Council</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Meath County Council</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan County   Council</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon County   Council</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo County Council</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin County   Council</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary County   Council</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City and   County Council</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath County   Council</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford County Council</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow County Council</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>800</td></tr></table></p></reply>

An information notice on fire safety has gone up on the RTB&rsquo;s website and  a further fire safety information leaflet is in the process of being distributed to all landlords;</p>  <p>  -  A Building Control Management System (BCMS) alert was issued to all 57,000+ registered users of the BCMS to remind those involved in works to existing or new buildings of the need to be vigilant in relation to compliance with the Building Regulations and in particular to Part B Fire Safety;</p>  <p>  -  The Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management met and reviewed the state of preparedness of Ireland&rsquo;s local authority fire services to respond to large scale incidents.  The Board noted the recent report of the External Validation Group titled &ldquo;Local Delivery - National Consistency - Fire Services in Ireland&rdquo; and concluded that the available evidence provides for confidence regarding the capability of fire services to respond to emergencies.</p>  <p>  Following on from these initial actions, on 27 June 2017, I tasked my Department&rsquo;s National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management with coordinating a high-level Task Force to lead Ireland&rsquo;s re-appraisal of fire safety in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire.</p>  <p>  The Task Force will oversee and report on the initial steps already taken and look to identify and consider urgently potential life safety issues and to initiate appropriate remedial action where necessary.  Following this initial work, the Task Force will review and re-appraise existing arrangements and systems for Fire Safety and related issues/issues which impact on fire safety in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Task Force will prepare an interim report by the end of September 2017, with a Concluding Report at a later stage setting out, inter alia, proposals for the consideration of the Minister. </p>  <p>  The Task Force consists of senior representatives from the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management and other Divisions of my Department, in addition to representatives from the local government sector including the Chief Fire Officer, Dublin who is also Chair of the Chief Fire Officers Association, an international fire service expert, a fire safety consultant and a representative from Insurance Ireland.

The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope. </p>  <p>  Some &euro;2.2 million was provided to the Housing Agency in 2014 to meet expenditure incurred under the scheme in respect of design work, contractors, expenses to homeowners, operational costs, the administrative costs to the Housing Agency and the remediation of a number of dwellings in the final quarter of that year.</p>  <p>  An additional sum of &euro;10 million was made available in Budget 2015 to fund the operation of the scheme in 2015.  A further 148 dwellings had remedial works completed under the scheme in 2015.</p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;19 million was provided for the pyrite remediation scheme in Budget 2016 to meet activity under the scheme in 2016.  Sanction for a further &euro;7.6 million to support additional activity under the scheme last year was granted in August 2016.  Some 400 dwellings were remediated under the scheme in 2016. </p>  <p>  A sum of &euro;22 million was announced under Budget 2017 to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme in 2017, of which &euro;15.9 million has already been drawn down by the Housing Agency.  This allocation will facilitate the remediation of some 400 additional dwellings this year and is a clear signal of the continuing importance attached by Government to addressing the issue of significant pyritic damage in private dwellings. </p>  <p>  In the context of the pyrite remediation scheme, an agreement was reached between the Pyrite Resolution Board and the company referred to by the Deputy in June 2014, under which the company agreed to contribute technical and project management services to the Board to the value of &euro;2 million.  Such services include assisting in organising and managing the testing of dwellings and project management of remediation contracts.  The company has also agreed to make available to the Pyrite Resolution Board/Housing Agency the results of testing undertaken by it prior to the operation of the scheme.</p>  <p>  A Supplemental Agreement has been signed with the company for dealing with structural defects not related to pyritic heave, which are identified prior to or during the course of pyrite remediation works.  In such cases, it will, under the Supplemental Agreement, make an appropriate contribution towards the cost of such structural works.</p></reply>

The hubs will provide more appropriate and suitable accommodation for families.  They are not a long term housing solution as families will move into houses and apartments that will be provided under social housing supports, as supply becomes available.  This type of emergency accommodation provides a secure and stable placement for families on an on-going basis unlike the insecurity of hotel accommodation especially during peak periods and holidays.</p>  <p>  These custom-developed facilities will offer family living arrangements with a greater level of stability than is possible in hotel accommodation while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured.  Furthermore, such arrangements will facilitate more coordinated needs assessment and support planning including on-site access to required services, such as welfare, health, housing services, cooking and laundry facilities and appropriate family supports. </p>  <p>  Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities, while my Department&rsquo;s role involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.  In relation to the Deputy's specific query, the operation and management of individual housing solutions for families, such as family hubs, Housing Assistance Payments, local authority allocations, etc. are a matter for the relevant housing authorities.  </p></reply>

The Unit is the primary point of contact between the Department and the CSO and as such is regularly in contact with that Office in relation to a variety of different issues, including assisting with queries of a statistical nature and developments such as the National Data Infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Census results are of interest right across the Department but particularly inform policy considerations in respect of planning, housing, water, local government and franchise functions.  Census data is centrally relevant to much of the planning arena both in relation to strategic planning such as for the National Planning Framework (NPF),but also in preparing for the forthcoming Regional, Spatial and Economic Strategies to be prepared by the three Regional Assemblies.  As part of the formulation of the NPF, the finalised Census 2016 results are under review to ensure the most recent and accurate data is considered and reflected in any evidence-based proposals that may form part of the draft NPF and subsequent Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies.</p>  <p>  In relation to housing, up-to-date Census information is utilised across all areas of policy development. In April and May of this year for example, the CSO released two major Census 2016 publications of relevance to the housing area.  These were Census 2016 Profile 1 - Housing In Ireland and Census 2016 Profile 2 - Population Distribution and Movements both of which can be accessed via the following weblink: www.cso.ie/en/census/census2016reports/census2016publicationschedule.  These reports contain important data in terms of the context in which housing policy is formulated and they will be a key data source to inform the recently announced review of Rebuilding Ireland.</p>  <p>  My Department collaborates actively with the CSO and, by way of example, engaged extensively with the Office prior to Census 2016 being conducted, in view of the CSO&rsquo;s intention to publish a specific Homeless Persons report.  The Department is represented on the CSO's Housing Data Group and the CSO in turn participates in the Department's Housing Data Analytics Group.</p>  <p>  Census data also informs policy considerations in the franchise area.  The publication of preliminary census results triggers the establishment of a Constituency Commission under the Electoral Act 1997 and the Commission is required to present its report on D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies within three months of publication of final census results.  Other franchise considerations informed by Census data include, for example, voting age and citizenship requirements for voter registration and voting rights.</p>  <p>  Census information also informs the preparation of terms of reference for any review of local electoral areas to be undertaken and provides a basis for the work of any Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee established by the Minister or any other local government review committee which may be established from time to time.  Population changes are also one of a range factors that my Department considers in the context of Local Property Tax allocations, which are kept under review to ensure equitable treatment of all local authorities, recognising also that the resource requirements of local authorities vary significantly across the State. </p>  <p>  Finally, regarding the water function in my Department, the Census results provide statistics on the number of households connected to different types of piped water supplies and to different types of sewerage facilities.  This data is vital in relation to policy on public water and wastewater services, the group water sector, private wells and small private supplies.</p></reply>

While the vote does not give rise to fundamental strategic issues for Defence Forces operations or for Ireland&rsquo;s continuing engagement within the EU in the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), it is expected that Brexit will have an impact on future developments in the Defence sphere.</p>  <p>  The structures put in place in the Department of Defence to address the potential challenges arising from Brexit include the assignment of responsibility to a senior official at Assistant Secretary General level in relation to Brexit related matters.  The senior official is leading the Department&rsquo;s input to deliberations within the framework established across Government and is supported in their role by a number of branches in the Department.  The senior official represents the Department on the Interdepartmental Group on EU-UK Affairs which is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and is engaged with the identification of key strategic, operational and policy issues arising from Brexit.  In addition, the Management Board is acting as a clearing house for Brexit and maintains oversight on an ongoing basis. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, the Government has adopted a contingency framework to deal with all issues arising in respect of the UK vote to leave the EU.  Accordingly, any issues arising, including those within the Defence area, whether bilateral, or in respect of developments in CSDP, or regarding our wider international multilateral defence engagements, will be also addressed within that framework.</p>  <p>  As matters relating to Brexit are currently being absorbed and dealt with within already existing Department structures and resources, there is currently no dedicated Brexit funding allocation in the Department of Defence. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware the formal EU-UK negotiations commenced earlier this month.  All potential consequences in the defence sphere, arising during these negotiations, will remain the subject of ongoing consideration by my Department throughout this process, including whether there will be a future requirement for a dedicated unit to exclusively handle Brexit related matters. </p></reply>
