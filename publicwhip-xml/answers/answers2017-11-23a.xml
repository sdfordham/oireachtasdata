    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-23a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300078#WRA00600"><p>This Government is substantially strengthening its focus on the possible implications of Brexit in order to safeguard the competitiveness of the Irish economy against any potential negative impacts.</p><p>My Department and its Agencies play a key role in implementing the Government&rsquo;s policies to stimulate the productive capacity of the economy and create an environment which supports job creation and sustainment of existing jobs.</p><p>As the Deputy has acknowledged, last week my Department published its plan &lsquo;Building Stronger Business &ndash; Responding to Brexit by competing, innovating and trading&rsquo;.  This plan focuses on our responses to the range of challenges and opportunities arising as a result of Brexit, including those of the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs).</p><p>The LEOs are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business in Ireland.  They aim to promote entrepreneurship, foster business start-ups and develop existing micro and small businesses, especially those with export potential.  Financial supports are provided to new start-ups and businesses with 10 employees or fewer in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities.</p><p>As stated in the plan, I secured an additional &euro;4m in capital funding for the LEOs this year which has, and will continue to fund, a range of measures put in place to supplement LEO supports.</p><p>An additional &euro;4m in capital funding has also been allocated to the LEOs in 2018, and this will ensure that a suite of LEO Brexit supports are available to micro and small businesses through the 31 LEOs nationwide.  These supports, which are aimed at strengthening the capacity of micro and small businesses to better cope with the changing external environment, especially Brexit, include: </p><p>- Access to the &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo; online tool where micro and smaller businesses can self-diagnose their readiness for Brexit; </p><p>- A &lsquo;Technical Assistance for Micro-enterprises&rsquo; grant designed to support qualifying businesses to diversify into new markets, enabling companies to explore and develop new market opportunities; </p><p>- A &lsquo;Lean for Micro&rsquo; programme available nationwide to help small businesses become more efficient and competitive; </p><p>- A &lsquo;LEO Innovation and Investment Fund&rsquo; pilot programme to support innovation in micro-enterprises and to help them become investor ready so that they can scale their businesses; </p><p>- Tailored mentoring to address Brexit-related business challenges;</p><p>- Targeted training on specific Brexit challenges, including financial aspects and capability building in innovation, competitiveness and opportunity diagnosis; and </p><p>- Continued information, advice and guidance across all 31 LEOs and regionally.</p><p>The LEOs will also:</p><p>- prepare and disseminate a suite of online information addressing practical issues aimed at micro-enterprises. </p><p>- conduct a survey of locally trading businesses to better understand the exposure and opportunities arising from Brexit amongst this cohort. </p><p>- continue to be proactive in identifying client businesses that are exposed to Brexit and to help them to plan their response, including exploiting new opportunities and leveraging the suite of LEO supports available. </p><p>- seek to leverage the Regional Competitive Funds to drive collaborative initiatives and peer-to-peer networking amongst micro and small businesses in certain sectors and activities.</p><p>In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme.Â  The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully.</p><p>These initiatives supplement the core services provided by the LEOs to the micro and small business sector.  These services include advice and guidance, training and mentoring, a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; and referrals service to other State supports, as well as financial assistance to micro-enterprises in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector.  For example, LEO Dublin City is running a series of Start Your Own Business courses over the coming months and LEO Fingal have scheduled a number of training courses addressing issues such as website development and the use of social media to promote a company.</p><p>Events such as the National Enterprise Awards and the County finals of the Ireland's Best Young Entrepreneur competition showcase the range and quality of LEO clients and provide avenues for LEOs to promote their suite of services to stakeholders.</p><p>Finally, the majority of LEOs currently have a full staff complement, and arrangements are at an advanced stage for the filling of the small number of existing vacancies.  The first phase of the LEO Graduate scheme is coming to an end, and it is intended that the next scheme, which will provide for a placement in most LEOs, will be in place during Q1 2018.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-23a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300078#WRA00900"><p>My predecessor as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Mary Mitchell O'Connor T.D., published a consultation paper on the resale of tickets for entertainment and sporting events on 20 January 2017 along with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the then Minister for Tourism and Sport.  The 24 responses to the consultation were published on the Department's website on 9 May 2017. </p>  <p>  As evidenced by the different responses to the consultation, the matter is neither simple nor straightforward, and, while it would be relatively easy to enact legislation on the issue, it is much more difficult to ensure that such legislation would be effective and enforceable.</p>  <p>  For example, although it is sometimes assumed that all of the tickets to entertainment or sporting events go on general sale to the public, this is not typically the case.  Tickets for entertainment events are commonly made available to a range of parties &ndash; including performers and their managements, members of performers&rsquo; fan clubs, venues and members of their clubs, corporate sponsors, holders of some credit cards, customers of some telecoms services, record labels and media organisations &ndash; prior to going on general sale.  Estimates from the US and the UK suggest that half or more of tickets for concerts by top acts may be allocated or sold prior to the commencement of the general public sale. Â For major sporting events, all of the tickets may be allocated to affiliated clubs and boards or to subscribers with multi-year or season tickets with none available on general sale. </p>  <p>  If a proportion of tickets for high-demand events are not available for general sale, potential purchasers&rsquo; chances of obtaining tickets on the primary market are correspondingly reduced.  Pre-sales and pre-sales allocations also go some way to explaining why tickets for some events can be offered for sale on secondary marketplaces within minutes of their going on general sale or, in some cases, even before the start of the general sale.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that a high proportion of ticket resales appear to be made by individuals who have bought a small number of tickets legitimately and then proceed to resell them.  For some events, most resales (sometimes up to 90 per cent of resales) may be accounted for by private sellers.</p>  <p>  Since receipt of the public consultation submissions, my Department has engaged in follow-up discussions with sporting bodies, event promoters, consumer bodies, primary ticketing service providers and secondary ticket marketplaces.  MyÂ Department is also pursuing enquiries with public authorities in European Union member states with laws that prohibit or restrict ticket resale on the experience with, and effectiveness of, these laws.Â Â The results of these discussions as well as the responses to the consultation are being analysed with a view to identifying possible measures aimed at helping ensure that ticket markets work better for consumers. </p>  <p>  The outcome of this process will inform both me and the Government on the approach to be taken on this matter, including the approach to the Deputy&rsquo;s Private Member&rsquo;s Bill entitled Sale of Tickets (Sporting and Cultural Events) Bill 2017.</p></reply>

    <ques id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-23a.12.q" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1361" speakername="Tommy Broughan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300078#WRA01100"><p><i>13.</i> To ask the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation if studies (details supplied) are on target to be completed before the end of 2017; the timeframe for the findings to be made available; and if she will make a statement on the matter. <b>[49461/17]</b></p></ques>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-23a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300078#WRA01200"><p>In advance of the UK Referendum, my Department conducted a contingency risk assessment of the potential impacts of Brexit across policy areas of the Department.  We have refined our analysis post-referendum and have been working with Agencies to put in place actions to mitigate risks and maximize opportunities. </p>  <p>  In this regard, my Department is conducting a number of research projects to build an understanding of the possible implications of Brexit on Ireland for enterprise, consumers and trading relations. </p>  <p>  These studiesÂ examine a range of scenarios and will provide an evidence base to inform Ireland&rsquo;s policy positions as part of the wider negotiation on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU and will further assist with the continued development of mitigation measures to respond to Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Department is also engaged in extensive consultation with stakeholders across all sectors of the economy.  Such consultation provides direct input to the more formal research studies but also represents a strand of research in itself, facilitating direct engagement between policymakers with those most significantly impacted by Brexit. </p>  <p>  Many of the challenges facing our economy and our enterprise base reflect longer term global trends. </p>  <p>  Brexit, however, is acting as a catalyst, bringing these challenges into sharper focus, expediting the need for firms to respond and adapt.  This in turn behoves my Department, and indeed the entire Government system, to continue to develop effective policy responses to support enterprise. </p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge, however, that the majority of policies and interventions that are already in place to support enterprises and to help them grow and diversify remain relevant.  In this context, the ongoing review of Enterprise 2025, offers a value opportunity to take stock and ensure that these policies are Brexit proofed. </p>  <p>  The challenge now, is to identify the additional specific policies that are required to address Brexit and emerging global challenges and opportunities.  Whilst identifying new actions to support our companies, we must also ensure we fully utilise all of the existing supports that are in place. </p>  <p>  The various studies currently underway will provide a valuable resource as my Department&rsquo;s policy response continues to evolve.  The outputs from such studies will contribute to the development of targeted, sector specific messages and mitigation measures.Â  These are outlined in the recent Brexit Sectoral Report 'building Stronger Business' which I published last month.</p>  <p>  The details of the research studies which are currently being undertaken by my Department, as referred to in this question, are as follows:</p>  <p>- The study into the &ldquo;Sectoral implications arising from Brexit: Most exposed sectors&rdquo; and the study into &ldquo;Strategic Implications arising from EU-UK Trading Patterns&rdquo; are on target for completion at the end of 2017.  These studies willÂ form part of the deliberative process to inform the development of our policy positions as part of the negotiations on the UK future relationship with the EU and key findings will be made available in due course.</p>  <p>  - Phase 2 of the InterTrade Ireland study on &ldquo;The Potential Impact of WTO TariffsÂ and other key relevant issues on Cross-Border Trade&rdquo; is expected to be completed by the end of November 2017.  It is intended that this report will be publishedÂ within the coming weeks</p>  <p>- The study by the CCPC and the ESRI on the &ldquo;Financial impact of Brexit on consumers in Ireland&rdquo; is expected to be completed by the end of 2017.  The issue of publication will be considered once the Project has been completed.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-23a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300078#WRA01500"><p>My Department, its Offices and the Agencies under its remit, are committed to the success of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy that was launched this year and the implementation of the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with Disabilities.</p>  <p>  Officials of my Department are members of the Steering Groups overseeing the implementation of both of these Strategies.Â  A Disability Consultative Committee has recently been put in place in my Department.Â  </p>  <p>  Examples of specific actions which support the delivery of these strategies are:</p>  <p>  1. In June, I launched Ireland&rsquo;s new National Plan on Corporate Social Responsibility, &lsquo;Towards Responsible Business&rsquo; 2017-2020&rsquo;.Â  The Plan aims to encourage businesses to develop strategies to integrate diversity in the workplace, including for people with a disability</p>  <p>  2. Ireland has reached agreement at EU-level on the text of a Directive and Regulation that will jointly ratify the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or otherwise Print Disabled.Â  My Department is actively preparing for this transposition, to ensure that it is carried out quickly and effectively.</p>  <p>  3. The Employment Equality Acts prohibit discrimination on nine grounds including the ground of disability.  Any person who believes that s/he has experienced discrimination which is contrary to the Employment Equality Acts may seek redress by referring a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission, which is an Office of my Department. </p>  <p>  4. Officials of my Department are currently assisting the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in drafting the Copyright and Related Rights (Miscellaneous Intellectual Property) Bill.Â Â One of the primary intentions of this Bill is to improve access to copyright works for persons with a disability.  The Bill will allow an individual to make a personal copy of a work modified to meet their particular needs.  Moreover, certain designated bodies will be able to make multiple copies of a work to meet the specific needs of persons with a disability and to share these with other designated bodies as well as directly to individuals with a disability.</p>  <p>  5. Enterprise Ireland is actively working with the National Disability Authority in looking at routes to commercialising universal design product ideas for the NDA&rsquo;s Annual Design Challenge. </p>  <p>  6. EI hosted aÂ knowledge sharing event with the National Disability Authority on a range of issues to do with disability with approximately 30 employers.</p>  <p>  7. Staff in theÂ Local Enterprise Office (LEOs) recently undertook training on interacting with people from disadvantaged or underrepresented communities, including people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  7. In line with other Government Departments, my Department and Offices have in place access officers who provide the assistance necessary to enable our clients and customers with disabilities to effectively access all our services.</p>  <p>  8. My Department is committed to complying with the Code of Practice for Appointment of Persons with Disabilities to positions in the Civil Service.Â  At the end of 2016, 5.2% of our staff were reporting a disability. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-23a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300078#WRA02000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 16 and 30 together.</p>  <p>  The 2016 Annual Report under the Control of Exports Act,2008, was submitted to Government this week and will be laid before both houses of the Oireachtas and published as soon as it is translated into Irish.Â  I expect to publish the Report before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  The objective of publishing these reportsÂ is to provide the public with a continuing enhanced level of transparency about exports of controlled goods and services. Â My Department applies the highest international standards in the implementation of the export control regime.Â  Our policy of free trade and open markets must conform with the core principles of security, regional stability and human rights which underpin export controls.Â  </p>  <p>  In regard to theÂ increase of over &euro;100 million inÂ exports during the first half of 2017, I would like to clarify that this increase does not concern arms but rather goods that have a military classification.Â  This classification also includes goods that are exported temporarily for repair and maintenance, even including within the European Union.</p>  <p>  The EU has a range of sanctions and measures in place in respect of countries engaged in conflicts.  All licence applications are considered having regard to these measures.Â  Sanctions can include arms embargoes and various restrictive measures including prohibitions on the provision of targeted goods and services.  My Department observes all arms embargos and trade sanctions when considering export licence applications.  There are no EU sanctions in place in respect of Saudi Arabia. </p>  <p>  All export licence applications, whether for Dual-Use or Military GoodsÂ are subject to rigorous scrutiny.Â  My Department has safeguards built into the licensing system which enable robust checks and cross-checks to ensure, as far as possible, that an item to be exported will be used by the stated end-user for the stated end-use, and will not be used for illicit purposes.</p>  <p>  My officials are in regular contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on export licensing issues.  They consult with that Department in respect of all military export licence applications.  My officials seek observations on any foreign policy concerns that may arise in respect of a proposed export; such factors are subject to review in the light of developments in a given region.  Any observations which may arise from this examination are considered in the final assessment of any licence application.</p>  <p>  My Department can and does refuse export licence applications where we have concerns about the ultimate end-user or end-use of a product.Â  In 2016, 3 licence applications were denied.Â  It is also the case that a company may withdraw a licence request, on the basis of information provided by my Department. </p>  <p>  Only last week, I led a trade mission to Oman and the United Arab Emirates which included the announcement of multi-million euro deals for our companies.Â  Trade with the Gulf region is very important for Ireland as part of our response to Brexit and the need for diversification of markets for our companies.Â Â  Â </p>  <p>  Let me be clear that the Government is extremely concerned about the current situation in Yemen, particularly as the humanitarian crisis continues to deteriorate.Â  Both the ongoing war and the growing cholera epidemic are having devastating consequences for the civilian population.Â  The EU is the largest humanitarian donor to Yemen and Ireland has contributed some &euro;10M to the EU&rsquo;s &euro;170M contribution to date.  I would also say that this is effectively a civil war and no one country is responsible for the misery there.Â  There are many countries involved but taking a hard line with one side or the other will not solve this complex war.</p></reply>

The Agreement includes provisions to ensure governments&rsquo; &ldquo;right to regulate&rdquo;.  CETA will not affect EU rules on food safety or the environment.  The Agreement explicitly excludes workers&rsquo; rights, environmental rights, health and safety regulations or similar public policy measures. </p>  <p>  Indeed, in CETA, the EU and Canada reaffirm their commitment to sustainable development and agree that further trade and investment should strengthen, not weaken, environmental protection and labour rights.Â </p>  <p>  Both the EU and Canada want CETA to help ensure that economic growth, social development, and environmental protection reinforce each other.  Therefore, CETA includes the EU's and Canada's obligations under international agreements on workers' rights and environmental and climate protection. </p>  <p>  When it comes to implementing the EU's and Canada's commitments in these areas, CETA gives a strong oversight role to civil society, including business associations, trade unions, consumer bodies, environmental groups and other non-governmental organisations. </p>  <p>  CETA will establish a Regulatory Cooperation Forum to discuss regulatory policy issues of mutual interest and develop bilateral cooperation activities.  By fostering cooperation earlier in the regulatory process, the Forum will enhance information sharing between Canadian and EU regulators, facilitate the development of more compatible regulatory measures, resulting in fewer barriers to trade, and making it easier for the EU to do business in Canada. </p>  <p>  The Regulatory Cooperation Forum will be a voluntary cooperation mechanism and any initiative entailing a change in EU regulations can only be introduced and pursued outside CETA, in compliance with the ordinary EU legislative procedure. </p>  <p>  Regarding the ratification of CETA, It is important to note that the provisions relating to investment protection and the Investment Court System (ICS) are excluded from provisional application.Â  Member States will not be bound by these provisions until they are ratified by all Member States in accordance with their national procedures.Â  In this regard, I have no immediate plans to ratify the Agreement given the Opinion of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the EU-Singapore case and the recent request by Belgium for an opinion from that Court on the compatibility of the Investment Court System with the European Treaties. </p></reply>

Since the first Action Plan for Jobs was launched in Q1 2012 the number of people in employment has increased by almost 225,000, while the unemployment rate has dropped from 15.2% to 6.0% in October this year.</p>  <p>  Between June 2015 and January 2016, my Department published eight Regional Action Plans for Jobs, aimed at raising employment levels in all regions including areas deemed by the CSO to be unemployment blackspots.  This initiative is a central pillar of the Government&rsquo;s ambition to create 200,000 new jobs by 2020, 135,000 of which are outside of Dublin. </p>  <p>  The primary objective of these plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020 and to ensure the unemployment rate of each region is within one percentage point of the State average.  Each plan contains a series of actions with timelines for delivery between 2015-2017, to be delivered through improved collaboration between enterprise agencies and other stakeholders supporting enterprise development in the regions.  These plans monitor progress and is reported to Government twice a year.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices and IDA Ireland are working to support the implementation of each region&rsquo;s action plan in order to start, grow and attract new business and employment.  Each agency has a suite of programmes and supports to that end.</p>  <p>  In May of this year, Enterprise Ireland launched a new &euro;60 million competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund.  This competitive fund is a key action to support the Regional Action Plans for Jobs and the Action Plan for Rural Development.  The Competitive Fund will support significant collaborative regional initiatives to build on specific industry sectoral strengths and improve enterprise capability, thereby driving job creation.  The evaluation process for the first call under the Regional Development Fund is still ongoing. It is anticipated that a second open competitive call will be launched in early 2018.</p>  <p>  The LEOs were established as the &lsquo;first-stop-shops&rsquo; for advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports for anyone who intends to start or grow their own business, they offer a range of supports available from 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) nationwide.  The LEOs provide a wide range of supports to existing businesses and entrepreneurs including grants, training, mentoring and access to loan finance through Microfinance Ireland.</p>  <p>  At least 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies and theÂ IDAÂ are constantly engaging with the current client base about expanding their operations here.Â  It should also be emphasised that FDI only forms one part of investment in regional locations.Â  Indigenous enterprise is responsible for a significant portion of employment growth, especially outside Dublin.Â  My Department and all its Agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and the LEOS, work together constantly and collaboratively to ensure that jobs and investment are spread fairly across this country.</p>  <p>  I should also mention, in relation to &lsquo;blackspots&rsquo; with a high concentration of unemployment, as identified in the Census, it is important to recognise that Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection services through Intreo are focused on unemployed individuals.Â  This meansÂ that those areas where unemployed individuals are most concentrated will also be the areas that receive a greater share of DESP income support payments and activation and employment services.</p>  <p>  Finally, I should mention that in the context of Budget 2018 a new &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme will provide affordable financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future.  The new scheme is open to all trading SMEs and large firms employing less than 500.  The scheme will see a sizeable reduction in interest rates charged for lending to circa 4%.  The new scheme will be delivered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) through commercial lenders, to get much needed low-cost working capital into Irish businesses.</p></reply>

The approach Â is to minimise risks and maximise opportunities by ensuring the growth and resilience of Irish enterprise post-Brexit working across four pillars:</p>  <p>  - Helping firms toÂ compete: We are working across Government to create the best environmentÂ  for business to grow, export and create jobs.  Key elements include:ensuring that firms have access to finance; ensuring that our tax regimeÂ and infrastructure spend promote national competitiveness; and that theÂ Agencies are appropriately resourced to help business focus onÂ competitiveness at firm level.</p>  <p>  - Enabling firms toÂ Â innovate: As part of our strategy to become a Global Innovation Leader, we are targeting R&amp;D funding through our Agencies.  We want to supportÂ Â innovation in new products and processes which firms will need if they areÂ to compete, grow and invest in the pipeline of the next generation ofÂ innovators through a new postgraduate researcher programme.</p>  <p>  - Supporting firms toÂ trade: We are supporting firms to: start exporting; grow their exports inÂ existing markets; and diversify into new markets and regions.  We willÂ continue to attract overseas investment while working with EU partners toÂ expand the portfolio of Free Trade Agreements.</p>  <p>  - Negotiating for the bestÂ possible outcome: We are working across government to ensure we get theÂ best outcome possible for business from Brexit negotiations.  DBEI isÂ leading a range of Brexit research projects which will provide an extensive evidence base to inform and guide Ireland&rsquo;s position within the EU-27.</p>  <p>  Northern Ireland accounts for aboutÂ  twelve percent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for about eight per cent of imports.Â  Given that the population of Northern Ireland makes up less than three per cent of the UK total, this shows the closeness of the economic ties between the two jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  It is therefore very important that we understand the implications of Brexit on this trade and that we have a strong evidence-based analysis to inform policy decisions. Â Accordingly, in partnership with InterTrade Ireland, the cross border body which my Department co-funds, we have initiated a major research project, with the analysis being undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute.</p>  <p>  Phase 1 of this analysis used data on WTO baseline tariff rates, sectoral price elasticities and non-tariff barrier costs, to generate estimates on the range of possible impacts for the type of products currently being traded.Â  It considered a range of tariff and exchange rate scenarios.  The results presented,Â show a very significant adverse impact on levels of cross border trade, especially in the Agri-food sector.Â  It is important to note that theseÂ are the worst case scenarios if no trade agreement is in place.  Obviously, our stated Government intention is to ensure negotiations mitigate these impacts.Â  This report was publishedÂ  in July last.Â </p>  <p>  The secondÂ  phase of the research, currently nearing completion, is examining the concentration of North-South trade, how the structure changed over time, the patterns of intermediate inputs and final products, the frequency with which new products are introduced, and how product composition compares to other markets. Â The third phase, to commence shortly, Â will look at issues relating to services trade between both jurisdictions as opposed to goods trade.</p></reply>

A closer examination of the research and analysis behind the findings and the associated underlying assumptions would be required before I could make further comment on the specifics of the data quoted by the Deputy.  In addition, as the Deputy is aware,Â issues relating to income tax are a matter for the Minister for Finance.</p>  <p>  As regards the core issue raised however, it is the case that delivering sustainable employment and higher standards of living for all is theÂ central objective of enterprise policy as set out by my Department in Enterprise 2025.  This means creating the environment for quality jobs, enabling flexibility without exploitation, and a regulatory environment that remains attuned to changing work organization and society over the coming decade.</p>  <p>  The enterprise agencies IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland (EI), together with the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are focused on the creation of quality employment, taking into account the multidimensional aspects that define quality: ensuring opportunities for advancement that includes workplace learning and development; ensuring that people are educated and trained to meet the needs of industry; and recognizing the opportunities presented by entrepreneurship as an alternative career path.</p>  <p>  IDA is targeting a minimum increase in investment of 30 to 40 percent in the South-East region over the period of its strategy to 2019.  IDA positions the South East in the market place as an investment location with a strong ecosystem of both indigenous and multinational companies operating across a diverse range of sectors, includingÂ clusters in the Life Sciences and Financial Services/Business Services sectors, and strong FDI Engineering manufacturing businesses.</p>  <p>  At the end of 2016, there were 13,369 employed at 72 IDA companies in the South-East region.</p>  <p>  EI continues to engage with its 530 client companies in the South East to help establish their clients&rsquo; business needs and deliver quality jobs.  In 2016, over 20,000 people were employed in EI supported companies in the South East.</p>  <p>  In 2016, a total of 1,283 gross jobs were created by companies that have been supported by the LEOs in the South-East.  Total employment among the South-East LEO clients was 6,690 at the end of last year.Â  </p>  <p>  Key to deliveringÂ on the visionÂ set out in Enterprise 2025 is that we optimize the job creation potential of our regions, building on distinctive strengths and assets, and that is the aim of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs launched by my Department in 2015.</p>  <p>  These Regional Plans are crucial to meeting the Government&rsquo;s ambition to create an additional 200,000 jobs, of which 135,000 are outside the Dublin region by 2020. </p>  <p>  What the regional action plans can do is get things working from the bottom up, in partnership with the enterprise sector and other regional actors, building and reinforcingÂ local strengths.</p>  <p>  The South-East Action Plan for Jobs aims to increase employment in the region by 10-15% over the period to 2020, resulting in delivery of 25,000 jobs. </p>  <p>  In addition to the FDI investment target increase of 30-40 percent, the South East Plan also aims to achieve a 25 percent increase in the number of start-ups in the region, improve the scaling performance of companies by 25 percent and improve the 5 year survival rate of companies by 25 percent.</p>  <p>  The Local Authorities, enterprise agencies, and other key public and private sector stakeholders in the region have been strongly involved in, and are key drivers of, the South-East Action Plan.  In addition, the Regional APJ Implementation Committee is working with the South East Regional Skills Forum to assess and respond to the skills needs of industry and prospective employees in the region.</p>  <p>  As a result of a focused collaborative approach and a range of reforms, there has been a substantial improvement in the South-East region since the commencement of the National Action Plan for Jobs in 2012, with an additional 33,600 in employment in Q2 2017 compared to Q1 2012. </p>  <p>  There are now 13,000 more people in work in the region since the launch of the Regional Action Plan initiative in Q1 2015.</p>  <p>  The sectors which showed the highest employment growth since 2015 were Construction, Professional, scientific and technical activities and the Hospitality sector.</p>  <p>  In addition, the unemployment rate in the South-East region has fallen from 12.8% in Q1 2015 to 8.1% in Q2 of this year</p>  <p>  However, there is still work to be done: the unemployment rate in the South East is still over 1 percentage point higher than the (Q2 2017) national average of 6.4%.</p>  <p>  To complement the Regional Action Plan for Jobs process, Enterprise Ireland, with the support of my Department, in May, launched a Regional Enterprise Development Fund of up to &euro;60 million to grow and sustain jobs across the regions over a four-year period.  The Fund aims to support significant regional initiatives, to build on sectoral strengths and to improve enterprise capability.  An announcement of successful projects under the first call should take place by year end.</p>  <p>  Collaboration is key to the success of employment initiatives such as the South East Action Plan for Jobs, and I want to promote the idea of people working together in the region to come up with new ideas, including those that could be considered under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund.</p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;150m is also being made available to the IDA to support its Regional Property Programme and drive job creation in the multi-national sector. </p></reply>

There have been five cycles of the PRTLI to date and approximately &euro;1.2bn of public and private funding has been invested since the commencement of the programme in 1998.  PRTLI has complemented other research funding programmes of Government, including &euro;162m in  funding provided by my Department through Science Foundation Ireland in 2017.</p>  <p>  Our strategy for, research and development, Science and Technology (SFI) Innovation 2020, includes an action to scope out and develop a successor to PRTLI to support new investment in research infrastructure.  It also contains an action to increase the enrolment of PhD and Research Master students.  The creation of additional physical space for research and funding for structured programmes for postgraduate researchers are two key elements associated with previous cycles of PRTLI.</p>  <p>  In the context of Budget 2018, I announced additional funding would be made available through my Department to address the need for a PhD and Research Master&rsquo;s programme.  This programme will fund 150 new enrolments in disciplines aligned to enterprise and national needs and is to be rolled out through SFI.  Further details of the new programme will be provided by SFI in the coming months.  I envisage that further additional funding will be provided in 2019 and subsequent years to continue growing this programme and to allow for new student intake in subsequent years.</p>  <p>  In relation to research infrastructure, in the context of Budget 2018, the Minister for Education and Skills also announced a range of measures addressing physical infrastructure and human capital development in the higher education sector, including for research.  This includes &euro;21m for the Irish Research Council to increase the pipeline of researchers across all disciplines and &euro;200 million for Public Private Partnerships, with a focus on physical capital needs across the Institute of Technology sector.  It also includes an additional &euro;257 million over the period 2018 to 2021 for higher education institutions to expand research capacity and upgrade campus infrastructure.</p>  <p>  The funding announcements made by my Department and the Minister for Education and Skills in the context of Budget 2018 will allow the Government to continue making investments that will address objectives encompassed by previous cycles of PRTLI. </p>  <p>  In addition, SFI also holds regular research infrastructure calls.

This Government&rsquo;s goal is to have an additional 200,000 people at work by 2020, including 135,000 jobs outside of Dublin.  Since the first Action Plan for Jobs was launched in early 2012: </p>  <p>  - There are over 225,000 more people at work bringing total employment in the State to almost 2,063,000 in the first half of the year; </p>  <p>  - The number of unemployed fell by 180,400, a 56% reduction,Â leading to a reduction of the unemployment rate from 15.2% at the beginning for 2012 to 6.0 % in October 2017; and</p>  <p>  - In 2016,Â the Agencies under my Department's remit - LEOs, EI and IDA Ireland - supported the net creation ofÂ almost 24,800Â jobs.Â  Two thirds of new jobs created byÂ EIÂ supported companies and over half of those created by IDA supported companies were outside Dublin in 2016. </p>  <p>  Unemployment is decreasing in all regions.  As set out in our enterprise strategy, Enterprise 2025, we want to progressively address the gaps between the potential and the performance of our regions and ensure that the unemployment rate in each region is within 1% of the State average.  This has been achieved in 6 of our eight regions, with good progress also being made inÂ the Midland and the South East regions.</p>  <p>  In addition to the cross-government initiatives in theÂ Action Plan for Jobs, the reduction of regional disparities is being pursued with the Regional Action Plans for Jobs (RAPJ).  Developed over the last two years, their objective is to mobilise the regional economic development partners in the eight former NUTS 3 regions around the country to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020.  Each Regional Plan is being driven and overseen by a Regional Implementation Committee, led in most cases by senior industrialists from the Regions and good progress is being made. </p>  <p>  The National Planning Framework being developed by the Minister of Housing, Planning and Local Government will also play a role in addressing regional disparities: it will set out a national overarching vision and expectations around development and growth for Ireland over the coming decades.  Strategic long term planning that integrates enterprise, spatial and infrastructure investment planning offers the potential to create places of quality that businesses will want to invest in, and that people will want to live, work, and learn in. </p>  <p>  In developing the annual Action Plan for Jobs, we have consistently sought to ensure that we are supporting the creation of good quality jobs and that individuals are incentivised and rewarded to take-up those jobs and thereby &lsquo;making work pay&rsquo;.  This Action Plan for Jobs 2018, will focus on new and more strategic actions that will have a significant impact on sustainable job creation. and contribute to creating the right environment for continued job growth and retention right across the country. </p></reply>

The employment situation in the South East has been steadily improving in recent years.  I am pleased that there has been a substantial increase in job creation in the region since the commencement of the National Action Plan for Jobs in 2012, with an additional 33,600 in employment in Q2 2017 compared to Q1 2012. </p>  <p>  Overall, there are now 13,000 more people in work in the South East region since the launch of the Regional Action Plan initiative in Q1 2015.  This initiative is a central pillar of the Government&rsquo;s ambition to create 200,000 new jobs by 2020, 135,000 of which are outside of Dublin.  The core objective of the Plans is to see a further 10 to 15% at work across each region by 2020. Â The South-East Action Plan for Jobs has been developed on the basis of a series of consultations with stakeholders in the region, identifying particular strengths and opportunities in the South East.Â  The South East APJ is monitoring a number of emerging projects with potential for job creation and enterprise opportunity in the region in the future.Â  For example: </p>  <p>  - The APJ committee is working with the South East Regional Skills Forum to assess and respond to the skills needs of industry in the region; </p>  <p>  - A new value proposition for the region to promote the South East as a great place to live and work is being developed; </p>  <p>  - AÂ South East Micro Food Export Initiative aimed at assisting micro food companies has been developed by the South East LEOs and will be launched shortly.</p>  <p>  My Department and agencies, including IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs, continue to workÂ together to implement this plan. </p>  <p>  Looking ahead, the IDA is targeting - as part of its 2015-2019 strategy -Â an increase of investment in the South-East region of 30% to 40% by 2019.  To achieve this,Â the Agency will continueÂ to draw the attention of potential investorsÂ to the region's particular strengths.  These include the South East's accessibility, its ports and its existing cluster of medical technology firms.  The Agency will work closely with its existing clients in the region to help strengthen and potentially grow their respective workforces. </p>  <p>  In terms of site visit statistics, whilst they can be a useful indicator of new investment interest, they are not by any means indicative of the potential for FDI in an area.Â  I would point out in this regard, that at least 70% of investment comes from existing IDA Ireland clients.Â  Regular engagement and collaboration with stakeholders is important in positioning any regional location to attract FDI and in this respect the IDAÂ continues to work with all stakeholders and potential clients as well as working with existing clients in all regional locations to generate additional jobs.  However, the final decision on where to locate an investment is always decided by the client and not by the IDA.Â Â </p>  <p>  While more work remains to be done in the wider South East region - the overall employment trend in the area is one of steady improvement.Â  My Department andÂ its Agencies will continueÂ to doÂ their utmost to ensure that further progress is made in the time ahead in terms of creating more jobs and reducing unemployment further.Â </p></reply>

The outcome of the index for North Meath and for many other areas serves to underline the importance of maintaining a strong focus on local and regional economic development.</p>  <p>  The Mid East Action Plan for Jobs is a key policy response for supporting employment growth in the Mid East region, including County Meath, with public and private stakeholders currentlyÂ engaged in delivering the range of innovative and practical actions set out in the Plan. Â </p>  <p>  The first two Progress Reports on the implementation of the Action Plan show that good progress is being made: there are now 12,800 more people at work across Meath, Kildare, and Wicklow since the launch of the Regional Action Plan initiative in Q1 2015.  The core objective of the Plan is to see a further 25,000 at work in the region by 2020 and to reduce the unemployment rate to within 1% of the State average.</p>  <p>  Small and micro-businesses areÂ key to sustainingÂ local and rural economies.  In 2016, theÂ Local Enterprise Office (LEO) Meath supported 207Â small and micro-businesses employing 927 people in the county, and approved 25 grants &ndash; feasibility, priming and business expansion &ndash; in total for the year, to a value of almostÂ &euro;300,000.Â  LEO Meath will continue to act as the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own businesses in the county.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;4m capital fundingÂ was made availableÂ for the LEOs for 2017 which has, and will continue to fund, a range of measures put in place to supplement LEO Brexit supports.  A furtherÂ  &euro;4m in capital funding has been allocated to the LEOs in 2018, and will ensure that a suite of LEO Brexit supports are available to micro and small businesses through the 31 LEOs, including LEO Meath.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has 168 client companies in Meath, which it has supported with investment of &euro;7 million in the period 2014 -2016.  In 2016, 7,000 people were employed in Enterprise Ireland supported companies in County Meath, with a gross gain of 550 jobs over that year.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has also co-funded the establishment of 3 Community Enterprise Centres in Meath, and in 2016 awarded funding to Meath Enterprise Centre under the Community Enterprise Initiative Scheme to develop a food innovation and research centre and a digital media hub.</p>  <p>  To further support enterprise development across all regions, additional funding of up to &euro;60m is being rolled out by Enterprise Ireland over the next 4 years under the competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund, which will support the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.  Additional funding of &euro;150m is also being made available to the IDA to support its Regional Property Programme and drive job creation in the multi-national sector.</p>  <p>  The IDA is making significant progress towards achieving its regional development targets, which include a 30% to 40% increase in FDI in the Mid-East Region which incorporates Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  There are now 56 multinational companies based in this region, 17 of which are located in Meath, employing 1,500 staff.  Recent announcements from companies such as Shire and Facebook demonstrate both existing companies&rsquo; commitment to continue investing in the county, as well as the county&rsquo;s attractiveness for new investments.</p>  <p>  The IDA is committed to increasing investment in Meath through ensuring an adequate supply of modern property solutions and supporting the development of the county&rsquo;s FDI base.  The Agency is also encouraging its client base there to undertake further investment projects.  The IDA will continue to work with local authorities and other relevant agencies to support the development of further quality infrastructure in the County.</p></reply>

Those efforts are focused on minimising risks and maximising opportunities by ensuring the growth and resilience of Irish enterprise across the following four pillars:</p><p><b>- Helping firms to compete:</b>The Government is taking a cross-Departmental approach to create the conditions necessary for companies to expand, export and create jobs.  This includes providing access to finance, our tax regime and infrastructure spend, as well as ensuring that enterprise agencies are appropriately resourced to assist companies in their drive for competitiveness.</p><p><b>- Enabling firms to innovate:</b>As part of our strategy to become a Global Innovation Leader, we are targeting R&amp;amp;D funding through our Agencies to support innovation in new products and processes which firms need to compete and grow and to invest in the next generation of innovators.</p><p><b>- Supporting firms to trade:</b>We are supporting firms to start exporting, to grow their exports in existing markets and to diversify into new markets and regions.  We will continue to attract overseas investment while working with EU partners to expand the portfolio of Free Trade Agreements.</p><p><b>- Negotiating for the best possible outcome:</b>We are working across Government to ensure we get the best outcome possible for business from Brexit negotiations.  My Department is leading a range of Brexit research projects which will provide an extensive evidence base and valuable analysis to inform and guide Ireland&rsquo;s position within the EU-27.</p><p>To underpin this strategy, as part of Budget 2018, a new &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme will provide affordable financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future.  The new scheme is open to all trading SMEs and large firms employing less than 500.  The scheme will see a sizeable reduction in interest rates charged for lending to circa 4%.  The new scheme will be delivered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) through commercial lenders, to get much needed low-cost working capital into Irish businesses. </p><p>My Department is also exploring the development of a longer-term Business Development Loan Scheme which would assist firms in long term investing for a post-Brexit environment.  My Department is also scoping the development of a Business Advisory Hub which would assist SMEs to make informed funding/investment decisions and helps them avail of private market solutions or existing State supports.</p><p>Budget 2018 also provides for an additional &euro;3 million in funding for enterprise agencies to allow for the recruitment of a further 40-50 Brexit-related staff.  This will ensure a joined-up response to Brexit and help Irish exporters to grow their international sales and diversify their markets, and to secure new investments for Ireland.  Those enterprise agencies serve a vital role in equipping SMEs for the challenges posed by Brexit.Â  Through those agencies, the following supports are available or will be available:</p><p><b>1. Enterprise Ireland (EI)</b></p><p>The suite of supports that EI offers to Irish businesses in the SME sector is broad, encompassing leadership, management development and training, internationalisation, productivity, RD&amp;amp;I, capital investment and access to finance. </p><p>EI will continue to regularly engage on a one-to-one basis with clients to support their preparations for Brexit.  In addition, it promotes awareness and preparation for Brexit through the Brexit SME scorecard, an interactive online platform developed by EI and open to all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit.  It will promote export ambition and market diversification through the Global Ambition Campaign, will deliver an extensive programme of trade missions, market access programmes and other schemes in support of market diversification, and will roll out the #IrishAdvantage campaign to promote the attractiveness of Irish goods and services in export markets.</p><p>In addition, EI will ensure that our regions maximise their potential to grow and scale resilient Irish companies through the Regional Enterprise Development Fund.  This regional competitive fund is designed to support the ambition, goals and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.  EI, with the support of my Department, is leading in the development and implementation of this Fund of up to &euro;60m. </p><p><b>2.Â IDA </b></p><p>IDA Ireland is constantly engaged with clients across its entire portfolio.  Brexit has become a significant feature of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy spanning all of its activities, including operations activities, overseas, finance, planning marketing and promotion departments.Â  </p><p>IDA Ireland continues to work on ensuring that the Agency&rsquo;s strategy is fit for purpose in light of Brexit and will continue: </p><p>- To work with its existing client base to assist and support them in their growth and expansion in Ireland.Â  </p><p>- To highlight Ireland&rsquo;s continued strong offering based on talent, ease of doing business, its competitive and transparent taxation regime, English as the spoken language and critically Ireland&rsquo;s continued access to the EU market </p><p>- To be in contact with clients, and prospective clients across the globe and continue to market a competitive value proposition to attract mobile foreign investment from global locations including the UK. </p><p><b>3.Â InterTrade Ireland </b></p><p>InterTrade Ireland (ITI), the Cross-border Body which my Department co-funds, assists businesses in Ireland to address the particular commercial challenges that Brexit may present for cross-border business.  That Body already has developed considerable experience in promoting and strengthening North-South trade.Â  The Government provided &euro;250,000 in additional funding to ITI this year to allow it to undertake a range of initiatives aimed at better preparing Irish SMEs.  This included the introduction of a Brexit readiness voucher scheme, strengthening the body's capacity to deliver expert advice, provision of information sessions and building awareness amongst SMEs of Brexit-related challenges.  It also involves capability building and the provision of other specialist expertise. </p><p><b>4.Â Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs)</b></p><p>LEOs provide access to a range of supports for small businesses.  These include innovation vouchers, trading online vouchers, lean start and management development supports.</p><p>As a result of the additional &euro;4m in capital funding secured in Budget 2017 and maintained in 2018, a suite of LEO Brexit supports are available to small and micro businesses through the 31 LEOs nationwide.  These supports, which are aimed at strengthening the capacity of small and micro businesses to better cope with the changing external environment, especially Brexit, include:</p><p>- A suite of online information addressing practical issues aimed at micro-enterprises;</p><p>- A &lsquo;Technical Assistance for Micro-enterprises&rsquo; grant designed to support qualifying businesses to diversify into new markets, enabling companies to explore and develop new market opportunities;</p><p>- A &lsquo;Lean for Micro&rsquo; programme available nationwide to help small businesses become more efficient and competitive;</p><p>- A &lsquo;LEO Innovation and Investment Fund&rsquo; pilot programme to support innovation in micro-enterprises and to help them become investor ready so that they can scale their businesses;</p><p>- Tailored mentoring to address Brexit-related business challenges.</p></reply>

This is not least because the link between the cost of housing and wage expectations means that developments in the residential property sector impact on our international competitiveness and on our ability to compete for mobile talent.</p>  <p>  The Government is fully committed to increasing the supply of affordable and quality housing.  That is why it has published the &lsquo;Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan&rsquo; which includes financing measures, better use of existing homes, new construction and rental sector improvements.  We are now one year into the plan and many key actions have been delivered or put in train, and, thankfully, it is clear from a range of housing related trends that the supply response is coming on stream.Â  All key indicators of construction activity show that residential construction is ramping up considerably.  Planning permissions are up by almost 50% year on year and the ESRI&rsquo;s latest commentary in October forecasts that house completions will reach 19,000 this year and 24,000 in 2018; on this basis, the Rebuilding Ireland target of 25,000 homes per year by 2020 will be met and quite likely exceeded.</p>  <p>  These steps will serve to reinforce our national infrastructure in terms of its capacity to accommodate further FDI.</p>  <p>  More long term theÂ Department of Housing Planning and Local GovernmentÂ (DHPLG) are developing the National Planning Framework (NPF).  My Department's in-depth engagement in the development of the NPF over the last 18 months provides an example of efforts to attract foreign direct investment being considered in terms of wider capacity and policy to provide infrastructure and housing.  The NPF is a critically important framework for the period to 2040 that will underpin Ireland&rsquo;s future economic development.Â  Â </p></reply>

The unemployment rate is now 6 percent, and well over 2 million people working every day.Â </p>  <p>  There have been significant global developments over recent years that present considerable challenge.  These include developments in relation to international tax as well as Brexit and potential changes in US policies.  Nevertheless, we need to remain ambitious and to continue to implement policies that support economic growth.Â </p>  <p>  More specifically in relation to your question, the issue ofÂ tax planning by multinational companies is a global problem that requires a global solution.Â  Ireland continues to take an active role in global work to reform the international corporate tax system.  An update on Ireland&rsquo;s International Tax StrategyÂ was published with Budget 2018 and provides concrete evidence of the measures already undertaken by Ireland to ensure that we continue to meet the highest international standards in corporation tax.Â  Ireland&rsquo;s regime continues to provide certainty, is stable and competitive and is internationally recognised as one of the most transparent in the world. </p>  <p>  That said, it is important to recognise that tax is just one aspect of Ireland&rsquo;s offering.Â Â Our enterprise policies ensure that Ireland offers a compelling location from which to do business, bothÂ for our indigenous companies and for foreign direct investment.  Our policy focus isÂ based on delivering real economic substance -Â underpinned by a supportive business environment,Â investments in innovation, access to the skills needed by enterprise in the 21st century and internationally recognisedÂ clusters in key sectors. Â Â </p>  <p>  As a small open economy, Ireland operates in an environment of continuous and fast-paced change globally.  Through the work of the enterprise development agencies we continue to scan the horizon for new market opportunities.  WeÂ support our enterprises to build capabilities to innovate, to develop new products and services and to compete effectively internationally.Â  WeÂ support our indigenous enterprises to diversify export markets.  We continuously seek out new sources of FDI and aim to build further on 'new names', new source countries and opportunities presented post Brexit.</p>  <p>  Ireland has proven its abilities in the past toÂ adapt and respond to external drivers of change.  Today's environment is perhaps one of the most challenging Ireland has experienced for some time. Â I have asked my executives to undertake a review of Enterprise 2025 in this context and to report early 2018. </p>  <p>  I want to ensure that our enterprise policies remain robust, that we deepen resilience and are prepared for whatever challenges come our way.  It is not necessarily easy - butÂ I am confident that we have an excellent track record, strong technology-rich Irish owned companies, and an attractiveÂ location from which to trade internationally.

Â Under the terms of the 2014 -2020 RAGS, regions covering 51.28% of Ireland&rsquo;s population are designated as &lsquo;assisted areas&rsquo;.Â </p><p>Being located in an assisted area does not confer any right to financial assistance.Â  Grants under Regional Aid come from the exchequer, i.e. there is no EU or other external funding.</p><p>Regional Aid is paid in the form of grants by the industrial development agencies in order to support new investment and new employment in productive projects. Â Regional aid is also provided by other Departments under schemes for tourism grants, marine tourism, urban and rural renewal and other tax-based development schemes.</p><p>All counties have been designated apart from Dublin City and County, Cork City and County and the Mid-East generally, i.e. Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.</p><p>The only exceptions to the Mid East&rsquo;s exclusion is the designation of the following three Local Electoral Areas, which contain Electoral Divisions with amongst the highest unemployment rates in the country.Â  The three exceptions in the Mid-East that have been designated are Kells, Athy and Arklow.</p><p>In respect of Kells, the Deputy is correct in acknowledging an improvement in the aid rate applicable for eligible projects.Â  This specifically relates to the aid rates for capital employment support under the regional aid guidelines of 10%, 20% and 30% for small medium and large companies for the period 2014-2020.Â  All projects are subject to assessment in terms of commercial, technical and market due diligence and should represent value for money in terms of the State&rsquo;s investment.</p><p>As Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, my priority is to drive the creation of high-quality and sustainable employment across Ireland, including in County Meath. Â We are making significant progress towards achieving our regional development targets, which include a 30% to 40% increase in FDI in the Mid-East Region which incorporates Meath, Kildare and Wicklow. Â There are now 56 multinational companies based in this region, 17 of which are located in Meath, employing 1,496 staff.</p><p>The IDA is committed to increasing investment in Meath through ensuring an adequate supply of modern property solutions and supporting the development of the County&rsquo;s FDI base.  The Agency is also encouraging its client base there to undertake further investment projects.  The IDA will continue to workÂ with local authorities and other relevant agencies to support the development of further quality infrastructure in the County.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland engages with established client companies in Meath through teams of sectoral focused development advisors using a company led diagnostic approach which is used to establish clients&rsquo; business needs.  Based on this, the agency can tailor a support package to the company&rsquo;s growth potential based on their ambition, capability and need.  A support package focuses, where relevant, on six business pillars (Innovation, Finance, Operations, Sales and Marketing, People and Organisational Development).  Enterprise Ireland is actively working with established clients on a one-on-one basis to deliver this client engagement model. Enterprise Ireland has approximately 500 clients in the Mid-East, of this 168 are located in Meath.  The Agency has supported client companies in Meath with an investment of &euro;7 million in the period 2014 -2016.</p><p>In 2016, 7,007 people were employed in Enterprise Ireland supported companies in County Meath.Â  </p><p>Enterprise Ireland has co-funded, with local enterprise development groups, 157 Community Enterprise Centres across the country totaling &euro;64 million.  There is now a Community Enterprise Centre located in every county.<b></b>These centers collectively employ approximately 6,000 people across 1,200 companies and are key hubs of enterprise activity in many areas.  In Meath, Enterprise Ireland has co-funded the establishment of 3 Community Enterprise Centres.</p><p>In 2016, the Local Enterprise Office (LEO) in Meath approved 25 grants to support business development, to a value of &euro;293,998. Â The LEO Office also ran training courses for 427 participants, provided mentoring services for 229 participants and supported 22 applications for loan finance to MicroFinance Ireland.</p></reply>

CSO figures show that the unemployment rate in WexfordÂ has decreased fromÂ 16,170 in 2011 to 11,478 in 2016, a reduction of almost 5,000 people. </p>  <p>  This overallÂ positive employmentÂ trend is reflectedÂ by the levels ofÂ FDI-driven employment in the County.  There are currently 17Â IDA IrelandÂ clientsÂ based there, employing a total of 2,630 people.Â  Moreover,Â 2016 witnessedÂ an increaseÂ of 6% in IDA client companyÂ employment over 2015.Â  The longer-term trends in WexfordÂ are also encouraging: since 2009 there has been a 22% increase in total in employment in IDA Ireland supported companies.</p>  <p>  Since 2012 there have been 717 newly created jobs by IDA Ireland supported clients in Wexford, this resulted in 244 total net new jobs bringing the total employed in IDA Ireland supported companies to 2,630 in 17 supported companies. </p>  <p>  Examples of successes in the County Wexford include Clearstream Technologies Limited, a medical devices manufacturer, who announced at the end of 2014 the completion of a 50,000 sq. ft. extension to its existing facility.Â  Since its acquisition in 2011 by CR Bard Inc., the US-based medical device manufacturer, has added 160 jobs to its workforce, bringing its current headcount to approximately 400 people.Â  The completed expansion which is expected to support growth through 2019, will give the company the potential to accommodate up new positions as required.</p>  <p>  Other positive examples of existing employers in the County include, Lake Region in New Ross employing approximately over 700 people, and Waters Technology, Wexford town &ndash; employing approximately 250 people.  In addition, service operations such as Equifax (Rosslare), BNY Mellon (Drinagh) and Indos Financial (New Ross) all form a positive employment framework in Wexford employing between them in the region of 350 people.</p>  <p>  Looking ahead, IDA Ireland is targeting - as part of its 2015-2019 strategy -Â an increase of investment in all regions outside Dublin, including the South East, of 30% to 40% by 2019.  To achieve this,Â the Agency will continueÂ to draw the attention of potential investorsÂ to the region's particular strengths.  These include the South East's accessibility, its ports and its existing cluster of medical technology firms.Â </p>  <p>  The provision of available property solutions is also very important from an FDI perspective and in this respect there are three IDA Ireland sites and one private finance facility available to market in Wexford. Â In 2016 there were seven site visits to Wexford with a further five to date this year. IDA IrelandÂ continues to highlight the benefits ofÂ expanding or locating in the regions to its client base and it makes every effort to ensure thatÂ FDI is spread as widely as possible across the country.  It is important toÂ remember, however,Â that the final decision as to where to invest always rests with the company concerned.  It is also the case that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as at least 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA Ireland client companies.Â Â </p>  <p>  While FDI can play a huge role in increasing economic activity and reducing unemployment it is important to recognize it cannot form the sole economic development strategy for Wexford.Â  Indigenous companies also have a strongÂ presence inÂ Wexford.Â In 2016, Enterprise Ireland supported companies in the County employed 4,816 people.  Enterprise Ireland has also funded two Community Enterprise Centres there whichÂ serve asÂ important enterprise hubs.  Local enterprise also continues to perform well and the Wexford Local Enterprise Office successfully secured funding for five projects under Enterprise Ireland's Competitive Fund for LEOs.  Two otherÂ projects from within the county were also awarded funding under Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Community Enterprise Initiative Scheme 2016.  These projects included a South East Shared Asset collaborative project to expand the range of services in the South-East region.Â  </p>  <p>  My Department andÂ its Agencies will continueÂ to doÂ their utmost to ensure that further progress is made in the time ahead in terms of creating more jobs and reducing unemployment further.</p></reply>

Â Â Â </p>  <p>  I believe the statistics the Deputy is referring to in his question are those contained in the 2018 Budget Day/Expenditure Report which refers to the 435,000 Agency supported jobs verified by the AES at the end of 2016.Â  The Expenditure Report reflects that my ambition is to grow this to 470,000 directly supported jobs during 2018.Â  This would mean that over the course of 2017 and 2018, 35,000 jobs would be created by EI, IDA Ireland and the LEOs.Â </p>  <p>  Progress towards this target to date is good and employment continues to grow strongly.  Encouragingly, the unemployment rate has fallen in all regions in the past year while, during the same period, more than three out of every four new jobs created were outside Dublin. Â </p>  <p>  EI, IDA Ireland and the LEOs publish their yearly targets as part of the Action Plan for Jobs (APJ) process.Â  Through the APJ the Government has committed to creating 200,000 new jobs by 2020, with 135,000 of these to be located outside of Dublin.  As part of the APJ process the Government aims to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the unemployment rate of each region to be brought within one per cent of the national average. Â </p>  <p>  Each of the Agencies have their own strategies targeting this ambitious levels of job creation over the coming years.Â  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2017-2020 aims to create 60,000 jobs, while sustaining existing ones, which will make an important contribution to economic growth across all regions of Ireland. Â </p>  <p>  As part of its 2015-2019 strategy IDA Ireland aims to create 80,000 new jobs and 900 new investments in the period from 2015 to 2019 &ndash; which would bring total Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) employment in Ireland to 209,000.  I am pleased that over the first two years, the Agency is delivering well ahead of those targets with 2016 being a record year for FDI investment in Ireland.  IDA client companies created nearly 19,000 new jobs during the year across a range of sectors, with every region of Ireland benefitting.  This strong performance has continued into 2017 and investments approved by the Agency in the first half of this year will lead to the creation of 11,000 jobs &ndash; this compares with 9,000 for the equivalent period in 2016.Â </p>  <p>  The LEO 2016 annual jobs survey results highlighted three consecutive years of local jobs growth throughout the country: with a net increase of 3,679 jobs and total direct employment among LEO client companies standing at 34,634.Â </p>  <p>  Last year collectively the Agencies under my Departments remit - LEOs, EI and IDA Ireland - were responsible for the creation of almost 46,000 jobs with 28,000 of these outside Dublin.Â  An additional 66,100 jobs were created during 2016, well in excess of the APJ 2016 target of 50,000 new jobs.Â  The numbers in employment increased in all regions during 2016 with 70% of the new jobs added in 2016, or 46,270 jobs based outside Dublin. Â </p>  <p>  Through EI, IDA Ireland and the LEOs 70 new jobs are being created per day and over 50,000 new jobs have been delivered in the past two years.Â  I am confident, on the basis of the excellent progress made to date, that total Agency supported employment will grow to 470,000 by 2018.</p></reply>

The ISDS system has been theÂ cause ofÂ controversy in our recentÂ Trade negotiations.  I believe that the Commission has rightly addressed the concerns raised.Â  Their proposal is forÂ an independent investmentÂ system, consisting of a permanent tribunal and an appeal tribunal competent to review decisions of the tribunal. Dispute settlement proceedings will be conducted in a transparent and impartial manner. Â Provisions for the application of such a system have been included in more recent draft Free Trade Agreements (FTAs).</p>  <p>  ICS goes a long way to meet the concerns on transparency, legitimacy and public interests.  The ICS system is composed of a first instance tribunal and an appeal mechanism based on clearly defined rules and operating on similar principles to the WTO Appellate Body, with qualified judges and transparent proceedings.  The ability of investors to take a case before the Tribunal is precisely defined and limited to cases such as targeted discrimination on the base of gender, race or religion, nationality, expropriation without compensation, or denial of justice.  Forum&ndash;shopping (i.e. presenting a legal case to be heard in the court thought most likely to provide a favourable judgment) will not be possible.  Claims deemed to be frivolous will be dismissed quickly, and multiple and parallel proceedings will be avoided. </p>  <p>  Also, clear distinction between international law and domestic law will be maintained.Â  Further,Â domestic law/governmental right to regulate will maintain precedence.</p>  <p>  TheÂ ICS also includes additional improvements on access to the new system by small and medium sized companies - SMEs - allowing them to enjoy privileged treatment in comparison with large multinational companies. </p>  <p>  The implications of the ICS for Ireland are positiveÂ asÂ they bring greater clarity to Irish business, especially SMEs,Â on the modalities ofÂ an open and transparent dispute resolution systemÂ as well asÂ confirming that a State can never be forced to change legislation, only to pay fair compensation in cases where the investor is deemed to have been treated unfairly.</p>  <p>  The aim of the European Commission is to establish a multilateral court, modelled on arbitrator panels currently operating under the WTO, and other Investment Tribunals.Â  It will build on the EU's approach on its bilateral FTAs and be a major departure from the system of investor-to-State dispute settlement (ISDS) based on ad hoc commercial arbitration.Â  The recently concluded EU-Canada trade agreement - CETA - and the EU-Vietnam trade agreement both contain a reference to the establishment of a permanent multilateral investment court.  Work continues at EU level on this matter.</p></reply>

In advance of the Referendum my Department conducted a contingency risk assessment of the potential impacts of Brexit across policy areas of my Department.  Given that the EU&rsquo;s initial negotiating position is now clear, all of Government is intensifying its focus on the economic implications of Brexit, including on domestic policy measures to reinforce the competitiveness of the Irish economy, to protect it from potential negative impacts of Brexit, and to pursue all possible opportunities (e.g. foreign direct investment) that might arise.  My Department is central to the Government wide effort to prepare our economy to respond to Brexit</p>  <p>  On 9 November, I published &ldquo;Building Stronger Business: Responding to Brexit by competing, innovating and trading&rdquo;.  This paper sets out work underway, and planned, byÂ my Department and its Agencies in response to Brexit.  The paper summarises the impact of Brexit across key policy areas withinÂ my Department and outlines the policy and operational measures underway and planned byÂ my Department and its Agencies to respond to Brexit, including supports available to companies to help them prepare for Brexit, regardless of the deal that emerges from the Brexit negotiations.</p>  <p>  Building Stronger BusinessÂ also describes the research programme underway in DBEIÂ to inform that response, as well as new structures put in place to ensure a coherent approach across the Department and its Agencies. </p>  <p>  In terms of theÂ research projects underway in my Department,Â studiesÂ are being done to enhance ourÂ understanding of the possible implications of Brexit on Ireland for enterprise, consumers and trading relations.  These studiesÂ examine a range of scenarios, including a hard Brexit scenario, and will provide an evidence base to inform Ireland&rsquo;s policy positions as part of the wider negotiation on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU and will help us to continue to develop further mitigation measures to respond to Brexit.  These studies include a study to understand the implications of a number of Brexit scenarios on our trading patterns, and another study considering the implications of Brexit for our most exposed sectors.</p>  <p>  In addition to these studies, theÂ Action Plan for Jobs and Enterprise 2025 are part of a range of policy documents setting out our overall approach to enterprise policy.</p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025 sets out a long-term ambition and strategy to encourage and facilitate enterprise growth and job creation.  This document addresses the broader enterprise environment and also sets out the rationale for a range of enterprise supports.  As part of DBEI&rsquo;s overall response to Brexit, a review of Enterprise 2025 is currently underway to determine the extent to which the policy framework and priorities set out in Enterprise 2025 remain robust in light of recent significant and potentially disruptive changes in the global environment, with a particular focus on Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs has been an essential tool from a competitiveness perspective and has been successful in driving coordinated actions to improve job creation, broaden the export and enterprise base, and enhance competitiveness.Â  APJ 2018 will provide aÂ platform to develop and implement immediate, short terms actions to support enterprise and address the challenges which firms are already facing as a result of the UK&rsquo;s decision to exit the EU.Â  </p>  <p>  Budget 2018 contained some important pro-business measures to help companies compete in the face of Brexit including:</p>  <p>  - New &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme for Business;</p>  <p>  - Doubling of additional DBEI Brexit related agency staff to 100;</p>  <p>  - New &euro;25m Regional Fund Competitive Call from Enterprise Ireland;</p>  <p>  - Tax package to support Enterprise and investment to attract jobs to Regions;</p>  <p>  - Investment in PhD &amp;amp; Research Masters Programme to meet enterprise skills needs;</p>  <p>  - SFI Research Centres to increase from 12 to 17 with new Capital funding; and</p>  <p>  - Ireland to become a member of European Southern Observatory in 2018.</p>  <p>  I also secured an additional &euro;3 million in current funding in both 2017 and 2018 to recruit up to 100 additional staff, specifically to assist in the response to the evolving Brexit situation.  As well as supporting Brexit-related staffing withinÂ my Department, these resources have been distributed across Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority.  These additional resources will be assigned to both overseas offices in markets that are growing and have scale and markets where we are already well-established but with potential for further growth.  Irish based posts will address a range of Brexit issues, including the support for internationalisation activities, a strengthening of the LEOs ability to respond locally to help micro-enterprises, and enhanced support for innovation. </p>  <p>  It is essential that Government supports are definitively targeted at vulnerable, but viable companies.Â  My DepartmentÂ is developing specific supports for companies to mitigate these impacts.  In response, working in partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, DBEI has secured Budget funding for a Brexit Loan Scheme which aims to make up to &euro;300 million available to businesses with up to 499 employees at a proposed interest rate of 4 per cent.  The scheme is open both to State Agency clients and those businesses that do not have any relationship with State Agencies.  The finance will be easier to access, more competitively priced, and at more favourable terms than current offerings. </p>  <p>  Additional measures compatible with the EU State Aid framework are also under active consideration: </p>  <p>  - A longer-term investment loan guarantee scheme which would focus on Business Development to allow SMEs to invest for a post-Brexit environment and to address potential disruption that might arise (i.e. new market entry and development costs, trade facilitation requirements, new trading arrangements and possible tariffs, transport costs and trans-shipment costs, changes to regulations and standards and border controls and certification).  It is intended that the Scheme will operate under the State Aid General Block Exemption Regulation.</p>  <p>  - A rescue and restructure scheme was pre-notified to the Commission at the end of August.  It is envisaged that this scheme would apply to all SMEs in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sectors, as well as to the fisheries and aquaculture sector, and SMEs engaged in processing and marketing in the agricultural sector.</p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, it is proposed that a Business Advisory Hub be established which would focus on business development to allow enterprises to position them for a post-Brexit environment.  This would build on the existing supports available and on work being undertaken by Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices and the Credit Review Office.</p></reply>

The country is seen as particularly attractive to the technology and IT sector.  This is, for example, because of strong incentives for research and development and collaboration, a competitive and transparent corporation tax regime, our supportive environment for the development and management of intellectual property, EU membership, and strong pool of highly skilled workers.  Data industry related construction in Ireland has also generated expertise and capability amongst Irish-owned enterprises. </p>  <p>  My Department,Â through the activities of IDA Ireland, ensures that enterprises,Â including those in the data management industry,Â can benefit from engagement and support. </p>  <p>  Further, DBEI participates in a Working Group established by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprised of representatives of other relevant Departments and bodies.  The Working Group is examining Ireland&rsquo;s strategic national policy approach to data management projects.  The Group is examining the many cross-Departmental policy issues associated with these projects, including renewable energy and climate change topics.  DBEI is bringing the enterprise development perspective and related analysis to the Group to aid its discussions </p>  <p>  Finally, my Department in conjunction with others is leading aÂ cross-government effort to develop aÂ national policy statement on the strategic importance ofÂ data centres as part of Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise strategy, with a first draft expected later this year.  This strategic policy approach takes account of wider energy policy developments.  We are strongly of the view that the development of data management projects must be plan-led, and believe theÂ policy statement will lay out a clear and balanced approach to the development of the sector, and will take account of a variety of elements including regional development, costs and benefits and the impact on Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure.</p></reply>

IDA Ireland opened its first Chinese office in Shanghai in 2006, and then established an office in Shenzhen in 2010 and Beijing in 2013.  Enterprise Ireland have offices in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.</p>  <p>  Bilateral trade between Ireland and China is worth over &euro;8 billion each year. Ireland&rsquo;s priority sectors for trade with China include agriculture, education, financial services, culture, and tourism.  Exports to China by Irish-owned companies increased by over 49% in 2014, while a total of 92 Irish companies employ over 10,000 people in China.</p>  <p>  On 11th February, 2015, following a concerted effort by the Government over several years, the Chinese authorities lifted their longstanding ban on imports of Irish beef into China.  This covers &ldquo;off the bone from animals up to 30 months old at slaughter&rdquo;.  It places Ireland ahead of all other EU member States on the road to opening the Chinese beef market.  Bord Bia anticipates that China will become Ireland&rsquo;s 2nd largest market for food and drink exports in the coming years. </p>  <p>  Successive Ministers and Taoisigh have led trade missions to China and we have also received visits from the highest levels of leadership from China to promote trade links between our two Countries.  On the 16th-19th January 2017, Minister Eoghan Murphy travelled to China with Enterprise Ireland.  The aim of the trade visit was to support the increasing number of Fintech companies targeting the Chinese market as part of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing focus on market diversification and the growing cooperation between Ireland and China.  One of the aims of the Enterprise Ireland 2017-2020 corporate strategy is to ensure that Irish fintech companies are well positioned to continue to grow their business and make new business contacts in China.  Enterprise Ireland is working collaboratively with IDA Ireland to achieve the IFS2020 strategic goals which include increasing the number of start-ups, increasing the number of direct employees by 10,000 and driving innovation and research in the sector. </p>  <p>  On 21st August 2017, the Taoiseach announced Government plans to double Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint by 2025.  My Department is in discussions with DPER in relation to the allocation of additional resources to deliver on one of the key aims of Ireland&rsquo;s Global Footprint 2025, which is to attract greater investment in Ireland and increase our exports into key strategic markets like China. </p>  <p>  A comprehensive EU-China Investment Agreement is currently under negotiation, which will provide Ireland and other EU Member States with increased market access.

Â Member States are discussing and debating the various aspects of the proposal in the relevant tax working parties.Â  In line with the Programme for Partnership Government, Ireland is engaging constructively with the proposal while critically analysing whether it is in line with Ireland&rsquo;s long-term interests.</p>  <p>  Proposals seeking new approaches to taxing large digital businesses have also been discussed recently.Â  The OECD is currently carrying out important work on this area and is expected to publish an interim report in the first half of 2018.Â  Ireland recognises the need for work in this area but believes that it would be premature to take action without considering the OECD analysis.Â  Ireland believes that a consistent global approach is needed and that any solution must build on a shared understanding of where value is actually created by digital business.</p>  <p>  All of these discussions are at a relatively early stage and the implications, if any, will depend on the exact nature of any changes which are ultimately agreed.Â  It is important to remember that tax remains a matter of Member State competence and unanimity is required before any proposals can be agreed.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding potential reforms in the future, Enterprises locating real substantial activity in Ireland will continue to be subject to Irish tax at 12.5% on their profits properly attributable to activity located in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Enterprises will always want to have operations in the EU, and taxation, whilst important is only one element of our continued attractiveness to FDI.Â  For instance, the Institute for Management Development (IMD) ranks us as theÂ 6th most competitive countryÂ globally.Â  Ireland also scores very highlyÂ in terms of key criteria for FDI including investment incentives, labour productivity and the adaptability and retention of talent.  As recognised by the IMD, many of Ireland&rsquo;s traditional assets including our education system, highly skilled workforce and pro-enterprise business environmentÂ add to our competitive advantage and are extremelyÂ attractive to inward investors. </p>  <p>  The State has a long track recordÂ of winning overseas investment, in that time the world economy has changed shape many times yet Ireland has remained an attractive destination for FDI.Â  Our continual review and examination of how we can improve on the factors crucial to fostering investment here, including our cost base, infrastructure, the availability of talent and our legal and regulatory environment, ensure that Ireland continues to be a desirable location for FDI. </p>  <p>  As the global investment climate continues to evolve, we will adapt accordingly &ndash; as we have done in the past &ndash; and make sure that Ireland continues to secure new FDI projects and the jobs that go with them.</p></reply>

Through our enterprise policies, we will continue to invest in ensuring that Ireland remains the best place to succeed in business.  We will continue toÂ place an emphasis on innovation, on creating attractive places throughout Ireland in which to work, investÂ and live, and on developing and attracting the talent needed for 21st century enterprise.</p></reply>

In advance of the Referendum my Department conducted a contingency risk assessment of the potential impacts of Brexit across policy areas of my Department.  Given that the EU&rsquo;s initial negotiating position is now clear, all of Government is intensifying its focus on the economic implications of Brexit, including on domestic policy measures to reinforce the competitiveness of the Irish economy, to protect it from potential negative impacts of Brexit, and to pursue all possible opportunities (e.g. foreign direct investment) that might arise.  My Department is central to the Government wide effort to prepare our economy to respond to Brexit.</p>  <p>  On 9 November, I published &ldquo;Building Stronger Business: Responding to Brexit by competing, innovating and trading&rdquo;.  This paper sets out work underway, and planned, byÂ my Department and its Agencies in response to Brexit.  The paper summarises the impact of Brexit across key policy areas withinÂ my Department and outlines the policy and operational measures underway and planned byÂ my Department and its Agencies to respond to Brexit, including supports available to companies to help them prepare for Brexit, regardless of the deal that emerges from the Brexit negotiations.</p>  <p>  Building Stronger BusinessÂ also describes the research programme underway in DBEIÂ to inform that response, as well as new structures put in place to ensure a coherent approach across the Department and its Agencies. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has set strategic ambitions to increase client exports by &euro;5 billion to &euro;26 billion per annum by 2020 and to support clients in the creation of 60,000 new jobs, as well as sustaining the existing 200,000 record level of jobs.  EI will achieve these ambitious objectives by: </p>  <p>  - Increasing the levels of diversification of EI client companies into new export markets, with two thirds going beyond the UK; </p>  <p>  - Improving the competitiveness of EI client companies through Lean programmes; </p>  <p>  - Driving the innovation in Irish enterprise through new supports to reach a target of &euro;1.25 billion in R&amp;D expenditure per annum by 2020; and </p>  <p>  - Inspiring more companies to have Global Ambition.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland is constantly engaged with clients across its entire portfolio and in the months leading up to the UK referendum it engaged with clients and prospective clients in relation to the potential impact of BREXIT.Â  The IDA has a Team involved in strategic scenario planning, which continues to work on ensuring that the Agency&rsquo;s strategy is fit for purpose in light of the referendum results in the UK. </p>  <p>  Â IDA Ireland will:</p>  <p>  - Continue to engage with current and prospective clients on Brexit and the potential implications of the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU for their investment decisions;</p>  <p>  - carry out updated analysis and research on the FDI risks and opportunities associated with Brexit.  This will include assessing new feedback from IDA clients on issues relating to Brexit;</p>  <p>  - continue to hold events in key international locations, to promote Ireland as an attractive investment destination in the post-Brexit environment.</p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland provides a targeted portfolio of programmes to help businesses, especially SMEs, develop capacity in the areas of science, technology &amp;amp; innovation and sales &amp;amp; marketing.  Given its role in promoting and supporting North- South commerce, ITI is especially well-positioned to help businesses both prepare for and address challenges that Brexit may present for cross-border trade.  With that in mind, the Department has put in place two specific ITI Brexit initiatives. </p>  <p>  - The Department funded a research project undertaken by the ESRI for InterTrade Ireland.  This study provides useful data on the extent and concentration of cross-border trade, including information on this trade by product, firm types and barriers to trade. </p>  <p>  - Additional funding was provided to ITI to undertake a range of initiatives for SMEs in the Republic of Ireland who are trading with Northern Ireland, to help them adapt to the changed circumstances following the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.  In May, InterTrade Ireland utilised this funding to launch a new dedicated &lsquo;Brexit Advisory Service&rsquo;.  This Service offers businesses a number of supports, including vouchers (valued at &euro;1,000 allowing them to fund specialist advice), technical and commercial advice, information on currency hedging and an interactive information tool explaining the technical language related to Brexit. </p>  <p>  In addition, ITI is establishing a Sectoral Advisory Panel, consisting of experts with hands-on exporting experience in specific sectors, to help ITI assess the impact of Brexit changes on particular sectors as negotiations evolve.</p>  <p>  In terms of theÂ research projects underway in my Department,Â studiesÂ are being done to enhance ourÂ understanding of the possible implications of Brexit on Ireland for enterprise, consumers and trading relations and will take account of potential changes toÂ the conditions facing exporters and importers.  These studiesÂ examine a range of scenarios and will provide an evidence base to inform Ireland&rsquo;s policy positions as part of the wider negotiation on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU and will help us to continue to develop further mitigation measures to respond to Brexit. </p>  <p>  These studies include a study examining the Import Content of Irish Exports: Implications of Brexit for Inputs and Competitiveness and the extent to which Irish firms source intermediate inputs from the UK.  This research will provide empirical evidence on the import content of Irish firms&rsquo; exports, how firms may be exposed to changes in the trading environment after Brexit and the impact of Brexit on inputs, and competitiveness. </p>  <p>  In addition to these studies, theÂ Action Plan for Jobs and Enterprise 2025 are part of a range of policy documents setting out our overall approach to enterprise policy.</p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025 sets out a long-term ambition and strategy to encourage and facilitate enterprise growth and job creation.  This document addresses the broader enterprise environment and also sets out the rationale for a range of enterprise supports.  As part of DBEI&rsquo;s overall response to Brexit, a review of Enterprise 2025 is currently underway to determine the extent to which the policy framework and priorities set out in Enterprise 2025 remain robust in light of recent significant and potentially disruptive changes in the global environment, with a particular focus on Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs has been an essential tool from a competitiveness perspective and has been successful in driving coordinated actions to improve job creation, broaden the export and enterprise base, and enhance competitiveness.Â  APJ 2018 will provide aÂ platform to develop and implement immediate, short terms actions to support enterprise and address the challenges which firms are already facing as a result of the UK&rsquo;s decision to exit the EU.Â  </p>  <p>  Budget 2018 contained some important pro-business measures to help companies compete in the face of Brexit including:</p>  <p>  - New &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme for Business;</p>  <p>  - Doubling of additional DBEI Brexit related agency staff to 100;</p>  <p>  - New &euro;25m Regional Fund Competitive Call from Enterprise Ireland;</p>  <p>  - Tax package to support Enterprise and investment to attract jobs to Regions;</p>  <p>  - Investment in PhD &amp;amp; Research Masters Programme to meet enterprise skills needs;</p>  <p>  - SFI Research Centres to increase from 12 to 17 with new Capital funding; and</p>  <p>  - Ireland to become a member of European Southern Observatory in 2018.</p>  <p>  I also secured an additional &euro;3 million in current funding in both 2017 and 2018 to recruit up to 100 additional staff, specifically to assist in the response to the evolving Brexit situation.  As well as supporting Brexit-related staffing withinÂ my Department, these resources have been distributed across Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority.  These additional resources will be assigned to both overseas offices in markets that are growing and have scale and markets where we are already well-established but with potential for further growth.  Irish based posts will address a range of Brexit issues, including the support for internationalisation activities, a strengthening of the LEOs ability to respond locally to help micro-enterprises, and enhanced support for innovation. </p>  <p>  It is essential that Government supports are definitively targeted at vulnerable, but viable companies.Â  My DepartmentÂ is developing specific supports for companies to mitigate these impacts.  In response, working in partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, DBEI has secured Budget funding for a Brexit Loan Scheme which aims to make up to &euro;300 million available to businesses with up to 499 employees at a proposed interest rate of 4 per cent.  The scheme is open both to State Agency clients and those businesses that do not have any relationship with State Agencies.  The finance will be easier to access, more competitively priced, and at more favourable terms than current offerings. </p>  <p>  Additional measures compatible with the EU State Aid framework are also under active consideration: </p>  <p>  - A longer-term investment loan guarantee scheme which would focus on Business Development to allow SMEs to invest for a post-Brexit environment and to address potential disruption that might arise (i.e. new market entry and development costs, trade facilitation requirements, new trading arrangements and possible tariffs, transport costs and trans-shipment costs, changes to regulations and standards and border controls and certification).  It is intended that the Scheme will operate under the State Aid General Block Exemption Regulation. </p>  <p>  - A rescue and restructure scheme was pre-notified to the Commission at the end of August.  It is envisaged that this scheme would apply to all SMEs in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sectors, as well as to the fisheries and aquaculture sector, and SMEs engaged in processing and marketing in the agricultural sector.</p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, it is proposed that a Business Advisory Hub be established which would focus on business development to allow enterprises to position them for a post-Brexit environment.  This would build on the existing supports available and on work being undertaken by Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices and the Credit Review Office.</p></reply>

This includes efforts to build awareness of sector-specific challenges that Brexit is likely to pose. </p>  <p>  Much of our broaderÂ work so far to help mitigate the impact of Brexit on Irish firms is captured in my Department's recently published response paper to the UK's impending exit from the EU, entitled "Building Stronger Business - Responding to Brexit by Competing, Innovating and Trading".  This paper summarises the policy measures already taken, outlines future initiatives we intend to take forward and detailsÂ the steps the Department has taken alreadyÂ to ensure that we can work as efficiently as possible to support our companies. </p>  <p>  To inform policy, develop effectiveÂ mitigation strategies and help prepare Ireland&rsquo;s position on our trade priorities, DBEI had already published a number of reports and is currently engaged in a suite of studies.  A significant amount of this analysis is undertaken at sectoral level.</p>  <p>  Completed research includes the outputs from a series of structured engagements with companies (of different sizes, across different sectors and across the regions) and from a survey of a thousand SME business owners to "Understand the Implications of Brexit for Irish SME&rsquo;s" which my Department published earlier this year.  Additionally, a study analysing the "Potential Impact of WTO Tariffs on Cross-Border Trade" was published by InterTrade Ireland in conjunction with my Department in June.  This study provides an understanding of the impact of different trade and tariff regimes which might be imposed following Brexit andÂ includes aÂ sectoral focus.</p>  <p>  In terms of ongoing research commitments, the Department is currently working on: </p>  <p>  - AÂ Â major study examining the "Strategic Implications arising from EU-UK Trading Patterns".  This study will provide an evidence base on key trade and investment questions to inform Ireland&rsquo;s position as part of the wider negotiation on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU.  It will  quantify the possible impact of a range of Brexit scenarios on trade and investment.  The study will provide in-depth analysis of key sectors.Â  It will decompose the potential trade and investment impacts for key sectors and in each scenario identify which elements contribute to the results (i.e. tariffs, non-tariff barriers, transit costs, other trade costs), leading to sector-by-sector understanding of solutions. </p>  <p>  - A study examining the "Sectoral implications arising from Brexit" focused on 18 sectors most exposed to the UK is underway and is due to be completed by end 2017.  This research examines the implications at firm-level for Ireland&rsquo;s most exposed enterprise sectors of the UK being outside of the European Single Market and Customs Union.  The study is expected to be completed by end 2017.Â Â Â  </p>  <p>  - A study examining the "Import Content of Irish Exports: Implications of Brexit for Inputs and Competitiveness" and the extent to which Irish firms source intermediate inputs from the UK has just commenced.  This research will provide empirical evidence on the import content of Irish firms&rsquo; exports, how firms &amp;amp; sectors may be exposed to changes in the trading environment after Brexit and the impact of Brexit on inputs, and competitiveness. </p>  <p>  - AÂ study examining the "Skills needs arising from the Potential Trading and Regulatory Implications of Brexit" has commenced &ndash; with a  particular focus on sectors such as logistics and freight.  This research is being undertaken in my Department on behalf of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs. </p>  <p>  The outcomes of this research will inform policy decisions relating to the immediate support for enterprise, developing effective mitigation actions and preparing our longer term desired outcomes from the negotiations. Â </p>  <p>  Our State Agencies are already very active in taking forward projects aimed at helping businesses in Ireland prepare for the post-Brexit commercial environment. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs are steadily working with companies to make sure that they are better prepared to respond to the challenges that Brexit will bring.Â  These are the medium term, strategic actions that I know that companies are calling for &ndash; things like helping them to drive down costs, diversify into new markets and innovate in the way they do business.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has been systematically engaging with its 1,500 clients that export to the UK and is providing information and guidance, market diversification support and competitiveness and market development support to help companies prepare for the future trading relationship with the UK. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland launched the 'Prepare for Brexit' campaign, which features the SME Scorecard tool.Â  The Scorecard is an interactive online platform which can be used by all companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit and areas they may need to consider preparing further on in the context of Brexit.  EI has also introduced a &lsquo;Be Prepared Grant&rsquo; which offers up to &euro;5,000 in funding to support exporting client companies develop a Brexit Action Plan.  The 'Prepare for Brexit' campaign aims to encourage more SMEs to prepare for Brexit and start putting in place detailed plans to mitigate risks and leverage opportunities that may arise, now that Brexit negotiations have begun.  Additionally, InterTrade Ireland, has introduced a scheme to help SMEs avail of expert advice on Brexit.</p>  <p>  While progress is being made in helping sectors to prepare, we know much more work remains to be done.  That is why we will remain absolutely focused on our Brexit-related initiatives and will continue to explore new avenues and means of helping our companies plan for the future. </p></reply>

Â As set out in Innovation 2020, Ireland&rsquo;s ambition is to become Global Innovation Leader, driving a strong sustainable economy, underpinned by a strong innovative and internationally competitive enterprise base, growing employment, sales and exports.Â  Recognising that innovation must be at the core of stimulating growth, sustainability and company resilience, the strategy sets out actions to increase enterprise engagement in innovation to assist companies in developing new, higher value-added products and services, and more efficient processes.

This is particularly the case in countries where government-to-government contacts are a prerequisite for doing business.  These trade missions are an integral part of the work of relevant Government Departments and Agencies to develop and expand Ireland&rsquo;s exports to existing and new markets abroad.

Across these events, I have witnessed:</p><p>- Enterprise Ireland clients, such as Combilift, sign agreements with foreign companies that will see them launch new products in international markets. </p><p>- The launch of patented technology, such as, Novaerus first patented technology for airborne infections. </p><p>- The deployment of Irish technology in international markets, such as C &amp;amp; F Green Energy proprietary wind turbine technology deployment in Japan.</p><p>- The opening of an international office for Kingspan.</p><p>- The announcement of 14 new deals and achievements in the Australian market by Enterprise Ireland clients.</p></reply>

In the year to Q2 2017, 48,100 jobs were created across the country; four out of five of these jobs were outside Dublin.</p><p>The Enterprise Agencies continue to work to contribute to employment and economic growth throughout all regions.  In 2016, almost two thirds of new jobs created by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, and over half of those created by IDA supported companies, were outside Dublin.

This regional competitive fund will support the ambition, goals and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.Â </p><p>Additional funding of &euro;150m is also being made available to the IDA to support its Regional Property Programme and drive job creation in the multi-national sector.</p></reply>

Our improved performance is reflected in strong employment growth across sectors and regions.  The strong performance of clients supported by the enterprise agencies in winning exports, market share and job creation in the face of intense global competition is to be commended and reflects the competitiveness of the environment in which to do business in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Global uncertainty and Brexit have underlined the importance of building competitive advantage. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, my objective is to create the best possible environment for enterprise, entrepreneurship, innovation and investment across all regions which will increase our competitiveness and support job creation.  We are taking steps to ensure the economy is resilient at sectoral and firm level to deal with imminent competitiveness challenges and to build further on the progress we have made.  The Government is increasing investing in infrastructure, innovation and talent and enhancing our education and training system. </p>  <p>  From an enterprise competitiveness perspective, the ability of those coming out of the education and training system to meet the needs of a competitive economy is critical.  As measured by to the IMD&rsquo;s 2017 Global Competitiveness Report, Ireland performs relatively well in an international context.  In terms of whether the education system and university education meets the needs of a competitive economy, Ireland is ranked and 8th and 5th in the world respectively in the IMD's report.  Ireland is ranked 1st in perceptions regarding attracting and retaining talent being a priority for firms. Ireland is ranked 10th with regard to management education meeting the needs of the business community. </p>  <p>  From a competitiveness perspective, the affordability of housing and rent levels impact upon the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for investment and indirectly impacts on enterprise costs.  It is well recognised that an expansion in the supply of housing is urgently required, particularly in Dublin.  The Action Plan for Housing 'Rebuilding Ireland' sets out a range of actions to boost supply and sustainably address rental affordability of all types of housing, particularly for persons most at risk of housing and rental market exclusion.  Economic growth and enterprise expansion has contributed to strong demand for commercial office space in Dublin and other urban locations. </p>  <p>  Given the rise in both commercial property rents and capital values, I welcome the recent partnerships the Irish Strategic Investment Fund have entered with various property funds to increase the supply of commercial property solutions in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The immediate challenge for Ireland is to ensure growth is sustainable, enterprises are resilient and our economy is internationally competitive.  Improving competitiveness will remain the key to supporting employment growth.  I will shortly bring the Competitiveness Council's annual Competitiveness Challenge report to Government and I will ensure the required actions to address emerging competitiveness issues across Government are addressed as part of the Action Plan for Jobs process.  </p></reply>

That is why we introduced a pro-business Budget with record levels of multi-annual funding and tax measures which will allow businesses across Ireland to develop, scale, innovate and embed. Â </p>  <p>  My Department recognises the importance of Ireland remaining an active location for indigenous and foreign direct investment.  Enterprise Ireland is the state agency that has responsibility for the development of Irish enterprise, deepening Ireland&rsquo;s footprint in world markets, and supporting employment creation in our economy.  Supporting Irish businesses in the manufacturing and internationally traded service sectors and also FDI food companies located in Ireland, Enterprise Ireland supports companies in every region of Ireland to start and scale, innovate and remain competitive on international markets.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is working with client companies through a network of market and sector advisers from 10 offices located throughout the country and 33 international offices across the globe.  At the centre of the agency&rsquo;s strategy, Build Scale, Expand Reach 2017 &ndash; 2020, are strategic targets focused on:</p>  <p>  - Assisting clients to create 60,000 new jobs by 2020 while sustaining the existing record level of jobs;</p>  <p>  - Growing the annual exports of client companies by &euro;5bn to &euro;26bn per annum;</p>  <p>  - Increasing the level of spend made by client companies in the Irish economy by &euro;4bn to &euro;27bn per annum by 2020; and</p>  <p>  - Inspiring more Irish owned companies to have global ambition.</p>  <p>  The 5,000 manufacturing and internationally traded services companies that Enterprise Ireland works with are a critical source of existing employment and job creation in every county in Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s 2016 activity highlights presented below clearly show how Ireland is an active location for indigenous and foreign direct investment.</p>  <p>  - Enterprise Ireland supported companies employed 201,108 people. In 2016 19,244 new jobs were created resulting in a net gain of 9,117 jobs across the country. </p>  <p>  - Enterprise Ireland clients recorded exports of &euro;21.6 billion, up 6 per cent on 2015 export figures, with all sectors reporting growth.</p>  <p>  - In 2016, Enterprise Ireland supported the establishment of 229 new internationally focused start-ups (including 101 High Potential Start-Ups) across a range of sectors which will create over 1,500 jobs over the next three years.</p>  <p>  - Supporting market-led innovation, Enterprise Ireland approved 78 R&amp;D investments of over &euro;100k to client companies.  950 client companies were engaged in R&amp;D projects with an annual spend of over &euro;100k.  A top tier of 140 clients were engaged in R&amp;D projects with an investment of over &euro;1 per annum</p>  <p>  - Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s equity and venture capital investment was &euro;85 million in 2016.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s main objective is to encourage investment into Ireland by foreign-owned companies, and their success is measured by the impactÂ on the Irish economyÂ of FDI and IDA supported companies.  From an IDA perspective, our overall FDI offering which despite an increasingly competitive global environment, remains very attractive to overseas companies. </p>  <p>  Multinational companies invest in Ireland for many reasons, not just one.  Ireland has a strong pool of highly skilled workers and a first-class education system that produces top-level graduates.  Our country benefits as well from favourable demographics &ndash; over 40% of our population is under 29, making ours the youngest in the EU.  Our membership of the EU is another key selling point.  When companies establish operations here, they immediately benefit from barrier-free access to an EU market of over 500 million consumers. </p>  <p>  Ireland is simply a great place to do business: we offer strong incentives for research and development, a rich talent pool and a stable and competitive corporation tax regime. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland had a record year in 2016 and total employment at overseas companies now stands at 199,877 people, the highest level on record. </p>  <p>  IDA client companies created 18,627 Â jobs (11,842 Net New Jobs) on the ground during the year across a range of sectors, with every region of Ireland posting net gains in jobs.  The latest results indicating a strong performance by the organisation towards delivering its 2019 target of 80,000 new jobs and 900 investments. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2015-2019 includes a commitment to increase foreign FDI in every region outside Dublin by 30%-40%.Â  The Agency made good progress towards achieving this goal in 2016, with 52% of all jobs created by IDA Ireland's clients last year based outside of Dublin.</p></reply>

The continuing imperative to establish Ireland as the best place in which to succeed in business is reinforced in our national Enterprise and Innovation strategies.  Our aim is that Ireland will be recognised as the place where businesses are innovative, competitive and productive &ndash; leading to growth that is sustainable and results in employment opportunities and a higher standard of living for all.  These strategies set out the framework for investment over the coming decade to ensure that Ireland remains equally attractive to foreign direct investment and to Irish entrepreneurs and growth businesses in the context of an intensely competitive international environment. </p>  <p>  The Knowledge Development Box provides an effective 6.25% rate of corporation tax on profits from certain qualifying assets that are earned by a company, chargeable to corporation tax in the State, to the extent that the assets relate to R&amp;D undertaken by that company.Â  Ireland&rsquo;s KDB effective rate is internationally competitive. </p>  <p>  The KDB complements the existing suite of initiatives and supports available to companies that undertake R&amp;D activities in Ireland across the lifecycle of research and development &ndash; including R&amp;D tax credits, RD&amp;I grant supports, support for technology acquisition (S291A), significant state investments in National Research Centres and knowledge transfer infrastructures, and advisory supports for accessing Horizon 2020 funding &ndash; providing a competitive proposition for business investment. </p>  <p>  As a key part of Ireland's competitive offering as a location of choice from which to do business, the KDB has helped secure investment since its introduction in 2016.  It will continue to form part of Ireland's proposition and stimulate further investment in R&amp;D activities by both Irish and foreign owned enterprises - ultimately delivering jobs and economic substance in Ireland.</p></reply>

Since 2012, the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs has set out a comprehensive set of measures to improve our competitiveness performance.  Ireland&rsquo;s improving competitiveness performance over the period 2011-2016 has been central to the recovery in employment and economic growth.  Ireland&rsquo;s relative international competitiveness as measured by a range of international indices has improved.  Ireland moved from 16th to 6th in 2017 in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook.  In addition, the World Bank&rsquo;s most recent &ldquo;Doing Business 2018&rdquo; report shows Ireland is now ranked 17th out of 190 countries, an improvement of 1 place on last year. </p>  <p>  Our improved performance is reflected in strong employment growth across sectors and regions.  The most recent Quarterly National Household Survey data from the CSO shows there was an annual increase in employment of 2.4% or 48,100 in the year to the second quarter of 2017, bringing total employment to 2,063,000.  Employment increased in eleven of the fourteen economic sectors over the year.  CSO data shows that since 2012, the numbers employed in Industry have increased by 12% to 260,100 with the numbers employed in the Services sector increasing by 8.6% to 1,539,000 persons employed.  This increase in employment growth is testament to the competitiveness of Irish enterprise.</p>  <p>  However, there is no room for complacency.  We need to continue to improve the environment for doing business in Ireland and remain vigilant to the very significant challenges in the external environment, particularly, Brexit.  The challenges posed by Brexit provide urgent impetus to pursue policies that enhance competitiveness.  I agree with the assessment of the National Competitiveness Council that we need to improve structural factors such as innovation capacity, the quality of infrastructure, costs of doing business and productivity across all economic sectors.  The Government is working to reduce the administrative burden that regulations create can improve the business environment by reducing costs, minimising the time businesses spend fulfilling regulatory requirements and increasing productivity.  Ensuring that the State does not place undue administrative burdens and costs on entrepreneurs and business owners is critical to competitiveness, productivity and job creation. </p>  <p>  The immediate challenge for Ireland is to ensure growth is sustainable, enterprises are resilient and as a small open economy Ireland is best positioned to withstand shifts in economic fortunes.  My objective is to ensure the economy is resilient at sectoral and firm level to deal with imminent competitiveness challenges and to build further on the progress we have made.  As set out in Budget 2018 my Department is intensifying its focus on the economic implications of Brexit, including on domestic policy measures to reinforce the competitiveness of the Irish economy, to protect it from potential negative impacts of Brexit, and to pursue all possible opportunities that might arise.Â  </p>  <p>  I will shortly bring the Competitiveness Council's annual Competitiveness Challenge report to Government and we will ensure the required actions to address emerging issues are addressed as part of the Action Plan for Jobs process.</p></reply>

Negotiations are led by the EU Commission on behalf of Member States.</p>  <p>  An EU-Mercosur FTA would be the EU&rsquo;s largest trade deal to date, and is four times the size of the trade agreement with Japan.  It aims to eliminate trade tariffs between the EU and the Mercosur region.Â  Irish exporters are currently subject to trade tariffs, barriers and restrictions, when exporting to Mercosur,Â while imports from Mercosur, particularly in Agriculture, are currently subject to high tariffs.  The proposed FTA should makeÂ exports from Ireland more attractive and potentially increase demand for Irish products. </p>  <p>  Within the region, Brazil is Ireland&rsquo;s main trading partner with total exports from Ireland of &euro;715 million and total imports of &euro;634 million in 2014.Â  Brazil has been highlighted as a &lsquo;High Growth Market&rsquo; in the Enterprise Ireland Plan 2016, with Enterprise Ireland client&rsquo;s companies&rsquo; exports value increasing by 84% from 2012 to 2014.  In 2014, Ireland exported in excess ofÂ &euro;950 million to Mercosur countries, with services representing approximately 60% of the total exports andÂ Chemicals accountingÂ for 49% of Irish exports to Mercosur.  132 Enterprise Ireland client companies exported to Mercosur in 2014.Â  Year on year growth of exports to the region from 2013-2014 increased by 25%.</p>  <p>  On the other hand, Ireland has strong concerns in relation to agriculture, especially the impact that these negotiations present to the EU beef sector.  While all Free Trade Agreements include agriculture tariffs, agricultural market access and TRQs (Tariff Rate Quotas),Â TRQs provided under such agreements are not always fully utilised by our trading partners.  Equally, most Member States tend to have sensitives in relation to certain goods or services to be comprehended under an FTA.</p>  <p>  Ireland has continued to highlight the cumulative impact of agricultural market access in relation to all trade agreements.  We have done this through engagement with the Trade Policy Committee in Brussels, as well asÂ joiningÂ withÂ other Member States in formally writingÂ to the Commission outlining our concerns. Â Both I and my colleague Minister Creed have also raised the matter in various fora.</p>  <p>  Overall, Ireland remains fully committed to this negotiation, especially in view of the important economic and political gains expected for both sides from a comprehensive, ambitious and balanced EU-Mercosur Association Agreement.  However any TRQ offered must be structured - in terms of its size, composition and the application of in-quota tariff rates - in a way that mitigates the potential impact of a Mercosur deal on the EU beef sector. </p>  <p>  As negotiations are ongoing, it remains unclear what the final outcome will be, although it must be acknowledged that for the Mercosur countries offers on EU agricultural produceÂ areÂ essential to securing any deal.</p></reply>

It is important to understand what factors led to such mistakes being made and we must take appropriate steps to address these shortcomings and ensure that they are never repeated. </p>  <p>  In view of this, while I cannot publish the Report itself, I intend to publish an account of the investigative failures identified by Judge Alymer and the steps that are being taken to address them.  These include ongoing reform within the ODCE and the establishment, as announced by Government earlier this month, of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement as a new independent company law enforcement agency, to provide greater autonomy to the agency and ensure it is better equipped to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law.  Work on the drafting of the necessary General Scheme of a Bill to give effect to this decision has commenced.</p></reply>

I haveÂ no statutory function in relation to the banking decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time and these are taken by theÂ board and management of the relevant institution. </p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that interest rates are in a downward trajectory throughout the EU including Ireland as evidenced in the most recent joint European Commission/European Central Bank Survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE) October 2016 to October 2017.Â  The EU average interest rate decreased from 3.8% in 2016 to 3.4% in 2017 while Ireland&rsquo;s interest rate decreased from 5.9% in H1 2016 to 5% in H1 2017.Â </p>  <p>  It should be noted that cost of credit is only one of several factors affecting competitiveness of SMEs.  Furthermore, it is only one of a number of reasons why SMEs decide to seek finance.  The most recent published Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey, covering the period October 2016 to March 2017, reports only 1% of the SMEs that did not seek credit stated this was because it was too expensive to borrow.  The same survey also showed that, among those SMEs with outstanding loans, the average claimed cost of credit across all outstanding loans was 3.6%, down from 4.8% in March 2016.</p>  <p>  In the latest Central Bank of Ireland report on Trends in Business Credit and Deposits, the total weighted average interest rate on new non-financial SME loan draw-downs during Q2 2017 was 4.05 per cent.  In contrast, the existing stock of Irish SME loans carry a lower weighted average interest rate; recorded at 3.20 per cent at end-Q2. Â </p>  <p>  This Government recognises that small businesses play a central role inÂ the sustainable recovery of the Irish economy.  To facilitate this, Government policy since 2011 has beenÂ focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.</p>  <p>  This year, to address the challenges posed to SMEs by Brexit, the Government recently announced a Brexit Loan Scheme, which will provide affordable working capital financing to SMEs and small mid-caps that can demonstrate that they are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future.  This Scheme will be delivered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland through commercial lenders and will serve to get much-needed working capital into Irish businesses.  The Scheme will make up to &euro;300 million available to businesses of up to 499 employees, and will be open to both clients of State Agencies and businesses with no relationship with State Agencies. </p>  <p>  The Government is also considering the development of a Business Advisory Hub which would assist SMEs to make informed funding/investment decisions to help them avail of existing State supports or private market solutions.</p></reply>

This early repayment, which was completed inÂ 2015, generates significant interest savings.  It alsoÂ reduces the refinancing requirement in the coming years as debt that was originally to mature over the period July 2015 &ndash; January 2021 has been replaced with longer-term debt.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that on 7 September this year, I announced Ireland&rsquo;s intention to repay early and in full the remainder of the IMF loan as well as the bilateral loans from Sweden and Denmark.  This will further reduce the debt interest bill.  In addition, replacing EU-IMF Programme related debt with marketable debt increases the purchase capacity of the European Central Bank (ECB) for Irish government bonds. Â </p>  <p>  The third of the bilateral lenders is the UK.  However, it is not in Ireland&rsquo;s financial interests at this time to repay early the bilateral loan from the UK.  This is a fixed rate loan and the loan agreement contains a break clause which would be triggered in the event of early repayment.  The associated costs would offset any potential interest savings. </p>  <p>  Similarly, it is not in Ireland&rsquo;s financial interest to repay early the EFSF andÂ EFSM loans as these facilities can, on a like-for-like basis, raise funding at lower interest rates than Ireland.Â  </p>  <p>  Early repayment of the loans from the IMF, Denmark and Sweden requires a waiver of the right from the remaining Programme lenders &ndash; the EFSF, the EFSM and the UK &ndash; to proportionate early repayment.  A waiver has already been secured from the UK and the legal processes to secure the waivers from the EFSM and EFSF are underway.</p></reply>

The reporting requirements under this section mean that intermediaries who act on behalf of Irish resident persons who invest in offshore products are required to automatically notify Revenue of the investment.  For each investor, the following details must be provided: name and address, the tax reference number, a description of the relevant facilities provided, including a description of the offshore product concerned and the name and address of the person who provided the offshore product and details of all payments made by or to the person in respect of the offshore products.Â  </p>  <p>  It may also be of interest to the Deputy that those regulated institutions also have reporting obligations in respect of domestic accounts.Â  </p>  <p>  Section 891B TCA 1997 and associated regulations, which implement the obligations in the section, [Returns of Payments (Banks, Building Societies, Credit Unions and Saving Banks) Regulation 2008] places an obligation on financial institutions to make annual returns to Revenue.Â Â The following information must be returned for each Irish resident account holder: name, address, date of birth (if on record), the account number, the amount of the interest or other profit type payment, and, where appropriate, the tax deducted from the payments (e.g. DIRT).Â  Irish financial institutions are required to make all reasonable efforts to return the tax reference number of the payee.Â  </p>  <p>  Section 891B TCA 1997 and associated regulations, which implement the obligations in the section, [Return of Payments (Insurance Undertakings) Regulations 2011] places an obligation on insurance undertakings to make annual returns to Revenue.Â  The following information must be returned for each Irish resident policy holder: name, address, date of birth (if on record), the investment number associated with the policy and the value of the policy held.Â  The insurance undertaking is also required to make all reasonable efforts to return the tax reference number.</p>  <p>  Section 891C TCA 1997 and associated regulations, which implement the obligations in the section, [Return of Values (Investment Undertakings) Regulation 2013] places an obligation on investment undertakings to make an annual reporting to Revenue.Â  The following information must be returned for each Irish resident unit holder:Â name, address, date of birth (if on record), the investment number associated with the investment and the value of the units held.Â  The investment undertaking is also required to make all reasonable efforts to return the tax reference number.</p>  <p>  Irish regulated financial institutions must report certain details in respect of non-Irish residents to Revenue under the OECD&rsquo;s Common Reporting Standard (as implemented by s.891F), the EU&rsquo;s Directive on mandatory automatic exchange of information (as implemented by s.891G), and the US&rsquo;s Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (as implemented by s.891E).Â  These standards require that the following information is reported for each person: name, address, jurisdiction of tax residence, gross amount paid, account balance on the reporting date, details of accounts closed.Â  Unlike the annual domestic reporting obligations, date of birth and tax reference numbers are required fields in respect of reporting under the international standards.Â  </p>  <p>  In addition I am advised by Revenue that it has various powers to seek information from Irish based financial institutions where it is deemed necessary as part of their investigations.  These include the power, under section 906A of the TCA 1997, to issue a notice to a financial institution requiring information for the purpose of enquiring into a liability, and the power to apply to the Tax Appeals Commission to serve notice on a financial institution requiring it to furnish information concerning a taxpayer of a group taxpayers who may have failed to comply with the Taxes Acts under section 907 of the TCA 1997. </p>  <p>  Section 908 of the TCA 1997 provides that Revenue may to apply to the High Court for an order requiring information from a financial institution including in respect of a group or class of persons whose individual identities are not known, and Revenue can also seek a District or Circuit court order to obtain information from a financial institution where there is reasonable suspicion that a Revenue offence is being ,has been or is about to be committed by virtue of section 908A of the TCA 1997.</p></reply>

The Liquidator sought this report for the purposes of internal management reporting and to assist in determining the potential shortfall in assets available to cover the remaining liabilities as part of the liquidation process.  The contents of the report are therefore commercially sensitive and were provided to me solely for the purposes of assessing what the likely shortfall in the amount due to Setanta third party claimants would be.  Consequently I am not in a position to publish it.Â Â  </p>  <p>  Estimating the number of former policyholders of the company that could be made personally liable for outstanding claims is complex.  This is due to a number of issues, for instance there may be still ongoing disputes around liability between the policyholder and the third party claimant, and in some instances, there may be more than one claim against a single policyholder which means that the active claim figure below may not equate to an equivalent amount of policyholders.Â  </p>  <p>  The latest information I have received from the Liquidator is that there are 1,576 active claims and 573 claimants have been paid compensation from the Insurance Compensation Fund subject to the 65%/&euro;825,000 limits.  I have been advised that the process of settling claims is still ongoing and is subject in some cases to complex negotiations between all relevant parties.Â  I as Minister for Finance am not party to such negotiations and therefore do not have sight of individual claims, and consequently am not in a position to comment on such matters.</p></reply>

Following the placing of Setanta into liquidation, legal proceedings commenced between the Law Society of Ireland and the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland.  In May of this year, the Supreme Court overturned a High Court decision deeming MIBI liable for the claims in respect of Setanta.Â  The consequence of this is that the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) has been deemed responsible for the payment of claims subject to the limits set out in the Insurance Acts (65% or &euro;825,000 whichever is the less).</p>  <p>  The Review of the Framework for Motor Insurance Compensation in Ireland was completed in June 2016 and was approved by the Ministers of Finance and Transport, and noted by Government in July 2016. Its key recommendations were that:</p>  <p>  - Coverage of the ICF would be extended to include third party motorÂ insurance claims in the event of a liquidation of an insurer;</p>  <p>  - The level of compensation from the ICF for third party motor claimsÂ to be increased from 65% to 100% Â in line with that currentlyÂ provided by MIBI ;</p>  <p>  - The increased coverage of the ICF to be funded by a directÂ contribution to the ICF from the motor insurance industry via the MIBI toÂ the value of 35% of the third party motor insurance claims;</p>  <p>  - Administration of the ICF to be transferred from the Accountant ofÂ Â the Courts of Justice to the Central Bank of Ireland;</p>  <p>  - To provide for a more formal role for the State Claims Agency inÂ the event of a failure of an insurance company resulting in a draw on theÂ ICF.</p>  <p>  To implement these recommendations, heads of the Insurance (Amendment) Bill were approved by Government in July and then sent to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (OPC) for priority drafting and to the Joint Oireachtas Committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.  My Department continues to work closely with the OPC and other relevant stakeholders to progress the drafting.  This legislation will provide greater certainty for both consumers and industry and will ensure that 100% of third party personal injury motor insurance claims are covered ( for property claims it will be 100% up to a limit of &euro;1,220,000) by theÂ ICF in the event of any future insurance company failure.</p>  <p>  At an EU level, it is important to note that the regulatory framework, underpinning the operation of insurance companies, has been strengthened with the introduction of Solvency II from 1 January 2016.  This is a much more risk sensitive and demanding system, with increased capital requirements, which are consistent across all Member States.Â  The role of supervisory authorities is also significantly enhanced, including provision for more cooperation between Member States. </p>  <p>  These measures, at national and EU level, should make any similar failure of an insurance company in the future less likely, and provide certaintyÂ that if such an event were to occur, then 100% of third party motor personal injury motor insurance claims would be covered by the ICF.</p></reply>

A recent drawdown from the Framework of Providers of Broadband Services saw some 1,100 primary schools awarded download speeds of 30Mbps or greater (the baseline download speed required under the National Broadband Plan).  Some 1,000 of those schools have now been connected with the balance to be in place by the end of 2017.  This represents circa one third of all primary schools.  ThisÂ isÂ a significant improvement over recent years, given that less than 100 primary schools were on those speeds in 2012.</p>  <p>  The need to improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, and as noted access to high speed broadband is one of the indicators identified in the Digital Strategy Action Plan.  An interdepartmental working group has been established to determine how best to address broadbandÂ connectivity toÂ primary schools in collaboration with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, in the context of the National Broadband Plan and the Intervention Strategy, and proposed industry provision.</p></reply>

Ireland has raised with Saudi Arabia on numerous occasions its concerns about the situation in Yemen.  In November 2016, my predecessor, Minister Flanagan, raised concerns about the appalling humanitarian situation in Yemen, and about attacks which have directly impacted on civilians, with the Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Dr Nizar bin Obaid Madani, in November 2016.  Following this, he also raised these concerns with the UAE Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, both in the UAE and more recently here in Dublin.</p>  <p>  More recently, when senior officials from my Department met with the Saudi Charg&eacute; d&rsquo;Affaires earlier this month, they reiterated these concerns, and re-stated Ireland&rsquo;s view that there can be no military solution to the crisis in Yemen.</p>  <p>  Ireland does not have an arms industry and is not therefore an exporter of conventional weapons.  Ireland has signed and ratified the 2014 Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) and we consider ourselves in full compliance with the Treaty.  As one of the ATT&rsquo;s early signatories, Ireland continues to be one of its strongest supporters, given its potential to directly impact and reduce fatalities and injuries caused by conventional arms.</p>  <p>  I share a deep concern about violations of human rights in Yemen.  At the Human Rights Council in September 2017, I decided that Ireland should join a small core group of countries that drove forward the adoption of a Resolution on Yemen.  This Resolution establishes a group of international experts, who will establish the facts in relation to violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground.  This group will report back to the Human Rights Council, as an important step towards accountability in Yemen.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to press for a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Yemen, respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, and improved humanitarian access to those in need.</p></reply>

I also acknowledged the continuing solidarity and support we are enjoying from our EU partners in relation to the Irish specific issues, which was again in evidence throughout the meeting on 20 November. </p><p>I emphasised that the decision on whether or not sufficient progress has been made across all three exit issues is one that the EU27 will take together, on the basis of a recommendation from Mr Barnier. </p><p>As concerns the Irish specific issues, I underlined that the negotiations have reached the point where firm, explicit commitments are required from the UK, which will need to be reflected in the Withdrawal Agreement.  The achievement of sufficient progress does not mean that all issues need to be definitively settled and the detail worked out.  But what is essential is that the path to the final outcome is mapped out.</p><p>This includes protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, and the gains of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.  In this regard, I recalled that Ireland continues to believe that the optimal solution would be for the UK to remain in the Customs Union and the Single Market.  But this is ultimately a decision for the UK Government to make.  If the UK continues to rule out this option, the solutions that it offers must be concrete and workable.  This should include an acceptance by the UK that the risks posed by the<font color="#004080"> </font>emergence on the island of Ireland of regulatory divergence from the rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union must be avoided. </p><p>I also welcomed that there has been particular progress on advancing joint principles on the continuation of the Common Travel Area and that officials have also been carrying out detailed work over the last few weeks to map out areas of cooperation that operate on a North South basis on the island of Ireland and which rely on EU law and policies.  I noted, however, that there is still more work to be done in this area. </p><p>I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to continue working closely with the Commission Task Force to advance these issues and our hope that, with hard work and political will, the European Council will be able to take a positive decision next month.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Cavan/Monaghan Division on 30 September 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 321 with 12 Garda Reserves and 38 civilians.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Unit, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 33 of whom were assigned to Cavan/Monaghan Division.Â  In addition, another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest next month which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.Â  </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this Government&rsquo;s vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of the high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.Â  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Cavan/Monaghan Division, in the coming years.</p>  <p>  In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.Â  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.Â  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.Â  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, Operation Thor, which is effective in all Garda Divisions including the Cavan/Monaghan Division, involves a broad range of activities to tackle organised crime gangs and other prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime.  It is encouraging to note that in parallel with the implementation of Operation Thor burglary figures in particular have shown a significant downward trend.  The CSO official recorded crime statistics for Q4 of 2016 show a 30% decrease in burglary for the twelve months of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015 - which parallels the implementation of Operation Thor.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that there is close and ongoing cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI on all aspects of policing, with a particular focus on combatting security threats and cross-border crime.  The Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI, who are responsible for operational policing cooperation, have repeatedly emphasised the scope and the value of the close and high quality cooperation between the two police services in combating crime, protecting community safety and saving lives.  The two police services operate a joint Cross-Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island.</p></reply>

In approximately 75% of all cases the ward&rsquo;s Committee is a family member or a trusted friend. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has also informed me that if there is no suitable or willing relative or friend available, or if there is a conflict of interest between the ward and the person who would otherwise have been appointed, or where there is disagreement among a ward's relatives about how his/her affairs should be managed, the President of the High Court can appoint the General Solicitor for Minors and Wards of Court to act as the Committee.  The General SolicitorÂ takes the responsibility of acting as Committee very seriously and strives at all times to act in the best interest of each ward.  In so doing the General Solicitor often uses the services of others, including social workers, to assist her.Â </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised that the Committee of the Estate is involved in the management of the ward's assets and in matters relating to the ward's income and expenditure needs.  The Committee of the Person has a role in matters relating to the welfare of the ward.  If a family member, friend or other person close to the ward wishes to have more involvement in the welfare, property and affairs of a ward that person may apply to be appointed asÂ CommitteeÂ by writing to the Office of the General Solicitor.  That person may apply to be a Committee of the Person or of the Estate or a Committee of both the Person andÂ the Estate.  The decision whether or not to appoint such person asÂ Committee isÂ a matter for the President of the High Court.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides for the replacement of the adult wards of court system by a less intrusive system.Â  The proposed new system will offer a continuum of options to support people in maximising their decision-making capability.  </p>  <p>  Part 6 of the 2015 Act provides that adults currently in wardship will transition to the new decision-making support arrangements provided for in the Act on a phased basis over 3 years from the commencement of Part 6 of the Act.  Once Part 6 is operational, each ward will be reviewed by the wardship court in accordance with the new system.  A ward who is found to have capacity will be discharged from wardship.  A ward who continues to have capacity needs will be discharged from wardship and offered the decision-making support option most appropriate to his or her needs.Â  </p>  <p>  The specific decision making supports available under the Act to adults with capacity difficulties will be decision-making assistants, co-decision-makers and decision-making representatives, all of whom will be supervised by the Director of the Decision Support Service.</p></reply>

The 2015 Act provides for the family reunification of immediate family members (spouse, civil partner and minor children) in line with the permission operated by other EU Member States under the EU Family Reunification Directive, in which Ireland does not participate.  </p>  <p>  This humanitarian admission programme will operate under my discretionary powers and is expected to provide for the reunification of more than 500 vulnerable family members in the next two years. </p>  <p>  To allow the maximum number of families to benefit from the scheme, sponsors will be asked to prioritise a small number of family members for admission.  Priority may be given to sponsors who can meet the accommodation requirements of eligible family members, having regard to the housing situation.  </p>  <p>  Further operational details on the FRHAP will be announced in the coming weeks following discussions with UNHCR. </p>  <p>  The Government does not intend to amend the family reunification provisions under the International Protection Act 2015, which were approved by the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  The Seanad Private Members Bill referred to by the Deputy passed Committee Stage in the Seanad on 8 November 2017.  The Government does not support the Bill, which would have significant and unquantifiable impacts on the provision of housing, healthcare, education, welfare payments and other State supports.  The Bill has not considered the financial impacts of its proposal, therefore, the Government must decline a money message for the Bill.  One of the objectives of this new FRHAP programme is that it addresses many of the motivating concerns of the Senators who proposed the Bill.</p></reply>

They generally require various queries to be raised by the PRA in order to prove the facts of possession as claimed on affidavit.  Once a case has been fully established, notice must be served on all interested parties and appropriate time allowed for objections.  As a result, there can routinely be ongoing and detailed correspondence between the PRA and other parties, which can run for some time.Â  The PRA must be fully satisfied that a case is fully grounded, the nature of the title proved and that all interested parties' concerns have been fully considered before registering a State guaranteed title which has been based solely on adverse possession. Â While every effort may be taken to speed up the process, such applications, by necessity and legislation, may take a long time to process. </p>  <p>  All other applications submitted that are fully in order for registration and that do not result in the raising of queries are dealt with in a very timely and efficient manner. Â In 2017 to date, in excess of 62% of cases in order for registration which do not require a change to the map or examination of title are completed within ten days or less, while more than 70% of such cases are dealt with within 15 days or less. Â Where a case is urgent and is brought to the attention of the PRA it will, in accordance with its customer service policy, deal with the matter as a priority. </p>  <p>  The Deputy also refers to a number of initiatives previously outlined by the PRA which are aimed at reducing arrears.Â  The PRA has been enhancing its training and development programmes for managers and staff, and in particular for the large number of new staff in the organisation.  This has included business process improvement training for staff in key areas, with a view to identifying and implementing more efficient processes. Â The PRA has also now published a series of guides and videos for solicitors, again to help improve the quality of applications lodged and to assist in the reduction of cases being re-submitted, which add to the number of cases on hand.  These went live on the PRA's website in August 2017.  Advertising of the guides and videos was undertaken through the Law Society Gazette and the PRA&rsquo;s website. Â These measures are in addition to ongoing engagement with solicitors in various locations across the country, with a view to improving applications and well as improving internal PRA processes.</p>  <p>  I would agree with the Deputy that unwarranted delays in the process of applications for the registration of property must be addressed and initiatives in this regard are being monitored by the Board of the Authority.Â  I am advised that the measures outlinedÂ above will increase efficiency and, in tandem with further development of ICT systems, will increase the case processing capacity and capability of the PRA in the coming years.</p></reply>

The Minister for Justice and Equality found, on 30 May last, that in an international protection system with no temporal limits as to when the application process will be concluded, an absolute prohibition on the right to work for international protection applicants is contrary to the right to seek employment under the Constitution.Â  The Court recognised that this is a matter for the Executive and Legislature to consider and accordingly has adjourned consideration of the Order the Court should make for a period of six months.</p>  <p>  Following the approval of Government, I established an Inter-Departmental Taskforce in July to examine the wide-ranging implications of theÂ judgment, and to consider appropriate solutions.  The Taskforce was comprised of representatives from nine Government Department, along with the Office of the Attorney General.Â </p>  <p>  On 21 November 2017, the Government approved the recommendations of the Taskforce, including the key recommendation that the State should respond to the judgment by opting-in to the EU (Recast) Reception Conditions Directive (2013/33/EU).Â  </p>  <p>  I will move the required Motions to seek approval in the Houses of the Oireachtas for our participation in the Directive at the earliest opportunity.  Following the approval of both Houses, the opt in procedure with the formal notifications to the European Council and the European Commission will commence.  The European Commission then has four months from receipt of this letter to confirm our participation.Â  During these four months, the StateÂ will be required to demonstrate to the Commission how it is compliant with each Article in the Directive. </p>  <p>  The EU Directive provides, inter-alia,Â that international protection applicants shall have access to the labour market no later than nine months from the date the application for international protectionÂ was lodged, if a first instance decision has not beenÂ taken and if the delay cannot be attributed to the applicant.</p>  <p>  The GovernmentÂ hasÂ established an Implementation Group to oversee the opt-in procedure and the practical arrangements for facilitating access to the labour market for eligible applicants.  The Group will be drawn fromÂ membership of the Taskforce, supplemented by the participation of relevant operational areas in my own Department and in other Departments as required.</p></reply>

Â The actions taken by Waterways Ireland were entirely in the interests of public safety and the safety of its staff.</p>  <p>  Water levels were raised in July 2017 to fill the area under the bridge when all other measures failed to secure the area to prevent public access for people's own safety.

Significant developments have taken place over the last 3 years to improve the capacity of the health system to move to a digital environment.  New strategic systems are being put in place such as the new medical laboratory platform known as MedLIS, the continued roll out of the national radiology solution NIMIS, the eReferrals initiative in primary care and the Maternal and New Born System which is transforming the delivery of maternity care and has gone live in both Cork (2016) and Kerry (2017) and most recently in the Rotunda Hospital over last weekend.  </p>  <p>  I also welcome the recognition of the priority required for investment in the EHR Programme in the Sl&aacute;intecare Report which recommended &ldquo;continued strong support of the e-health strategy - particularly ensuring the necessary funding for timely roll-out of the EHR system" and advancement in eHealth will be considered as part of the implementation response to Sl&aacute;intecare, currently being developed by my Department. </p>  <p>  The scale of the task to implement a national electronic health record programme is very large, challenging and requires a complex planning, approval and tendering process.  The EHR business case, which has been developed by the HSE, highlights a number of optional timescales and investment approaches for implementation and roll-out including a 5 year and a 9 year technology investment programme.  </p>  <p>  The Electronic Health Record (EHR) has 4 main elements - the Shared Care Record, the Community &amp;amp; Primary Care EHR, the Acute Operational EHR and the EHR integration suite.  The HSE appointed a programme manager to oversee the implementation of the Electronic Health Record in May 2017.  The next phase of the EHR programme is to develop detailed business cases for each of the components including specification of requirements, procurement documentation and support during the procurement process.  The HSE sought and received conditional sanction from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure to procure additional services to further develop the business case in preparation for submission for permission to tender.  Tenders sanctioned are for the delivery of support in the following areas:</p>  <p>  1. programme office, </p>  <p>  2. acute EHR, </p>  <p>  3. community EHR and </p>  <p>  4. Shared Care Record and Integration.  </p>  <p>  The tender documents were published in August and the tender process closed mid-September.  To date, one contract for this work has been awarded for the acute hospital EHR in view of the requirements for the National Children's Hospital.  In the case of the other two lots, a re-tendering exercise is underway.  The outputs from this work will allow greater clarity on the scope of the individual components for what is being procured and the detailed costings for each of the areas that will make up the electronic health care record.  Only when this detailed work is completed can the procurement process be considered for submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and prioritisation assigned to the work.  The work in relation to EHR will continue and feed into the implementation response to the Sl&aacute;intecare report being prepared by my Department.</p>  <p>  ICT Capital allocation in the HSE has grown from a low base in 2012 of &euro;22m to &euro;55m in 2017.  The Government has committed to increase ICT capital spending over the next four years for the HSE with an indicative capital allocation of &euro;60m in 2018, &euro;85m in 2019, &euro;100m in 2020 and &euro;120m in 2021 to support eHealth, in the context of the Mid-Term Capital Review.  Provision of revenue funding to support ICT has also increased in recent years and  sanction for 49 additional posts was granted in 2016.  For a programme of this scale and scope, realistic timescales and funding options are important to ensure that the adoption of both the technology and the business change required by front line staff can be absorbed and managed in a coherent way. </p></reply>

The responsibility for reporting individual consultant compliance with their contract was formally delegated to the Hospital Groups in 2014.  The main reason for this was to ensure local accountability.  Hospitals know their consultants and the work they deliver.  </p>  <p>  However it seems clear that the arrangements in place are not robust enough to deliver compliance in all circumstances and, as a result, some consultants are able to engage in private practice activity at levels that significantly exceed the permitted levels, or else they may engage in significant levels of off-site private practice, although their contract does not provide for this.  It is incumbent on publicly-funded hospitals to ensure compliance with the terms of the contract, including the provisions in relation to private practice.  For some time my Department has been working closely with the HSE on this.</p>  <p>  I am very clear that consultants must deliver their work commitment to the public system.  It is the responsibility of management to make sure these contracts are being enforced and I have asked the HSE to ensure that more robust measures are in place in 2018 to make sure consultants comply with their contractual obligations.  I will require absolute assurances on this point. </p>  <p>  In the longer term I have established an independent group, chaired by Dr Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir, to examine the impact of separating private practice from the public hospital system.  This was one of the key recommendations of the Sl&aacute;intecare Report.</p></reply>

The approach is supported in the report by international evidence.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Consultant Contract 2008, a key objective of the Contract is to improve access for public patients to public hospital care.  Under the Consultant's Contract 2008 and HSE guidance issued from the National Director of Acute Hospitals in September 2009 a common waiting list for treatment, diagnostic investigations, tests and procedures on an outpatient basis in public hospitals is identified.  In addition, under HSE policy, private outpatients may not attend public outpatient consultant-led clinics.</p>  <p>  Finally, under the HSE National Framework for operation and management of Outpatient Departments published in 2013, referrals for outpatient appointments to a named consultant should be treated as general to the specialty involved, unless it is more appropriate for a particular patient to be managed by a specific consultant. </p>  <p>  In response to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.</p></reply>

It is important therefore that we upgrade our public bed stock and this is the aim of the 5 year Capital Investment Programme for Community Nursing Units which was announced last year.  This provides the framework to allow for an enhanced programme to replace, upgrade and refurbish these care facilities, as appropriate.  Significant work was undertaken to determine the most optimum scheduling of projects within the phased provision of funding to achieve compliance with National Standards.  </p><p>This investment programme will see the provision of two new centres in Donegal, namely in Ballyshannon and also a 130 bed centre, centrally located in Letterkenny.</p><p>Since the announcement in 2016, and following discussions with public representatives, Health Forum members and local community groups, local HSE management in CHO 1 agreed to review overall requirements for the area.  The Terms of Reference for the Rhatigan's review were as follows:</p><p>1. Assess current and future needs for short/long term bed capacity taking into account of up to date census data from the Central Statistics Office;</p><p>2. Based on current planning norms define scale of public/private provision required to meet this need up to 2026;</p><p>3. Assess the adequacy of existing facilities in St Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital Stranorlar, Ramelton and Lifford, taking account of amended legislation governing residential care standards 2016; </p><p>4. Recommend changes to the approved capital programme, if appropriate, taking into account capital and revenue costs, geographical factors, integration of care with acute services and time frames for delivery; </p><p>5. Make specific recommendations regarding dementia care provision; and</p><p>6. Based on the above to finalise brief and options appraisals for infrastructural developments proposed.</p><p>I understand that the review has been completed and a report is to be submitted to the HSE&rsquo;s National Social Care Division in the first instance, and then the HSE&rsquo;s National Capital Property Steering Group.</p><p>Any proposals for changes to the approved Capital Investment Programme for Community Nursing Units would have to be considered in the context of capital funding available to Health, potential revenue implications and compliance with the agreed capital approval process. </p></reply>

This extension followed an earlier comprehensive review by the European Food Safety Authority which concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans and can be used safely without putting consumers or users at risk.  Both the EFSA and ECHA assessments included detailed consideration of a report produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organisation in relation to glyphosate.</p>  <p>  The RAC concluded in March 2017, in an opinion adopted with the full support of all members, that glyphosate does not warrant classification as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction.  This means that legally glyphosate does not meet any of the substance non-approval criteria specified in Regulation 1107/2009.  A final decision on renewing the approval of glyphosate is due to be taken by 15 December 2017.</p>  <p>  Based on the conclusions of the risk and hazard assessments conducted by the European Food Safety Authority and the European Chemicals Agency, the Commission has prepared draft proposals for renewal of the approval of glyphosate.  These proposals have been discussed by Member State representatives at technical experts standing committee meetings but there has not been qualified majority support at these meetings for the draft renewal proposals that have been presented by the Commission.  This process will now move to a further meeting of member states, called an &lsquo;appeals committee&rsquo;, later this month.  This meeting will consider and vote on this proposal again at that time.</p>  <p>  In my view it is important that decisions such as this are based on the best scientific information that is available to us as policy makers.  In this instance the latest scientific information available from assessments completed by the European Food Safety Authority and the European Chemicals Agency supports the continued approval of glyphosate.</p></reply>

This accounts for almostÂ 70% of allÂ farmers with hen harrier habitat and represents a major step forward in the conservation of the bird and in securing important additional income for the farmers concerned.</p></reply>

Under the Disabled Parking Permit scheme, people who are Primary Medical Certificate holders or registered blind are automatically eligible to avail of the scheme.  People who are not holders of the Primary Medical Certificate or registered blind are required to have their application form completed by a certified medical practitioner.</p><p>The medical criteria for issue of the permit are strict and only persons whose mobility is severely and permanently restricted qualify.  These criteria were revised and clarified in my Department&rsquo;s Review of the Disabled Parking Scheme in 2010.  Specific measures for the degree of impairment of lung capacity and the severity level of heart conditions which apply are given in the Guidelines for Medical Practitioners.  These Medical Fitness to Drive Guidelines can be found on the Road Safety Authority website atÂ <i><i>www.rsa.ie.</i></i></p><p>The Disabled Parking scheme is operated on behalf of my Department by the Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland (DDAI) and the Irish Wheelchair Association (IWA).Â  Details on eligibility and how to apply for a Permit are available on their respective websites <i><i>www.iwa.ie</i></i>and <i><i>www.ddai.ie</i></i>.Â  </p><p>The Disabled Parking Permit is assigned to theÂ individual,Â not theÂ vehicle,Â and so can be used by a disabled person in any vehicle in which he or she is traveling.  This means that a disabled person who is being driven at different times by different people can bring the permitÂ with him or her and display it in the appropriate vehicle.  It is not necessary to have an adopted car in order to use the permit.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by almost 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approximately 898,000 customers with direct eligibility to free travel with an annual allocation of &euro;80 million.  The scheme is available to all people aged over 66 living permanently in the State.  To qualify for the scheme, applicants who are under age 66 must be in receipt of a qualifying payment.  These are invalidity pension, blind pension, disability allowance, carer&rsquo;s allowance or an equivalent social security payment from a country covered by EC Regulations or one with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement. </p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the free travel scheme to all children that are in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance would require additional funding for the free travel scheme and would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  Domiciliary care allowance is a monthly payment of &euro;309.50 to the carer of a child with a disability.  The allowance may be used for the additional costs involved in caring for the child and this may include additional transport costs.  On most transport services children under sixteen years of age are charged fares at special concessionary child rates. </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection may award a travel supplement in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant housing authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act.  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, housing authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme, it is essential that an applicant&rsquo;s income is of a long-term and sustainable nature.  This is necessary to ensure that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in theÂ Rebuilding Ireland AnÂ Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, a review of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken.  The review has incorporated analysis of comprehensive data received from local authorities regarding the operation of the scheme during 2016 and a wide-ranging public consultation process which saw submissions received from individuals, elected representatives and organisations.</p>  <p>  The review is now complete and a full report setting out findings and recommendations has been prepared.Â  I expect to be in a position to publish the outcome of the review shortly.</p></reply>

There are currently over 29,800 households in receipt of HAP andÂ over 20,000 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to households supported by the scheme. </p>  <p>  Under HAP, a tenant sources their own accommodation, the tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord and is covered by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended).  The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on the household size and the rental market within that area.Â  HAP applicants are informed of the maximum rent limits for their local authority area; these elements of the scheme are stated in the HAP Tenant Information Booklet, on the dedicated HAP website, www.hap.ie, and local authority staff are expected to explain them to each HAP applicant. </p>  <p>  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.Â  Greater enhanced support is also statutorily provided for in theÂ Dublin Region for homeless households.Â  It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis. Local authorities must also be cognisant of the provisionsÂ  of the Residential Tenancies ActÂ when approving increases in HAP payments and advise tenants accordingly.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf.  There is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent to their landlord.  Where a qualified household sources accommodation outside the maximum rent limits, it is important to highlight the responsibility falling on the household as set out in their tenancy agreement.Â  From available data,Â atÂ the end of Q2Â 2017, and excluding the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin Region, 12.6% of HAP households nationally were benefiting from the flexibility to exceed the rent limits.  In the Kerry local authority area,Â  27 of the 194 households supported by HAP at that point, orÂ 13.9% of households, were benefiting from the flexibility to exceed the rent limits. Â The average level of discretion being provided to those households was 13.4% in excess of the rent limits.</p>  <p>  The data available to my Department indicates that the current rent limits and the flexibility to exceed those rent limits, continues to provide local authorities with sufficient capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs.  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  I am satisfied with how the HAP scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland.</p></reply>
