Payment of Class K PRSI does not establish any social insurance entitlements.</p><p>Prior to the introduction of the Class K charge, all public office holders were exempt from PRSI on their income as a public office holder.  Then, as now, they could establish and protect their social insurance entitlements based on their non-office holder activities or through the payment of Voluntary Contributions.</p><p>The Class K PRSI charge for public office holders was introduced on the basis that public office holders were a group who unlike most self-employed and employees did not pay a 4% contribution and so has a lower marginal rate of income tax/USC and PRSI.</p><p>I am currently examining whether changes are required to the basis on which class K is charged for councillors.  There are a number of possible approaches including removing the Class K charge from councillor or bringing them into cover under Class S in line with the self-employed generally.</p><p>There are pros and cons to each approach. In particular, any changes to the current Class K arrangements will need to take into account the social insurance and occupational pension position of office holders generally.</p><p>I will be consulting with relevant Ministers on this issue.  I also intend meeting with the representative body for councillors to discuss the options available.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-30a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016063000058#WRA00800"><p>The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment has fallen substantially to 15% in May 2016.  This compares with a figure of almost 21% just one year ago, in May 2015, and with a peak level of over 31% in May 2012.</p>  <p>  Although the labour market situation is improving considerably as the recovery continues, the Government recognises the importance of a continued focus on measures to facilitate the young unemployed back into work.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy (published January 2016) and the Youth Guarantee plan (published January 2014).</p>  <p>  The key objective of Ireland&rsquo;s policy response to the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee is to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  In this regard there is monthly engagement by case officers with young people to assist them to prepare, review and, if appropriate, revise personal progression plans.  Where young people do not find work relatively quickly, additional supports may be offered, both through reserved places on existing employment and training schemes and through youth-specific measures.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s.  Overall, over 19,100 opportunities were taken up on the relevant programmes in 2015.</p>  <p>  Pathways to Work 2016-2020 continues to prioritise these measures for the young unemployed and further commits to a number of additional measures.  These include increasing the share of workplace-based interventions for youth unemployed; ensuring that monthly engagement, at a minimum, is consistently applied and maintained; restructuring the First Steps programme; and implementing the Defence Forces Skills for Life programme.</p>  <p>  I am confident these measures, and continuing economic recovery, will support further reductions in youth unemployment to add to the substantial improvements that have already been seen over the last few years.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-30a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016063000058#WRA01000"><p>Pathways to Work includes a wide range of programmes and services - such as the Gateway initiative - to help jobseekers back to employment.  Gateway provides work placements in local authorities for a period of 22 months for those who are unemployed for more than two years.  While the majority of participants are selected on a random basis by my Department, the opportunity for voluntary or self-selection is also available for 20% of places.</p>  <p>  When the initiative was set up in 2013, long-term unemployment remained unacceptably high.  While the economy recovered, the need for additional activation measures was recognised to assist the personal and social development of the long-term unemployed by providing short-term quality work opportunities.  Work schemes placements are not available in schools or hospitals.  As the Deputy is aware, these public service bodies receive funding directly from their respective Departments.  For example, work in areas such as caretaking, teaching or other classroom duties are funded directly by the Department of Education and Skills.  I have no plans to extend the Gateway scheme outside of the local government sector.   </p>  <p>  With the ongoing welcome reductions in the live register, I believe that a review of work schemes, including Gateway, will be necessary to ensure that the number and nature of schemes and the conditions governing participation continue to be appropriate.  I will be considering all of these issues over the coming months.</p></reply>

Job Clubs provide formal workshops, one-to-one engagements, CV preparation and a &lsquo;drop-in&rsquo; facility where jobseekers can get advice and share experiences with other jobseekers.</p><p>Community Employment is an employment programme which helps long-term unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine.  The programme assists them to enhance and develop both their technical and personal skills which can then be used in the workplace.</p><p>Job Clubs and CE schemes are operated by a variety of organisations from the not for profit and voluntary sector including community organisations and trade unions and in the case raised by the Deputy a church based group.  The Department contracts with these organisations for a specific purpose and monitors their delivery of services.</p><p>For Jobs Clubs, the achievement of key performance indicators, as set out in the contract, are monitored on a regular basis.  The key performance indicators are:</p><p>- Throughput, which is the number of job seekers who avail of the service, both formal workshops and &lsquo;one to one&rsquo; sessions</p><p>- A target of 40% of jobseekers placed into employment from formal workshops</p><p>- A target of 40% of jobseekers placed into employment from One-to-One engagement</p><p>In addition, each Job Club is subject to an annual review. </p><p>The organisation in question has operated a Job Club and CE scheme successfully for many years.  It is meeting its targets and the Department is not aware of any complaints regarding the approach it takes to providing services.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-30a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016063000058#WRA01700"><p>I welcome the recent publication of the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice&rsquo;s (VPSJ) report on the 2016 update of the expenditure and income required for a minimum essential standard of living.</p>  <p>  After a series of challenging years, improvements for people in receipt of social welfare payments began in Budget 2015 and continued in Budget 2016.  These improvements are reflected in the VPSJ report in that households with pre-school children moved into income adequacy (as defined in the report) as a result of increases in child benefit and the introduction of free GP care for children under the age of six.  In addition, the increase in the weekly rate of payment for pensioners aged 66 and over moved pensioners living alone in receipt of the State pension contributory into income adequacy while pensioner couples on welfare payments have, per the research, levels of income in excess of the minimum standard for many years.</p>  <p>  The analysis in the VPSJ report is a valuable contribution to our future consideration of appropriate levels of income supports and services.  I note the importance of better services such a free GP care for younger children outlined in the report.</p>  <p>  Analysis in the Social Inclusion Monitor, 2014, published by my Department shows the crucial role that Ireland&rsquo;s social protection system plays in alleviating poverty, cushioning people from the worst effects of unemployment and ensuring an adequate standard of living.</p>  <p>  Using Eurostat data for 2014, social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate in Ireland from 37.2% to 15.6%, thereby lifting over a fifth of the population out of income poverty.  Ireland is the best performing EU member state in reducing poverty through social transfers.  The poverty reduction effect at 58.9% is the highest in Europe, almost twice the EU average.</p>  <p>  The latest poverty data are for 2014 and do not fully reflect the impact of the recovery in economic growth and employment.  The unemployment rate in 2014 was 11.3%, down from a peak of 15% in 2012.  Since then, the unemployment rate has fallen further, to 7.8% in May 2016.  As unemployment is strongly linked to poverty, we can expect to see further decreases in basic deprivation and consistent poverty.</p>  <p>  The Pathways to Work Strategy 2016-2020 sets out comprehensive plans to increase labour market participation and make work pay.  It continues to prioritise the activation of the long-term and young unemployed people, with supports provided through the network of Intreo offices. </p>  <p>  A range of welfare and income tax measures were introduced in Budget 2016 to further incentivise work and improve living standards.  The social impact assessment of the Budget shows greater rewards for working, with over 80% of the unemployed substantially better-off in work.</p>  <p>  Looking ahead, the new Programme for a Partnership Government contains a number of significant commitments to enhance the welfare system in the years ahead.  This includes increasing rent supplement limits by up to 15% and I note the impact of housing costs included in the VPSJ report.  I hope to announce changes to the rent supplement scheme operated by my Department very shortly.</p>  <p>  I want to make progress on the welfare commitments contained in the Programme for Government in the forthcoming Budget and will seek to do this within the additional resources which will be available.</p>  <p>  I also look forward to engagement and input from my colleagues in the Oireachtas in the matter.  In addition, I will be holding a Pre-Budget forum on July 22 next to which I have invited forty welfare representative organisations.  I will listen carefully to the views of the organisations attending which will include the VPSJ.</p></reply>

Persons are engaged for 19&frac12; hours per week to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities.  The scheme currently provides work opportunities for around 2,600 participants and 130 supervisory staff.  My Department has engaged 35 local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to deliver the scheme.</p>  <p>  The operation of the rural social scheme is governed by a comprehensive set of rules which are reviewed on an on-going basis.  These may be modified in response to changes in the operating environment and the introduction of, or changes to, other schemes or other conditions that impact on the scheme&rsquo;s operations.  The funds allocated for the scheme in 2016 amount to &euro;44.3m.  This level of funding does not allow for recruitment above the numbers stated above.</p>  <p>  With the ongoing welcome economic recovery, the eligibility criteria for RSS will be kept under review to ensure that it remains fit for purpose and that the numbers on the scheme continue to be appropriate.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

Farm assist recipients retain the advantages of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme such as the retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.  The 2016 Revised Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure of almost &euro;85 million on the farm assist scheme.</p>  <p>  Changes introduced in Budgets 2012 and 2013 brought farm assist into closer alignment with the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme&rsquo;s treatment of self-employed people.  Farm families with the lowest income were least impacted by these changes as the headline rates of farm assist were maintained.</p>  <p>  Farm assist customers continue to receive more beneficial treatment than other self-employed persons as payments received under the Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS), Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) or Special Area of Conservation (SAC) schemes are assessed separately from other farm income.  Farm Assist remains a flexible payment and any farmer experiencing lower levels of income or cash-flow issues, due for example to bad weather, can ask his local INTREO office to review the level of means applying to his claim.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains the commitment to undertake a "Review of the Farm Assist Scheme, recognising the challenges facing farmers on low incomes".  I have asked my officials to review the farm assist scheme from a policy and an administrative point of view.  </p>  <p>  Any changes to the farm assist scheme will have to be considered in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

The scheme supports over 41,000 recipients and almost 74,300 children.</p>  <p>  The figure quoted by St. Vincent de Paul is based on SILC data for 2014 indicating a basic deprivation rate for lone parents of 58.7%.  This was a decrease of 4.5% on 2013.  Research shows that being at work reduces the at-risk-of-poverty rate for lone parents by three-quarters, highlighting that the best way to tackle poverty among lone parents is to assist them into employment.  The One Parent Family Payment (OFP) scheme is designed to support this.</p>  <p>  The OFP means test is more generous than that of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, with an income disregard of &euro;90 per week and the balance assessed at 50%.  In addition OFP can be paid concurrently with the family income supplement (FIS).  These supports encourage lone parents to take up employment thereby helping to tackle poverty rates among these customers.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2016 OFP recipients gained a 75% Christmas bonus, a &euro;5 increase in Child Benefit and an increase of &euro;2.50 per week in fuel allowance.  Those in receipt of FIS also benefitted from the increases to the FIS thresholds.  Lone parents on JST also gained as a result of the closer alignment of the JST means test with the more generous OFP means test.</p>  <p>  The social impact assessment of Budget 2016 showed an increase in average household incomes for working lone parents of 2%.  Non-earning lone parents also fared above average, gaining 1.8%. </p></reply>

One of these actions is a proposal for the Departments of Health and Social Protection to work together to pursue a &ldquo;Fit for Work&rdquo; programme to support more people with an illness or disability to get back to work through early intervention.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Fit for Work&rdquo; proposal is based on the findings of a pan European study, which examined the impact of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) on an individual&rsquo;s ability to work.  The Irish module of this study was progressed by a coalition of key stakeholders and was led by Arthritis Ireland.  The Irish College of General Practitioners, ICTU, IBEC and the Health &amp;amp; Safety Authority also contributed to the study.</p>  <p>  Early interventions and developing return-to-work practices in the case of people with musculoskeletal incapacities is consistent with my Department&rsquo;s approach to illness/disability income support, which aims to reduce the number of people progressing to chronic disability and long-term social welfare dependency.  To this end, my Department issued, in 2015, a set of certification guidelines for GPs, which sets out defined periods of recovery for common medical conditions, including MSDs. </p>  <p>  The certification guidelines build on the &ldquo;Renaissance&rdquo; project which is an initiative of my Department since 2003.  This has shown that early intervention reduced the incidence of progression from acute simple low back pain to chronic disability in 64% of claimants.</p>  <p>  No decisions have been made as to how a &ldquo;Fit for Work Programme&rdquo; might be delivered and any specific proposals for such a programme requires further development and scoping out.  I would like to assure the Deputy that any such proposals will be in line with the wealth of evidence which shows that generally employment is good for one&rsquo;s mental and physical health and wellbeing and that, conversely, unemployment is damaging.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Department is working hard to improve the processing times for CA applications.  Additional resources have been applied to assist with these increases and overtime is being applied where appropriate.  The continuing increase in the number of applications being received is a key factor in the Department&rsquo;s ability to improve these times.  The issue of resources for the processing of CA applications is kept under constant review to ensure the number of applications pending and the processing times are reduced significantly over the coming months.  While additional staff have been assigned to help deal with the increased volumes, due to the complexity of the decision-making process for the scheme, it takes some time for new staff to be fully trained and develop expertise.</p>  <p>  It would be my hope that with the additional staff fully trained and in place the delays should decrease in the coming months.  It is also important to note that, frequently, additional delays are outside the control of the Department and are caused by the customer failing to fully complete the claim form or failing to attach the supporting documentation that is requested on the application form.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

Eligibility is not dependent upon the recipient retiring from employment, and there is no retirement pension.</p>  <p>  The SPC is a very valuable benefit and is the bedrock of the Irish pension system.  Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.  In this context, even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they may qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances.</p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension.  The scheme does not involve the award of credits.  The 2007 Green Paper on Pensions estimated an annual cost of backdating the Home-maker's scheme, at that time, as &euro;150 million (if to 1973) or &euro;160 million (if to 1953).  However it described those estimates as &ldquo;extremely tentative&rdquo; and the passage of time means that the potential cost now could be significantly higher.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the distributive nature of the Fund.  For example, those with a yearly average of only 20 contributions (38% of the maximum) may qualify for 85% of the maximum rate.  The Review also examined the changes in the contribution rules and the associated rates of payment which were to be introduced in September 2012.  The Review found that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories still obtain the best value from their contributions. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should also note that the &lsquo;marriage bar&rsquo; describes a rule that existed in most of the public service and some private sector employments, where women were required to leave their employment upon marriage.  This practice was abolished in 1973 when Ireland joined the EEC.  As employees in the public service generally paid a reduced rate of PRSI, which provided no cover for the State pension (contributory), the marriage bar would not generally have impacted on State pension entitlement, as they would not have qualified for that payment had they remained in public sector employment.  Instead, by impacting upon their continuing public service employment, the marriage bar&rsquo;s pension implications, where they exist, more generally relate to a person&rsquo;s eventual entitlement to a Public Service pension.  Any questions regarding this issue are a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.</p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical components to be put in place prior its implementation.  The position of women who were home-makers will be considered very carefully in developing this reform.</p>  <p>  Any significant measures that would increase the cost of the State pension would have to be considered in the context of Budget discussions. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It provides valuable resourcing for service delivery undertaken by not-for-profit companies and co-operatives in communities around the country.  Service providers must operate community or social enterprises that deliver tangible services and are capable of generating non-public revenues from their operations by way of charging fees, sales and/or fundraising.

Funding of over &euro;45m has been provided for the programme in 2016 which will maintain the current level of activity.  Given the level of resources available and the number of companies currently supported, the Department has been unable to make an open call for new proposals to the programme for a number of years.

These were further extended in subsequent budgets and now apply to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients under 26 years of age.</p>  <p>  This is a targeted, non-discriminatory, measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency by incentivising them to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.</p>  <p>  To guard against the development of welfare dependency I believe it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If they do not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long term unemployed from a young age.  </p>  <p>  Any change to the reduced rates of JA for people under 26 is a matter for Government to consider in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

Officials in my Department are actively working on the detailed review required to progress this issue.  This is a complex area that is not limited to the potential extension of these provisions to the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment and as a result the review will take time to complete.  Any resultant changes would also require legislation.</p>  <p>  The issue of maintenance payments is first and foremost a private matter for the persons concerned, and if they cannot resolve the problem, for the Courts through family law provisions.</p>  <p>  The liability to maintain family provisions, contained in social welfare legislation, are separate to family law legislation.  In every case where a one parent family payment is awarded, the Department seeks to trace the other parent (liable relative) to ascertain whether he/she is in a financial position to contribute towards the cost of this payment.  This does not alter an individual&rsquo;s obligation to pay maintenance pursuant to a Court Order. </p>  <p>  Currently, once the one-parent family payment recipient&rsquo;s youngest child reaches age 7, and their entitlement to the one-parent family payment ceases, the liability assessed under the liable relative provisions no longer applies.  My Department advises the liable relative accordingly.  It is important to note that this does not affect any other maintenance arrangements that may be in place. </p></reply>

I recently had a constructive meeting with the Irish Postmasters Union and will be meeting with Bobby Kerr next week. </p>  <p>  My Department recently wrote to a cohort of jobseeker customers, who are classified as casual jobseekers, offering the option of payment to an account.  These customers are in-work and claim a jobseekers payment for 2 to 3 days per week or work week on/week-off.  They were paid by cheque each week due to the changing nature of their work/claiming patterns and the short turn-around time to issue and collect payments.  This group of customers were not paid via post offices under the department&rsquo;s existing cash payments contract with An Post.  The vast majority have responded and opted for payment to a bank account.

Abolishing the bereavement grant provided an annual saving of &euro;22 million.  This allowed the Department to protect other more fundamental social welfare payments such as the State pension. </p>  <p>  There are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant.  These include a weekly-paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  In Budget 2016, the Government increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone cares for an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure including help with funeral and burial expenses which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.  However, there is no automatic entitlement to such a payment.  An ENP is a means tested payment payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances.</p>  <p>  Any decision to restore the bereavement grant would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that reducing waiting times on applications is a key priority.</p>  <p>  As part of its programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented by the Department in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.</p>  <p>  In addition, staffing needs are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  Where additional staffing is deployed to a scheme, such as has happened for carer&rsquo;s allowance, there is a time-lag involved while those staff are trained and build up expertise.  </p>  <p>  In general terms, processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of disability and caring schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means-tested payments also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process.  </p>  <p>  The improved decision making is reflected in the numbers of appeals received, which are down from a peak of 35,500 in 2012 to 25,000 in 2015.  Processing times for appeals have also improved and seen a reduction of over 50% in the time taken to hear oral appeals; down from 52 weeks in 2011 to less than 24 weeks currently.

The scheme currently supports over 41,000 recipients and almost 74,300 children.</p>  <p>  The reforms to the one-parent family payment scheme were introduced to address long-term social welfare income support dependency.  The reforms provide enhanced access to the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service to lone parents once their youngest child turns 7 years of age.  Access to the Department&rsquo;s range of education and employment support services is essential to facilitate lone parents to progress into sustainable employment and financial independence.</p>  <p>  Budget 2016 contained a number of measures to support lone parents, including working lone parents.  For example a lone parent on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment working 15 hours at the national minimum wage saw an increase in their overall income of just over &euro;28 per week from approximately &euro;306 in 2015 to &euro;334 in 2016.  This is as a result of the increase in the national minimum wage, the more generous means test on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment and the increase in fuel allowance.  They also received an extra &euro;5 per month per child as a result of the increase in child benefit. </p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that the social impact assessment of Budget 2016 showed that budgetary policy would increase average household incomes for working lone parents by 2%.  Non-earning lone parents also fared above average, gaining 1.8%.  </p>  <p>  Research shows that being at work reduces the at-risk-of-poverty rate for lone parents by three-quarters - compared to those who do not work.  This highlights that the best way to tackle poverty among lone parents is to assist them into employment.  Access to activation supports is therefore vital to achieve this objective and it is therefore imperative that my Department continues to engage with lone parents to assist them into employment. </p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that supports in relation to housing and the provision of financial supports, including the rent supplement scheme currently supporting some 55,000 recipients at a cost of &euro;267 million in 2016, are a key priority as evidenced by the early implementation of this Government commitment. </p><p>In line with priority recommendations made in the report of the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness, the review sets the rent limits in line with market rents which have been benchmarked at the 35<sup>th</sup>percentile of agreed rents as registered with the Residential Tenancies Board.  Substantial levels of increases are being provided throughout the country, in both urban and rural areas, reflecting the local rental market conditions.  Detail of the revised limits is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.welfare.ie</i>.</p><p>The new limits, combined with the flexible approach provided by the Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service and the Tenancy Protection Service, operated by Threshold, will provide for increased security for persons seeking support under the rent supplement scheme.  To date, over 8,700 persons at imminent risk of homelessness have been supported through increased payments under this flexible approach.  </p><p>I would urge that any person experiencing increased rents or facing the threat of the loss of their tenancy under rent supplement to contact the Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service or the Threshold Tenancy Protection service without delay. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The updated National Action Plan for Social Inclusion identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing poverty.  The goals include a focus on early childhood development, youth exclusion, access to the labour market, migrant integration, social housing and affordable energy.</p>  <p>  The national social target, set in 2010, is to reduce consistent poverty to 4% by 2016 and to 2% or less by 2020.  The target is to lift over 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020.  Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the Europe 2020 poverty target is to lift a minimum of 200,000 people out of &lsquo;combined poverty&rsquo; (i.e. at-risk-of-poverty and/or basic deprivation) by 2020.    </p>  <p>  These targets are now more challenging than when they were set, because poverty rates rose substantially during the recession from 2009 to 2013.  However, the CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) shows that for the first time since the crisis poverty levels stabilised in 2014.  Consistent poverty decreased marginally to 8% while consistent poverty among children was 11.2%.  </p>  <p>  The full impact of the recovery is not yet reflected in these 2014 figures.  Ireland has returned to strong economic and employment growth.  The unemployment rate in May 2016 was 7.8%, down from a peak of 15% in 2012.  As unemployment is strongly linked to poverty, we can expect further decreases in poverty as the figures for 2015 and 2016 become available.  It is envisaged that 2015 data will be released in November next.</p>  <p>  Social transfers play a crucial role in alleviating poverty and inequality.  In 2014, social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate in Ireland from 37.2% to 15.6%, thereby lifting over a fifth of the population out of income poverty.  Ireland is the best performing EU member state in reducing poverty through social transfers.</p>  <p>  Continued economic recovery, together with government action to sustain and develop the social welfare system, will support further reductions in poverty over the coming years.</p></reply>

The main reasons cited for this is an increase in claims frequency over recent years by such schemes.  In the first instance, the Department recommends that schemes seek alternative quotes to ensure they get value for money.  In this context, schemes are asked to be especially mindful of their obligations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</p>  <p>  Insurance premium costs are reimbursed from the CE materials budget for the scheme.

The means test for carers allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  Since April 2008, the income disregard has been &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple.  This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of &euro;35,400 and qualify for the maximum rate of carers allowance as well as the associated free travel and where resident with the recipient of care, household benefits.</p>  <p>  Removing the means test would involve changing the nature of the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance scheme from a targeted income maintenance support for those most in need to a universal care support, in effect a payment for the provision of care rather than an income support payment for people on low incomes.  The only eligibility criteria remaining would be that the care recipient required full-time care and that the carer was providing that care on a full time basis.  Therefore, it is considered best that the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance means test should remain to ensure the most effective use of resources.   </p>  <p>  The Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant (CSG) (formerly known as the respite care grant) is a non-means tested, non-taxable annual payment paid to carers providing full-time care and attention to a care recipient.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that earlier this month, the grant, increased to &euro;1,700 in Budget 2016, issued automatically, to carers in receipt of Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance or Prescribed Relative's Allowance.  The CSG is also payable, in certain circumstances, to other carers who may still apply through my Department&rsquo;s stand-alone RCG section.  It is expected that in excess of 90,000 grants will be paid in 2016 at an estimated cost of &euro;157.6 million. </p>  <p>  Conscious of the reports of the Ombudsman regarding the legal status of both the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant Schemes in the context of the Equal Status Acts, the Government decided to close both schemes.  In addition the Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by my colleague the Minister for Health. </p>  <p>  Monthly payments continue to be made by the Health Service Executive to the 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time the scheme closed in 2013.  Work is ongoing on the policy proposals to be brought to Government for the drafting of primary legislation for a new scheme.  The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In addition, as a community work placement scheme, T&uacute;s provides valuable services to local communities.</p>  <p>  The twelve month duration of a T&uacute;s work placement was set to reflect a number of inter-related requirements.  These include the need to ensure that the limited numbers of placements available are open to the maximum number of people on the live register, that weaknesses identified in other work programmes resulting from longer duration placements are not replicated and the need to ensure that the scheme fits with the objectives set out in the Government&rsquo;s activation policies including Pathways to Work.

The Authority provides a wide range of information and guidance to help and support trustees to comply with their regulatory obligations as set out under legislation.  The Authority, in consultation with my Department, is continually assessing governance issues and making improvements in order to protect the members of pension schemes.   </p>  <p>  For example, the Authority has introduced trustee training obligations where trustees must receive training in governance matters to improve the quality of trusteeship.  It further introduced a Pensions Data Register where since 2011 some one million data submissions have been processed through the system.  The Authority has published a comprehensive series of model documents for trustees and administrators.</p>  <p>  The Authority has outlined plans for improved pension scheme governance in their Statement of Strategy 2016-2020 where it intends to further target areas such as governance and obligations of stakeholders by providing codes of conduct and models of best practice.</p>  <p>  On the wider EU level Ireland has implemented the first EU Directive 2003/41/EC on the Activities and Supervision of Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision (IORPS).  The IORPS Directive established the basic EU requirements for occupational pension funds and their supervision, including rules obliging schemes to invest their assets prudently.  Ireland has also been centrally involved in discussions on the revision of the IORPS Directive - IORPS II.  The IORPS II Directive is anticipated to be approved by member states shortly and Ireland will have a two year timescale to transpose the Directive into Irish law.  It is anticipated that the proposed revisions, which Ireland supports, will provide for, and improve, minimum standards in the areas of scheme governance requirements, e.g., new structures for risk management and evaluation, internal audit, internal control and remuneration.  It may also include new requirements regarding &lsquo;fit and proper&rsquo; management standards in schemes and the safekeeping of assets.  It is anticipated that final provisions will result in improvements in the areas of transparency, trustee competencies and scheme governance.</p>  <p>  Specific issues in relation to the Central Remedial Clinic Plan may be more appropriate for my colleague, the Minister for Health, given that the Central Remedial Clinic (CRC) is funded by the Health Service Executive under Section 38 of the Health Act 2004.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It also includes provisions on a common policy on the temporary entry of persons, the harmonisation of external border controls, and cross-border police and judicial co-operation.</p>  <p>  The relevant Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997 recognised the fact that Ireland and the United Kingdom were not parties to the original Schengen Agreement and made provision to allow those Member States to accept some or all of its provisions.</p>  <p>  Council Decision 2002/192/EC adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 28 February 2002, provided a basis for the partial implementation of the Schengen acquis in Ireland and remains in force.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has not applied to participate in those aspects of the Schengen acquis that provide for the abolition of internal border checks. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s participation in and right to &lsquo;opt-out&rsquo; from the Schengen acquis is explicitly guaranteed by the 2009 Treaty of Lisbon.</p>  <p>  Article 5 to Protocol (No 19) to the Lisbon Treaty provides that Ireland is deemed to be in any measures which build on those parts of the Schengen acquis in which it already participates unless, within three months of the publication of the proposal or initiative, it notifies the Council that it does not wish to take part in the measure. </p>  <p>  It is Government policy to maintain the Common Travel Area with the UK and there is no proposal by any party to change Ireland's opt-out of the Schengen border arrangements.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Garda authorities that towing management contracts are advertised to the market by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) to provide an outsourced solution to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in recovering, storing and the associated administrative work in managing seized vehicles. </p>  <p>  I am further informed that there are six towing contracts in place in the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  These contracts were awarded following the appropriate tender processes, including advertising in the EU Official Journals (OJEU).  The most recent DMR tender was for Dublin West and it was put in place by the OGP following an OJEU tender process in 2015.  The previous contract, which was held by Gannon City Recovery, was extended to 6 March 2016 to facilitate the OGP tender process.  The new contract commenced on 7 March 2016 and expires on 6 March 2017.  It can be extended on a yearly basis up to a maximum of four years. The contractor is Gannon City Recovery. </p>  <p>  No maximum prices are set by the OGP/An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to daily storage of vehicles that have been seized.  This is a matter for the contractor concerned.  The onus is on owners to reclaim their vehicles once they are cleared by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, thus minimising any additional charges that they might incur. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's query in relation to private information held by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is subject to the provisions of Data Protection legislation and has a comprehensive code of practice in place in this regard.</p></reply>

Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, and a total of 851 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 300 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year. So far 463 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.

We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake this year and in coming years<b><font color="#000080">. </font></b></p><p>In accelerating recruitment it is, of course, essential to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to train larger numbers without any diminution in the quality of its training programme, and to provide appropriate supervision and support to newly qualified Garda&iacute; to ensure that victims, and the public generally, are well served by their policing service.  My officials are also engaging with Garda management as a matter of priority in relation to the preparation of a recruitment plan for the next five years that will deliver increased numbers of Garda&iacute; without any compromise on the quality of those recruited or the training programme.  I expect to be in position to bring my proposals in this regard to Government before the Summer.</p></reply>

Until Article 50 Lisbon Treaty is invoked by the UK and negotiations on the terms of their interaction with the EU, and with Ireland, begin it remains to be seen precisely what the impact on the UK economy will be in the medium to long term.  Much will depend on the new arrangements, including on trade, that are yet to be agreed between the UK and the EU.</p>  <p>  The fiscal space of just under &euro;1 billion for 2017 set out in the Summer Economic Statement (SES) is not expected to change materially as almost all the factors used to calculate it under the expenditure benchmark are included the European Commission's 2016 Spring Economic Forecast.  Utilisation of this fiscal space in 2017 is consistent with compliance with the balanced budget rule based on the forecasts in the SES and this will be checked again in the forecasts to be prepared for the Budget in October.</p>  <p>  For the ensuing years, 2018-2021, the impact is difficult to estimate given that the fiscal space estimations are based on Department of Finance projections for the GDP deflators, reference rates and convergence margins.  Any negative impact on the UK economy in the medium term could have potential implications for the actual variables used to calculate the fiscal space in these years.  The actual final calculation for each year using the expenditure benchmark methodology will use the factors set out in the European Commission's Spring Forecasts of the previous year.</p>  <p>  My Department's next official forecasts will be provided in October in the context of the Budget.

The UK remains a full member until such time as it formally leaves, following the invoking of Article 50 and subsequent negotiations.  These negotiations may not begin for some time.

There will be no early change to the free flow of people, goods and services between our islands. </p>  <p>  In relation to the available fiscal space for 2017, the position is that the Summer Economic Statement (SES) 2016, set out a macroeconomic assessment of the impact of a UK decision to leave the European Union. It should be noted that the fiscal space of just under &euro;1 billion for 2017, as set out in the SES, is not expected to change significantly.  This is due to the fact that the factors used to calculate the fiscal space are largely finalised at this stage.  My Department's next official forecasts will be in October in the context of the Budget.  These will set out updated estimates of economic growth, the public finances and fiscal space.</p>  <p>  In the context of the current ambitious package of reform measures relating to enhanced involvement of the Oireachtas in budget scrutiny, the Government is committed to engaging with the Oireachtas as a partner throughout the budgetary and Finance Bill processes.  I look forward to seeing the results of that engagement.

This decision will have an adverse impact on the growth outlook.  In this context, the more traditional exporting sectors are particularly exposed, especially to bilateral euro sterling exchange rate developments.  My Department's initial estimate, based on the assessment in the SES, is that GDP growth could be about 0.5% lower than projected in 2017.   </p>  <p>  The fiscal space of just under &euro;1 billion for 2017 set out in the Summer Economic Statement is not expected to change very much because the factors used to calculate it are largely fixed at this stage.</p>  <p>  Looking to 2018 and beyond, the estimates of fiscal space depend on the impact on our macroeconomic and fiscal position.  At this point, it is far too early to speculate on the potential impacts.  </p>  <p>  As noted in the Summer Economic Statement, the Department of Finance will prepare a full macroeconomic projection in advance of Budget 2017 in October, and this will include updated estimates of economic growth, the public finances and the fiscal space, taking account of developments up to that time, including the UK decision.</p>  <p>  However, it is important to note that there is uncertainty around many aspects of the impact of the UK decision, and particularly the economic and fiscal impact.  </p>  <p>  As you are aware, a whole-of-government contingency framework has been put in place in response to the UK vote, within which key policy issues, including economic developments, will continue to be tracked and the Budget 2017 forecasts will be a critical part of that process. </p>  <p>  Finally, the prudent economic and fiscal policies implemented over recent years have placed Ireland in a stronger position to weather this shock.  Our economy is growing strongly, employment has increased for 14 successive quarters, unemployment has fallen to 7.8%, the deficit this year is expected to be 0.9%, and the debt has fallen from a peak of 120% to an expected 88% at the end of this year.  The Government is confident that our economy is resilient and that appropriate economic and fiscal policies are in place to deal with the challenges arising.</p></reply>

Over the same period, leading UK banks have fallen by a range of 23%-28% while the European bank sector has fallen by 17%.  Clearly these moves suggest investors believe bank profitability in the coming years will be materially impacted.  Indeed analysts have already moved to downgrade their earnings projections for UK and Irish banks and companies in many other sectors too.</p>  <p>  Given our substantial financial interest in the banking sector, these developments are disappointing and we are closely monitoring events as they evolve.  As I indicated in recent PQ responses, the current volatility in the stock markets are such that I expected that any market event involving our shares in the banks was more likely in 2017 than this year.  As such the State had no plans to dispose of any of its bank shares in the coming months and no sale proceeds are included in the 2016 budget, so there is no immediate impact on our finances.  In fact next month AIB is still scheduled to redeem its Contingent Capital Note of &euro;1.6bn plus accrued interest. </p>  <p>  As part of their day-to-day role, officials in the Shareholding Management Unit will continue to monitor market conditions, review all strategic options relating to our banking investments and will consider from time to time whether the sale of shares would be beneficial for the State.  Having said that I have no current plans to sell shares in any of the banks, notwithstanding the flexibility to do so within the Programme for Government.   </p>  <p>   Note: AIB's share price has fallen by circa 13% over the same period though the very small free float involved means this is not a reliable indicator of the change in the bank's underlying value.</p></reply>

The result marks the beginning of a new phase of negotiated withdrawal one that is expected to take place over at least two years and possibly longer.  Separate negotiations on the new relationship between the UK and the EU will also take place, if that is what the UK seeks.  The key priority for Government is to protect and promote Ireland's interests to the greatest extent possible.  Based on the analysis carried out by all Departments, including the Department of Finance, a framework has been developed on a whole of Government basis to identify contingencies that may arise in the days, weeks and months that follow the outcome of the UK referendum.  </p><p>In it's latest Macro Financial Review (MFR) the Central Bank noted that the effects on the profitability and business models of Irish-based financial institutions, including banks and insurers, could be material and could vary across firms and sectors depending on the nature of the new relationship agreed between the UK and EU and their exposure to UK markets.  The Central Bank has been engaging with firms across all parts of the financial sector, with a particular focus on the firms with the largest UK exposures, to ensure they are prepared for risks associated with the UK leaving the European Union.  </p><p>In terms of the implications of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union on the passporting regime, it is unclear at this time and will depend on the negotiations on the UK's future relationship with the EU.  The situation is complex as financial institutions in Ireland can passport services to the UK while financial institutions in the UK can passport services into Ireland.  The range of possible new arrangements is wide and it is too early to speculate at this stage. </p><p>The Central Bank maintains lists of firms which have notified it of the intention to offer services in Ireland through a passporting arrangement.  These lists are available at  and are maintained by industry sector (i.e.  Credit Institutions, Insurance Undertakings etc.).</p><p>In that MFR it was noted that an exit from the EU could have implications for insurance firms located in Ireland conducting business in the UK market, while the possible removal of UK competitors may benefit other firms operating in Ireland. Premium volumes written by life and non-life firms on an &quot;outward&quot; and &quot;inward&quot; basis between Ireland and the UK in 2014 were &euro;3.8 billion and &euro;8.6 billion, respectively.  </p><p>The Department of Finance and the Central Bank do engage regularly on material issues relevant to the financial services sector and will continue to do so as the process of withdrawal progresses.</p></reply>

Its goal is to increase the availability of funding to SMEs, at a lower cost and on more flexible terms, than has been available in recent times on the Irish Market.  The SBCI channels its funds through lending partners known as on-lenders.  The SBCI currently has three bank and three non-bank on-lending partners.</p><p>To the end of December 2015, in its first nine months of operation, the SBCI has lent almost &euro;172 million to c.4,600 SMEs, with broad coverage across various business sectors and regions.  The SBCI publishes results biannually and will publish results for the first half of this year in July 2016.</p><p>The level of lending to SMEs is to a large degree driven by market demand, and the SBCI is engaged with a range of potential new on-lenders to broaden its distribution capability and market coverage.  In doing so, the SBCI is seeking to deliver a wide variety of types of funding including those that support export orientated SMEs. </p><p>The SBCI will announce a new on-lender in the coming week, who will use SBCI funds to provide working capital finance products to the Irish SME market.  Discussions are progressing well with additional on-lenders, and it is expected that further announcements may be made in the coming months.</p><p>It may also interest the Deputy to note that an interagency Export Finance Working Group with membership drawn from my Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation, Enterprise Ireland, ISIF and the SBCI is currently progressing the development of a pilot financial product that would support the exporting activity of Irish SMEs.</p><p>In relation to the UK Referendum on membership of the EU, my officials met with multiple stakeholders, including the banks, to discuss preparatory actions for the outcome to the Referendum.  I understand that banks have put in place resources to support their SME customers who could be affected including:</p><p>- Dedicated information resources on Brexit (i.e. teleconferences, websites, questions and answers documents);</p><p>- Daily market commentaries distributed to SMEs; and</p><p>- Additional treasury and support staff to answer customer queries.</p><p>Following the outcome of the UK Referendum on membership of the EU, I expect that the banking sector will:</p><p>- Continue their high levels of customer engagement, particularly in relation to treasury and foreign exchange matters;</p><p>- Engage directly with Enterprise Ireland in relation to supporting exporting SMEs; and</p><p>- Make available finance to viable business cases to support SMEs entering new export markets outside the UK. </p><p>Intensive contacts will continue between State bodies and the banks so as to respond to developments in the coming weeks and months.  Indeed, the Heads of Business Banking in AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank have met with the Board of Enterprise Ireland to discuss the potential impact of Brexit on exporters and SMEs. </p></reply>

The IFS sector now employs about 38,000 people across over 400 companies with a 10,000 of those employed outside Dublin.</p>  <p>  The strategy seeks to ensure that we protect the progress that has been made but to also to develop further as we recognise that we cannot stand still.  In terms of vision for the Strategy we want Ireland to be recognised as a global location of choice for specialised international financial services, building on our strengths in talent, technology, innovation and excellent client service while focusing on capturing on new opportunities in a changing market and embracing the highest forms of governance.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to remain focused on the successful implementation of the IFS 2020 strategy and the development of a robust and sustainable financial services sector in Ireland.  As we have always done, we will continue to market Ireland across the globe as the number one location for foreign direct investment.</p>  <p>  In relation to the physical infrastructure, the capabilities and associated infrastructure to support international financial services activity now extends well beyond the original boundaries of the IFSC.  For example, the funds industry employs people in over ten counties around Ireland.  Other financial services companies and firms are also located throughout Dublin and in other centres around the country so there are a range of options for firms considering Ireland as a base.  </p>  <p>  Currently about 3.5 million square feet of office space is under construction.  It should also be noted that of this 3.5 million square feet, at least 1 million square foot is pre-let with legal contracts exchanged with a further 600k square feet formally reserved.</p>  <p>  Annual office take up last year was c. 2.6 million square feet and expected take up in 2016 estimated at around 2million square feet.</p>  <p>  Figures provided by the IDA forecast that there is approximately 5.2 million square feet of grade A office space due for delivery by end of 2018.  </p>  <p>  We will continue, through the IDA, to promote the attractiveness of Ireland as a location of choice for investment and talent.  This is based on our unique competitive strengths and our position as an English-speaking country in Europe.</p>  <p>  Naturally, there may be new opportunities arising for Ireland in certain sectors, many of which already form part of the IDA's marketing strategy.  We will, for example, continue to implement our clear strategy for driving growth in the financial services sector and we will maximise any opportunities that might arise.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Central Bank had considered the potential financial regulatory resource implications of a UK vote to leave the EU.  At present, the Central Bank Commission is satisfied that it has the resources required to regulate the financial sector.  I am confident based on the Central Bank's ability to significantly expand its regulatory resources in the last seven years that it is capable of doing so again in order to properly supervise and regulate additional financial service activity that may relocate to Ireland.</p></reply>

Beneficial ownership of the assets in an ARF vests in the individual owner of the ARF and, among other conditions, the ARF must be managed by an independent Qualifying Fund Manager.  The ARF option is an alternative to annuity purchase and essentially gives control over post-retirement income to those individuals who, generally, have borne the investment risk on their funds in the pension growth phase.</p>  <p>  A Buy-out Bond, otherwise known as a Personal Retirement Bond, is a single premium pension policy into which an existing pension fund or the cash value of an accrued pension benefit can be transferred from a Defined Contribution (DC) or Defined Benefit (DB) occupational pension scheme.  Buy-out Bonds are generally effected by the trustees of a scheme on behalf of a scheme member when the scheme member is leaving the employment of the scheme-sponsor or when the scheme is being wound-up, in lieu of providing the member with a preserved retirement benefit under the scheme.  They are also availed of in circumstances where the scheme member's pension entitlements are being split under the terms of a pension adjustment order.  Buy-out Bonds are usually provided and administered by life assurance companies.</p>  <p>  There is no requirement on Qualifying Fund Managers or on life assurance companies to provide my Department or the Revenue Commissioners with detailed data of the kind requested in the questions in relation to ARFs or Buy-Out Bonds.  I am, therefore, not in a position to supply the Deputy with information on the current numbers or values of such products.</p>  <p>  I am assuming that the questions raised by the Deputy have been prompted by the change which I announced last week whereby the holders of Buy-out Bonds whose funds originate from DB schemes will from now on have access to the ARF option.  Buy-out Bonds whose transfer values originate from DB schemes have not had access to the ARF option up to now and the only option available to the holder of a Bond in those circumstances has been to purchase a pension annuity with the remaining funds in the Bond (after taking the permissible tax-free retirement lump sum).  Buy-out Bonds are DC pension products, however, and whether funded originally from DB or DC pension schemes, the holders of such Bonds bear the investment risk on their funds in the same way as holders of other DC pension savings who would have access to the ARF option as well as the annuity purchase option at retirement. </p>  <p>  The ARF option is not available to the main benefits paid from DB pension schemes, generally, since it was never intended or considered a necessary requirement for such schemes which pay out a specified pension benefit.  This position remains unchanged.  </p>  <p>  My decision to change the policy on ARF access for the holders of Buy-out Bonds whose funds originate from DB schemes has been particularly informed by the increasing frequency over recent years of the wind-up of DB pension schemes, with the members of such schemes having no choice in many cases but to accept a transfer to a Buy-out Bond and inevitable annuity purchase on retirement.  The policy change will be of particular benefit to individuals in this situation.  The Deputy should note that there is no Exchequer cost involved as a result of this change.</p></reply>

The review is looking at all aspects of DEIS, including the identification process for the inclusion of schools in the programme, the range and impact of different elements of the School Support Programme, and the scope for increased integration of services provided by other Departments and agencies, in order to improve effectiveness. </p><p>  As part of the review, targeted measures in a number of key areas will be considered.  They include: Supporting school leadership; Networks and clusters for DEIS teachers and schools; Teaching methodologies; Exploring ways in which the work of schools could be better integrated with other state supports within the community, and in consultation with Minister Zappone, making greater use of Home School Community Liaison.</p><p>I intend that innovative measures such as these, which are shown to work well in improving results for disadvantaged children and students, can form pilot schemes under a new schools support programme.</p><p>The number of additional schools to be included in the new programme will be determined by a new identification process for this purpose, which is currently in development and all schools will be assessed.

Droichead which is the enhanced model of induction for Newly Qualified Teachers (NQTs) developed by the Council is being phased in at present and will be the only recognised route of induction for all new teachers from September 2018.  In the meantime, NQTs in mainstream settings may complete probation through external evaluation conducted by my Department's inspectors. However, completion of the induction/probation process in special education settings can only be achieved through the Droichead process.</p><p>  Arrangements for the Supplementary Panel will be reviewed with the relevant education stakeholders later this year to determine what adjustment, if any, is required for the 2017/18 school year.</p></reply>

With regard to the institute of technology sector, the Strategy recommended significant reforms to position the sector to meet national strategic objectives.  In particular, in order to qualify for technological university status, the Strategy recommended that Institutes of Technology would have to merge and to demonstrate significant progress against robust performance criteria before they can apply to be designated as a technological university. </p>  <p>  The Government is keen not to replicate the mistakes made in other countries and to avoid a scenario whereby Institutes of Technology are allowed to become Technological Universities simply as a rebranding exercise, in the process damaging the strengths of the sector, and the national and international reputation of the Irish Higher Education system, built up over many years.  </p>  <p>  Regional Focus: There will also be a specific focus on the particular contribution the university will make to the needs of the region in which it is located.  The development of technological universities has the potential to deliver greater opportunity to students in these regions, to staff working in the institutions, and to the broader local economy and society. </p>  <p>  Consortiums who have applied: As part of the implementation of the Strategy, the Higher Education Authority in 2012 published a four-stage process and criteria for applicant groups of institutes of technology wishing to apply to become technological universities. </p>  <p>  The designation process consists of four stages as follows:</p>  <p>   - an expression of interest,</p>  <p>  - the preparation of a plan to meet the criteria,</p>  <p>  - an evaluation of the plan, and</p>  <p>  - an application for designation.</p>  <p>  There are currently four consortia engaged with the process to become designated as TUs.  These are TU4Dublin (Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Tallaght, Institute of Technology Blanchardstown), Technological University for the South-East (TUSE &ndash; consisting of Waterford Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Carlow), Munster Technological University (MTU &ndash; consisting of Cork Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Tralee) and the Connacht Ulster Alliance (CUA &ndash; consisting of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Sligo and Letterkenny Institute of Technology). </p>  <p>  Position of Technological Universities Bill: The first Government Legislative Programme of this new Partnership Government was published on 8 June 2016, and the Technological Universities Bill has been restored to the D&aacute;il Order Paper at Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  I recognise that there were a significant number of matters raised in respect of the Bill at both Committee and Report Stage.  It is my intention to now consult with all of the relevant stakeholders, including Athlone Institute of Technology (AIT), in relation to both the matters raised during the legislative process and the commitments contained in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  Following the finalisation of this consultation process I will then advance the legislation having determined a position in relation to any matters raised as part of this consultation process.</p></reply>

The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and information from my Department's own databases.</p>  <p>  The outcome of the latest demographic exercises, based on the GIS, was the announcement in November 2015 of the establishment of 13 new schools to open nationwide in 2017 and 2018 to cater for increased demographic needs.  One of the new post-primary schools will serve the Swords school planning area and one will serve the Malahide and Portmarnock school planning areas.  Both new schools will open in 2017 and both are included in my Department's six year construction programme (2016-2021).  Details on the progress of all projects on this programme will be published on my Department's website and this will be updated regularly.</p>  <p>  In April this year, my Department issued an invitation to all school patron bodies and prospective patron bodies to apply for the patronage of the nine new post-primary schools, including the schools to serve the areas referred to by the Deputy.  As part of the application process, prospective patrons must submit completed parental preferences, including whether parents wish their children to be educated through the medium of Irish or of English.  The closing date for receipt of applications to my Department was Wednesday 8th June. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently assessing the applications received from the prospective patrons and an assessment report will be prepared for the consideration of the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG).  The Group will then submit a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  I will announce the patronage of the schools following completion of the process and the patronage assessment report will be published on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  My Department are liaising with Fingal County Council in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding in relation to the identification and acquisition of suitable locations for these schools. </p>  <p>  Agreement in principle has been reached in respect of a site for the new post-primary school in Swords and my Department is currently progressing with its acquisition.</p>  <p>  In relation to the new post-primary school to serve the Malahide and Portmarnock areas, the technical feasibility of an identified site option is currently being comprehensively assessed by officials from my Department in liaison with officials from the Local Authority.</p>  <p>  Due to commercial sensitivities relating to site acquisitions generally, I am, unfortunately, not in a position to provide further details at this time.  I can, however, assure you that the site acquisitions for both of these schools are being advanced by my Department and that pending the delivery of the permanent school buildings, temporary accommodation will be provided.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's policy in allocating this support. </p>  <p>  Staffing arrangements for special schools are in line with policy advice provided by the NCSE which did not recommend alteration to staffing ratios established under SERC Report in 1993.</p>  <p>  Circular 0042/2011 provides information to schools regarding the staffing arrangements which apply in Special schools.</p>  <p>  The Circular sets out that special schools are staffed based on their pupil profiles and the disability category of the pupils enrolled, as opposed to being based principally on school designation.  Staffing levels therefore reflect the complexity of needs that exist within schools rather than being determined solely by a school's designation, in recognition that many Special schools enrol students from disability categories other than from those provided for by their school designations. </p>  <p>  In determining the staffing allocation for schools, including the above school, the NCSE takes into account up-to-date enrolment and pupil profile information. School staffing schedules are reviewed and updated each year by the NCSE.  As such, the profile of Special school pupil populations are aligned with appropriate staffing allocations.  Accordingly, the staffing allocation for the school referred to in the Deputy's question has been calculated to reflect the profile of pupils currently enrolled in the school, in accordance with each pupil's disability categorisation. </p>  <p>  The NCSE are currently considering additional information in relation to the school's staffing allocation for 2016/17 and the school will be advised of the outcome of the NCSE's decision shortly.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that on 14th June, 2016, I announced that 860 additional SNAs will be available for allocation to schools from September 2016.</p><p>12,900 SNA posts will now be available at a total gross annual cost of &euro;425 million.  This is more SNAs than we have ever had previously and will ensure that all children who qualify for SNA support can continue to receive access to such support. </p><p>In total, the number of SNAs available has increased by almost 22% since 2011, at which point 10,575 posts were available. </p><p>The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to schools is set out in my Departments Circular, DES 30/2014, which states that a key feature of the NCSE allocation process is to provide an annual allocation of SNA support to eligible schools.</p><p>The NCSE issues notification to schools each year requesting they submit applications for SNA support to the NCSE for the coming school year.  Having considered all of the applications received, the NCSE advises schools of their SNA allocation quantum for the coming school year, taking into account the number of valid applications received and the assessed care needs of the children concerned. </p><p>This year, the NCSE asked all schools to submit applications for SNA support by 29th February, 2016.</p><p>The NCSE advised all schools of their allocations for SNA support for the 2016/17 school year, on 14th June, 2016, based on the number of valid applications received.  The NCSE also published details of the allocations for SNA support on their website<i>www.ncse.ie.</i></p><p>In making applications for SNA support for the coming school year, schools will have been engaging with their local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) in relation to these applications.  Where an adjustment or reduction in a schools SNA support is likely to take place, a SENO will normally indicate this to a school in advance.  However, the formal notification to schools cannot be made until the allocation process is finalised for all schools.  </p><p>The provision of allocations in June ensures that schools have sufficient time to plan for the provision of supports in advance of September 2016.  It also gives schools certainty as to the resources which will be available to them for the coming school year.</p><p>Whereas the NCSE will continue to consider applications throughout the school year, in cases where schools have enrolled new pupils with care needs, where new assessments are received, or in cases of emergencies, the main allocation of SNA support is now made to schools on an annual allocation basis and most schools will by now have received their SNA allocations for September 2016. </p><p>It is important to note that the level of SNA support allocated to all schools can change from year to year, as students with care needs leave the school, as new students with care needs enrol, or as students develop more independent living skills as they get older and their care needs diminish over time.  It is therefore appropriate that SNA allocations be reduced in schools which have declining numbers of pupils requiring SNA support, so that they can be reallocated to schools which have increased requirements. </p><p>Where there has been a reduction in SNA support in a school, supplementary assignment arrangements are in place for SNAs, details of which are set out in Departmental Circular 0041/2015.</p><p>Once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service (Service in a substitute capacity i.e. covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job-sharing etc. does not count) is notified by his/her employer that s/he is to be made redundant then s/he shall be deemed to be a member of a supplementary assignment panel for SNAs. </p><p>The operation of this panel is described and outlined in Circular 0041/2015 and it is designed to be as flexible as possible which enables all eligible SNAs, who have the requisite Panel Form 1 completed by their former employer, to apply for any SNA position that is advertised by a school or an ETB with no sectoral, diocesan or geographical limitations imposed.</p><p>Every eligible SNA will remain on the panel for two years with a view to getting further employment. If they are not successful over that period of time in obtaining a further SNA position then they will be eligible for a Redundancy payment.  Furthermore, an SNA may opt out of this supplementary assignment panel at any point in time triggering the processing of his/her redundancy payment in line with the terms set out in the SNA redundancy scheme (DES Circular 58/06) or any revision of same that is applicable at that time.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants.</p><p>The RTB, as an independent statutory body, will adjudicate each dispute on its own facts and merits and may grant redress and give specific direction as appropriate on foot of a determination order.  Receipt of a determination order is the official notification to parties of the final outcome of a dispute resolution case.  The order sets out the terms to be complied with, including any payments owing and the length of time given to comply.  In making determination orders, the RTB can make provision to allow for payment of awards in instalments to facilitate recovery of the award, based on the circumstances of the case.  A party who fails to comply with one or more terms of a determination order is open to having legal proceedings taken against him or her in the Courts.</p><p>Under the Act, enforcement of RTB determination orders is a discretionary power and the Board exercises this power taking account of the circumstances pertaining to each case.  While there is no legal obligation on the RTB to enforce, the Board takes the issue of non-compliance with determination orders very seriously.  In 2015 alone it referred 312 cases to its legal advisors for enforcement proceedings.  It is also open to parties to pursue enforcement independently through the Courts, including the seeking of a garnishee order.  It should be noted that going to Court does not of itself ensure successful enforcement and more particularly, recoupment of an award.  In many cases the best option, and one which the RTB facilitates, is for the parties to agree a schedule of payments.</p><p>Details on the number of dispute applications and enforcement requests received by the RTB are available in the RTB Annual Reports at .</p></reply>

The rates applicable for the half-yearly and quarterly options are 55.5% and 28.25% of the annual charge, respectively.  These relativities have remained generally consistent since the 1960s.</p>  <p>  The differential takes account of the extra workload for staff in motor tax offices and the Driver and Vehicle Computer Services Division of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, which operates the online motor tax system, as well as the resultant administrative costs and printing costs that arise, including the issuing of renewal notices.  Each quarterly renewal of motor tax follows the same administrative procedures as the annual renewal process.  Consequently, renewing on a quarterly basis generates four times the workload of an annual renewal for the equivalent period.</p>  <p>  The loss of income that would arise from changing these arrangements would have a negative impact on the total collected via motor tax and would have to be borne elsewhere in the motor tax system or through the taxation system generally.</p>  <p>  I have no plans currently to review the basis for paying motor tax on a half-yearly or quarterly basis.</p></reply>

The Arrangement document also affirms the parties&rsquo; position that those who have paid their water bills will be treated no less favourably that those who have not.</p>  <p>  The Bill seeks to suspend domestic water charges for a period of 9 months so as to ensure that Irish Water customers are not billed for water services in the period from 1 July 2016 to 31 March 2017 or at any other time in relation to this period.  The suspension is to allow for an extensive deliberative process to be carried out.  An expert commission will be established shortly to consider the long term funding of public domestic water services and make recommendations thereon.  These will be considered by an Oireachtas committee and, ultimately, the Oireachtas will then determine the enduring funding model for public water services into the future.</p>  <p>  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it and all dwellings connected to the public water or waste water systems will remain liable for domestic water charges up to the date the suspension of charges takes effect.</p>  <p>  Section 3(A)(9) of the Water Services Act 2014 provides that a person who is a tenant of a dwelling let under the Housing Acts 1966 to 2014 and who proposes to purchase the dwelling shall before completion of the sale provide the local authority concerned with a certificate of discharge from Irish Water confirming that any water charge in respect of the dwelling owed to Irish Water has been paid.  The sale of the dwelling cannot proceed until a certificate discharge in respect of the dwelling has been received from Irish Water.

Farm assist recipients retain the advantages of the jobseeker's allowance scheme such as the retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.  The 2016 Revised Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure of &euro;85 million on the farm assist scheme.</p>  <p>  Changes introduced in Budgets 2012 and 2013 brought farm assist into closer alignment with the jobseeker's allowance scheme&rsquo;s treatment of self-employed people.  Farm families with the lowest income were least impacted by these changes as the headline rates of farm assist were maintained.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains the commitment to undertake a "Review of the Farm Assist Scheme, recognising the challenges facing farmers on low incomes".  I have asked my officials to review the farm assist scheme from a policy and an administrative point of view.  This review has commenced and its recommendations may be considered in the context of Budget 2017, subject to the overall budgetary context.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the rural social scheme (RSS) is to provide income support aimed at low-income farmers and fishermen in receipt of certain social welfare payments who are underemployed in their primary occupation.  Persons are engaged for 19.5 hours per week to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities.  The scheme currently provides work opportunities for around 2,600 participants and 130 supervisory staff.  The funds allocated for the scheme in 2016 amount to &euro;44.3 million.  This level of funding does not allow for recruitment above the numbers stated above.</p>  <p>  With the ongoing welcome economic recovery, the eligibility criteria for the Rural Social Scheme will be kept under review to ensure that it remains fit for purpose and to ensure that the numbers on the scheme continue to be appropriate.</p></reply>

The overall number of appeals received increased from an average of 15,000 per year up to 2009, to a peak of 35,500 in 2012, reducing annually thereafter to just below 25,000 in 2015.</p><p>Significant effort and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeals process in recent years:</p><p>- Additional appeals officers were appointed to the office</p><p>- An overhaul of the operating model was undertaken</p><p>- New technology to support appeals officers was introduced</p><p>- Work was undertaken with the Department to reduce delays in responding to requests from the appeals office for appeal submissions.</p><p>This resulted in a marked improvement in overall appeal processing times.  The average time taken to determine an appeal requiring an oral hearing reduced from 52.5 weeks in 2011 to 25.5 weeks in 2015 and the average time taken to finalise an appeal decided by way of a summary decision dropped from 25.1 weeks in 2011 to 18.1 weeks in 2015.  This downward trend in overall appeal processing times has continued to date in 2016 to 23.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 17.2 weeks for a summary decision.  </p><p>This overall improvement is also reflected in processing times for carer&rsquo;s allowance appeals.  The average time taken to determine a carer's allowance appeal requiring an oral hearing has reduced from 57.9 weeks in 2011 to 25.5 weeks in 2015 and to 22.4 weeks to date in 2016.  The average time taken to finalise a carer&rsquo;s allowance appeal decided by way of a summary decision dropped from 31.3 weeks in 2011 to 20.6 weeks in 2015 and to 18.2 weeks to date in 2016.</p><p>The quasi-judicial nature of the appeals system means that there are inevitable time-lags involved.  The system is designed to be flexible and fair and allows for review and submission of further information up to and including the oral hearing.  The time taken is proportionate to the complexity of many of the issues under appeal, which require a high level of judgement and often involve complex legal questions.  A number of elements within the process are time-consuming including the need to ensure due process, natural justice and compliance with the statutory obligation to obtain the Department&rsquo;s appeal submission.  If an oral hearing is requested by the appellant or is required to resolve conflicts, the processing time is prolonged</p><p>The Chief Appeals Officer assures me that appeals processing times are continuously monitored and that, although significant progress has been made in reducing appeal processing times in recent years, continued improvement in this area remains a priority.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Appeal processing times by scheme 01/01/2015 &ndash;

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.  In this context, even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their sixteenth and sixty-sixth birthdays, they may qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances.</p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should also note that the &lsquo;marriage bar&rsquo; describes a rule that existed in most of the public service and some private sector employments, where women were required to leave their employment upon marriage.  This practice was abolished in 1973 when Ireland joined the EEC.  As employees in the public service generally paid a reduced rate of PRSI, which provided no cover for the State pension (contributory), the marriage bar would not generally have impacted on State pension entitlement, as they would not have qualified for that payment had they remained in public sector employment.  Instead, by impacting upon their continuing public service employment, the marriage bar&rsquo;s pension implications, where they exist, more generally relate to a person&rsquo;s eventual entitlement to a Public Service pension.  Questions on this are a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives may not qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.</p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;, under which, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical components to be put in place prior its implementation.  The position of women who were home-makers will be considered very carefully in developing this reform.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department, at the request of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, intend to carry out a review of the JST scheme and this is due to be completed during 2017.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that my Department provides a number of income supports to lone parents.  These include the OFP scheme until the youngest child is 7, the JST payment where the youngest child is aged 7-13 years, Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance (JA) where the youngest child is 14 or over and the Family Income Supplement (FIS).  FIS can also be paid concurrently with OFP.  Both the OFP and JST means tests are more generous than that of JA, thereby supporting lone parents to take up employment, which is their best route out of poverty.   </p>  <p>  Lone parents on a jobseeker's payment also gain access to the full range of Intreo supports available to assist them into training, education and employment.  Those on JST receive a more intensive support via a one to one meeting with a case officer followed by an engagement of up to 7 years while the customer is on JST.  Those on JA receive the standard activation process for jobseekers commencing with a group engagement meeting.</p>  <p>  These income and activation supports combined ensure that there are effective resources available to lone parents.</p>  <p>  Budget 2016 saw OFP recipients gain a 75% Christmas bonus, a &euro;5 increase in Child Benefit and an increase of &euro;2.50 per week in fuel allowance.  Those in receipt of FIS also benefitted from the increases to the FIS thresholds.  Lone parents on jobseeker's transitional payment (JST) also gained as a result of the closer alignment of the JST means test with the more generous OFP means test.</p>  <p>  My Department published a social impact assessment of the main social welfare and tax measures of Budget 2015 and 2016.  The assessment found that the cumulative impact of these budgets on lone parent households fared above that of the average household.  The assessment indicated that average income in households where the lone parent is employed will rise by 2.8 per cent, while that of unemployed lone parents will rise by 2.4 per cent.</p></reply>

In doing so it is hoped to promote competitiveness and productivity.</p><p>Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment has fallen substantially to 15% in May 2016.  This compares with a figure of almost 21% just one year ago, in May 2015, and with a peak level of over 31% in May 2012.</p><p>Although the labour market situation is improving considerably as the recovery continues, the Government recognises the importance of a continued focus on measures to facilitate the young unemployed back into work.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy (published January 2016) and the Youth Guarantee plan (published January 2014).</p><p>The key objective of Ireland&rsquo;s policy response to the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee is to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  In this regard there is monthly engagement by case officers with young people to assist them to prepare, review and, if appropriate, revise personal progression plans.  Where young people do not find work relatively quickly, additional supports may be offered, both through reserved places on existing employment and training schemes and through youth-specific measures.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s.  Overall, over 19,100 opportunities were taken up on the relevant programmes in 2015 (see Table 1 to this reply).</p><p>Pathways to Work 2016-2020 continues to prioritise these measures for the young unemployed and further commits to a number of additional measures.  These include increasing the share of workplace-based interventions for youth unemployed; ensuring that monthly engagement, at a minimum, is consistently applied and maintained; restructuring the First Steps programme; and implementing the Defence Forces Skills for Life programme.</p><p>I am confident these measures, and continuing economic recovery, will support further reductions in youth unemployment to add to the substantial improvements that have already been seen over the last few years. </p><p><b>Table 1.

The Department is committed to ensuring that claims are processed as expeditiously as possible.  Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process. </p>  <p>  It is the policy of the Department to standardise and simplify its application forms as much as possible.  The design of the medical elements of application forms is undertaken in consultation with the Department&rsquo;s Chief Medical Adviser and Deputy Chief Medical Adviser. </p>  <p>  As part of the Department&rsquo;s service delivery modernisation programme, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised. </p>  <p>  The new Intreo service integrates employment services and the traditional income support model, providing for a streamlined and personalised service to Jobseekers.  Intreo centres have also introduced an integrated decision-making team to further streamline the processes formerly undertaken by former Local Office staff, Social Welfare Inspectors and the Community Welfare Service. </p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that prompt processing of claims remains a priority for my Department.  Each scheme area is monitored on an on-going basis and processing procedures are reviewed to ensure that claims are paid to customers as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

Following extreme and repeated storm surges experienced on the River Feale Estuary in 2014, several dwellings at Rahoonagh were inundated by tidal flooding.  These properties were constructed since the completion of the Feale CDS.  Consequently, the OPW undertook to improve the flood defences at this location by extending an existing OPW Earthen Flood Defence Embankment by approximately 500 metres and tying it into adjacent higher ground.  This was necessary to provide protection to these vulnerable dwellings which experienced flooding in 2014.</p>  <p>  Following several meetings and protracted negotiations, OPW obtained consent from a local landowner to enter his property to carry out the necessary works.  In recognition of this consent, OPW agreed to extend the flood defence by a further 250 metres to provide protection against tidal inundation of this person&rsquo;s farmland.  This work has been completed.  In common with many other flood defence assets in Co. Kerry, this embankment was damaged by Storm Imogen in February 2016.  OPW intends to carry out necessary repair work and is currently in communication with the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service on the matter.  NPWS consent is necessary as the site lies within a designated Special Area of Conservation and proposed National Heritage Area.</p>  <p>  I understand that the landowner concerned has sought a further extension of the flood defence embankment which would provide protection to a section of land that is only vulnerable to tidal inundation in very extreme events.  OPW would not be justified in further extending the embankment.</p></reply>

The group explored the necessity for and the implications of legislating with regard to a number of issues, including in relation to granting a right of access to private lands by recreational users.</p>  <p>  The group reported in May 2007 and the then Minister formed the view that the most appropriate way forward was to continue on the basis of a permissive access regime with the agreement of landholders via initiatives such as the Walks Scheme and the Pilot Mountain Access Projects.  These initiatives continue to be successfully implemented on the ground by a team of Rural Recreation Officers, employed by Local Development Companies.</p>  <p>  The consensus approach adopted is underpinned by the principle of mutual respect between landowners and recreation users, with the acceptance of the rights of landowners on the one hand and the need of recreation users to have reasonable access to the countryside on the other.  The permissive access model currently used as part of the implementation of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy for the development of greenways and walkways in Ireland has led to the successful delivery of over 880 walking, cycling, and equestrian trails, which are all listed on the Irish Trails Register.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Way Marked trails and the majority of other walking routes are permissive access routes that have been developed with the landowners&rsquo; agreement; they are not public rights of way.  In general, there are very few public rights of way in Ireland which are not maintained public roads.  Public rights of way acquired otherwise than by statute, arise as a result of dedication and acceptance.  Given the success of the permissive model to date, I am of the view that access to private lands for recreational users should continue to be on a permissive basis only.</p></reply>

Nonetheless there are substantial numbers in some coastal towns and cities, including north Dublin city and county.

Some additional appendices will be added to the operating rules prior to the launch of the programme in early July 2016.</p><p>The Service Level Agreement between each Local Community Development Committee, and its implementing and financial partners, is a matter for agreement at local level.  Having said that, my Department has contributed to the drafting of a template agreement and will continue to work with all entities to conclude a workable format.</p><p>A number of the local action groups have also been collaborating to develop harmonised procedures manuals and processes, and this work is progressing well.</p></reply>

Both hospitals are designated cancer centres and have an extensive range of multi-disciplinary services and expert clinical advice available to them.</p>  <p>  St Vincent's University Hospital has provided highly specialised and individualised treatment to sarcoma sufferers for a number of years.  St. Vincent's has access to all of the relevant specialties including surgery, medical oncology, radiation oncology, radiology and pathology and is the largest provider of surgical procedures for soft tissue sarcomas in the country.</p>  <p>  A National Clinical Lead in Soft Tissue Sarcomas is in place to oversee the services for patients with sarcomas.  Irish patients with sarcoma have their cases presented and discussed at one of the two sarcoma multi-disciplinary teams.  Members of these teams also have links with European specialists in sarcoma.</p>  <p>  A Consultant Medical Oncologist was employed by St Vincent&rsquo;s hospital on a locum contract to provide cover for another Consultant Medical Oncologists who had taken on the role as Chair of Irish Clinical Oncology Research Group.  This Consultant has now returned to his post at the hospital and the reason for employing the locum has ceased.</p>  <p>  I am assured by the HSE that care for patients requiring treatment for sarcoma cancer will continue to receive high quality care at St Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital and that their management will be provided by one of the hospital&rsquo;s full-time oncologists.</p>  <p>  Consideration is also being given to appointing a permanent Consultant Medical Oncologist with a special interest in the area of sarcoma to meet demand at St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital.

The Directive establishes a framework for cross border healthcare between EU/EEA states to facilitate patients to access care in another Member State in accordance with their entitlements in their own country.  Under the Directive, known as the Cross Border Healthcare Directive (CBD), insured patients are entitled to have the costs of cross-border healthcare services reimbursed if the healthcare service in question is among the benefits to which they are entitled in their Member State of affiliation.  As such, it allows Irish residents to avail of healthcare in other EU or EEA (excluding Switzerland) Member States that they would be entitled to within the public health system in Ireland, which is not contrary to Irish legislation.</p>  <p>  The result of the recent EU Referendum in the UK means that the UK electorate have declared their wish to leave the EU.  It is important to be clear that the UK has not yet left the EU.  Until it formally withdraws from the Union, it remains a full Member, with all of its existing rights and obligations.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that there will be no immediate changes in the area of health as a consequence of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU.  Cross-border services and health cooperation between the UK and Ireland will not be affected in the immediate term.  Arrangements are in place, building on an already completed initial risk assessment plan, to consider any longer-term implications of the referendum result.  Irish patients who had planned to travel to the UK under the CBD in the near future may continue to do as planned.</p>  <p>  The terms of a British exit from the EU are unknown at this stage.  It is expected to take a minimum of two years of negotiations between all EU member states, including Ireland, to agree a new arrangement between the UK and the EU, and the Department of Health will be fully involved in these negotiations.  Ensuring that there is minimum disruption in the area of health and that essential services are maintained will be our key priority.</p></reply>

I am very conscious of the fact that prices have come under pressure over the last year and the difficulties that this is causing for producers.</p>  <p>  Given the strategic importance which the sector plays in our agri economy, a Pig Industry Stakeholder Group, chaired by Dr Sean Brady was established in my Department and membership was drawn from across the sector, including farmers and processors.  This Group&rsquo;s remit was to address these challenges facing the sector under themes such as biosecurity, animal welfare, quality assurance, antibiotic usage, animal health, salmonella control programme, marketing, feed, non-intensive sector and other production models.  This was a very comprehensive exercise stretching over many months which also included a public consultation phase during which submissions were received and presented to the Committee by many different stakeholders.  The Group completed its report in February and presented it to the High Level Implementation Committee overseeing the implementation of the Food Wise 2025 strategy.  This reflected the fact that the preparation of this report is one of the key recommendations under the Food Wise Strategy.</p>  <p>  This timely report afforded all industry stakeholders including farmers, processors and Government Agencies a chance to take a collective view of how best to address the challenges facing the industry in order to support its development in accordance with the Food Wise 2025 vision.  The focus now must turn to its implementation and my Department is working on a plan for its implementation in the context of the Food Wise 2025 strategy.  Given the comprehensive nature of the report, its support from stakeholders and its wide-ranging conclusions I believe that a focus on its implementation represents best use of available resources for all parties and most importantly will deliver the most meaningful outcome for the sector going forward.</p></reply>

The UK is by far our largest trading partner.  Last year we exported almost &euro;5.1 billion worth of agricultural products.  This included more than &euro;1.1 billion in beef products and almost &euro;970 million in dairy products.  Ireland is also the UK&rsquo;s largest destination for its food exports - worth &euro;3.8 billion last year.</p>  <p>  This bilateral trade takes place on the basis of harmonised EU rules on animal and public health and labelling, without complex certification, quota limits or customs duties and tariffs.  And it is underpinned by the vital support of the CAP budget, to which the UK is a significant net contributor.</p>  <p>  Given these linkages, and as the UK is a net food importer, both countries have a strong interest in maintaining a close agri-food trading relationship.  In addition, the resilience of the Irish agri-food sector, and of the beef sector in particular, is well recognised, and this, together with the strong commercial relationships built up over years of trading, will help us to negotiate our way though the challenges ahead.</p>  <p>  It is important also to bear in mind that the precise implications of last week&rsquo;s decision depend on the trade and other arrangements ultimately negotiated between the EU and the UK.  These negotiations may take up to two years, and perhaps longer, and over that period existing arrangements will continue to apply.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department has engaged in detailed contingency planning for the possibility of this result, and has published a summary of the key actions we will now take to address the contingencies arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision.</p>  <p>  The most immediate concerns for beef exporters centre on Euro Sterling exchange rates.  It should be noted that the fall in the value of Sterling against the Euro since the UK referendum, while significant, is not unprecedented.  Nevertheless a sustained period of currency volatility could be of concern.  In that regard, the Central Bank of Ireland has pre-established contingency plans to deal with market volatility surrounding the referendum result.  The Bank will engage with the Department of Finance and individual financial institutions regarding potential risks.  Actions by ECB and other global actors will be monitored closely.  In addition, I have asked Bord Bia to provide practical guidance to SMEs to assist them in dealing with marketing challenges arising in the short term.</p>  <p>  The other areas in which potential impacts are foreseen are in relation to tariffs and trade, the EU budget, regulations and standards, and customs controls and certification, while complex issues also arise for the fisheries sector.</p>  <p>  However, we must remember that our trading relationship with the UK is not altered in any way until the negotiation process that will dictate the terms and conditions of the UK&rsquo;s departure is completed.

International research has shown that deer as a species are not particularly effective as maintenance hosts for TB except when numbers are high.  An exercise conducted in 2007-2008 in an area with known TB infection in deer, focussed on identifying the strains of TB in cattle, deer and badgers, found a significantly higher prevalence of the disease in badgers than in either cattle or deer.</p><p>I would note that responsibility for the management of wild deer in the State under the Wildlife Acts rests with the Minister for of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the control of deer on private property is the responsibility of individual landowners.  Landowners may apply to the Department of Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht for permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to cull deer where this is necessary outside the annual open seasons.</p><p>In an effort to address concerns around the linkage between TB and deer, my Department in consultation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service has conducted post-mortem sampling of deer carcasses for the presence of TB in the Calary area of Co. Wicklow where relatively high levels of TB in deer has been reported.  The project also involves identifying the strains of TB for comparison with that found in cattle and badgers in that specific area.  Mindful of the commitment in the Programme for Partnership Government to address individual TB blackspots, further consultations have recently taken place between officials of the two Departments to further this work and a range of options are currently being considered.</p><p><font color="#222222">  Additionally, it should be noted that hunters supplying wild game to Approved Game Handling Establishments (AGHEs) must be trained in animal health and hygiene relevant to wild game.  By law, hunters must report suspicion of contagious disease (e.g. TB in deer) to the relevant competent authority, either my Department or the Local Authority Veterinary Service (LAVS). </font>Based on existing evidence, from AGHEs and reports from trained hunters, TB levels in wild deer are, with the exception of Co. Wicklow very low nationally.</p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map 2020, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area, which is the subject of procurement.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The Department continues to monitor commercial operator deployment plans of high speed broadband in the BLUE area.  In March /April of this year the Department issued a detailed questionnaire to those operators whose coverage is included in the BLUE area on the High Speed Broadband Map.  Submissions received in response to the questionnaire are currently being analysed and I expect that a key component of this analysis will be concluded shortly.  In the event that commercial plans do not materialise as anticipated in the BLUE area or where no alternative operator is present, the Department has reserved the right to include these premises as part of the State Intervention.</p><p>The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention. </p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including County Westmeath.</p><p>The Map is a critical aspect of EU State Aid compliance and the mapping process remains open, in accordance with terms that have been published on the Department's website <i>(www.broadband.gov.ie)</i>so as to ensure that existing plans are realised and that any new developments can be managed.</p><p>The current county breakdown for the National Broadband Plan Intervention in Co Westmeath is set out in the table, with the percentage of premises to be covered by the Intervention and through commercial investment also listed. <table><tr><th>County Name </th><th>Total Number of County Townlands* </th><th>Number of Premises Covered by National Broadband Plan Intervention </th><th>% Premises within the NBP Intervention Area </th><th>% Premises within Commercial Operators' Area </th></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>1346</td><td>17,814</td><td>40% </td><td>60% </td></tr></table></p><p>Over 750,000 premises are the focus for the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire ( 'PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum.  Five responses were received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March 2016. </p><p>The second stage in the procurement process will be a formal invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to qualifying bidders.  I expect that my Department will move to this stage over the coming weeks.  The third stage of the procurement process involves the issue of final tender documentation which follows the dialogue process.  Following the submission of final tenders by bidders, a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy.  The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s). It is expected that contract(s) will be awarded by June 2017.</p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits also to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of county or regional broadband taskforces, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p></reply>

As set out in 'A Programme for a Partnership Government', our objective is to protect our national competitiveness from unsustainable cost growth and to deliver a job-fit business environment which ranks in the top tier globally.</p>  <p>  The Costs of Doing Business Report published by the National Competitiveness Council on April 21st provides an assessment of Ireland's cost competitiveness performance vis-a-vis a range of competitor countries.  The report, which has been noted by Government, concentrates on the costs that are largely domestically determined such as labour, property, transport, energy, water, waste, communications, credit /financial, and business service.  It finds that Ireland&rsquo;s cost base has improved across a range of metrics over the last five years. This has made Irish firms more competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations in.  However, despite these improvements, Ireland remains a relatively high cost location for a range of key business inputs and there is upward cost pressure evident in the market for commercial insurance.  The report is a timely reminder of the risks of complacency regarding our cost competitiveness.  To protect the gains achieved to date, to sustain the recovery, and to ultimately spread the benefits of economic growth to all, we must continue to enhance all aspects of our cost competitiveness.  The policy implications of the Costs of Doing Business report and the associated reforms required to address Ireland&rsquo;s cost base, will be included in the Council&rsquo;s annual Competitiveness Challenge report which will be brought to Government and published later this year.</p>  <p>  Insurance costs are relevant to businesses of all sizes and in all sectors of the economy.  In general insurance costs account for a relatively low proportion of the overall enterprise cost base.  While insurance costs represent a minor component of enterprise operating costs, premium increases can have an impact on costs, particularly for SMEs and micro enterprises.  Under EU law, the ability of the Government to influence insurance pricing is limited.  While the provision and the pricing of insurance policies is a commercial matter for insurance companies, competitive and transparent markets are vital. </p>  <p>  While my Department has no role in the supervision or regulation of insurance, which is a policy and supervisory matter for the Department of Finance and the Central Bank respectively, last year, the National Competitiveness Council (NCC) considered the commercial insurance market in Ireland as part of its 2015 Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2015 report.  It subsequently set out a range of potential actions which could help facilitate enhanced cost competitiveness in the non-life commercial insurance market.  These were set out in its Competitiveness Challenge 2015 report.  The Council concluded that the absence of price data makes it very difficult to assess market conditions and competitiveness in the non-life insurance market.  The Council subsequently recommended that responsibility for improving insurance cost competitiveness of commercial insurance must be clearly assigned and accorded sufficient priority by policymakers and there is a need to comprehensively benchmark insurance costs and the drivers of costs in Ireland with costs in our key competitors.</p>  <p>  The Department of Finance is currently examining the factors which contribute to increasing costs of insurance.  This work is part of an overall review of policy in the insurance sector which that Department is carrying out in consultation with the Central Bank and other Departments, Agencies and external stakeholders.  My Department will continue to engage with the Department of Finance in their ongoing work.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-30a.751.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1247" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016063000078#WRV01200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 to 270, inclusive, together.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the UK decision will not take effect for some time and that the precise implications of the referendum result will now depend on the period of negotiation ahead, involving the UK and our EU partners.</p><p>As indicated by the Taoiseach in his statement last Friday, the Government has adopted an initial Contingency Framework to map out the key issues that will be most important to Ireland in the coming weeks and months.  My own Department has been, and will continue to be, fully engaged in the risk analysis and contingency planning work that is being undertaken at cross-Government level, led by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p><p>Following the announcement of the referendum result on Friday June 24th, as part of my contingency plans, I instituted a Coordination Group consisting of the Chief Executive Officers of both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland and relevant enterprise, single market, and trade officials, to oversee the management of our immediate response and the messaging to businesses both overseas and domestically.  I will continue to chair this Group as part my Department&rsquo;s ongoing response as developments unfold.</p><p>I have asked the agencies to communicate directly with their clients, and, I am aware that in addition to writing to them, there have been multiple contacts since then, between IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland and their respective senior business clients.</p><p>I will continue to meet with the enterprise agencies to lead the co-ordination of our response to challenges as they emerge.</p><p>The UK remains a market opportunity for Irish business, and I am conscious that a decrease in the value and/or the volume of exports to the UK will affect industry, including SMEs and agrifood sector enterprises. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland has already set up a helpline and email address to provide assistance to its clients, and will implement a range of plans to assist Irish exporters. Key measures in this regard include:</p><p>- Provision of information and guidance on the practical implications of a UK exit;</p><p>- Market diversification support; expansion of EI &lsquo;International Sector Clustering Strategy&rsquo;;</p><p>- Intensification of UK market support to include advice on improving competitiveness, reducing supply chain costs, accessing funding, finance, foreign exchange as well as identification of key business opportunities;</p><p>- Management and financial supports including market access grants to client companies to evaluate new market opportunities.</p><p>In addition, Enterprise Ireland will fine-tune existing support tools (Lean Programmes, Market Diversification, Innovation and Management Development) to address new UK market conditions.</p><p>It is worth noting however, that as a result of determined efforts to assist companies to diversify into new markets, Enterprise Ireland clients have moved in recent years from some 45% of goods &amp;amp; services exports going to the UK, to some 37% in 2015.</p><p>The impact on enterprise and trade in Border counties will also be monitored closely.  In this context, the North East/North West Action Plan aims to deliver 28,000 extra jobs in the counties of Cavan, Monaghan, Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal and Louth by 2020. </p><p>The Regional Action Plans for Jobs initiative is a concrete example of the targeted approach we are undertaking to boost regional employment.  I intend to visit the regions and meet stakeholders to ensure that plans are being implemented in every region, including the Border region.</p><p>IDA Ireland will continue to market Ireland across the globe as the number one location for direct investment, confirming that we are open for business.</p><p>IDA Ireland has a strategic scenario planning team, which in the months leading up to the UK referendum on European membership, engaged with clients and prospective clients in relation to the potential impact of a decision by Britain to leave the European Union.  This team continues to work on ensuring that the Agency&rsquo;s strategy is fit for purpose in light of the recent referendum results in the UK. </p><p>Following the announcement of the results on 24<sup>th</sup>June, the Chief Executive of IDA Ireland, Martin Shanahan, wrote to the Agency&rsquo;s 1,200 clients and reassured them that <i>&ldquo;Ireland is and will remain a member of the European Union (and Eurozone), and retains full access to the European Union market&rdquo;.  </i>Mr. Shanahan re-affirmed IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to working with the existing client base to assist and support them in their growth and expansion in Ireland.  His letter also highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s continued strong offering in relation to talent, ease of doing business, a competitive and transparent taxation regime, English-speaking and, critically, Ireland&rsquo;s continued access to the EU market.</p><p>Mr. Shanahan has also engaged with international media to highlight that Ireland is very much open for business with full European Union market access.</p><p>Ireland will be working closely with the UK and other EU member States to ensure that any potential disruption to trade and investment is minimised. </p><p>We will continue to support the EU in creating open markets and will endeavour to ensure that our interests are to the fore in future negotiations with the UK.  Ireland will continue to make the most effective use of the framework of bilateral trade agreements and multi-sectoral trade agreements that the EU already has in place under the World Trade Organisation, and to support the opening of new markets through the EU.  Regarding the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership Agreement the EU Council of Trade Ministers at their meeting in May urged the Commission to advance the negotiations, whilst fully respecting its negotiating mandate and the EU interests.  While many complex and difficult issues remain to be resolved, both the EU and the US negotiators remain optimistic that a comprehensive and ambitious agreement can be concluded.  Ireland&rsquo;s enterprises are particularly well placed to take up opportunities to trade more easily with the US.  This will build on our already rewarding economic relationship.</p><p>I have asked Enterprise Ireland to accelerate the finalisation of their plans for increasing the number of trade missions both within the EU, to include France, Germany and Scandinavia, and to intensify our programme of missions in non-EU markets.</p><p>I am also initiating a review of the overseas footprint of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, to ensure we are fully prepared to support business in finding new markets and investment.</p><p>In tandem, I will be leading a trade mission to the UK in early July, as the UK will remain a key market for Ireland and we need to retain our focus on its potential, even as we seek to diversify to other markets.</p><p>Since taking up my appointment as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I have already met with my UK ministerial counterparts on trade and on the Single Market (Competitiveness) &ndash; Lord Price and Baroness Neville-Rolfe, respectively; and a senior delegation of Trade and Single Market officials from my Department will meet on Friday 1<sup>st</sup>July, in London with their UK counterparts to review developments.</p><p>I would assure the Deputy that the Government, my Department and the enterprise agencies are fully committed to supporting business in this period of heightened uncertainty; however, we do so against the background of a strong economy and a highly competitive enterprise sector.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-30a.754.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1247" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016063000078#WRV01400"><p>The EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) is a new generation agreement that will remove over 99% of tariffs between the EU and Canada and will create sizeable new market access opportunities in services and investment.  It will end limitations in access to public contracts, open-up services market, and offer predictable conditions for investors.</p>  <p>  The main benefits for Ireland in this Agreement include the opening up of public procurement markets in the Canadian provinces giving Irish firms increased access to Canadian public sector purchasing.  Ireland also gains unlimited tariff free access for most of our important food exports.  In addition, Ireland successfully campaigned for a low beef import quota from Canada to the EU thereby safeguarding our important EU market in this area.  Irish firms will also benefit from the recognition of product standards and certification, thus saving on &lsquo;double testing&rsquo; on both sides of the Atlantic.  This is of particular benefit to smaller companies for whom paying twice for the same test can be prohibitive.  These are some of the benefits of the trade deal with Canada as well as providing new market opportunities in many sectors for Irish firms.</p>  <p>  The proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) EU-US agreement is still being negotiated.  Like the CETA, it is intended that the EU-US Agreement will cover not only tariffs, services and investment but also include regulatory coherence and cooperation.  An EU-US agreement would be the world&rsquo;s largest bilateral trade and investment deal, and a successful conclusion is expected to benefit Ireland more than any other EU Member State.  An independent study commissioned by my Department, carried out by Copenhagen Economics, suggests a boost to GDP of 1.1%, growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1.5%, and an increase in real wages of 1.5%.  It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs could be created.  The findings are backed up in an interim independent report contracted by the EU Commission, carried out by Ecorys Consultancy and published on 13th May 2016.  The report estimates that an EU-US free trade agreement would boost Irish GDP by 1.4 per cent.  </p>  <p>  CETA was discussed at the last EU Council of Trade Ministers on 13th May 2016, which I attended.  The Council had an exchange of views on the Agreement and the process towards signature and provisional application.  I made Ireland&rsquo;s approach clear, that based on our current assessment of its provisions, that we viewed CETA as a mixed Agreement, in terms of EU and Member State competency.  This position was also expressed by other Member States.  There are differing views on the legal position on this and the European Commission may be of the view that CETA falls within the competence of the EU only.  We will need to wait and see the formal proposal from the Commission and, importantly, the legal basis for this.  It will be a matter for the European Council and the European Parliament to decide on the signature and provisional application of CETA.  It is expected that the decision making process and ratification process of the EU-US FTA will be similar to the EU-Canada Agreement. </p>  <p>  It is in Ireland&rsquo;s interest to see strong progress towards the implementation of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement and conclusion of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership as they will provide opportunities for Irish based firms to further diversify their export markets.  The issue of growing market share in other markets is made even more important by the result of the recent UK referendum on its membership of the EU.  </p></reply>

This decision has significant short-term and long term implications for Ireland.  Economically, the uncertainty arising from the outcome of this decision in the short term, has resulted in a weakened exchange rate, stock market volatility and lower growth prospects for the UK economy.  Due to our close and well established ties with the United Kingdom, the outcome of the referendum has particularly direct consequences for Irish growth and trade prospects.</p>  <p>  The economic and political implications and timing of Brexit &ndash; and indeed the institutional arrangements between the UK and EU, and between Ireland and the UK are unclear at this juncture. Notwithstanding this considerable uncertainty, the immediate implications for Ireland of the UK leaving the EU are being addressed by Government.  The Government has undertaken careful planning in recent months for the contingency of this result, and we will now take this work forward to ensure that we respond appropriately, and that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are represented fully in the negotiating process.  On June 24th we published a contingency plan outlining our whole of Government response.</p>  <p>  While there is a lack of clarity as to how the negotiation process will proceed, I will be working to ensure that there is certainty as early as possible on the terms of future trading relationships. The UK will remain an attractive market for many Irish companies, with a population of over 65 million people. I have met with and will continue to engage intensively with our enterprise development and promotional agencies and other stakeholders and representative bodies.  They will be working with enterprises to support their adjustment to the new arrangements in due course.  Similarly, the UK is the third largest investor in Ireland and I will endeavour to ensure the impact on those relationships is minimised.  I, together with the enterprise agencies under my remit, will also ensure that businesses, investors and potential investors in Ireland are fully informed of Ireland&rsquo;s continued commitment to the EU and of developments as they unfold. </p>  <p>  Ireland is ranked first in the eurozone in the 2016 IMD Global Competitiveness Index and it is important that we continue to sustain that position.  As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I consider it vital to retain a sharp focus on maintaining our own competitiveness for trade and investment.  In particular in relation to areas such as costs, it is important that we continue to provide a stable macroeconomic environment and public finances during the adjustment period.  We need to continue to invest in the areas that will underpin future enterprise growth including in innovation and research, skills and address infrastructure bottlenecks.  We need to sustain our core strengths for inward investment namely a strong pool of highly skilled, multilingual workers in the only English-speaking country within the Eurozone.  We will continue to provide barrier-free access to an EU market of over 450 million consumers. </p>  <p>Enterprise 2025, Ireland&rsquo;s National Enterprise Policy, sets out our vision for Ireland to be the best place to succeed in business, delivering sustainable employment and higher standards of living for all.  Enterprise 2025 highlighted the importance of sustaining the progress made on diversifying to non-UK markets and we will continue to support enterprises in that regard.  We will continue to implement Enterprise 2025 through the Annual Action Plan for Jobs.  We will work across government to progress any additional specific measures necessary to sustaining and growing jobs in the 2017 Action Plan for Jobs.   </p></reply>

I understand that the Board of Management conducted a strategic review recently and following this a decision was made that this service would not be in a position to provide services for the under twos.  I understand this was a business decision, and as such is a matter for the Board, which is independent of my Department.</p><p>There are a number of changes to Programmes being implemented for the 2016/17 programme year, including the expansion of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme and changes to the Childcare Regulations concerning qualification requirements for those working in the sector.</p><p>The new Childcare Regulations require that all staff working with children in early years services should hold a qualification in early childhood care and education at a minimum of Level 5 on the National Qualifications Framework (NQF) or equivalent.  This is in accordance with international best practice.</p><p>In the past, Community Employment participants with no qualifications were used as part of core staff / child ratios.  From 31 December, unless these CE participants are in year 3 of their programme and have received their level 5 qualification they cannot be considered as part of core staff ratios but can of course remain as an additional resource to the service.  The level 5 requirement will come into effect on 30 June 2016 for newly-registering services and for existing services on 31 December 2016. </p><p>The contract for ECCE<font color="#FF0000"> </font>has always required that pre-school leaders in ECCE services hold a minimum Level 5 qualification, or equivalent.  From 31 December 2016, all pre-school leaders delivering the ECCE programme must hold a minimum Level 6 qualification, or equivalent.</p><p>My Department has long-standing relationships with community/not-for-profit childcare providers, and recognises the important role that this sector has to play in childcare provision.  As demand for childcare continues to grow with, for example, the ECCE scheme being set to increase from 67,000 children last year to approximately 127,000 in 2017, it is essential to support both community and private childcare provision to meet the higher standards. </p><p>In relation to the availability of childcare for children under two, my officials have been in contact with Dublin City Childcare Committee and they are available to assist parents to source alternative childcare provision within the area.  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) Programme provides funding to childcare services to enable them to provide quality childcare, including to children under two, at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.  Parents qualify as disadvantaged or low income on the basis of means-tested entitlements. In the case of full day care, parents qualifying for the higher rate of subvention under the CCS Programme can have up to &euro;95 per week deducted from the overall charge for childcare in the participating childcare facility. <font color="#FF0000"> </font>Traditionally, CCS was only available through community services, but to ensure wider access for families,<font color="#FF0000"> </font>in 2016 this Programme has been extended to include private providers for the first time, and my Department is working to ensure the availability of places under this Programme.</p></reply>
