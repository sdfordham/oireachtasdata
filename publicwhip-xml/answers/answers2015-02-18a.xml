Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice, means to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.<br/><br/>The Garda&iacute; have requested ATCP support from the Defence Forces at Shannon since 2003.  Up to 12th February 2015 there has been 47 deployments at a cost of &euro;24,116, which includes Security Duty Allowance, rations and fuel.<br/><br/>The basis for such requests are an operational matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Accordingly, decisions to seek support from the Defence Forces are a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

The ceremony took place in Waterford as the ship had a long association with the city.</p>  <p>  The proud record of the ship in operational service with the Naval Service was duly recognised and the range of activities which the ship was involved in was recalled and commended.   </p>  <p>  With regard to the future of L&Eacute; Aoife, the intention was, as with L&Eacute; Emer, to sell the decommissioned ship at a public auction.  However, I am considering a formal approach from the Maltese Minister for Home Affairs and National Security in which they have outlined interest in acquiring L&Eacute; Aoife. </p>  <p>  Following discussions with my Maltese counterpart, I understand that the Maltese authorities require this ship for their armed forces to patrol the Mediterranean Sea to endeavour to deal with the ongoing difficult refugee crisis in the region. </p>  <p>  Recent tragic events in that part of the Mediterranean have underlined the significant challenges which need to be addressed by the international community.  In the circumstances, I wish to advise the Deputy that I am favourably disposed to acceding to the request from the Maltese authorities on humanitarian grounds.  I will discuss the matter further with my colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs and National Security, when I meet him later today at an EU Defence Ministers Informal Council in Riga.   </p>  <p>  The Naval Service Ships Replacement Programme continues to move ahead with the sea acceptance trials for L&Eacute; James Joyce scheduled to take place in the middle of March 2015 in the United Kingdom.  Subject to the successful outcome of these trials, the ship will be handed over to the Department of Defence. </p>  <p>  Details of the formal naming and commissioning of L&Eacute; James Joyce into operational service will be finalised when the ship arrives into Ireland.</p></reply>

These latter responsibilities for airspace over the high seas are exercised under assignment from the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).  All air traffic, both civil and military, is monitored and controlled by the IAA in respect of this airspace in accordance with the ICAO&rsquo;s safety objectives for civil aviation.</p>  <p>  In line with ICAO rules it is normal practice for the IAA to be informed by the relevant State of any military flights operating in Irish controlled airspace. </p>  <p>  On a routine basis, the Air Corps monitors and communicates with foreign military aircraft where such aircraft are flying in the airspace in the vicinity of Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, where air traffic control is provided by the Defence Forces.  However, the Air Corps is not tasked or equipped to monitor and communicate with military aircraft overflying Irish airspace irrespective of whether the transponder is switched on or not.  This position is in accordance with the Air Corps&rsquo; roles as set out in the White Paper for Defence (2000).   </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that, under the legislative requirements of the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952, all military aircraft require the permission of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade to overfly or land in the State.</p></reply>

It is designed to support and develop the capacity of the Afghan National Defence Forces to ensure the security of the Afghan population and its national governmental institutions following the withdrawal of the ISAF mission.Â  The United Nations Security Council welcomed the Resolute Support mission with the unanimous adoption on 12 December 2014 of Resolution 2189.  This Resolution underscores the importance of continued international support for the stability of Afghanistan.   </p>  <p>  The seven (7) Defence Forces personnel who were deployed to the ISAF mission were reassigned to the new Resolute Support Mission on the 1st of January 2015. They are based in the mission headquarters in Kabul. These personnel are employed in training and advisory roles in Operations, Training and Support appointments.

This is based on the requirement to allow fair competition between suppliers through the submission of tenders following advertising of the tender competition usually on the e-tenders site and as required in line with the EU Directive on the procurement of Defence and Security equipment. </p>  <p>  In following the required procurement guidelines and codes, the Department of Defence must deal impartially with all companies that are entitled to enter its procurement competitions and must evaluate tenders on the basis of objective criteria.</p></reply>

This work will inform recommendations regarding defence provision.</p>  <p>  A key part of the development of the White Paper is the consideration of the security environment and challenges that may emerge into the future.  As recent events have highlighted, the security environment can be volatile and unpredictable.   </p>  <p>  In the course of their deliberations, the Working Groups are taking into consideration the inputs received from a wide variety of stakeholders.  Discussions have also been held with a range of other Government Departments on cross-cutting policy issues and likely future demands from Government bodies and State agencies.  This includes the views of international organisations which have been sought, with a particular focus on likely future trends in international peace support operations.   </p>  <p>  Defence policy is a critical aspect of Government policy and I am determined to ensure that the new White Paper fully addresses the Defence response to future security challenges and associated resource requirements in a comprehensive way.   </p>  <p>  I have decided to establish an external Advisory Group to further support me in the production of the White Paper.  I have appointed Mr. John Minihan to act as chairman to the Group.

As recent events have highlighted, the security environment can be volatile and unpredictable.<br/><br/>In the course of their deliberations, the Working Groups are taking into consideration the inputs received from a wide variety of stakeholders.  Discussions have also been held with a range of other Government Departments on cross-cutting policy issues and likely future demands from Government bodies and State agencies.  This includes the views of international organisations which have been sought, with a particular focus on likely future trends in international peace support operations.<br/><br/>Defence policy is a critical aspect of Government policy and I am determined to ensure that the new White Paper fully addresses the Defence response to future security challenges and associated resource requirements in a comprehensive way.<br/><br/>I have decided to establish an external Advisory Group to further support me in the production of the White Paper.  I have appointed Mr. John Minihan to act as chairman to the Group. Ms. Marie Cross, Mr. Frank Lynch and Mr. Karl Croke have also agreed to join the Group.<br/><br/>I anticipate that the final draft of the White Paper will be submitted to Government for approval by the end of July.  Subject to Government approval, the White Paper on Defence will then be published.</p></reply>

The role of the Air Corps as set out in the White Paper is to provide a range of military and non-military services in support of the State.  These supports include maintenance of a general helicopter capability for a variety of tasks, including support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as provision of a maritime patrol service, a ministerial air transport service, an air ambulance service on the basis of agreed arrangements with the Department of Health, and the provision of assistance to the principal response agencies, including the Irish Coast Guard, in relation to civil emergencies.</p>  <p>  The preparation of a new White Paper on Defence is one of my key priorities.  The White Paper process, which is ongoing, is intended to provide an opportunity to examine critically future demands and consider how to best meet associated operational requirements across the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  Working groups comprising civil and military representatives from the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are considering likely future operational demands.  The question of the future operational roles of the Air Corps is being considered in this context.  You will appreciate that I do not wish to second guess any recommendations that may arise from the White Paper process by commenting on specific issues at this point.  The final draft of the White Paper will be fully considered by Government in due course.</p></reply>

It operates in the role of a Quick Reaction Force, which is on standby to assist with on-going operations within the UNDOF Area of Responsibility.  Eight (8) other Defence Forces personnel are also deployed in UNDOF Headquarters, including the Deputy Force Commander, Brigadier General Anthony Hanlon. </p>  <p>  Following the significant events in August 2014 in the area of separation, there was a fundamental realignment of the UNDOF mission with a view to minimizing unacceptable risks to peacekeepers, while continuing to implement the mission&rsquo;s mandate.  Most UNDOF personnel are now deployed on the Israeli side of the area of separation.  The UN provides regular updates on the mission to the Security Council in this regard.  The presence of the UNDOF mission remains an important element in ensuring stability on the Golan Heights and in the Middle East region. </p>  <p>  Participation in overseas missions is reviewed by the Government on an annual basis.  On the 17th June 2014, the Government approved continued participation in the UNDOF mission for a period of twelve months up to June 2015.  I intend to bring proposals to Government in due course for the continued participation by the Defence Forces in the mission beyond June 2015, subject to the renewal of the UN authority for the mission.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the prevention of crime rests primarily with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, the White Paper on Defence (2000) provides for a security role for the Naval Service and the Air Corps to assist and support the civil authorities in this important work.</p>  <p>  The Joint Task Force on Drug Interdiction was established in 1993 as a Government measure to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs and consists of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Customs Service and the Naval Service. </p>  <p>  While there is no direct financial contribution to the Task Force, the Defence Forces make a significant contribution to its work.  Drug interdiction is carried out by Naval ships on receipt of intelligence from the Joint Task Force.  The Air Corps provides air support and on occasion carries the Customs National Drugs Team in an observational capacity for the purposes of monitoring vessels suspected of drug trafficking.   </p>  <p>  Internationally, the establishment in 2007 of the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre &ndash; Narcotics (MAOC-N) has led to a greater focus on intelligence exchange amongst countries to tackle large drug shipments by sea.  MAOC-N was set up by seven European countries and is designed as an international co-ordination force with access to national tasking agencies and requires participation and resources from all active members.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service have full-time officers based at the Centre in Lisbon.  Irish Naval Service personnel travel to the Centre when requested by the Joint Task Force. </p>  <p>  The value of this cooperation both nationally and internationally in tackling large drug shipments at sea was highlighted in September last when an operation by members of the Task Force, supported by the EU Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre for Narcotics and other agencies, resulted in a highly successful drug interdiction operation off the south west coast.</p></reply>

A cross-Departmental working group of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning has met on a regular basis during 2014 to oversee the development of the 2014/15 &lsquo;Be Winter Ready&rsquo; campaign by the Office of Emergency Planning (OEP).  The role of the OEP is to ensure that there is a &ldquo;whole of Government&rdquo; approach to emergency planning while each lead Department/Agency retains responsibility for their specific winter preparedness.<br/><br/>The meetings reviewed aspects of the previous &lsquo;Be Winter Ready&rsquo; campaign in 2013/2014 and agreed new initiatives to be included in this year&rsquo;s campaign.  This includes building on the national and local radio advertisement and social media campaigns initiated in 2013 as well as continuing the display of public information notices at peak traffic times across all the National Roads Authority motorway signs.<br/><br/>A redesign of the &lsquo;Be Winter Ready&rsquo; booklet was undertaken by OEP staff making it more &lsquo;user friendly&rsquo;.  The office distributed over 9,000 copies of the booklet to libraries, community groups, individuals etc. throughout the country.  It is also available for download at <font color="#0000CC"> </font>.  Posters were designed and produced in different sizes for distribution to post offices, transport groups, libraries, community groups, etc.  All Departments/Agencies put links to <font color="#0000CC"> </font>on their website and informed all bodies under their aegis of the campaign. <br/><br/>OEP staff attended the National Ploughing Championship in September 2014 and designed, produced and distributed a leaflet for farm families, which was launched at this event. <br/><br/>While these innovative steps helped to further expand the public awareness of this annual information campaign, the OEP would welcome any innovative suggestions for further promoting this annual campaign for the next winter season in 2015/2016.</p></reply>

Personnel who leave the Defence Forces or who vacate a married quarter property that had been assigned to them are required under regulations to return vacant possession of that property.  Where the property is not vacated those remaining in the property are overholding and the Department seeks to recover possession from them.<br/><br/>Overholders are those who have no right under military regulations to hold or reside in military accommodation.  The personal circumstances regarding the people overholding would not generally be known to the Department consequently I am unable to provide the numbers overholding due to circumstances such as relationship breakdown.<br/><br/>The Department assists in whatever way it can in order to resolve the cases of overholding without recourse to legal action.  It is preferable not to have to use legal means to obtain vacant possession of the properties concerned.  However, any initiative to resolve overholding must support and complement the current policy, which dates back to 1997, of withdrawing from the provision of married quarters.<br/><br/>While each case of overholding is dealt with on an individual basis, it is important to remember that my Department does not have a role in the provision of housing accommodation for the general public. <br/><br/>The securing of alternative housing is a matter for the individuals concerned in the first instance.  If individuals are not in a position to secure housing in their own right it may be the case that they qualify for social housing or that they qualify for some level of housing assistance.  In such cases my Department provides whatever assistance it can in support of any such application.  In addition, officials from my Department have met with officials from relevant local authorities regarding the overholding issue in order to make them aware of the situation and so as to be in a position to advise overholders of procedures and requirements when making applications for social housing, if requested to do so.<br/><br/>There are also a number of advice and support services available to Defence Forces personnel and their families.  The Defence Forces Personnel Support Service (DFPSS) provides a confidential information, training and education, support and referral service for Defence Forces personnel with one or more qualified Barrack Personnel Support Service Officer(s) (BPSSO) in every Barracks. <br/><br/>The role of the BPSSO includes providing information, assistance and counselling on a range of matters including:<br/><br/>- Interpersonal problems<br/><br/>- Stress in many forms (personal, due to family and/or financial problems etc.)<br/><br/>- Bereavement (in its many forms, including family breakup)<br/><br/>- Housing (including stress from mortgages, inability to sell property to relocate family nearer the military workplace etc.)<br/><br/>Each Brigade/Formation also has a civilian Defence Forces Social Worker whose tasks are to provide assistance and support to service military personnel and their families, where required.<br/><br/>In addition, there is an Independent Confidential Helpline and Counselling Service for Permanent Defence Force personnel.  Since 2013 this independent and confidential service was extended and a broader range of services was introduced, including family and couple counselling.</p></reply>

Removal proceedings were undertaken by Immigration and Customs Enforcement of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  He remains in custody in Lebanon.   </p>  <p>  This is a significant step in the pursuit of justice for Privates Thomas Barrett and Derek Smallhorne who lost their lives while on United Nations peacekeeping duty in Lebanon almost 35 years ago.Â  The arrest of the alleged perpetrator was an important day for the families and I wish to commend them for their continued commitment to securing justice for their loved ones.Â  </p>  <p>  The Irish Government are aware that the Lebanese authorities have primary jurisdiction in terms of pursuing a prosecution against the alleged perpetrator.  We stand ready to provide whatever assistance possible to the Lebanese authorities in progressing this issue.  However, it is a matter for the Lebanese authorities to investigate the case and to determine any future action and it would be inappropriate for me to comment any further in the matter.</p></reply>

Eight (8) other Defence Forces personnel are also deployed in UNDOF Headquarters, including the Deputy Force Commander, Brigadier General Anthony Hanlon. </p>  <p>  Following the significant events in August 2014 in the area of separation, there was a fundamental realignment of the UNDOF mission with a view to minimizing unacceptable risks to peacekeepers, while continuing to implement the mission&rsquo;s mandate.  Most UNDOF personnel are now deployed on the Israeli side of the area of separation.  The UN provides regular updates on the mission to the Security Council in this regard.  The presence of the UNDOF mission remains an important element in ensuring stability on the Golan Heights and in the Middle East region. </p>  <p>  Participation in overseas missions is reviewed by the Government on an annual basis.  On the 17th June 2014, the Government approved continued participation in the UNDOF mission for a period of twelve months up to June 2015.

Its principal role is to support the Primary Response Agencies, such as the Garda&iacute; and the HSE, in dealing with emergencies. It is also involved in a wide range of community support activities.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with local authorities. The Deputy will be aware that on the 9th of December last the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Alan Kelly T.D., announced a 20 point Action Plan to tackle emergency and short term homelessness. The initiative in Dublin, supported by Civil Defence, was just one of a series of measures aimed at rapidly increasing the number of beds available for homeless people in the capital.</p>  <p>  Since the 12th December last, Dublin Civil Defence with the assistance of Civil Defence Volunteers from other counties, have been operating a temporary hostel at their premises at Wolfe Tone Quay. This provides overnight accommodation for up to 20 people. This facility also operated from January to March of last year, in support of the City Council&rsquo;s initiative to alleviate homelessness in the capital. Professional carers on contract to the City Council assist with the management of the homeless persons at the facility. On Wednesday of last week Minister of State at my Department, Mr. Paul Kehoe, T.D., had the pleasure of visiting the temporary hostel to thank the Civil Defence Volunteers for their efforts on behalf of the Government and to meet with some of the homeless persons using the facilities there.</p>  <p>  We must also be mindful of the other demands on Civil Defence. For example, in recent weeks Civil Defence Volunteers have assisted the Garda&iacute; in ten different searches for missing people including in your own county of Tipperary. Civil Defence volunteers also make themselves available, if required, to assist in dealing with flooding and the effects of severe weather. Thankfully this has been much less of an issue this year compared to the early part of 2014 when Civil Defence Volunteers were called out repeatedly to assist local authorities in dealing with the effects of severe weather.</p>  <p>  While Civil Defence is always willing to assist the community, homelessness by its nature is a complex issue and there are other agencies and groups, both statutory and voluntary, who specialise in dealing with the homeless.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that, under the Action Plan announced by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government Mr. Alan Kelly, T.D., which involves all of the relevant agencies, the issue of homelessness in other areas of the country outside of Dublin will be comprehensively addressed.</p></reply>

Â A minimum of &euro;4,405 (before VAT) must be spent on the property in order to qualify for the HRI tax credit and the maximum expenditure on which the tax credit can be claimed is &euro;30,000 (before VAT). In addition, all Local Property Tax and Household Charges must be up to date at the time of making a claim.<br/><br/>The HRI tax credit is included in a person's tax credits over two years, starting the year after the work is carried out and paid for. Â An applicant would need to have a sufficient level of taxable income to benefit from the tax credit. Â I am advised by the revenue Commissioners that based on the stated current income of the person concerned, the person might not be in a positionÂ to benefit from the tax credit immediately but the credits could be carried forward. The person concerned can obtain further information on the Revenue website at or by contacting Revenue's LoCall service at 1890 777 425.<br/><br/>I would draw the Deputy's attention to a separate measure, whichÂ provides for a VAT refund in relation to certain works carried out to homes to adapt them to make them more accessible for persons with disabilities.Â  The Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax)(No 15) Order 1981 provides for the refund of VAT on qualifying goods, covering, inter alia, aids or appliances including parts or accessories, specially constructed or adapted for use by persons with disabilities,Â  purchased for the exclusive use of persons suffering a specified degree of disablement. The measure includes adaptations carried out to homes to make them more accessible for persons with disabilities. While the measure does not apply to the actual construction of a home it would apply, for example, to certain alterations or adaptations which would be necessary to meet the particular needs of the person. Further information is available from Revenue's Central Payments Office, telephone 1890 60 60 61.</p></reply>

A claim for relief may be made in respect of a number of students.Â  <br/><br/>In making a claim for relief for the tax year 2014, the maximum amount of fees that can qualify for the relief is &euro;7,000 per student, but an amount set out in the legislation must be disregarded from each claim (whether in respect of one or more students).Â  Where a claim for relief includes fees paid on behalf of at least one full-time student, the disregard for 2014 is &euro;2,750.Â  Where a claim for relief includes fees solely paid on behalf of a part-time student or part-time students, the amount disregarded for 2014 is &euro;1,375.Â  <br/><br/>AÂ family with three siblings attending college on a full-time undergraduate basis,Â might beÂ liable to &euro;8,250 in student contribution charges. In claiming tax relief on such fees,Â the first &euro;2,750 of any claim is disregarded and the remaining &euro;5,500 would qualify for tax relief at 20%, giving a potential tax refund of &euro;1,100.<br/><br/>Further information is available on the Revenue website at:Â <br/><br/></p></reply>

It is a progressively structured imposition, and as such takes account of theÂ position of persons in receipt of modest-sized pensions.Â Specifically, the progressive structure of PSPR is evident in the fact thatÂ all pensions below &euro;12,000 are exempt from PSPR, while pensions below &euro;32,500 are exempt from a PSPR increase/extension legislated for inÂ 2013 via the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public InterestÂ Act 2013.Â In addition, for those pensions which are affectedÂ by PSPR, the reduction is proportionately greater for higher-value pensions than for lower-value pensions.Â  The following table illustrates the impact of PSPR on a sample of public service pensions awarded on orÂ before 29 February 2012.<table><tr><th>Pension before PSPR (&euro;)</th><th>Annual Reduction (&euro;)</th><th>Annual Reduction (%)</th></tr><tr><td>12,000</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>20,000</td><td>480</td><td>2.4</td></tr><tr><td>30,000</td><td>1,260</td><td>4.2</td></tr><tr><td>40,000</td><td>2,880</td><td>7.2</td></tr><tr><td>60,000</td><td>5,280</td><td>8.8</td></tr></table><br/><br/>As the Deputy will be aware, I am required to review the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009-2013 annually and cause a written report of my findings to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.Â As part of that review I consider whether the various measures, including the PSPR, continue to be necessary, having regard to the purposes of the legislation. In my most recent report laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in June 2014 I concluded that the continuation of the PSPR remained necessary. <br/><br/>However, as the economic and fiscal conditions move towards a more sustainable position, I believe it will be necessaryÂ to prepare for an orderly wind-down of the financial emergency legislation. In this context, and asÂ I have previously indicated, it would beÂ my intention, as a matter of priority and at the earliest date economic progress permits, to move towards reducing the burden of public service pension reductions, with the initial focus on the people in receipt of low pensions.</p></reply>

While employment has increased nationally by approximately 80,000 since the start of the Action Plan process in 2012, not all regions are yet fully experiencing the benefits of economic recovery. That is why the Government is placing an increased emphasis on supporting jobs growth in the regions. </p>  <p>  The 2015 Action Plan for Jobs includes a commitment develop and publish a suite of Regional Enterprise Strategies based on the strengths of each region, in consultation with key stakeholders.  Last week, the Government announced details of the Action Plan for Jobs-Regional initiative which will seek to maximise the strengths and assets of each region to support enterprise growth and job creation.   </p>  <p>  My objective is that six Regional Action Plans, including one for the Border region, will be launched by July, with two remaining Strategies in development at that stage. The Regional Action Plans will identify measures that can be taken to help each region to realise its economic potential, with a view to increasing the number of people at work in the region.  Consultation with local stakeholders will be an essential part of the process of developing the Regional Action Plans.  In that context, local entrepreneurs and business people will have an opportunity to provide inputs to the Action Plan for Jobs for the Border region.  </p>  <p>  In launching the Action Plan for Jobs-Regional initiative last week, I announced that new funding of up to &euro;250 million will be made available over the next five years to support job creation through enterprise growth in the regions.  This includes &euro;150 million for an IDA property investment programme to attract foreign direct investment into the regions, and &euro;100 million to Enterprise Ireland to support indigenous enterprises to start up, grow and export. </p>  <p>  These funds will be distributed through three new competitive calls which will be announced by Enterprise Ireland over the coming months.  The first of these calls will focus on community-driven enterprise initiatives, the second will focus on new ideas emerging from the Local Enterprise Offices and a third, broader, competitive regional call will support significant projects or initiatives to improve enterprise capability in the region.  Funding will be allocated to the best ideas across the regions.  Tangible jobs impact, enterprise start-up and scaling are amongst the criteria against which applications will be measured.  Innovative collaborations among different regional agencies or stakeholders will also be favourably weighted.</p></reply>

As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I will lead the initiative.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">Each of the 8 regions will develop its own Action Plan. It is my intention that all regional plans will be published or in development by July 2015. </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">Under the strategy, Enterprise Ireland will launch a series of new competitive funding initiatives in the areas of entrepreneurship, innovation, enterprise infrastructure and job creation. The objective is to bring forward fresh collaborative initiatives to boost enterprise and job creation in the region. An initial fund of &euro;50 million is to be made available for three competitive calls. </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">The first of these competitive calls, with a budget of &euro;5 million, will focus on community-driven enterprise initiatives and how all the local players, public and private, can work together to maximise job creation.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">The Community Enterprise Initiatives Fund call will be open to existing Community Enterprise Centres (CECs) and also to any other organisation or groups of organisations with innovative ideas to create jobs, promote entrepreneurship, boost innovation or enhance exports. It should be open to any credible and novel approach rather than simply replicating what has been done before.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">Criteria in any such competition will be announced by Enterprise Ireland, but the typical criteria will include:</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">- Promoting a culture of entrepreneurship locally and regionally;</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">- Developing capacity to start up and scale companies; filling gaps in enterprise facilities; </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">- Building on existing strengths or opportunities, e.g. developing a sectoral opportunity where there is a competitive advantage </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">- Devising a credible plan to deliver added value in jobs and start-ups and increased level of exporting/potential exporters</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">- Commitment of matching finance </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">- Bringing originality in approach, objectives, leverage of other stakeholders </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">- Leveraging off other enterprise support (Mentoring, funding, networks)</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">- Promoting public and private partnership, e.g. alignment/collaboration with others players (e.g. LEO, ETB, HEIs, Chambers etc.) </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">A second call, also with a budget of &euro;5 million will focus on Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) and how innovative new ideas or plans to support job creation in the region can receive additional funding.  A third, broader, competitive regional call of up to &euro;40 million will support significant projects or initiatives to improve or leverage identified enterprise capability in the region.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">The first two calls will be made at the end of March 2015.</font></p></reply>

The ratio of funding from non-Irish Exchequer to Irish-Exchequer is almost 2:1.<br/><br/>SFI plays a leading role in the implementation of national policy through the funding of research in key sectors identified in the National Research Prioritisation Exercise (NRPE) and the creation of employment through the Action Plan for Jobs.<br/><br/>The remit of SFI was amended in 2013 with the enactment of the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Act 2013 (No. 36 of 2013) to enable SFI to fund applied as well as oriented basic research in strategic areas of opportunity for the State. The Act as amended also enables SFI to:<br/><br/>-develop and extend the capability for the carrying out of oriented basic and applied research in institutions<br/><br/>-promote attraction to the State world class researchers and research teams in strategic areas of opportunity for the State<br/><br/>-provide funding on an all-Island basis, subject to excellence and strategic criteria being met;<br/><br/>-enter collaborative arrangements with international partners; and<br/><br/>-provide funding to promote the study of, education in and awareness of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).<br/><br/>SFI has a suite of award programmes and developments/investments in line with its remit that support competitive advantage in Ireland. <br/><br/>The material requested by the deputy relating to funding provided to SFI since its inception can be found in the table. <br/><br/>Background Points:<br/><br/>Through investment in SFI, Ireland is building a significant international reputation for research excellence. Since 2009, Ireland has been listed among the top 20 countries in global rankings for the quality of our scientific research.  We have excelled in certain fields: Ireland is now ranked 1st in the world for Immunology and Animal and Dairy, 3rd for Nanoscience, 4th in Computer Science and 6th for Materials Science.  <br/><br/>In 2013 SFI announced an investment of &euro;300 million over five years in seven world class SFI Research Centres in key strategic areas of importance to the economy. The &euro;200 million funding delivered through the SFI Research Centres Programme was complemented by over &euro;100 million in cash and in-kind contributions from over 150 industry partners, making it the largest ever combined state/industry co-funding announcement of its kind in the research field in Ireland directly supporting over 800 jobs.  More recently on the 20th October 2014 a further five SFI Research Centres were announced, through a Government investment of &euro;155 million together with industry funding of &euro;90million. <br/><br/>The 12 SFI Research Centres have an investment of &euro;355million from Government through SFI and a further &euro;190 million from industry collaborators.  Over 200 companies are involved in collaborations with the centres.<br/><br/>The SFI Research Centres link scientists and engineers in partnerships across academia and industry to address crucial research questions; foster the development of new and existing Irish-based technology companies; attract industry that could make an important contribution to Ireland and its economy; and expand educational and career opportunities in Ireland in science and engineering.  The Centres promote and develop academia-industry partnerships which serve to provide industry-relevant training and contacts to the researchers.  <br/><br/>These 12 SFI Research Centres are focused on strategic areas of importance to Ireland - Pharma, Big Data, Medical Devices, Nanotechnology/Materials, Marine Renewable Energy, Food for Health/Functional Foods, Perinatal Research, Applied Geosciences, Software, Digital Content, Telecommunications and Medical Devices etc.<br/><br/>Through its investments <br/><br/>-SFI supports a cohort of circa 2,600 researchers across Ireland&rsquo;s HEIs. <br/><br/>-SFI continues to support Excellence and Impactful science with a significant component of its budget supporting researchers on grants.  It is important to note that while the number of researchers directly supported by SFI has declined slightly, SFI-funded researchers have leveraged significant other funding with the total composition of the research teams (both SFI and other funding sources) numbering 4,678 <br/><br/>-A total of 3,996 peer-reviewed publications were reported in 2013 by SFI funded researchers, of these 2,237 publications were attributed to SFI awards.  Publications and citations provide a key indicator of the excellence of the research funded.  Of the total number of publications from active award, 40% have an international co-author; this provides a strong basis for building partnerships for EU Horizon 2020 funding. <br/><br/>-SFI researchers were involved in over 900 linkages with industry involving links to 460 Multinational Corporation (MNCs) and 440 SMEs.<br/><br/>-SFI has built strategic partnerships with other agencies for collaborative funding initiatives, as part of the implementation of the NRPE through the Prioritisation Action Group (PAG). These include a partnership with Teagasc to fund projects in the Future Agri-Food space and a partnership with the Department of Education and Learning in Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>-SFI was instrumental in the Smart Futures national campaign, promoting careers in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) to second-level students in Ireland. Continued support for the Smart Futures programme has come from industry representative bodies such as ICT Ireland, the Irish Software Association, Irish Medical Devices Association and Engineer&rsquo;s Ireland. A Smart Futures Advisory Forum has been established to provide strategic support for the implementation of the initiative.<br/><br/>-SFI researchers engaged in more than 1,383 international linkages with partners in 48 countries, and play a key role in enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s international scientific reputation.<br/><br/>-SFI will continue its endeavours to promote and encourage research of Excellence and Impact. SFI&rsquo;s focus on excellence of research is critical to allow Ireland to continue to build an effective research base that will contribute to economic development. This SFI focus on excellence has enabled Ireland to markedly enhance its international scientific rankings, from 36th in 2003 to breaking into the global top 20 in 2009, a ranking which has been maintained every year since.<br/><br/>-The impact of basic scientific research is cumulative.  Primarily as a consequence of SFI support, Ireland excels in specific research disciplines, as seen clearly in rankings such as 1st for the quality of its research in Immunology and Animal &amp;amp; Dairy; 3rd In Nanoscience; 4th in Computer Science and 8th for the quality of its research in Materials Science.<br/><br/>-The Global Innovation Index 2013 ranked Ireland 10th out of 142 countries.<br/><br/>-In July 2013 Nature Magazine, the eminent scientific publishing journal, cited Ireland as one of 5 up-and-coming countries for research.<br/><br/><b>Table</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Funding to SFI from Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation (DJEI)<br /><br />&euro;&rsquo;000</th><th>Funding to SFI from other government departments/agencies<br /><br />&euro;&rsquo;000</th><th>Funding to SFI from EU Programmes<br /><br />&euro;&rsquo;000</th></tr><tr><td>2001</td><td>8,768</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td>30,910</td><td></td><td>SFI was a unit under the aegis of Forf&aacute;s up to 2003 when it was established on a statutory basis under the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Act, 2003.</td></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>66,476</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>113,730</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>129,561</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>147,570</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>164,066</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>170,418</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>180,398</td><td></td><td>109</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>158,705</td><td>63</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>161,642</td><td>69</td><td>160</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>164,439</td><td>10</td><td>905</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>161,550</td><td>10</td><td>235</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>162,440</td><td>364</td><td>120</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>1,820,673</td><td>589</td><td>1,529</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The scope of the EU Commission&rsquo;s mandate to negotiate with the US on TTIP is comprehensive and can be found on the EU Council&rsquo;s website at  <i><font color="#4181FF">.</font></i><br/><br/>Since the negotiations started with the US in 2013, eight negotiating rounds have taken place, the most recent during the week 2-6 February 2015 in Brussels.  A further two rounds of negotiations are expected to take place before the summer.  <br/><br/>Regulatory co-operation is one of three broad areas included in the negotiations.  The main objective is to reduce or eliminate any unnecessary costs, for example, duplication of testing or inspection.  The EU Commission has put together a paper that provides an overview of the EU&rsquo;s position in the negotiations on regulatory co-operation and this can be found on the EU Commission&rsquo;s website at .  <br/><br/>In the area of public services, such as health and education, where there has been a lot of misinformation, it is important to point out that the agreement will not require any public service to be privatised.<br/><br/>The purpose of the TTIP negotiations is to generate jobs and growth by reducing barriers to trade and investment. According to assessments made by the EU Commission and other European bodies, a comprehensive TTIP could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% per annum bringing significant economic gains as a whole for the EU.  This converts into 400,000 jobs across the EU.  <br/><br/>Ireland has particularly strong economic links with the US, with over 118,000 people employed in 585 US companies here.  The total level of trade (imports and exports) between Ireland and the US in 2012 was &euro;55 billion.  The US is Ireland biggest merchandise export market.  The most recent data from the CSO shows that Ireland&rsquo;s services exports to the US increased by 40% in 2012.  Notwithstanding the present high level of trade, significant benefits could be derived from a comprehensive and ambitious TTIP.  <br/><br/>My Department commissioned a study on the potential impact of the TTIP for Ireland. This study is intended to assist in guiding the Irish position in the negotiations.  The study is expected to be finalised shortly and published in early 2015.<br/><br/>The initial findings of the study show that the benefit to Ireland would be more than double the EU average, with 1.1% added to GDP.  Other preliminary findings include increased exports (2.7%), increases in real wages (1.4%) and investment (1.6%).  Opportunities are expected mainly in manufacturing &ndash; pharmaceutical and chemical industry, electrical machinery and other advanced machinery; in certain services and in processed foods. Small and medium enterprises in Ireland are expected to gain from this trade agreement. <br/><br/>In accordance with EU&rsquo;s Common Commercial Policy, on the basis of a proposal from the EU Commission, it is a matter for the EU Council to decide on the signature of a trade agreement, and, following the consent of the European Parliament and ratification by Member States, to adopt the formal decision to conclude a trade agreement. This means that Ireland will be part of the final decision to ratify the agreement.</p></reply>

It was a collaborative effort which has borne fruit, with Ireland being the first European country to regain access to the biggest beef market in the world.</p>  <p>  The US beef market is potentially lucrative, with consumption at 11 million metric tonnes annually, which makes this new market such an exciting one for Irish producers.  While grass fed is a small volume category compared to conventional or grain fed beef, currently accounting for approximately 10% of total volume, it is estimated to be growing at approximately 20%+ per annum.  Consumers in this segment of the market will be a key target in the marketing efforts to promote Irish beef.</p>  <p>  Last week I visited the US to launch the arrival of Irish beef there and hosted launch events in New York, Washington and Boston.  All of the major Irish beef exporters that accompanied me reported strong interest from US buyers and distributors, which I am sure will lead to further collaboration in the future.  I also had the opportunity to meet with many buyers and distributors and it was clear the superior taste and quality of Irish beef allied to the sustainability of its production clearly resonated with the US audience.</p>  <p>  In addition, last week Bord Bia unveiled their marketing strategy for Irish beef in the US having been actively preparing the groundwork for market entry.  Having this first-mover advantage as the first and only EU MS to achieve access to date is significant.  One of the key announcements last week was the launch of a dedicated website highlighting the qualities of Irish beef to US beef consumers and buyers.</p>  <p>  Currently just 2% of Irish beef exports go outside the EU each year and further diversifying the available markets has been a key element of my strategy for the beef sector for some time.  This is a key element in ensuring more sustainable returns to beef farmers and ensuring that an over-reliance on particular markets does not harm the long term prospects of the sector.  I am very confident that the opening of the US market is a major step forward in ensuring the long term viability of the beef sector.</p></reply>

The volume of beef available for export was approximately 530,000 tonnes whilst average prices fell by around 11%.  The volume of beef destined for the UK (up 9%), Continental Europe (especially Italy, Scandinavia and Germany) (up 17%), and international markets (up 10%) increased in 2014.</p>  <p>  In so far as exports to third country markets have been concerned, I have been very active in building and expanding relationships in potential markets in order to raise the profile of Ireland and build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in the future.  In the last year, I have lead trade and political missions to China and the US as these have been identified as key priority markets.  I was delighted to be in the US last week to launch the arrival of Irish beef for the first time there in 16 years and I can report very strong interest from US buyers and distributors in Irish beef. </p>  <p>  In the last year agreements have been reached with Japan, Lebanon, Philippines, Namibia and New Caledonia for the export of Irish beef.  Work is currently ongoing with Korea, and significant progress has been made on securing market access to the Chinese market.  My Department continues to engage with industry and Bord Bia to identify markets which may present market opportunities and be lucrative for Irish beef and will pursue these opportunities as a priority.</p></reply>

In Ireland, average prices rose steadily from &euro;3.22 a kilo at the start of January 2011 to an unprecedented peak of over &euro;4.40 per kilo in June of 2013.  They subsequently declined to &euro;3.51 in September of 2014 before recovering to the current price with tightened supplies of &euro;4.05 excluding VAT.  Prices are a function of normal supply and demand factors which are in turn influenced by the seasonality of production, the length of the production lifecycle, and market conditions such as retail promotions, consumer confidence, competition with other meats, exchange rates and the overall macroeconomic situation.  Last year Irish processors slaughtered nearly 10% more animals than in 2013 and over 17% more than in 2012, while there has been a drop in beef consumption throughout Europe.</p>  <p>  There are structures in place to help to alleviate the impact of these price changes, and to help farmers to reduce production costs and increase efficiencies.  Successive reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy have involved a shift in emphasis from market supports to direct payments to farmers.  The &euro;1.2 billion per year secured in direct payments each year forms a constant and secure income for farmers, and this is a particularly important buffer as prices fluctuate.  In addition, the need to ensure a viable future for the beef sector has been central to the draft &euro;4 billion Rural Development Plan submitted to the EU Commission in July.</p>  <p>  The RDP includes a number of elements which will be of benefit to beef farmers throughout the country, including the Beef Data and Genomics Programme which will be worth around &euro;300 million over a 6 year period and should bring about long term improvements to the sector though improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.  Also, the continued support under the new agri-environment scheme GLAS and the &euro;195 million per year support for disadvantaged areas will be of significant benefit to beef farmers.Â  </p>  <p>  Reducing input costs and improving efficiencies on farms has also been a key focus, and in this regard the funding by my Department to Teagasc, ICBF and Animal Health Ireland is critically important.  I have also been active in developing new market opportunities for Irish beef and in recent years markets such as, Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran have been opened.  In addition, I launched Irish beef on the lucrative US market last week and I am confident of further success in the coming months. </p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that prices for R3 steers in Ireland have risen by 54 cents per kilo since the beginning of September.  This is an increase of over 15 % during this period and Irish prices are now at 105 % of the EU15 average price.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, the main targets in the Food Harvest report are by 2020 to increase the value of: <br/><br/>- Primary output in the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sector by 33%;<br/><br/>- Value added production by 40%;<br/><br/>- Agriculture, food (including seafood) and drink exports by 42%;<br/><br/>In addition, a 50% increase in milk production following the abolition of the milk quotas and a 78% increase in the volume of aquaculture production is envisaged.<br/><br/>Progress on these targets and on the 215 recommendations in the Food Harvest report are monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis.  The fourth annual report &ldquo; <i>Milestones for Success 2014</i>&rdquo;, published last September, showed that the sector had achieved very significant progress on these targets.  Four and a half years into a 10 year strategy, the value of primary production has almost reached its target and export s have grown by 27% compared to its 2020 target of 42% growth.  That report, link attached, also used case studies to illustrate the manner in which the Food Harvest 2020 vision of 'smart, green, growth' is being attained. <br/><br/><i></i><br/><br/>The CSO trade statistics for 2014, which were published last week show that the value of primary production has grown by 30%, value-added has increased by 23% and exports have grown by 27%, compared to the Food Harvest 2020 baseline period.<br/><br/>Based on these statistics, all targets are currently well on track but notwithstanding same, I regard it as opportune to continually review the internal and external environment so that we will continue to maximise the opportunities available to this indigenous sector.  To that end, I have appointed a 2025 Agri-Food Strategy Committee to report back to me by end June with any key recommendations and actions they consider necessary to achieve this objective.</p></reply>

Since September, average prices have risen by over 15% and now stand at &euro;4.05, exclusive of VAT, for R3 Steers.  This price is 5.5% higher than the same period last year and is also ahead of the same period in 2013, a year of exceptionally high prices for beef in Ireland.  With supply forecast to tighten in 2015, I would be hopeful that recent price rises will be sustained and that they can result in improved margins for beef producers.<br/><br/>Margins are, of course, also impacted by a number of factors other than price and these are the areas where I have focused my efforts since becoming Minister.  I established the Beef Roundtable last year in order to bring all stakeholders together and to facilitate open discussions between industry and farming organisations.  At the 4<sup>th</sup>meeting of the Roundtable in November, the stakeholders agreed to a broad range of outcomes which address areas of concern for the sector such as relate to product specifications, price transparency and quality payment system.<br/><br/>The Roundtable allows stakeholders to engage in a positive way on strategic goals for the sector.  As an example, the most recent meeting of the Roundtable held earlier this month resulted in the establishment of a stakeholder group, led by Teagasc, which was tasked with preparing written guidelines for beef farmers which would act as a blueprint for those currently producing bull beef or those considering developing bull beef production systems, taking into account production efficiency and market dynamics.<br/><br/>The Deputy will also be aware that I have provided for a package worth over &euro;70 million for the beef sector in 2015.  This includes &euro;52 million for the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) which forms part of Ireland's draft Rural Development Programme, and will involve a budget of some &euro;300m over a 6-year period.  The proposed BDGP is intended to deliver an accelerated improvement in the environmental sustainability of the beef herd through the application of genomics technology.  This will help farmers to manage their enterprises in a sustainable way that is cognisant of Ireland's climate change commitments, while supporting improved quality and traceability in the national suckler herd.  It will also place Ireland at the global forefront in the application of genomics technology and cement our place as one of the most important and export focused beef producing nations in the world.<br/><br/>Of course, new market opportunities for both beef and live cattle exports also impact on the eventual returns to farmers.  The recent the opening of the US market to Irish beef is a major achievement in this regard and I am confident of delivering more markets in the coming months which will further improve prospects for the sector.<br/><br/><b><i>Sheepmeat</i></b><br/><br/>The industry wide strategy for developing the sheep industry in Ireland was set out in the Food Harvest 2020 document which envisages a 20% increase in value terms of the sector by 2020.  My approach to building on the significant achievements of the strategy up until now is to drive the development of the industry at home and increase Ireland's market share of the world market.  This will ensure that producers and processors can plan for the future, increasing the value of the industry for the benefit of all.<br/><br/>In terms of the performance of the sector in 2014, Irish sheep throughput at DAFM-approved plants was up slightly on 2013, with a marginal increase 1%.  Prices paid to producers over the same period have increased, with the average factory price running at 6.9 % of last year's level at the end of the year.  To date in 2015 there is a 5% drop in throughput at DAFM approved plants with an approximate 12% increase in the average factory price over the same period last year.<br/><br/>At producer level I continue to put in place incentives to ensure that producers see a viable future in the sector.  During 2014, I announced the extension of the Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP) for a further year.  In committing funding of &euro;3m to the programme in 2015 I am acknowledging the success of the scheme in 2013 and 2014 in which 4,000 producers participated.<br/><br/>Support for the sheep sector has also come from the Grassland Sheep Scheme for which I have prioritised funding over the last five years.  This scheme delivered &euro;83 million directly to the incomes of Irish sheep farmers.  As it was not possible to implement the grassland payment under the new CAP regime I decided that payments received under the 2014 Grassland Sheep Scheme will be incorporated into the calculation of the entitlement value in each year of the new regime for those farmers who participated in that Scheme.  This will have the effect of increasing their entitlement value and ensure that such farmers do not lose through the cessation of the scheme at the end of 2014.<br/><br/>Under the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) I have made provision for improving efficiency and profitability in sheep production under the Knowledge Transfer measure which has a budget of &euro;100m.  The experience in STAP will inform the development of this measure.  In addition to profitability, the emphasis will be on the key issues of business skills, environmental sustainability and herd health, with increased interaction between individual farmers and advisors in order to customise information exchange.  The Knowledge Transfer Programme for the sheep sector will be launched in 2016 when the current STAP concludes.<br/><br/>The current AEOS Scheme supports sheep farming through its commonage measure.  The proposed new agri-environment scheme, GLAS (Green Low-carbon Agri-environment Scheme) will also support, amongst others, extensive and hill farmers, who have shown themselves to be careful custodians of the countryside in previous agri-environment schemes.  GLAS intends giving priority to those commonage farmers who come together to form an agreed plan to manage these valuable landscapes.  It also includes a menu of environmental actions, many of which will be suitable for all sheep farmers.<br/><br/>On the export front I intend to drive further the search for new markets.  My Department in consultation with the meat industry and in cooperation with Bord Bia and the Irish Embassies abroad is constantly pushing for new markets and opportunities.<br/><br/>During 2014, we have agreed veterinary health certificates with Lebanon, Namibia, Hong Kong and The Philippines thus allowing for the export of Irish sheepmeat to those countries.  Also, during my visit to China leading a Trade Mission in November 2014, I was able to hand over the completed version of a sheep questionnaire which we had been asked to complete in connection with our efforts to gain access to the Chinese market for sheepmeat.  This represents the first milestone on the road which will lead, I hope, to Ireland gaining access to the Chinese market for sheepmeat in the future.<br/><br/><b><i>Dairy</i></b><br/><br/>With respect to the dairy sector, Ireland strongly supported the abolition of the milk quota regime, on the basis that quotas were widely regarded as a brake on the potential of the Irish dairy sector to respond positively to market opportunities.  The ending of milk quota regime represents an exceptional opportunity for the dairy industry to increase milk output and, as a result, the industry has set itself a target, under Food Harvest 2020, of increasing milk production by 50% in the period to 2020.  This will result in increasing the 2008-2009 average annual milk production of 5bn litres to 7.5bn litres in 2020.  Consequently I am satisfied that dairy production in Ireland will not suffer in the aftermath of the abolition of quotas.  Furthermore, since the publication of the Food Harvest 2020 Report, my Department has been providing a range of supports to assist farmers in exploiting the potential for expansion and development.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding a softening market for dairy products on world markets towards the end of 2014 and the consequent reduction in farm gate prices for milk, the general consensus among forecasters in this area is that increasing global population and other demographic factors are expected to result in strong demand for milk and dairy products in developing countries.  Ireland is well placed to take advantage of this increased trade in the context of the removal of quota restrictions which will facilitate the necessary increased production.<br/><br/><b><i>Pigmeat</i></b><br/><br/>The development of the pigmeat sector is a priority for me given the crucial role which the industry plays in supporting approximately 7,000 jobs including production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services.  The sector accounts for 5% of the total agri-food sector and is the third largest individual component. In 2014 export volumes were up 7%, continuing the growth seen in previous years, while export values increased by 3%, constrained somewhat due to price pressures.  Pigmeat prices tend to be cyclical in nature with periods of lower prices and production followed by recovery and this has remained the case for many years.<br/><br/>Support is provided by my Department for the development of the pig sector in a number of ways.  Firstly I have included provision in 2015 and throughout the whole RDP for an on-farm capital investments scheme, TAMS II, with an overall budget of &euro;395 million across all sectors, with &euro;37 million allocated for 2015.  Among the areas identified for initial funding are investments on pig farms for energy, water meters and medicine dispensers.<br/><br/>Other supports for development of the sector come through Teagasc which, through its Moorepark pig research facility and courses in pig production, plays an important role in improving production at farm level.  Through its Joint Research Advisory Programme, Teagasc supports Irish pig producers by providing advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector.  The high level objective of the programme is to enhance the sustainability of Irish pig meat production, including improvements in economic, social and environmental standards.  This will result in improvements in the production and marketability of Irish pigmeat.<br/><br/>I am also conscious of the need to promote the consumption of Irish pigmeat in domestic and overseas markets.  Bord Bia provides assistance to the pigmeat sector through its marketing and promotional activities, and the pigmeat quality assurance scheme helps to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and helps expand its presence on EU and third country markets.<br/><br/>I am pleased to report that overall Irish pigmeat exports in 2014 increased by 10%, to a value of &euro;570m.  Exports to Asia alone are estimated to have risen by 20% to China, 210% to Japan and 650% to South Korea.  International trade is expected to improve in 2015, reflecting the ongoing increase in demand in response to growing <i>per capita</i>wealth in China, and the redirection of pigmeat usually directed towards the Russian market to different locations such as South Korea and the Philippines.  For my part I have undertaken to ensure that as many alternative markets as possible are open to Irish Pigmeat processors.  In this regard I was pleased to recently announce the opening of the markets in Vietnam and the Philippines for Irish pigmeat which are already serving as valuable alternative markets to Russia for Irish pigmeat exports.<br/><br/>I am of course aware of the current price difficulties for Irish pig farmers and have met with farm organisations and processors on a number of occasions to discuss possible solutions to alleviate these difficulties.  I will continue to work closely with like-minded Ministers in the EU to persuade the European Commission to come forward with market response measures in response to current price difficulties.  In addition my Department will continue to engage with the Russian authorities and with a view to lifting the pigmeat restriction as a priority.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that pigmeat remains the most consumed meat worldwide and this will continue to present opportunities for Irish producers, given our self-sufficiency.  In addition, the progress made in the last few years in establishing and consolidating a presence in important international markets will better position Irish producers to take advantage of growing demand.<br/><br/><b><i>Poultry</i></b><br/><br/>Poultry meat has long been seen as a value for money food and this has underscored an increase in demand, particularly in recent years.  The sector has faced considerable challenges in recent years with rising input and energy costs combined with significant pressure from lower cost imports.  While input prices reduced somewhat in 2014, the beneficial impact of this was counterbalanced by reducing producer and wholesale prices.<br/><br/>Support is provided by my Department for the development of the poultry sector in a number of ways.  Provision is made through the RDP, TAMS II, for poultry investments.  In addition knowledge transfer groups will be established to optimise producer productivity and profitability in the poultry sector.<br/><br/>In terms of marketing supports, on a national level Quality Assurance plays a fundamental role in promoting food and horticulture and provides the platform for consumer promotion of product quality.  The primary outlet for Irish-produced poultry is the fresh retail trade where Irish product is still dominant.  The Bord Bia Poultry Quality Assurance Scheme (PQAS) is a very important instrument in that market and is recognised by consumers as a guarantee of traceability and reliability which is sought after by Irish retailers.<br/><br/>Ireland exports poultry meat to almost 40 international markets<b></b>and export values grew by an estimated 20% in 2014 to &euro;310 million, underpinned by strong growth in the export of processed products.</p></reply>

This should ultimately lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns.  The new Common Fisheries Policy specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY.  I am committed to the ambitious objective of achieving MSY by 2015 where possible and by 2020 at the latest.  As president of the Council during the CFP negotiations it fell to me to broker an agreement on this important issue between the co-legislators.  In line with the CFP, I consider that for some stocks we will need to phase in delivering MSY if its immediate application seriously jeopardises the social and economic sustainability of the fishing fleet.  The TACs and quotas for 2015, as agreed at the December Agriculture &amp;amp; Fisheries Council of Ministers meeting, take account of delivering MSY for 2015 where possible and on a progressive, incremental basis at the latest by 2020 for all stocks.</p>  <p>  The introduction of a landing obligation/discarding ban on a phased basis, as set out in the CFP, represents a fundamental shift in fisheries policy and fishing practices.  A discards plan for pelagic stocks in North Western Waters, developed by Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands, France and Belgium in consultation with the Advisory Council, has been in place since the 1st January 2015.  Work on a discard plan for the whitefish &amp;amp; demersal stocks is already under way and is due to come into force on the 1st January 2016.  This work is carried out in close consultation with both the Advisory Council and other Member States with fisheries interests in North Western Waters.  It is expected that over time the landing obligation will lead to an improvement in the state of the stocks of importance to Ireland and will result in increased fishing opportunities for the Irish fishing industry.</p>  <p>  From the outset of the Common Fisheries Policy revision process, Ireland's overarching goal was to ensure a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to safeguard fish stocks for future generations.  This will ensure that families dependent on fishing can look forward to being part of a vibrant, productive and resilient Irish fishing industry and can expect to continue to achieve a reasonable return for their efforts and investment. </p></reply>

It reports higher market prices and the recovery of some fish stocks helped the EU fishing fleet to again improve its profitability in 2012.  It reports that despite the economic crisis and less fish being landed, economic performance has more than doubled over the last 5 years, from 3.2% net profit in 2008 to 6.6% in 2012.  These are some of the main findings of the 2014 annual economic report on the EU fishing fleet,produced by the JRC (Joint Research Centre, the European Commission's scientific and technical arm) and independent experts.<br/><br/>The report finds that although generated revenue fell compared to 2011, costs decreased even more, making a &euro;458 million net profit for the EU fleet, performing better than in 2011.  This improvement can be attributed to lower labour and capital costs, a steady reduction in fuel consumption, higher market prices for several commercially important species, such as European pilchard, anchovy and brown shrimp, the capacity reduction in some fleet segments, the implementation of long-term management plans and the recovery of some important fish stocks.<br/><br/>Research and innovation projects, implementation of certification schemes and the growing demand for certified products as well as favourable market conditions are some other factors that may also have led to an improved economic performance.<br/><br/>The EU Commission advises that this improvement occurred in spite of sustained high fuel prices and the ongoing economic crisis that continues to affect markets for some species and limit access to credit.  Other drivers that may have contributed to deteriorating performance include the reduced amount of fish that can be caught from several key stocks such as European sprat and Atlantic herring, severe weather conditions and, in some areas, damages caused by marine mammals, e.g. seals.<br/><br/>However, this overall positive evolution in 2012 did not apply to all fleets.  Of 18 analysed Member States, the report finds that three national fleets (Belgium, The Netherlands and Slovenia) made overall net losses and while the economic performance of the EU large-scale and distant water fleets generally improved over the period 2008-2012, that of the small-scale fleet declined from 13% in 2008 to 3.4% in 2012.  The analysis of available data up to 2012 suggests that the performance of the small-scale fleet will deteriorate even further during 2013.<br/><br/>The annual reports on the economic performance of the European fishing fleet are prepared by the JRC and independent experts convened under the auspices of the <i>Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF).</i>This year's edition is accompanied by a summary report, prepared in cooperation with the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries.<br/><br/>A fleet report for 2013 for Ireland has been submitted to the EU Commission which will inform it's preparation of a report on the performance of the EU fishing fleets for 2013.  A report in respect of 2014 will be prepared and will be submitted in advance of the EU deadline of the end of May 2015.</p></reply>

I published an Irish &ldquo;discard atlas&rdquo; back in 2011, which was the first publication of its kind, and this ultimately assisted in advancing the case for a phased elimination of discards as part of the CFP reform package concluded under the Irish Presidency in 2013.<br/><br/>It was agreed, following intensive negotiations, whereby a practical and phased discards policy or landing obligation is being introduced under EU law for all fleets in all fisheries, with the 1<sup>st</sup>stock, pelagics, being subject to the ban from the 1<sup>st</sup>January 2015.  The phasing in period, up to 1 January 2019, means that fishermen will have time to adjust and implement changes that will allow for the avoidance of non target species.<br/><br/>At national level, I have established a national Discards Implementation Group, whose primary aim is to ensure that the Irish fishing Industry are fully prepared for, and engaged in, the implementation of the discards ban.  A new regional decision making process, involving Ireland, Belgium, France, UK, Netherlands and Spain has also been set up to negotiate and implement measures appropriate to the North West Waters Region.  A discards plan for pelagic stocks (herring, mackerel etc.) on the waters of interest to Irish fishermen was agreed under this regional decision making process in 2014.  For 2015 the Group are continuing to develop a regional Discards Plan for certain whitefish stocks which is due to be introduced on a phased basis from the 1<sup>st</sup>January 2016.<br/><br/>I believe that the ending of the previous high levels of discarding carried out by all EU fleets fishing on stocks of interest to the Irish fishing industry will greatly help over time to underpin the sustainability of the Irish fishing industry and lead to greater conservation of fish stocks to the benefit of all.</p></reply>

In all 73 stocksÂ are subject toÂ the scientific advice of the Marine Institute.  This is an increase from 59 stocks last year, mainly due to the addition of a number of skates and rays stocks.  There is a higher number, 25 stocks,Â assessed to be sustainably fished in 2014, up from 20 last year.  The proportion remains the same due to the higher number of stocks being assessed overallÂ this year.  The number of stocks overfished has also increased from 14 in 2013 to 22 in 2014.  This isÂ due to the inclusion of 4 new stocks (rays and sea bass) and 4 stocks have gone from unknown status or underfished to overfished.  The number of stocks with unknown status is 26, which is similar to last year.</p>  <p>  In respect of the biomass of stocks, that is the quantity of mature fish in the sea, approximately one quarter, or 17 stocks are in a positive state withÂ above biomass trigger points.  The number of depleted stocks has increased from 7 to 12 and now 16% of stocks are assessed to be depleted.  The number of stocks with unknown Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB), no assessments or undefined maximum rate of fishing mortality (Fmsy) remains relatively high involving 44 stocks.  Many of these stocks have good information on biomass trends and this informs scientific advice for the stocks.Â </p>  <p>  A Key element of the new CFP is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY).  This will be phased in gradually, applying by 2015 where possible and by 2020 at the latest for all stocks.  This will result in more fish being left in the sea to mature and reproduce leading to increased abundance of fish, and over time to higher quotas for Irish fishermen.</p>  <p>  The EU Commission has noted that the state of fish stocks in European Atlantic and nearby waters continues to improve which I believe indicates that we are finally starting to see the benefits of prudent and responsible fisheries management practices.</p></reply>

We are keen to increase our access to the American market for dairy products, pig-meat, beverages and food ingredients.  Now that we have gained access to the US beef market, we want to grow that trade by securing higher quotas and lower tariffs. </p>  <p>  Of course we have defensive interests as well.  One of these is our beef sector where we are mindful of the potential of increased imports of US beef to have a negative effect on the economics of EU and Irish beef production, particularly beef from suckler cows.  We must ensure that the EU market is not undermined by over-supply.</p>  <p>  We are at a relatively early stage in these negotiations but I am confident that there is sufficient determination and good will on both sides of the Atlantic to secure an agreement that will be good for Europe and good for the United States.</p></reply>

The positive CSO employment results above are borne out by annual surveys which Enterprise Ireland and BIM carry out on all their food industry clients.  These provide an accurate assessment of company employment trends since 2009 and show that employment levels for EI food and beverage client companies rose from 38,784 at end 2009 to 42,212 in 2013, while employment for BIM seafood processing clients also rose by 450 in the same period.<br/><br/>Food Harvest 2020 identified particular potential for direct and indirect employment gains in the dairy, seafood and beverage sectors.  Progress to date on these and other targets is set out in the <i>Milestones for Success 2014</i>report, published in September.

The <i>Food Harvest 2020</i><i>Environmental Analysis Report</i>found that the adoption and use of high technology and best production methodologies at farm production level will yield the best environmental outcomes and result in the most effective mitigation measures.<br/><br/>The draft <i>Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014-2020</i>has been informed by the findings and recommendations in the above mentioned report and the '<i>Marginal Abatement Cost Curve for Irish Agriculture' </i>(September 2012 prepared by Teagasc), which identified a number of measures for the abatement of greenhouse gases.<br/><br/>The draft RDP 2014-2020 has been designed to support the smart green growth message of <i>Food Harvest 2020</i>and encompasses the themes of technology, efficiency and sustainability. The main elements of the programme include:<br/><br/>- a substantial new agri-environment/climate scheme (GLAS), which will build on the progress made under REPS and AEOS;<br/><br/>- incentives for on-farm capital investment, which will incorporate support for investments with clear sustainability benefits;<br/><br/>- knowledge transfer and innovation measures including support for the European Innovation Partnership, which are aimed at underpinning farm viability, sustainability and growth through the adoption of best practice and innovative solutions;<br/><br/>- a new beef data and genomics programme will have a range of benefits in terms of sustainability, profitability, animal health and welfare, quality assurance, and herd quality; and<br/><br/>- other supports aimed at collaborative farming, artisan producers and organic farming.<br/><br/>My Department chairs an <i>Agriculture Climate Change Committee</i>, under the auspices of the <i>Food Harvest High Level Implementation Committee</i>which undertakes work on important and urgent issues in the development of national and EU policy on agriculture and climate change. The Committee comprises representatives of Teagasc, Bord Bia and the Environmental Protection Agency, and has helped to inform the development of <i>A discussion document on the potential for Greenhouse Gas (GHG) mitigation within the Agriculture and Forestry sector.</i>This document is currently open for public consultation and submissions received will be considered by my Department in the formation of the agriculture and forestry sector mitigation plan.<br/><br/>My Department is also preparing a sectoral adaptation plan which will also be open to public consultation.<br/><br/>Under the <i>Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015</i>, which was published in January, National Mitigation and Adaptation Plans are to be developed. The sectoral adaptation and mitigation plans will form an important part of this work.  The plans will specify the policy measures to be undertaken for both mitigation and adaption and will be fundamental pillars of future national policy.<br/><br/>In addition, my Department is currently preparing a national strategy for the agri-food sector up to 2025 which will outline the key actions required to ensure that the agri-food sector (primary agriculture, the food and beverage industry, fisheries and fish processing, forestry and forestry processing) maximises its contribution to overall economic growth, job creation and environmental sustainability over the coming decade and builds upon the progress achieved under <i>Food Harvest 2020</i>. This Strategy, like its predecessor, will be developed by a Committee of leading figures from the agri-food sector.<br/><br/>Independent consultants are being engaged to carry out a full Environmental Assessment of the 2025 strategy to include both a SEA and AA, which when completed will inform future policy development.</p></reply>

Global trends in health and wellness, 'naturalness', nutritional awareness and convenience are also driving sophistication in recipe development and ingredient selection.</p>  <p>  Ireland is well placed as we produce high quality, safe and sustainable ingredients. The dairy sector is gearing up to increase production by 50% by 2020 and value added ingredients can provide a market with less price volatility than commodity production. One major opportunity is supplying dairy ingredients to infant formula manufacturers. Exports of infant formula have increased by over 55% since 2010 to c. &euro;920m and there is further potential for growth as infant formula manufacturers increase their Irish manufacturing footprint. Market opportunities are also expanding for dairy powders and proteins, butter and cheese ingredients which are used in a very broad range of functional foods, clinical, paediatric and sports nutrition products.</p>  <p>  The prepared consumer foods sector is a major market for meat and dairy ingredients and there is a positive trend in demand for particular products and export markets.  The Irish food industry includes suppliers of ingredients such as micronutrient premixes, seasonings, brine and cure ingredients, prepared sauces, stocks, and marinades, baking aids, Individually Quick Frozen (IQF) meat and vegetable ingredients. These suppliers are developing new business in European and Middle Eastern markets.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also significant opportunity to develop new marine ingredient industries.  There is strong demand from international companies for sustainable, high quality marine ingredients such as oils, calcium and proteins as well as fish oil for direct human consumption. New supplies of marine ingredients may be found in underutilised species such as krill and boarfish.</p>  <p>  Market insight, manufacturing and R&amp;D capability will be key to growth. The development agencies and research bodies are working closely with food companies to facilitate this. On the market side, Bord Bia research into end users of dairy ingredients in world markets has provided insights for Irish companies seeking to expand their export footprint exporters. Promotion of Ireland as a leading source of sustainable dairy ingredients has increased awareness of what we have to offer.  Companies may avail of Bord Bia market insight services across sectors and also attend trade fairs such as Food Ingredients Europe which is taking place in Paris in December.</p>  <p>  Teagasc Moorepark provides world class support in the dairy research area to companies exporting worldwide.  In strengthening their technical and product development capability, companies can and do leverage the capabilities of Teagasc and the Universities.</p>  <p>  Sustained growth requires targeted investment. Capital investment under the Dairy Fund, administered by Enterprise Ireland on behalf of my Department, has been followed by further major investments in manufacturing capacity and capability, in many cases supported by Enterprise Ireland. Food for Health Ireland (FHI) and the Dairy Processing Technology Centre (DPTC), both supported by Enterprise Ireland, are focused on developing next generation dairy ingredients. The investment by Kerry Group in its Global Technology and Innovation Centre at Naas and R&amp;D initiatives by other food companies, highlight the potential for dairy ingredients. Initiatives in other sectors are under consideration.</p>  <p>  In summary, there is considerable scope for further development in the food ingredient area.</p></reply>

Evidence suggests that the sector can have a significant impact on local economies. The emergence of Ireland's artisan food sector, supported by growing consumer demand for niche products and a strong entrepreneurial spirit, has generated many new small food companies. Most are owner managed, frequently have a farming basis, and produce diverse products, demonstrating high potential for innovation. Artisan food also has potential to attract visitors and tourists as evidenced at Bloom and many food festivals.</p>  <p>  The Food Harvest 2020 strategy has stimulated the development of innovative programmes for the sector. These include Food Academy, a programme developed by Bord Bia, the Local Enterprise Offices and Musgraves/Supervalu to support small producers to build businesses, which has been particularly successful in generating sales and employment. Food Works, an initiative of Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland, has also been successful.</p>  <p>  Within the artisan sector, the farmhouse cheese sector includes over 50 cheese-makers producing more than 150 types of cheese valued at over &euro;12 million per annum at farm gate level. My Department is supporting a three year programme managed by Bord Bia under the EU Promotion Scheme to promote and increase awareness of farmhouse cheese. It is projected that with the overall increase in milk production following the abolition of milk quotas, farmhouse and specialty cheese output could increase to just over 4,500 tonnes per annum worth around &euro;33 m without requiring significant additional capital expenditure.</p>  <p>  Growth prospects for the sector are positive overall, driven by increased consumer interest in the provenance of food, environmental concerns, health and a desire to support the local economy.</p></reply>

Consultations and discussions with all of the stakeholders including the farming organisations have continued since then on the exact requirements of each.</p>  <p>  My overall objective has been to implement the measures in a way that farmers can comply with them efficiently and effectively while at the same time ensuring the requirements of the EU Regulation and the overall objectives of the Schemes are met. At this stage, I think that there is a good degree of consensus that the approach taken is the most appropriate one from the point of view of the agricultural sector in Ireland. Over the coming days, my Department will be launching a considerable number of new schemes such as the Basic Payment Scheme, the Greening Payment and GLAS.</p></reply>

I intend to prioritise their applications under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation scheme (TAMS), with grant-aid payable at 40%, being introduced under the new RDP.Â  EU Commission approval is awaited on the proposed schemes under TAMS.</p>  <p>  Under Pillar 1 the Regulation provides that young farmers and new entrants are priority categories under the National Reserve. It also provides scope to include an optional provision whereby Member States may use the National Reserve to allocate new entitlements or give a top-up on the value of existing entitlements for persons who suffer from a 'Specific Disadvantage'.</p>  <p>  With regard to the group of young farmers who established their holding in 2008 and 2009, but who missed out on both the Young Farmer Installation Scheme which closed to applications in 2008 and the Young Farmer priority category under the National Reserve which includes young farmers who commenced since 2010.</p>  <p>  I am glad to say that this category can be considered as a 'group suffering from specific disadvantage'.Â  The positive result of this development is that these young farmers will be eligible to apply under the 2nd phase of the National Reserve to be given new entitlements or be given a top-up on the value of existing entitlements.  Applications will be made available in early April 2015. This is a very welcome outcome that I feel will address an anomaly in the system and allow for fair and equal treatment for this particular category of young active farmers.</p></reply>

In order to provide the best possible customer service it is important to ensure that participants in these schemes have a good understanding of their terms and conditions.  To this end my Department endeavours to ensure that the language used in application forms, supporting documentation and information campaigns is clear, concise and accurate and that only necessary detail is provided and requested.</p>  <p>  Bearing in mind the need to communicate clearly in both written and verbal communications, my Department also provide s step by step guidelines, user friendly explanatory manuals, question and answer sheets and working examples for most schemes, as well as telephone help lines to deal with queries.  Our on-line applications facilities are designed to provide a clear, simple and efficient system for applicants to a range of the Department's schemes.  This approach not only assists our customers in the application process but also reduces the number of errors in applications and facilitates a more efficient service for all.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above and as part of its quality customer service, my Department has put in place a Farmers Charter which among other things is intended to provide information in relation to the delivery of services and implementation of schemes in a clear, simple and easily understood format.</p>  <p>  My Department is also conscious that some of its customers may have literacy difficulties and cannot easily access, understand and/or use information on the Department's schemes and services.

The Natura measure provides for compensation to farmers for disadvantages in their farming activities arising out of 3 Directives &ndash; the Habitats Directive, the Wild Birds Directive and the Water Framework Directive.  Natura 2000 forms an integral part of the REPs and AEOS agri-environment schemes and applicants with Natura designated land are prioritised under AEOS schemes.<br/><br/>Participation in agri-environment schemes, including Natura, is voluntary on the part of farmers and expenditure is therefore demand led. Actual demand under the measure during the 2007 &ndash; 2013 Programme proved to be significantly less than had been provided for.Therefore, the financial provision for Natura was revised to reflect the actual spend.  This involved the reallocation of funds across the agri-environment and Less Favoured Areas schemes in Axis 2 of the Programme without changing the overall spend under that Axis.<br/><br/>The members of the Rural Development Programme Monitoring Committee were informed of the proposed amendments and amendments made to the Rural Development Programme 2007 &ndash; 2013 were processed in full accordance with the regulatory and legislative process in place.<br/><br/>While &euro;95m was expended under the Natura budget line this does not take into account expenditure under the agri-environment budget line that complemented and incentivised farmers with Natura land to engage with the agri-environment scheme.  For example, a broad analysis of REPS 4 expenditure shows that the total combined Agri-Environment and Natura payments to farmers with Natura lands is in the order of &euro;293.5m in respect of 390,000 hectares of farmed land.<br/><br/>Under GLAS, the new agri-environmental measure planned for the 2014-2020 programming period, expenditure on Natura lands will be continued and enhanced.Â  Natura land is deemed a Priority Environmental Asset under the new scheme, and any farmer with Natura is Â guaranteed access to Tier One of GLAS.  There are three principal categories under which Natura lands will be supported under the new Scheme,<blockquote>(a) Commonages &ndash; where an enhanced payment of &euro;120/ha is proposed (increased from &euro;75 under the last programme);<br /><br />(b) Privately-owned Natura, attracting a rate of &euro;79/ha<br /><br />(c) Endangered Farmland birds, many of which are located on Natura lands, and where some of the highest rates of payment are available to farmers who undertake the actions necessary for the preservation and enhancement of the habitats in question (up to &euro;375/ha).</blockquote>All-in-all, it is expected that Natura-related actions will account for a very large proportion of expenditure under GLAS over the next programming period. Â GLAS itself is a highly targeted scheme, prioritising expenditure on birds and habitats at risk, enhanced water quality and climate change mitigation.</p></reply>

In addition, ten (10) Defence Forces personnel have been serving with the EU-led Training Mission in Mali, EUTM Mali, since 2013.</p>  <p>  Given Ireland's current level of commitment in overseas peacekeeping operations, notably to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in Syria and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), we are not in a position to make significant long-term commitments to other missions at this time.</p>  <p>  The current contribution of some 432 personnel to overseas missions reflects the Government's continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security.</p></reply>

As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration. <br/><br/>As Military life places unique physical and psychological demands on individuals it is necessary that its members be physically and mentally prepared to meet the challenges of all military operations and to undertake their duties on deployment overseas<font color="#555555">.</font>It is vital the age and health profile of personnel be such as to ensure that operational capability and effectiveness are not compromised.  As such, in order to maintain the age profile of the PDF to carry out the operational tasks required by Government, it is necessary to have a constant input of recruits into the PDF.  The maximum age for personnel who have enlisted in the PDF post 1 January 1994 provides the mechanism through which a satisfactory age profile can be achieved. <br/><br/>While there was significant progress made in recent discussions between PDFORRA and Civil and Military Management on this issue, it was not possible to reach full agreement.  As a result, the issue was referred to third party adjudication for a ruling.  The adjudication hearing took place on 30 January 2015 and the report of the Adjudicator was issued to all parties to the Scheme on 12 February 2015.  In accordance with the Scheme rules there is a procedure to be followed with regard to the publication of the report in that it cannot be published before presentation to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  As the report requires detailed consideration of the findings by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on this matter at this time.</p></reply>

The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in Syria.  The recent incidents involving Irish troops in UNDOF are testament to the type of the equipment available to the Defence Forces in that mission area. </p>  <p>  The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces remains a focus for me as Minister for Defence and is a matter that is kept under constant review at a senior level in my Department and in the Defence Forces through their joint participation in the High Level Planning and Procurement Group.  This Group is charged with identifying equipment requirements and agreeing on a procurement programme to provide the Defence Forces with the type and quantities of equipment necessary to carry out their assigned duties. </p>  <p>  Given the ongoing budgetary challenges, the continued application of a robust evaluation process by the Defence Organisation in relation to equipment purchasing and maintenance/upgrade programmes during 2014 has ensured that the Defence Forces continue to have access to modern equipment.  Ongoing analysis of defence equipment expenditure has ensured that this expenditure is prioritised and explicitly linked to capability priorities.  A particular focus is maintained in ensuring that modern and effective equipment is available for overseas operations as is the case with the UNIFIL deployment in Lebanon and the UNDOF deployment in Syria.   </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I can assure the Deputy that I am satisfied that the Defence Forces are adequately equipped and trained to meet the many demands and tasks Government has assigned to them including service overseas. </p></reply>

All such plant and equipment suitable for use in emergency situations is made available as the need arises.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Naval Service, all vessels, in addition to their fishery protection role, also undertake general surveillance, security, pollution monitoring, and Search and Rescue in support to the Irish Coast Guard.  These activities assist in detecting and preventing emergency situations throughout Ireland's maritime jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  The role of the Air Corps includes the provision of an emergency inter-hospital Air Ambulance service in support of the HSE.  It is also supporting the HSE in a pilot emergency aero medical support service operating primarily in the West of Ireland.  The Air Corps also has a maritime surveillance function undertaken by its maritime patrol aircraft and both it and the Naval Service provide support to the Irish Coast Guard in maritime Search and Rescue operations.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Defence Forces personnel have a modern and effective range of equipment, including telecommunications and logistical equipment, needed to fulfil all roles that are assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

This  includes personnel, Garda vehicles and the various technologies utilised to support frontline Garda&iacute; and intelligence led operations against organised crime.  This process takes account of annual policing priorities determined by me as Minister for Justice in consultation with the  Commissioner as provided for under Section 20 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005.</p>  <p>  The first intake since 2009 of 100 new recruits entered training at the Garda College, Templemore, on 15th September 2014.  As part of Budget 2015, a further intake of 200 recruits in two batches was announced.  On 15 December 2014, the first 100 of these batches commenced their training with the remaining 100 to entered the college in early February.  This will bring to 300 the number of recruits in the Garda College and is a measure of the Government's commitment to ensure that recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues seamlessly.  The September intake will attest as members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in May 2015 and the December intake will attest in August 2015.  On attestation they will be assigned to Garda stations throughout the country by the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  The strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 31 December 2014, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 12,799.  There were also 1,124 Garda Reserve members, with a further 48 in training.  In addition, there were over 2,000 Garda civilian staff. I remain in discussion with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the timing of future intakes of Garda recruits.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are continually looking to ensure that the latest information, communications and forensic technologies are sourced and deployed to achieve their strategic objectives as set out in the context of their annual policing plans, as provided for in section 22 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which includes commitments to target individuals and groups engaged in organised criminal activity and terrorism.  This policy is designed to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be in a position to meet the evolving needs of a modern effective police force and take advantage of proven up to date technological developments in crime detection and prevention as they occur.</p>  <p>  In terms of existing technology, the Deputy will be aware that a considerable amount of new Garda ICT solutions has been delivered over the past number of years.  These include the deployment of a secure national digital radio system (NDRS), the deployment and support of Garda and Community CCTV systems, an automated number plate recognition (ANPR) system, and the addition of many new functions to the PULSE system, which itself is further supported by a dedicated Garda data entry service in Castlebar.</p>  <p>  In the area of forensics the situation is that the Garda authorities currently employ state-of-the-art automated fingerprint and ballistics identification systems which I am informed are at least on a par with those used by police forces in other EU jurisdictions.  The Deputy will also be aware that the forensic capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be further enhanced by a new national DNA database, scheduled to become operational shortly, which was established on foot of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act, 2014.</p>  <p>  I have also clearly signalled my intention to support the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their efforts to address deficits which were identified in the recent Garda Inspectorate report on crime investigation.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that the issues raised in the report are widespread, varied and far-reaching and, when taken together with the review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Haddington Road agreement, will demand significant structural reform within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The need for additional resources across a number of areas will be examined within that context.  Furthermore, I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Commissioner has commenced an in-depth examination of all recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate Report with a view to determining what can be  implemented in the short, medium and long term.  I also look forward to the significant contribution to this process of reform that will be made by the new policing authority which is to be established shortly.</p></reply>

A prohibited weapon is defined as a firearm under the same Act, and accordingly the restrictions that apply to firearms in the Firearms Acts apply to pepper spray.</p>  <p>  In considering whether or not to grant licences for the possession, use or carriage of firearms, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na take into account a number of factors provided for in the relevant legislation. In this context, in September, 2009 the Garda Commissioner issued revised guidelines in relation to the operation of the firearms legislation which are designed to be of benefit to both members of the Garda&iacute; and members of the public.</p>  <p>  These guidelines specifically state that: &ldquo; The protection of life and property is a function of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and civilians are only entitled to use reasonable force to protect themselves and their property.  The combined effect of this means that there is no justification for seeking to possess a firearm for purposes of personal protection or protection of property.  When assessing an application for a firearm certificate, a superintendent or chief superintendent should not take into account as part of a 'Good Reason' a reference to personal protection."   As personal protection is the only reason for a person to acquire pepper spray, it follows that a firearm certificate is unlikely to be granted for pepper spray.</p>  <p>  I do not envisage amending the legislation to permit the use of pepper spray for civil protection.</p></reply>

It is essential that all young people leaving care are provided with the type of transitional support that their individual situation requires.  	</p>  <p>  The Child Care Act 1991 provides that the core eligible age range for aftercare is from 18 years up to 21 years.  This can be extended until the completion of a course of education and training in which a young person who has left care, or is leaving care, is engaged, up to the age of 23 years.  	</p>  <p>  Current aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance and practical (including accommodation and financial) support.  Advocating on behalf of young people to support their development as fulfilled adults in their community and, when necessary, to link them to targeted adult services, are also crucial elements of an aftercare service.</p>  <p>  Between 450 and 500 young people leave care annually upon turning 18.  According to the Child and Family Agency, at the end of September, 2014 there were 1,698 young people aged 18 to 23 years (inclusive) in receipt of an aftercare service.  Of those, 946 (56 %) were in full time education.  </p>  <p>  A significant number of these young people are supported financially to remain living with their foster carers, in addition to having access to an aftercare worker.  The most vulnerable group of children are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements.  Children, who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that help them achieve good outcomes.  </p>  <p>  Young people who do not have family support from a foster carer or family base are assisted in finding accommodation in supported lodgings, sheltered housing or independent accommodation and encouraged and supported financially in furthering their training and education.</p>  <p>  The Child and Family Agency has advised that they are in the process of establishing interagency aftercare committees at local level bringing together local authorities, the HSE and other statutory and voluntary agencies.  These committees will develop interagency wrap around aftercare plans for young people, particularly for those with complex needs, including housing requirements.  The situation regarding the establishment of these committees varies nationally but, it is expected that all committees will be operational by mid-2015. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, as the Deputy is aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare.  This is in response to concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.  The approach adopted is to impose a statutory duty on the Child and Family Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person.  The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the Agency's duty to satisfy itself as to the child's or young person's need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the Aftercare Bill will be published in the early part of 2015.</p></reply>

They are not political or Ministerial decisions. </p>  <p>  The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine in the GMS and community drugs schemes. The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association  for the assessment of new medicines. </p>  <p>   In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and a fair price for Fampridine in the Irish health-care setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. </p>  <p>  On foot of this, the HSE decided that it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. </p>  <p>  It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE for the inclusion of Fampridine on the community drugs schemes incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of the drug, by offering a reduced price or both.  A revised application was received by the HSE on 25 July 2014. The HSE has since been engaging with the company seeking an improved commercial offering. These engagements have been completed and the HSE is now considering the outcome of those commercial engagements. The HSE has also engaged with clinical experts and is considering the outcome of those engagements. Fampridine will be assessed along with a range of other applications for reimbursement of medicines for multiple sclerosis and other diseases.</p></reply>

It assists the thyroid gland in making hormones which are important for growth, metabolism and for development of a baby's brain during pregnancy and early life.  Iodine is found in a range of foods, but the richest sources are sea food and dairy products.  The level of Iodine needed varies depending on age, gender and whether a woman is pregnant or lactating.</p>  <p>  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has published the results of a research (Report on Total Diet Study 2001-2005 published in September 2011).  It showed that average daily intake ranged from 170 - 260 micro grammes.  These intake ranges are in line with the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of 130 micro grammes for the 18 - 64 age range. </p>  <p>  Currently UCD has been asked to do further analysis on the levels of iodine in the Irish diet and we are awaiting their results.  Early indications show that most Irish people are meeting the RDA but a certain proportion may have intakes below this during the summer; the reason for which may lie in the fact that milk and milk products contain less Iodine during the summer period.  Adding iodine to salt is permitted in Ireland and other European countries.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is currently revising the Healthy Eating Guidelines, which will be published later this year.  In addition, the Department intends to start work on a National Nutrition policy later in 2015, and iodine intake will form part of this work.</p></reply>

The Act also introduces a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  </p>  <p>  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines.  This is the maximum price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority maintains the list of interchangeable medicines and is responsible for determining which medicines should be deemed interchangeable.</p>  <p>  The first reference prices were set for atorvastatin in November 2013, since then the HSE has set reference prices for a further 35 medicines and this process is ongoing. Reference pricing is expected to generate approximately &euro;50 million in savings in 2014 and a further &euro;25 million in 2015.</p>  <p>  As part of our wider Troika commitments a target for generic penetration of the off-patent market by volume was set at 70% by end 2016.  This was to be phased as follows: 60% by end 2014; 65% by end 2015; and 70% by end 2016. By Quarter 3 2014 generics accounted for approximately 67% of the total off-patent market, thus already ahead of target. </p>  <p>  The continued implementation of generic substitution and reference pricing remains a top priority.  Reference prices will ensure that generic prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms.</p></reply>

Some Missions receive few if any applications while others, particularly where there is a large Irish community, receive large numbers of applications.  The processing time for citizenship applications varies from place to place, and is dependent on the number of applications received and the resources available at the Mission to process those applications.  While the Department aims to process all applications as quickly as possible, there is no uniform processing time for citizenship applications and some delays have been unavoidable where high volumes of applications are received.<br/><br/>All applications for Irish citizenship through Foreign Birth Registration must be accompanied by certain documentation depending on the type of application involved.  My Department's website, , lists the documentation that must be submitted in each case.  Missions may ask for additional documentation or information if a particular application is incomplete or raises additional questions requiring further clarification or validation.<br/><br/>The documentation submitted with FBR applications is particularly important in proving entitlement to Irish citizenship and safeguarding against possible fraud.  Applicants submit a wide range of both Irish and foreign birth and other certificates.  There is no common standard applied to birth, marriage and death certificates around the world and certificates from different countries and different periods of time display different types of information.<br/><br/>It should be noted that while Irish certificates have all been issued in a standard format since 2003, many applicants will submit Irish certificates which were issued prior to 2003 when both long and short form certificates were the norm.  The continued reference to 'long form' certificates in the list of documentation required is there to assist these applicants in differentiating which type of pre-2003 certificate is acceptable.<br/><br/>Officials in the Consular Services Section of my Department would be happy to follow up with the Deputy to get further details in relation to the application (including actual name of applicant and a reference number) so that they can ascertain its current status and likely time frame for decision.</p></reply>

It is an area of spending which has been prioritised above most other areas by this Government, despite the enormous pressures on all areas of public spending.<br/><br/>  Some &euro;1.37 billion will be spent in support of children with Special Educational Needs this year, which represents approximately 15% of my Department's budget.<br/><br/>  There has been no reduction in the overall number of Special Needs Assistant or resource teaching/learning support posts being provided for schools.<br/><br/>  On the contrary, 365 new Special Needs Assistant posts and 480 new resource teaching posts have been provided to support children with special educational needs in schools in 2015, bringing the total number of SNAs available for allocation in 2015 to 11,330 posts and the total number of resource teaching posts to 6,705.<br/><br/>  Over 11,000 resource and learning support teaching posts are now available.

The details for each year are the December figures for the year in question. The primary schools information is inclusive of the special schools details.<br/><br/>  SNAs are recruited specifically to assist in the care of pupils with disabilities in an educational context.  The class teacher is responsible for educating all pupils in their class, including any pupil with a special educational need.  In this task, the teacher may be supported by a learning support teacher and/or resource teacher. As a result, the allocation of SNAs in each school can alter from year to year.

It was not possible to also secure the funding which would have been required to change the staffing schedule for schools.<br/><br/>  With regard to Resource Teachers for Travellers, the principle of inclusion is at the core of the Report and Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy published in 2006 and, accordingly, the focus of both current and future provision is on the development of a more inclusive school environment. In keeping with this principle, additional resources provided in the education system are allocated on the basis of identified individual educational need rather than that of ethnic or cultural background.<br/><br/>  Following decisions of the last Government, as part of the December 2010 budgetary process, Traveller pupils who are eligible for learning support teaching now receive this tuition through the existing learning support provision in schools. This is in keeping with the policy of inclusion and the 2006 report. <br/><br/>  The General Allocation Model, which provides additional learning support and English as an additional language allocations for primary schools, was updated for all primary schools from the 2012/13 school year and now includes the Traveller pupils who had previously been supported by Resource Teacher for Traveller (RTT) posts under the General Allocation Model.<br/><br/>  Limited alleviation measures were also put in place to assist schools who had high concentrations of Traveller pupils previously supported by Resource Teacher for Traveller posts/hours, in the context of the limited resources available. <br/><br/>  Provision for English Language Support posts is now provided for under the General Allocation Model for schools, while further additional temporary language support posts are provided on the basis of appeals to the Staffing Appeal Boards. The appeal criteria are set out in the published staffing arrangements.<br/><br/>  Since September 2012 guidance counsellor provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. In this way principals have discretion to balance guidance needs with the pressures to provide subject choice. My Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations. All 195 second-level school in DEIS have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools (23:1 in fee-charging schools). There is no scope to reverse this budget measure.<br/><br/>  Guidance and counselling are a whole-school responsibility, with guidance counsellors playing their part within an overall team approach. The representative organisations for school principals and school management have developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation. Wherever possible, group work and class-based activity should be used to maximise the amount of time available for those pupils who are most in need of one-to-one support. <br/><br/>  In February my Department published a guide to developing student support teams in post-primary schools. This is an important resource for schools in promoting and protecting students' well-being and an aid to establishing a team or reviewing an existing team.<br/><br/>  Guidance counsellors have two distinct functions. The first is general career guidance and guidance on the educational opportunities a child or young person might pursue, while the second involves support for students' well-being. The principal and leadership of a school have the best knowledge and experience to determine how exactly guidance resources and teaching resources should be allocated.<br/><br/>  It should be noted that there has been no overall reduction to the level of investment being provided to support children with special educational needs in our schools. On the contrary, the number of SNA and Resource Teaching posts being allocated to support children with special educational needs has increased in recent years to reflect demographic growth and increased demand in this area.<br/><br/>  This Government has been resolutely committed to protecting, and in some instances increasing, the level of investment being made to support children with special educational needs at a time when there has been a requirement to make expenditure reductions across a range of areas. It is an area of spending which has been prioritised above most other areas by this Government, despite the enormous pressures on all areas of public spending.<br/><br/>  Some &euro;1.37 billion will be spent in support of children with Special Educational Needs this year, which represents approximately 15% of my Department's budget.<br/><br/>  365 new Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts and 480 resource teaching posts have been provided to support children with special educational needs in schools in 2015, bringing the total number of SNAs available for allocation in 2015 to 11,330 posts and the total number of resource teaching posts to 6,705. Over 11,000 resource and learning support teaching posts are now available. This is the highest level of SNA and resource teaching allocations that we have ever had, and will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.<br/><br/>  With regard to the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, a number of sections have been commenced, including those establishing the National Council for Special Education and those promoting an inclusive approach to education of children.<br/><br/>  The NCSE report on 'Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools' which was published in 2013 and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie, recommends that the EPSEN Act be fully implemented as soon as possible. The report also states that the NCSE recognises that the current economic climate makes it unlikely that the Government will be able to implement this recommendation in the short to medium term.<br/><br/>  It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.<br/><br/>  With regard to the proposed new model of allocation, the Deputy will be aware that last week I announced that I am not proposing to change the way teachers are allocated to schools for children with Special Educational Needs for the coming school year.<br/><br/>  In making this decision to retain the current model for allocating resource and learning support teachers for the coming year, I have been guided by the advice of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Working Group report, which recommended that sufficient time should be allowed for further consultation totake place with the education stakeholders before the new model is implemented in schools. <br/><br/>  Through consultations which have already taken place, there was a broad welcome for the proposed new model from Parents, disability groups, schools and stakeholders. However, while there has been significant consultation in relation to the proposed new model, there has not been sufficient time to address fully all of the concerns which have been raised, particularly those concerns relating to the profiling of schools, in advance the September 2015 school year. <br/><br/>  In particular, a robust mechanism for identifying children with complex special educational needs has yet to be finalised. Similarly it will be important to ensure that the concerns that successful schools continue to receive appropriate levels of support to ensure that their successes can be maintained are addressed.<br/><br/>  The proposed new allocation model was developed following advice received from the NCSE which indicated that the current model which requires that there is a formal assessment and diagnosis in place before an allocation is provided is unfair. The advice recommended removing diagnosis as a prerequisite for receiving support. The NCSE working group provided additional advice recommending that providing support to schools based on their educational profile was the best way currently available to ensure that schools would be able to support all children with special educational needs who needed such support. <br/><br/>  While the proposed new model is not proceeding for the coming year, work will continue in the coming months to develop the proposed new allocation model and to address the range of concerns which were identified through the consultations which have taken place so far, including the manner in which school profiles are developed. <br/><br/>  I have asked my Department to design a pilot of the new model which schools could opt into on a voluntary basis.<br/><br/>Continuing consultation with stakeholders will be a vital part of the ongoing work.</p></reply>

As a result of the review, qualification allowances were abolished with effect from 1st February 2012. Department of Education and Skills Circular 0008/2013 outlines the effect of this decision on teachers. <br/><br/>  In Paragraph 12 of Circular 0008/2013 an exception is made in the case &quot;where as at 5 December 2011, a teacher in employment on that date and eligible for receipt of a qualification allowance in respect of the post they held on that date, was actively undertaking a course of further study leading to an additional qualification, provided that the teacher does not cease to be a registered student on that course before its completion. Such individuals may apply to the Department/VEC (now ETB) as appropriate for a derogation from the general position within 3 months of the date of receipt of the award.&quot; Teachers who were not in employment in an Oireachtas funded post on 5 December 2011 and not eligible for receipt of a qualification allowance in respect of any teaching post on that date, do not qualify for payment of an allowance in respect of the qualification related to the course being undertaken at that time.<br/><br/>  The issues raised by the Deputy have been brought to the Teachers' Conciliation Council (TCC) by representatives of the teachers concerned and it would therefore not be appropriate to comment further until the issues have been deliberated on by that forum. The TCC is part of the scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for Teachers, the purpose of which is to provide a means of dealing with claims and proposals relating to the salaries and terms and conditions of teachers. The Council is composed of representatives of the teacher representative bodies, school management, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and is chaired by an official of the Labour Relations Commission.</p></reply>

The ban proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels in Dublin.  As well as bringing air quality levels into compliance with the then EU standards, the ban also had the effect of significantly improving human health in the capital: research indicates that the ban in Dublin has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths. The ban was subsequently extended to other urban areas.</p>  <p>  In August 2012, following a public consultation process, new solid fuel regulations (S.I. No. 326 of 2012) were introduced with the aim of ensuring that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of certain residential solid fuels. The ban now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide, including all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people, bringing the ban areas broadly into line with national EPA air quality management zones.</p>  <p>  While my Department keeps the matter under regular review, I have no immediate plans at present to extend the ban to new towns.</p></reply>

I am pleased to be in a position to increase that funding by some 10% in 2015 to &euro;40.4 million; individual allocations to local authorities will be made shortly.<br/><br/>Funding in the total amount of &euro;654,876 was made available to Sligo in 2014 for the grant schemes.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.  While my Department and Irish Water are in regular engagement in relation to future capital investment, it is a matter for the CER to approve charges in respect of the provision of a service connection to or in respect of a premises.</p>  <p>  In its decision on Irish Water's Water Charges Plan, published in October 2014, the CER stated that, until it made a decision on Irish Water's new connection charges, Irish Water should continue to apply rates equivalent to the water and wastewater related development levies which were applied by the local authorities at 31 December 2013.</p>  <p>  The CER is currently working with Irish Water to develop a high level work plan for the year ahead and this will include the new approach to connection charges. This plan will be published in the coming weeks. A more detailed work plan outlining the consultation schedule will be published later this year. The CER has informed my Department that it will consult widely with stakeholders when considering any submission from Irish Water, and that there will be many opportunities for interested parties, including my Department, to participate in the consultations on the new connection charging policy.</p>  <p>  I am not aware of any letters received in my Department from local authority chief executives regarding the new connection fees for Irish Water.</p></reply>

While the specific details of the contribution towards the achievement of these targets to be made by each Member State remain to be defined, the Council agreed that all Member States will participate in this effort, balancing considerations of fairness and solidarity.</p>  <p>  The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and in the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015, published last month.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050. Proposed statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015. </p>  <p>  In anticipation of enactment of the planned legislation, work is already underway on developing a low-carbon plan - the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures within the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050. I am satisfied that Ireland is on course to comply with the annual mitigation targets under the 2009 EU Effort-Sharing Decision (406/2009/EC) in the first half of the 2013-2020 compliance period. However, there will be a significant compliance challenge in the years 2017-2020 and therefore the first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address this particular challenge in the years 2017 to 2020 but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that. It is also important to note that the Bill published last month will provide for long-term successive planning in this respect. </p>  <p>  2015 will also be a pivotal year in terms of the international response to climate change, with all 196 Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) working to conclude a new global agreement in Paris in December. The Paris outcome will build on existing agreements and chart a course for future global emissions reductions. Ireland, through the EU, will play its part in these negotiations and the globally agreed act ions arising. The October 2014 European Council commitment will be the basis of the EU's intended nationally-determined contribution to the new agreement.</p></reply>

This was not a compensation scheme, but rather a proactive incentivisation scheme to trial approaches to farming for conservation in some of Ireland's most important biodiversity areas, where there were no specifically targeted measures in national agri-environment schemes. Eleven types of NPWS Farm Plan Scheme were implemented.<br/><br/>A total of 728 NPWS Farm Plans were approved, typically of a 5-year duration. Of these, 376 were for Hen Harrier, which applied in the Special Protection Areas outlined in Table 1 below.<br/><br/>The general scheme was closed to new applicants in April 2010 and my Department is honouring contracted commitments to the end of the 5-year period.

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.<br/><br/>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades.  Approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.<br/><br/>A public consultation on a national high speed coverage map 2016 which was launched last November, closed on the 12th February. 27 submissions have been received to date and will be assessed over the coming weeks.  The map will continue to be available at .  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016.  The AMBER areas show the target areas for the State intervention. <br/><br/>The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises or home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. <br/><br/>Based on information provided by commercial operators, Newtown, Enfield, Co. Kildare will be 100% covered by the State intervention. Individual residents should check the map for themselves to establish precisely where their own house or premises is located. <br/><br/>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30 Mbps will also be delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.<br/><br/>In tandem with the mapping consultation, intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy. The strategy will address a range of issues in relation to the intervention including the optimum procurement model, ownership model for the infrastructure, affordability and likely market impact.<br/><br/>Following a public consultation process on the draft intervention strategyduring the summer, I hope to move to formal procurement phase towards the end of this year in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders. <br/><br/>The Department will design a tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost of the network build as low as possible. I hope that the first homes and businesses will be connected in 2016 and connections will continue thereafter, with the intention of having all premises connected within a 5 year period. <br/><br/>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government. It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland.</p></reply>

This was not a compensation scheme, but rather a proactive incentivisation scheme to trial approaches to farming for conservation in some of Ireland's most important biodiversity areas, where there were no specifically targeted measures in national agri-environment schemes. Eleven types of NPWS Farm Plan Scheme were implemented.<br/><br/>A total of 728 NPWS Farm Plans were approved, typically of a 5-year duration. Of these, 376 were for Hen Harrier, which applied in the Special Protection Areas outlined in Table 1 below.<br/><br/>The general scheme was closed to new applicants in April 2010 and my Department is honouring contracted commitments to the end of the 5-year period.  As of this date, 120 NPWS plans remain active, of which 76 relate to the protection of the Hen Harrier.<br/><br/>Of the total expenditure of &euro;24.7m incurred on the NPWS Farm Plan Scheme, over &euro;14m has been spent from 2008 to date for the protection of the Hen Harrier. The information sought in terms of financial breakdown per designated site and county is not readily available and its compilation would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work, which would be difficult to justify. <br/><br/><i>Table 1: NPWS Hen Harrier Farm Plans</i><table><tr><th>Designation Code</th><th>Designation Name</th><th>County</th><th>Number of Plans</th></tr><tr><td>004160</td><td>Slieve Bloom Mountains</td><td>Laois, Offaly</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>004161</td><td>Stack's to Mullaghareirk Mountains, West Limerick Hills and Mount Eagle</td><td>Cork, Kerry, Limerick</td><td>193</td></tr><tr><td>004162</td><td>Mullaghanish to Musheramore Mountains</td><td>Cork</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>004165</td><td>Slievefelim to Silvermines Mountains</td><td>Limerick, Tipperary</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td>004167</td><td>Slieve Beagh</td><td>Monaghan</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>004168</td><td>Sieve Aughty Mountains</td><td>Galway, Clare</td><td>116</td></tr></table></p></reply>
