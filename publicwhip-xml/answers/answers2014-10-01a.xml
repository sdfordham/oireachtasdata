The total Exchequer allocation for this in 2014 is &euro;23m. Subhead D5 funding is the grant given annually to the Irish Sports Council to fund a wide range of programmes aimed at increasing participation and raising standards in Irish sport and to fund National Governing Bodies of sport to enable them to develop their sport in a strategic manner. The total Exchequer allocation for the Irish Sports Council in 2014 is &euro;42.5m.</p><p>  It is important to note that these programmes are only part-funded by the Lottery and that the remaining expenditure comes from general Exchequer funding.  In addition, the Revised Estimates do not specify the precise amount of National Lottery funding in each individual subhead.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.    </p><p>  On 23 January this year, my Department announced the &euro;331.9m investment programme for regional and local roads. From this allocation, Waterford County Council was allocated &euro;7.5m in funding and Waterford City Council was allocated &euro;1.36m for regional and local roads. These grants are mainly focused on the maintenance of the existing road network and it is open to Waterford Council to include the rehabilitation of public roadways and footpaths within housing estates when prioritising its works programme each year.</p><p>  In May this year, an additional &euro;43 million in Stimulus funding was announced for road maintenance by Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform. The purpose of the additional Stimulus money announced in May is to allow local authorities and the National Roads Authority to enhance their road maintenance and improvement work programmes this year. Waterford County Council was allocated a further &euro;547,437 (&euro;314,237 for Restoration Improvement works and &euro;233,200 under the Community Involvement Scheme).  Waterford City Council also benefitted, receiving an additional &euro;69,051 for road maintenance under the Stimulus funding. Again it was open to the Council to allocate some of these monies towards road rehabilitation works within housing estates.</p><p>  All available funding for this year has now been allocated and no further funding is available.  It is a matter for the local authority concerned to prioritise works and to select projects that are in line with available resources. </p></reply>

The  2010 business case for DART Underground is currently being updated and will be based on the latest data on population, transport demand, construction costs etc.</p><p>  The NTA have advised me that the DART Underground report and the outcome from the Fingal/North Dublin Transport Study and the preliminary Business Case for the BRT to Swords will be available by early next year.  </p><p>  Following receipt and assessment of the reports I will then consider the options and priorities for addressing key public transport deficits in the GDA having regard to the costs and benefits and affordability of each project as well as funding sources and options including private funds, EIB loans and EU grants. </p><p>  Significant additional Exchequer resources will be required to advance any new major project irrespective of the availability of private or EU funds. With existing funding levels the key priority is to protect investment made to date and to maintain safety standards. If additional funds become available, there will be many competing projects from all transport modes in all regions.  </p><p>  I will prioritise any additional funds for projects for which there is a clear need, which are affordable, have a sound business case and add value to existing infrastructure. I would expect that there will be public transport projects in the Dublin region which will meet these criteria if funds are available.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-01a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014100100068#WRA01200"><p>As the Deputy will know, there is a key distinction in EU policy on emissions between those covered by the Emissions Trading Scheme, which I will refer to as the ETS, and those not covered by the ETS.      </p><p>  Transport, excluding commercial airlines, forms part of the non-ETS sector along with households, energy, and agriculture.  In the non-ETS sector, it is the responsibility of each Member State to achieve the allocated reduction in emissions and the overall target for the EU as a whole is a reduction of 10% by 2020, compared to 2005.  By comparison, Ireland's commitment is ambitious with a reduction target of 20% in non-ETS emissions by 2020.</p><p>  This context is important because, as Minister, a key role for me is to ensure that the transport sector is well positioned to make a cost effective contribution towards this 20% target along with agriculture, energy and the built environment.</p><p>  I am under no illusion about the challenges involved in meeting this target and, to rise to the challenge, the Government is putting in place a low-carbon development strategy to ensure that Ireland can effectively and equitably underpin an effective transition to a low-carbon future by 2050.  The Government has developed a Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill, which sets out proposed statutory obligations in relation to the development of a National Low Carbon Roadmap, incorporating sectoral roadmaps. The purpose of the road-mapping process will be to set out a pragmatic and holistic approach aimed at pursuing and achieving transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy in the period up to and including 2050.  My Department is required to develop a sectoral roadmap for transport and that process is well underway.</p><p>  In relation to Electric Cars or EVs, my Department fully supports the underlying technology and the potential for EVs to contribute to significant emissions reductions. 644 EVs have been registered between 2010 and the end of August this year.  Similarly, biofuels have a significant role to play and will be central to achieving the 10% renewable energy target for transport by 2020.  However, in terms of promoting EVs and biofuels, that policy rests with Minister Alex White and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  I will be working closely with Minister White to ensure that our sectoral roadmaps are suitably aligned in terms of policy and ambition so that they can be seamlessly drawn together when constructing the overall national low carbon roadmap to 2050. My colleague Minister Alan Kelly and the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government expect to go to extensive public consultation on the national low carbon roadmap in 2015.</p></reply>

The Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and my Department is now working with the NRA, local authorities, the Garda&iacute;, and the Road Safety Authority to implement its recommendations.<br/><br/>Much background work has since been undertaken in developing new regulations, guidelines and standards with new signage expected to appear on public roads towards the end of this year. In addition, local authorities and the NRA will be asked to carry out a complete inventory and audit of speed limits as well as to carry out a comprehensive update of speed limits throughout the country. The goal is to ensure that the speed limits on any given road are a fair reflection of the road conditions.<br/><br/>As the Review was undertaken by a voluntary committee, any costs arising were minimal. However, costs will arise from the removal and replacement of a number of speed limit signs and it is envisaged that these will be catered for within existing budgets.<br/><br/>Finally, I understand that it is not currently proposed to alter the speed limits on the M50 or N7 Naas dual carriageway as the existing speed limits are considered appropriate for the roads in question.</p></reply>

The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.     </p><p>  A pilot &euro;10.6m Community Involvement Scheme (CIS) for works on regional and local roads was started in 2013.  The Scheme was successful in allowing local authorities to carry out with community support maintenance work on more lightly trafficked roads which could not otherwise be done.</p><p>  Following the success of the scheme in 2013 the scheme is being continued in 2014 with additional funding of &euro;12.4m. made available this year for the scheme including monies provided under the Government's May Stimulus plan.</p><p>  Local authorities were asked to put forward suitable schemes in line with the scheme criteria earlier this year. The proposals received from the local authorities were then reviewed by my Department and allocations made taking into account the amount of funding available.  Where a project does not go ahead, local authorities are allowed to substitute an alternative suitable scheme but the decision on which schemes to recommend rests with the local authority.  The promoters of this scheme should, therefore, continue to liaise with the local authority.</p><p>  A decision on the continuation of the scheme in 2015 will be made as part of the overall grant programme assessment.</p></reply>

The implementation of the provisions is a matter for the Courts Service and my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p><p>  In addition, under section 40 of the 1961 Act, a Garda may demand production of a driving licence and, under Section 60 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, may seize such licence where the member has reasonable grounds for believing that the individual has been disqualified.</p><p>  Where a person reaches the penalty point threshold of 12 points, or 7 points or more for first time learner permit holders from 1 August 2014, a notification issues to the person informing them that they must surrender their driving licence to the National Driver Licensing Service (NDLS). In addition to this notification, a notice is issued to the licensing authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na informing them of each individual penalty point disqualification to ensure that they are aware of the disqualification as well as the driver.</p><p>  It is a matter for the Road Safety Authority, as the licensing authority to ensure that those drivers who have been disqualified surrender their licence to the NDLS.  I will however ensure that this matter be considered in the context of the Penalty Points working group with a view to ensuring that the most effective arrangements are put in place to ensure that all licences are surrendered. I have also forwarded the Deputy's question to the RSA and have asked it to respond to the Deputy directly with regard to the actions it is taking to ensure that drivers who have been disqualified surrender their licences.  I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response has not been received within ten days.</p></reply>

This represented an increase of almost 14% or 17,300 extra jobs since 2012.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland estimates that total tourism employment is approximately 200,000 and could grow by 6,000 - 8,000 this year based on current trends.</p><p>  In terms of measures to generate further growth in the sector, an extensive promotional programme is continuing with a view to further growing visitor numbers to Ireland. The year to date has been very encouraging and overall sentiment for travel to Ireland is largely positive. Tourism Ireland is currently finalising its marketing plans for 2015 which I am scheduled to launch on 1st December.</p><p>  In view of the ongoing work of the tourism agencies, increased air access to Ireland and other measures already introduced by this Government such as the 9% VAT rate for tourism services, the reduction of the air travel tax to zero and the joint visa initiative between Ireland and the United Kingdom, I am confident that the prospects for Irish tourism remain positive.</p></reply>

Earlier this year regulations were introduced which permit smaller and less expensive WAVs to operate, and arrangements were put in place to permit holders of standard taxi licences to exchange those licences for wheelchair accessible taxi licences and avail of a longer operating age.<br/><br/>Furthermore, a &euro;1 million grant scheme is currently being administered by the NTA to support the wider availability of WAVs. Under the scheme grants of up to &euro;10,000 are available for the purchase or conversion of a new WAV, with a sliding scale of grant amounts for older cars. Further details of the scheme and its conditions are available on the NTA's website .<br/><br/>The Department is committed to seeking to ensure that public transport, including taxis, is accessible to persons with disabilities, and improvements to taxi accessibility are being progressed in line with the Department's Sectoral Plan - <i>Transport Access for All </i>- under the Disability Act 2005. <br/><br/>In relation to the use of companies with high levels of WAVs for public and Departmental contracts, this is a wider public procurement issue that goes beyond the remit of the NTA. However, I will keep under review, in consultation with the NTA whether initiatives such as this may be necessary or appropriate to seek to increase the proportion of WAVs in the fleet.</p></reply>

The Report of the Panel built on the 2013 Labour Court recommendations and the summary of a draft funding proposal put forward by the Trustee in February this year.</p><p>  The IASS Trustee and the principal employers have recently issued documents in respect of the proposed changes in pension arrangements.  These communications mark the commencement of the formal consultation process which the Trustee is required by the Pensions Act 1990 to undertake in respect of the reductions in benefits that it is proposing.  Each member will also shortly receive a personalised illustration of future pension benefits.  All members have been invited to send their views on the proposals to the IASS Trustee by 27 October 2014.  The target date for implementation of the proposals remains 31 December 2014.</p><p>  Huge efforts have been put in by all concerned over many years in an attempt to resolve the scheme's funding problems.  A set of clear proposals has now been put forward which offer the best chance to resolve the long-standing problems of the scheme and resolve members&rsquo; uncertainties about their future pension entitlements.  I would urge all parties to accept them.</p><p>  On the basis that the trustee decides to proceed with changes to the IAS scheme following the consultation process which is underway, I will sign the Ministerial Orders enabling the IAS scheme trustees to amend the scheme.</p></reply>

JobsPlus is biased in favour of those who are longer term unemployed. It provides employers with two levels of payment: &euro;7,500 over two years where a jobseeker is recruited following 12-24 months on the live register and &euro;10,000 for those on the live register for more than 24 months. The subsidy is paid in monthly instalments over a two year period provided the employment is maintained. The objectives of JobsPlus are focussed on supporting the longer term jobseeker into work.  A person on a one parent family payment is not considered eligible and I have no proposals to change the criteria.</p><p>  Since its launch in July 2013 to the end of September 2014, JobsPlus has supported 2,999 jobseekers in full-time employment with 2,272 employers nationally.

The Government is conscious that child benefit is an important source of income for all families. Child benefit is paid to around 616,000 families in respect of some 1.17 million children, with an estimated expenditure of around &euro;1.9 billion in 2014. Child benefit as a &ldquo;universal&rdquo; payment is paid in respect of all qualified children up to the age of 16 years.  The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education or who have a disability. </p><p>  Budget 2009 provided for the reduction of the age for which child benefit is paid from under 19 years of age to under 18 years of age. This measure was implemented in full in 2011 and has resulted in savings of &euro;79 million on an annual basis.  A value for money review of child income supports, published by the Department of Social Protection in 2010, found that the participation pattern of children in education supports the 18 year age limit for child benefit. I have no immediate plans to make any changes to the age threshold for child benefit. Furthermore, any changes to the eligibility criteria for child benefit could only be decided in a Budgetary context. </p><p>  Families on low incomes can avail of a number of provisions to social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including through the payment of qualified child increases (QCIs) on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement (FIS).  Furthermore, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, which provides a one-off payment to assist families on social welfare and health service executive payments with the extra costs when children start school each autumn, is payable in respect of young people aged 18-22 who are in second-level education.  These payments provide a level of assistance which is directly or indirectly linked with a household&rsquo;s income situation.

There are currently in excess of 780,000 customers with direct eligibility. </p><p>  The Department appreciates the important role that free travel plays in promoting social inclusion and preventing the isolation of elderly people. All of the schemes operated by this Department, including free travel, were examined in the context of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and continue to be kept under review given the on-going need for savings. The Review continues to inform decisions in relation to future spending while striving to ensure that priority is given to the elderly and disabled. </p><p>  Under the programme for National Recovery 2011-2014 introduced by the previous Government, expenditure on the free travel scheme was frozen at 2010 levels for the duration of the plan leaving a provision for the scheme of &euro;77 million per annum. As a result of this, the Department is not in a position to consider new applications or indeed requests from existing operators for increased payments under the Scheme. </p><p>  However, given the increasing number of recipients and the funding pressures, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I have established a working group with representatives from the two Departments, as well as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the National Transport Authority to review the free travel scheme. The work of this group is expected to conclude shortly.</p></reply>

However, it is expected that a number of these Programmes will meet ESF eligibility criteria and they have been included in the Youth Employment Initiative application for Ireland.  This will permit EU funding to be drawn down in respect of expenditure in 2014 and 2015 to a level that should enable the full YEI allocation for Ireland of &euro;68.145 million in current prices (with a further similar amount in ESF funding) to be taken up over those two years.<br/><br/>The Department of Social Protection (DSP) proposes to claim &euro;41.4m ESF and &euro;35m YEI over the period 2014-2020 under the relevant ESF and YEI Operational Programmes. These claims will be submitted under arrangements with the Department of Education and Skills (DES) who are the certifying authority for the EU.<br/><br/>The DSP schemes covered are T&uacute;s, JobBridge, JobsPlus and Back to Work Enterprise Allowance Schemes.  Expenditure relating to clients on these schemes who are under 25s will be claimed for both the ESF and YEI i.e. for every &euro;300 of eligible expenditure submitted, &euro;100 ESF and &euro;100 YEI (i.e. ⅔) will refunded by the European Commission.<br/><br/>The DSP Youth Guarantee schemes that will attract co-funding under the ESF Operational Programme 2014-2020 are:<br/><br/><b>Table 1: ESF Funding for DSP Schemes</b><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><table><tr><th><b>-</b></th><th><b>Intermediate Body</b></th><th><b>Activity Total for ESF</b><br /><br /><b>&euro;m</b></th><th><b>Total for YEI</b><b><sup>1</sup></b><br /><br /><b>&euro;m</b></th><th><b>Total Matching Funding</b><br /><br /><b>&euro;m</b></th><th><b>Activity Total Funding 2014-2020</b><br /><br /><b>&euro;m</b></th></tr><tr><td>Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA)</td><td>DSP</td><td><div>3.094</div></td><td><div>3.094</div></td><td><div>3.094</div></td><td><div>9.282</div></td></tr><tr><td>JobsPlus Incentive Scheme</td><td>DSP</td><td><div>3.333</div></td><td><div>3.333</div></td><td><div>3.333</div></td><td><div>10.0</div></td></tr><tr><td>TUS</td><td>DSP</td><td><div>10.6</div></td><td><div>10.6</div></td><td><div>10.6</div></td><td><div>31.8</div></td></tr><tr><td>JobBridge Internship scheme</td><td>DSP</td><td><div>18.0</div></td><td><div>18.0</div></td><td><div>18.0</div></td><td><div>54.0</div></td></tr></table><sup>1</sup>Other schemes under the Youth Employment Initiative are: Youthreach (DES), Garda Youth Diversion Projects (DJE), Young Persons Probation projects (DJE), Social Inclusion and Activation Programme (DECLG) and Momentum (DES). <br/><br/>Taking existing and planned provision together, table 2 below sets out our original estimates of programme uptake by young people in 2014, with associated programme costs that were published in Ireland&rsquo;s Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan in January of this year. However, these estimates are likely to be revised downwards significantly at the end of the year given that the full rollout of several programmes have been contingent on the passing of enabling legislation which only came into effect over the summer and has therefore considerably reduced the 2014 inflow into Youth Guarantee related schemes.<br/><br/>It should also be noted that the figures shown in table 2 reflect partial costs only as they are set out in the format of the Irish public expenditure estimates. As noted in the footnote to the table, for example, the costs for the Back to Education Allowance scheme relate only to the income supports offered to unemployed people taking up an approved education course. They do not include the cost of the education programme itself, which in most cases is also funded by the exchequer. These figures also exclude the likely costs of additional caseworker resources to be devoted to young people as a result of the new procedures described in Section 2 of Ireland&rsquo;s Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan. The exact level of resources involved remains to be determined in the light of early experience with the new procedures.<br/><br/>Estimates for the projected 2015 inflow and associated costs will only be available after Budget 2015.<br/><br/><b>Table 2: Expected participation, activation programmes, 2014</b><br/><br/><br/><br/><table><tr><th><b>Programme</b></th><th><b>Average participation</b></th><th><b>Inflow of new participants</b></th><th><b>Expected inflow</b><br /><br /><b>of young people</b></th><th><b>Indicative 2014 cost of youth provision (&euro;million)</b></th></tr><tr><td>Youthreach/CTC</td><td>6,000</td><td>3,300</td><td>3,300</td><td>110.0</td></tr><tr><td>JobBridge (including planned reserve)</td><td>7,700</td><td>13,300</td><td>5,000</td><td>27.0</td></tr><tr><td>Tus</td><td>7,500</td><td>7,500</td><td>1,000</td><td>15.9</td></tr><tr><td>JobsPlus</td><td>4,000</td><td>2,000</td><td>1,500</td><td>4.5</td></tr><tr><td>Momentum*</td><td>6,500</td><td>6,500</td><td>2,000</td><td>6.1</td></tr><tr><td>BTEA (excl Momentum)**</td><td>18,500</td><td>9,300</td><td>3,300</td><td>60.0</td></tr><tr><td>BTWEA</td><td>11,000</td><td>5,500</td><td>200</td><td>4.1</td></tr><tr><td>VTOS</td><td>5,600</td><td>2,800</td><td>500</td><td>14.3</td></tr><tr><td>FAS/Solas</td><td>10,300</td><td>25,000</td><td>9,500</td><td>72.0</td></tr><tr><td>CEB youth Entrepreneurship Training and Mentoring supports</td><td></td><td>700</td><td>700</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>CEB/MFI micro-loans for young people</td><td></td><td>150</td><td>150</td><td>2.5</td></tr><tr><td>International Work Experience and Training</td><td>250</td><td>250</td><td>250</td><td>2.5</td></tr><tr><td>Gateway</td><td>3,000</td><td>3,000</td><td>450</td><td>2.5</td></tr><tr><td>Community Employment</td><td>25,300</td><td>12,700</td><td>500</td><td>14.0</td></tr><tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td><b>105,650</b></td><td><b>92,000</b></td><td><b>28,350</b></td><td>336.4</td></tr><tr><td><b>Memorandum items:</b><br /><br /><b>PLCs</b><br /><br /><b>Apprenticeship</b></td><td><b>35,000</b><br /><br /><b>8,000</b></td><td><b>32,000</b><br /><br /><b>2,500</b></td><td><b></b><br /><br /><b>22,000</b><br /><br /><b>2,000</b></td><td>117.0<br /><br />75.0</td></tr><tr><td><b>Vocational Third Level</b></td><td><b>-</b></td><td><b>It is estimated that at least 50% of the 41,000 entrants to third level each year are entering courses leading towards defined occupations</b></td><td><b>-</b></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><b>Overall total</b></td><td><b>-</b></td><td><b>-</b></td><td><b>-</b></td><td>528.4<br /><br />(excluding vocational third level)</td></tr></table>*Excludes income maintenance costs tentatively estimated at &euro;10 million.<br/><br/>** Includes only income maintenance costs; most provision cost included in data for PLCs and Third Level under memorandum items </p></reply>

FIS is designed both to prevent child and family poverty and to offer a financial incentive to move from welfare to work. FIS is paid to some 44,000 families in respect of some 97,000 children. Expenditure on FIS for 2014 is estimated to be of the order of &euro;280 million.<br/><br/>An integral part of FIS is that once the level of payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the person remains in full-time employment. A key advantage of this approach, which is unique to the FIS scheme, is that claimants can be certain that they will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period. This certainty provides a real incentive to workers with families to avail of employment opportunities and to maximise their earnings from work.<br/><br/>The <i>Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016</i>contains a commitment to introduce measures to assist low income families by improve the system of child income supports in Budget 2015 such that those moving from welfare to work will retain payments for children to ensure that people are better off in work. Any decisions in this regard are a matter for Government to consider  in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 73,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.  </p><p>  The rent supplement assessment provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase.  Where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes. </p><p>  Rent supplement is not payable where a person or spouse/partner is in full time employment of 30 hours or more per week. However, a person on rent supplement who is deemed by a local authority to be eligible to participate in the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) may engage in full-time employment, subject to satisfying the standard means test, and may still be paid rent supplement. </p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to transfer responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need to local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Officials of the Department are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, in introducing HAP on a phased basis, initially in Cork County, Limerick City and County and Waterford City and County from 15th September 2014. Under the HAP scheme, recipients will pay a differential rent to the local authority allowing them to take up full-time employment, while still receiving housing support.</p></reply>

I would point out that Schedule 1 does provide a VAT exemption for the promotion of, and admission to, live theatrical or musical performances where food or drink is not provided during the performances.  It would appear that the admission fees to most feiseanna would benefit from this VAT exemption.</p></reply>

The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (DoECLG) wrote to Kerry County Council indicating that, based on the estimate submitted by the Council to that Department, up to &euro;1,226,920 was being made available to the Council via the OPW to undertake the necessary repair works to damaged coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure.    </p><p>  The estimates submitted by Kerry County Council to the DoECLG included for strengthening works at Incherea, Glenbeigh and both repair and strengthening works at Cromane Lower. However, strengthening works fall outside of the scope of the Government Decision. Only the repair element of projects such as that at Cromane Lower are covered under the allocation. The programme of works the Council submitted to the OPW detailing how it proposes to spend the total allocation of &euro;1,226,920 included an amount of &euro;30,000 for repairs to a coastal embankment at Cromane Lower. This programme is approved and it is a matter for the Council to progress these works.   </p><p>  The Council will need to address, in conjunction where appropriate with the local communities, the strengthening works at Cromane Lower and Incherea separately and outside of the current process aimed at repairs and emergency works either by utilising its own resources for this purpose or through an application for funding to the OPW under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  Applications by the Council to the OPW for funding for works that fall outside of the storm damage funding envelope will be considered having regard to the relevant eligibility criteria and the overall availability of funds for flood risk management.</p></reply>

No legal costs have been incurred by my Department to-date in respect of this case. Such costs are generally borne by the Chief State Solicitors Office and are a matter for that body.<br/><br/><b>With regard to the case in question, the media coverage of the legal settlement with Mr Fleury to-date has contained significant inaccuracies in relation to the nature of the settlement, which included a confidentiality clause binding both parties not to divulge the details of the settlement. While respecting the confidentiality clause, I want to stress that it did</b>not provide for any compensation whatsoever to be paid to Mr Fleury. Furthermore, I can confirm that the Department&rsquo;s costs in the Fleury case will be a small fraction of the exaggerated figure mentioned in the press coverage.<br/><br/>I want to emphasise also that the investigation into the Fleury case by the Department had no bearing on the actual settlement of the case. The settlement was agreed only following an approach by Mr Fleury&rsquo;s legal team<b>seeking a </b>comprehensive<b>settlement to the outstanding legal issues between him and the Department. </b><b>It is also relevant to note that</b>the Department secured a conviction in 2001 against GVM Exports Ltd, <b>in which Mr Fleury held 50% ownership and was a Director, in respect of offences detected in the course of this investigation.</b><br/><br/><b>The substance of the Fleury case relates to events in 1999 </b><font color="#222222">at a time when Bovine Brucellosis was causing great hardship to the farming community and imposing significant costs on the Exchequer. It</font><b>resulted from an investigation by the Department into the illegal movement of cattle in breach of the TB and Brucellosis eradication schemes. Following the investigation, normal legal procedures were followed involving the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the Courts Service and resulted in Mr Fleury and GVM Exports Ltd being charged with offences relating to the illegal movement of cattle (i.e. without a pre-movement Brucellosis test) and other offences relating to animal identification.</b><br/><br/><b>The prosecution of the case was delayed for a </b>considerable period of time over the years, largely due to challenges to the prosecutions initiated by Mr. Fleury, some of which were the subject of Supreme Court rulings, the most recent in December 2013. While the Court ruled in substance against all of his challenges, Mr Fleury had recently mounted further legal challenges to the re-activation of the prosecution and it was in this context that Mr Fleury&rsquo;s legal team sought a settlement.</p></reply>

The charges related to the alleged interference with the TB test. The investigation in this case was a joint investigation between my Department and the Gardai. Following the investigation, a file was submitted to the DPP who directed that certain charges be pursued. This case was heard before the Circuit Court.On the eighth day of the trial, the presiding Judge terminated the trial, and directed that Mr Fannin be acquitted, criticising the prosecution and the Department in particular. The key factor in concluding the trial appears to relate to confusion concerning the presentation of certain evidence, whether or not a brucellosis test had been carried out at the time of the TB test in March 2009, and the significance of this. However, this matter was not part of the Book of Evidence or the submitted prosecution case.</font><br/><br/><font color="#222222">  </font><font color="#222222">I initiated an internal review into how this particular case was handled within my Department. The position is that the report finds no evidence that Department staff sought in any way to mislead the court - a most serious inference carried in some commentary on the subject. A number of recommendations were made with regard to staff training, file preparation and to review current procedures of making available biological sample evidence to the defence. These recommendations are being examined currently. My Department has decided to release the report in redacted form but this decision has been appealed by a third party to the Information Commissioner.</font><br/><br/><font color="#222222">  </font>Earlier this year, I initiated a review of the investigation capability of my Department in the context of ensuring that the significant investment being made in the sector in meeting its expansion plans under Food Harvest 2020 would not be put at risk by failures to meet legal obligations which might undermine Ireland&rsquo;s excellent reputation for food safety and meeting the highest standards of food production. This is also vital to supporting and protecting an industry that is vital to the national economy. The outcome of the review was presented to me on 8 July when I decided on the establishment of a new Investigations Division. <br/><br/>The new arrangement brings all investigation capability, both internal and external, into one Division. It is up and running since July and is headed by a Senior Superintending Veterinary Officer, supported by a team of investigators, some of whom are core members of the team and others to be drawn from areas where their expertise will be beneficial to the conduct of particular types of investigations. A particular feature of the new arrangement is the governance that now surrounds the conduct of Departmental investigations. The new Investigations Division reports to an Investigations Steering Group chaired by the Assistant Secretary General responsible for Corporate Affairs and will comprise the Chief Veterinary Officer, the Assistant Secretary General with responsibility for direct payments, and the Heads of Legal Services, Internal Audit and HR. This group will, in all new cases, determine whether matters should be referred back to the relevant inspection areas of the Department for follow through, whether an investigation is warranted and if so, whether this should be conducted by the Investigations Division or referred to the Garda Siochana. This new Investigations Division includes the functions previously undertaken by the Special Investigations Unit.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I want to formally acknowledge the dedication and commitment of the staff of my Department who carry out investigations in sometimes very challenging circumstances, a fact I experienced first-hand last year when dealing with the equine DNA investigation which was conducted by my officers in a highly pressurised environment where their focus and sense of purpose was highly visible and extremely successful.</p></reply>

This includes two 'informal' meetings of Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs.</p><p>  My predecessor, Mr Alan Shatter T.D., was represented at the 'informal' meeting on 23-24 January by senior officials of the Department of Justice and Equality.  He attended the formal Council meeting of 3-4 March.  Since my appointment as Minister on 8 May 2014 there has been one formal JHA Council meeting on 5-6 June which I attended. I was represented by senior officials of my Department at the 'informal' Council meeting of 8-9 July.</p><p>  As regards attendance at meetings of the Council's Dapix working group, the position is that officials of my Department have attended 12 meetings since 1 January 2014 (8-10 January; 20-21 January; 18-20 February; 12-13 March; 31 March-1 April; 10-11 April; 7-8 May; 14-15 May; 12 June; 10-11 July; 11-12 September; 30 September). As regards progress made in finalising the Regulation since the end of the Irish Presidency, the position is that while many of the Regulation's chapters have been discussed in detail, limited progress has been made towards achieving a general approach which would permit the opening of formal trilogue negotiations with the European Parliament.</p><p>  At the June 2014 JHA Council meeting, the Hellenic Presidency achieved broad agreement on the contents of Chapter 5 of the Regulation, i.e. provisions concerning the transfer of personal data to third countries and international organisations.  However this agreement was reached on the understanding that &quot;nothing is agreed until everything is agreed&quot;.  It does not therefore provide a basis for engaging in trilogue discussions with the European Parliament because further adjustments may be required in order to take account of agreements reached at a later stage on other chapters. The current Italian Presidency is hopeful that a similar level of agreement can be reached at next week's JHA Council meeting in relation to Chapter 4 of the Regulation which determines the compliance obligations on companies and other bodies which process personal data.  While discussions at official level in relation to Chapter 4 are continuing, I am hopeful that Justice Ministers will be in a position to reach broad agreement on the contents of Chapter 4 at next week's meeting.</p></reply>

A number of people covered by funding arrangements which preceded the Scheme are also covered by this funding. However, &euro;23m has been transferred from the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to provide additional community services, with a view to allowing more older people to be supported in their own homes and communities for longer. This reorientation is in line with both Government policy and with the expressed wishes of older people.  The target in the HSE's Service Plan 2014 is for 22,061 persons to be in receipt of financial support for long-term nursing home care by year end.  </p><p>  The HSE operates a national placement list for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to enable it to operate within budget. All applicants who are approved for funding are put on the placement list in chronological order by the date of determination of their application, and funding issues to applicants in this chronological order to ensure equity nationally.  Funding is released by the HSE on a weekly basis to ensure those on the placement list receive it as soon as possible.  Currently, the average waiting time on the placement list following funding approval is 15 weeks. As of the 24th September there are 2,007 on the placement list awaiting funding release.</p><p>  Funding for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will be considered in the context of the Estimates Process 2015, which is currently underway. The funding that  becomes available must be balanced across all of the various service areas in a way that achieves the best possible outcomes for the greatest number of service users and prioritises areas of greatest need as far as possible.</p></reply>

The HSE can only award medical cards in accordance with the legislation and, therefore, it must assess applicants on the overall financial situation of the applicant and his or her dependants. </p><p>  All medical cards are subject to a periodic review of eligibility to determine continuing eligibility. The Deputy will be aware that each person who has eligibility to a medical or GP visit card receives a plastic card on which a &ldquo;valid to&rdquo; date is printed.  This is the latest date that a review may be conducted in respect of that person.  Notwithstanding the &ldquo;valid to&rdquo; date printed on the card, the HSE reserves the right to review eligibility, at any time, and take appropriate action in circumstances where the cardholder does not establish that he/she continues to fulfil  the criteria for eligibility under the Medical Card / GP Visit Card National Assessment Guidelines.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the gross income limits for an over-70s medical card were revised with effect from 1st January 2014 under the Health (Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) (No. 2) Act 2013.  The HSE is required to identify those persons who no longer have full eligibility as a result of this change in eligibility criteria, and, in place of the medical card, issue a GP visit card to those with gross income up to &euro;700 (single person)/&euro;1,400 (couple) per week.  While a person's income and medical circumstances may not have changed, he/she would lose eligibility for the over -70s medical card if gross income is in excess of &euro;500 (single person)/&euro;900 (couple) per week. </p><p>  It is HSE policy to extend the eligibility  for a reasonable period of time until the review is carried out and a final decision made on the person's continuing eligibility, once there is appropriate communication from the individual. Medical card holders who genuinely engage with the review of their medical card eligibility will not have their eligibility withdrawn before that review is complete. </p></reply>

The Act provides, inter alia, for the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and the enhancement of their high standards of professional education and competencies. The Department of Health is responsible for oversight of the governance of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI). The Department has no role in setting or approving registration fees.</p><p>  The Board is an independent body, answerable to the Oireachtas, with the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all its legal obligations.  The cost of enacting the additional requirements under the Nurses and Midwives Act 20141 was set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis that was carried out prior to the enactment of the legislation.  These costs include an enhanced regulatory process with supporting systems for continued professional development and certain education and training requirements for the professions.</p><p>  It was also made clear at the time of the legislation that the Board would continue to be self-funding and needed to plan and cost how it would fulfil its legal obligations.  Following detailed negotiations with the Executive and Board members in 2013 it was agreed in October 2013 that an initial once-off sum of &euro;1.6m would be granted by the Department to the Board to cover 2013/2014 costs, but that the Board would have to increase its income in 2015 to undertake its commitments in the legislation.  The Board of the NMBI made the decision to increase the annual registration fee at its meeting on 17th September, 2014.  A helpline, email address and website information page have been made available by the NMBI to provide clarification for registrants who may have queries on this matter.</p></reply>

As the pay of mental health staff nurses is slightly higher than general staff nurses the pay of graduate mental health nurses participating in the Programme is correspondingly higher than graduate general nurses.

Section 6A provides that persons born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years proceeding their birth.</p><p>  The 2004 amendment of the Act made particular provision for nationals of EU member States, who may make a declaration concerning their residence in the island of Ireland within the four years preceding their children&rsquo;s birth. In such cases, the EU national is regarded as having resided in the island of Ireland for the declared purposes of the Act, unless the contrary is proved. It is a requirement in passport applications that these declarations are supported by verifiable evidence (i.e. tax and social welfare documents, bank statements, utility/ phone bills) of the person&rsquo;s residence in the state. Two items of such evidence are generally required.</p><p>  The applicant&rsquo;s parents are Romanian. Romania entered the EU on 01 January 2007. Prior to 01 January 2012 there were restrictions on Romanian nationals in the labor market. Consequently, the Department of Justice and Equality have advised that work permits are required for Romanian nationals who entered Ireland after 01 January 2007, in addition to the standard documentation required.</p><p>  This restriction to the Irish labor market, which was dropped from 01 January 2012, meant that these nationals, if employed as workers, required work permits in order for their residence in the State to be considered legal and thus reckonable for the purpose of Section 6A of the Act. This is particularly relevant in terms of demonstration of the entitlements of the applicant to Irish citizenship and thereby to an Irish Passport.</p><p>  The applicant was born in this State in 2014. The applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship is governed by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended (the 1956 Act).  This Act was amended in 2004.  As the applicant&rsquo;s parents are Romanian citizens, section 6A of the 1956 Act requires that at least one of them has to be lawfully resident in the State for three of the four years preceding their child&rsquo;s date of birth.  Moreover, section 6B(2) of the 1956 Act, makes particular provision for a parent who is an EU national, that a declaration of residence must be supported by the submission of the parent&rsquo;s relevant documentation such as EU passports, Tax documents, Irish drivers license etc.</p><p>  Upon receipt of a passport application for this minor, the applicant&rsquo;s father was notified that in order for his child to qualify for an Irish passport, it would be necessary to submit documentary evidence of his residence history in the State. As a Romanian national who was in employment in the State before 1 January 2012, the applicant&rsquo;s father was also required to submit a copy of the work permit issued to him by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment predating the evidence of employment submitted in support of his daughter&rsquo;s application.</p><p>   He was notified by the Department by letter on 17 July 2014 that the additional documentation was required to be submitted, in order for the Passport Office to progress the application.

However, it is customary at these meetings for Ministers to review work undertaken in the areas of North South cooperation, including by the North-South Bodies, since the preceding plenary meeting.</p><p>  It is likely that discussions will also touch on financial and economic matters, the shared interest North and South in EU issues including the new PEACE and INTERREG programmes, the North West Gateway Initiative, and, in the context of the St Andrews Agreement Review,  progress made on expanding the areas of North South cooperation and ongoing opportunities for further all-island cooperation, with the focus on those areas that promote economic recovery, job creation, the best use of tax-payers&rsquo; funds and the most effective delivery of public services.  I also expect a discussion to take place on the North South Consultative Forum.</p><p>  I am looking forward to the Plenary and to continuing to work with our Northern colleagues on the further development of North South cooperation.</p></reply>

Our policy on International Development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo;, clearly states our commitment to the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA), and to making further progress towards it when economic circumstances permit.  </p><p>  Despite the extremely difficult economic circumstances, we have successfully managed to stabilise the budget for development assistance over the past three years.  Since 2011 we have allocated in total over &euro;2.5 billion for ODA, providing &euro;657 million in 2011, &euro;629 million in 2012, and&euro;637 million in 2013.  For 2014 we will spend some &euro;600 million on ODA.  These are substantial allocations of public funds and represent a genuine investment on behalf of the Irish people in assisting those less fortunate than ourselves.  They are also clear evidence of the Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to the aid programme.</p><p>  The estimates process for Budget 2015 is now in its finals stages. As with allocations to all Government Departments, Budget 2015 allocations for ODA will be framed in the context of our policy commitments and the overall budgetary circumstances we face.  The final 2015 Budget allocation, which is ultimately a decision for Government, will be announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on 14 October next.  As I have repeatedly stated publicly, and in response to earlier Questions, I and the Minster for Foreign Affairs and Trade have made, and will continue to make, the strongest case possible for the allocation to the development assistance programme.</p></reply>

To support this objective, a paid internship has been in place in my Department&rsquo;s Conflict Resolution Unit since it was established. The internship, lasting 11-months, is designed to give a graduate in this area an opportunity to gain practical experience in policy development. As outlined in the role specification for the recent internship competition, candidates are required to have, inter alia, a strong interest in conflict resolution, as demonstrated by previous relevant experience, specialised studies or academic training. The role specification also indicated that a postgraduate degree with a focus on conflict resolution and/or peace and security would be desirable.</p><p>  All applications were carefully considered. Due to the large number of applicants and the high calibre of the applications received, it was necessary to confine the interview process to a number of candidates whose applications most closely matched the requirements of the position, as outlined in the role specification. Unsuccessful candidates were advised of this.</p><p>  Interest in conflict resolution demonstrated by experience may include voluntary, research, academic and extra-curricular activities. Paid work experience is not a requirement for this internship.</p></reply>

Among these are the establishment of a North South Consultative Forum, a Bill of Rights and an Irish Language Act. The Government&rsquo;s firm position is that these Agreements must be implemented in full.  The Agreements, as well as the principles and values underpinning them, are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s approach to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.<br/><br/>I welcome the report agreed at the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly plenary in Dublin on 31 March 2014<b></b>on the implementation of the Good Friday and St Andrew&rsquo;s Agreements and which calls on all parties to the Agreements &lsquo;<i>to maintain momentum to ensure that all outstanding provisions are implemented in their totality</i>&rsquo;.  <br/><br/>I continue to urge all the parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly to engage in constructive discussion with a view to reaching agreement on the substance of a Bill of Rights.  A Bill of Rights drawn up by agreement between the main parties of the Assembly could set out precisely and formally the rights underpinning a reconciled society in Northern Ireland. Officials of my Department keep in ongoing contact with representatives of civil society on the issue of a Bill of Rights. <br/><br/>In the St Andrews Agreement, the British government committed to introducing an Irish Language Act and to working with the Executive to enhance and protect the development of the Irish Language.  Since the restoration of the devolved Institutions on 8 May 2007, the question of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland is a devolved matter and is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive and in particular of the Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Ms. Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n MLA.  The Government continues to follow developments closely in relation to the proposed Act, as well as the overall enhancement and protection of the Irish Language in Northern Ireland. <br/><br/>The Good Friday Agreement also provided for the establishment of an independent Consultative Forum representative of civil society. The St Andrews Agreement provided further that the Northern Ireland Executive would support the establishment of an independent North/South Consultative Forum.  In September 2008, the Irish Government submitted proposals for the role, format, membership and operation of a North South Consultative Forum to the Executive for its consideration, and facilitated three consultative conferences, the most recent of which was in January 2011.  The Government awaits a response from the Executive.  The Taoiseach has raised the Forum at each Plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council he has attended and it is on the agenda for the forthcoming meeting on 3 October 2014.<br/><br/>I will continue to press the importance of implementing outstanding elements of the Agreements in my discussions with the British Government and Northern Ireland Executive.  Officials in my Department will continue to monitor these matters in their ongoing contacts with the Northern Ireland Office and officials of the Northern Ireland Executive.</p></reply>

Ireland co-sponsored the Resolution along with 103 other States, including all other EU member states.</p><p>  This Resolution takes a comprehensive, human rights compliant approach to tackling the foreign fighters problem in accordance with international law.  It highlights the need to tackle the underlying causes of radicalisation through community outreach initiatives, while at the same time focusing on strengthening legal and security measures.  This comprehensive strategy is very much in line with Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the issue.</p><p>  The terms of the Resolution are consistent with conclusions of a special meeting of the European Council on 30 August 2014 which called for accelerated implementation of a package of measures agreed in June 2013 concerning four priority areas: prevention of radicalisation, detection of suspicious travel, investigation and prosecution and cooperation with third countries.  The European Council will review this issue in December 2014. </p><p>  My colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality recently published new counter terrorism legislation - the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014.  When enacted, this legislation will create three new offences: public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism.  </p><p>  The Bill will complement existing 2005 legislation which already provides for the offences of hostage taking, terrorist bombing and terrorist financing.</p><p>  Enactment of the new Bill will mean that Ireland will have more comprehensive legislation in place in this area.  However, my Department, in consultation with other relevant Government Departments, will closely examine the Resolution to establish whether any further legislation may be required in order to ensure its full implementation in Ireland.</p></reply>

This included both existing families and families applying for the first time, amounting to some 75,000 families.</p><p>  This was a once-off scenario and Bus &Eacute;ireann advises that in future only those families applying for school transport for the first time will be obliged to register. This can be expected annually to be less than a fifth of the volume encountered this year.</p><p>  The introduction of a comprehensive new IT system particularly on the scale involved was likely to encounter some teething problems, and these were addressed promptly by Bus &Eacute;ireann when they arose, but the comparatively high level of necessary public interaction with the system at the same time further complicated matters in a unique set of circumstances.</p><p>  The dedicated help line provided assistance to families who had technical issues using the new system, and created more capacity for local school transport offices to address the more traditional questions that families have relating to the operation of school bus services in general such as ticketing enquiries, the availability of seats, and timetable queries.</p><p>  Even so, and although the level of public interaction was anticipated this year and additional staff, as well as a dedicated help line, were put in place by Bus &Eacute;ireann to handle related enquiries, it is acknowledged that some families still encountered difficulties.</p><p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann appreciates the patience and understanding shown by the families and sincerely regrets any inconvenience or hardship caused.</p><p>  Looking to the future it can be appreciated that the new School Transport online Application and Ticket Payment system affords greater convenience and transparency in school transport related interactions than ever before and will enable families to manage all aspects of their applications for school transport, including registration, amendments and payments, using contemporary online features.</p></reply>

In addition, since July 2008, schools allocated devolved funding for the provision of additional classroom accommodation must utilise this funding to construct a permanent structure where the need for the accommodation is long term, typically for a period in excess of three years.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that under my Department's Prefab Replacement Initiatives announced in 2012 and 2013, approval was given to 216 schools to replace 614 prefab units with permanent accommodation. Replacing prefabs is part of the Government's &euro;475 million education infrastructure plan for 2014. This has reduced the reliance on rented prefabs in schools.</p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the overall policy goal of my Department is to ensure the highest standard of permanent accommodation for all schools. In the context of a rapidly increasing school population, my Department's priority is to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place and in this regard, it is sometimes necessary to make use of temporary accommodation in order to meet the accommodation needs of schools. In that regard, it is not possible to indicate when it will be possible to replace all rented prefabs in schools as the delivery of major school projects required to meet demographic demand will be the main focus for capital investment in the coming years.</p></reply>

Where children have significant care needs whereby they may need additional support to be able to attend school, the NCSE may make an allocation of SNA support to the school to assist that child.<br/><br/>The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.<br/><br/>The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.<br/><br/>To date, the NCSE has allocated over 10,900 Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts to schools supporting students with special educational needs for the 2014/2015 school year. As the SNA allocation process is still ongoing, the exact numbers of SNAs and pupils being supported will become clear following the finalisation of enrolments of students in mainstream schools as at 30th September.<br/><br/>Should a school wish to make an application for additional SNA support for a child who was not previously considered for SNA support or who is due to enrol to a school, they may do so to the NCSE.<br/><br/>All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.<br/><br/>I will arrange for the Deputy's question to be forwarded to the NCSE for their direct reply to the Deputy in respect of information regarding the number of pupils supported by SNAs in the 2014/15 school year, in line with its role in the allocation of SNAs to schools.</p></reply>

There has also not been any reduction to the overall number of SNA posts which may be allocated to schools. On the contrary, the number of posts which may be allocated to schools increased from 10,575 posts to 10,965 posts for 2014.</p><p>  Once SNAs have been allocated to schools, the deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management.

It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>  The total number of Resource Teaching posts which the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) may allocate to schools to support children with special educational needs for the 2014/15 school year is presently set at 6,225 WTE posts. </p><p>  This is more posts than has ever previously been made available to the NCSE to allocate to schools and shows that there not been a reduction to the overall number of posts being allocated to schools for resource teaching support. The figure of 6,225 posts 2014/15 should be compared with 5745 posts for 2013/14, and 5265 posts for the 2012/13 school year.</p><p>  Over 35,000 pupils are being supported by resource teaching hours allocated to schools by the NCSE this year, while allocations are still being made to schools in respect of late applications.</p><p>  No reduction was made to the amount of resource teaching time allocated to schools, per pupil for either the 2014/15 or the 2013/14 school year.</p><p>  In order to provide an additional 15% allocation, to return the allocation rate for individual applications to the level which was in place at the 2010/11 year, based on the number of posts expected to be allocated to schools by the NCSE for the current school year, it is estimated that this would require an additional 1098 Resource teaching posts, at an initial teacher salary rate of &euro;49.4m per year.</p></reply>

This is the maximum allowable variation that can be applied by any local authority and is referred to as the &quot;local adjustment factor&quot; (LAF). The decision must be taken by resolution of the Council and must be notified to the Revenue Commissioners by 30 September in order to apply for the following year. As the LAF applies to one year only, the rates revert back to the basic rate in subsequent years at which stage the matter is considered afresh. <br/><br/>There are certain factors that local authorities are legislatively bound to take into account when deciding whether or not to vary their LPT rates for a given year (expected income &amp;amp; expenditure, accumulated assets and liabilities and the impact of any variation on their local area). The decision is not one that can be taken without considering the financial implications as it will have a direct impact on the level of funding available to local authorities and, therefore, on their ability to discharge their statutory responsibilities.<br/><br/>The Local Property Tax (Local Adjustment Factor) Regulations 2014 set out the process for local authorities who wish to vary their LPT base rates, including the factors that they must consider and the type of public consultation that they should undertake as part of that process. Guidance has also been issued to local authorities concerning matters relating to these Regulations: <br/><br/>The power to vary LPT rates has been given to local authorities to further increase their autonomy. Elected members are already responsible for finalising the annual budget of the local authority &ndash; it is a reserved function for them &ndash; and the power to vary LPT rates will enable them to directly influence the level of LPT income they have to meet their expenditure requirements in the future.</p></reply>

Section 5 of the Act provides that the shareholders of Irish Water are Ervia (formerly Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann), the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Finance.

This plan sets out the charges to be levied by Irish Water on customers in receipt of water services provided by it, including the unit price for water supply and wastewater. Full details are available on the CER&rsquo;s website ().<br/><br/>The Water Services Act 2013 assigned the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the water metering programme. Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that<i>, as the meter boxes are not sealed, it is possible for a customer to access the meter to verify readings if necessary. </i>Householders with a meter installed will be provided with a reading of their meter as part of their bill and any unusual usage patterns can be discussed with Irish Water if the householder is concerned.<br/><br/>Under the Water Services Acts 2007-2013, Irish Water may request its customers and certain specified persons or bodies, including the nister for Social Protection, to provide it with information so that the Company can perform its functions under these Acts. <br/><br/>In advance of the introduction of domestic water charges, the Government made certain decisions on 6 May 2014 relating to the structure of water charges including, inter alia, a free allowance per household and an additional free allowance for children on the same qualifying conditions as the Child Benefit payment from the Department of Social Protection. As these allowances are to be funded by Government, Irish Water needs to ensure it has the appropriate and sufficient information to reflect these entitlements. Irish Water is a specified body under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended by Section 20 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2014, and is therefore permitted to request PPS numbers to authenticate the identity of the person being provided with an allowance.<br/><br/>In relation to data protection issues, I refer to the reply to Questions Nos 550, 571, 580, 581, 587 and 594 of 30 September 2014. The position is unchanged.</p></reply>

This is what is known as Automatic Meter Reading (AMR). The AMR is dormant until the meter is read when it is activated only for the purpose of taking the meter read.  The meters used by Irish Water do not currently employ smart metering technology and therefore home display units are not compatible at present. However, the meters are capable of being integrated into a smart meter reading system, should that ever be required.</p><p>  Irish Water has procured meters and radio units that comply with all relevant European and international standards designed to protect the health and safety of customers and the public.   The water meters used emit significantly less electro-magnetic radiation than the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) limits (1,000 times less than the limit), producing 10,000 to 25,000 times less electro-magnetic radiation compared to a mobile phone.</p><p>  Meters will be read automatically and the information will be provided directly to customers in their bills. Any unusual usage patterns can be discussed with Irish Water if the householder is concerned. The meter boxes are not sealed and can be opened to allow the householder to verify the meter reading if necessary. Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that all the water meters in use by Irish Water comply with the Measuring Instruments Directive. In common with meters for other utility services, the meters will be the property of Irish Water who will be responsible for meter repair and maintenance. </p><p>  Irish Water is putting in place a number of facilities for customers who require special or priority services. This includes the compilation of a confidential special services register for customers who prefer to have some of the services adapted to suit their needs and a confidential priority services register for domestic customers who have a critical medical dependency on water. The special arrangements put in place for the visually impaired have been developed in consultation with the National Disability Association. Irish Water has also contacted all of its customers and asked that householders with disability, mobility or medical concerns to contact its call centre in advance of the meter installation so any additional support or advice can be arranged.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.<br/><br/>The proposed approach to charging was outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan which it submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act. The CER recently held a public consultation on this plan which covered a range of issues relating to water charges and included the proposed approach to the assessed charge . Yesterday, the CER issued a determination on the water charges plan and details and associated documentation are available on the CER website ().<br/><br/>In making its determination on the water charges plan, the CER had to take account of the decisions made by the Government on the funding model for Irish Water and a direction made under Section 42 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 in July 2014. This policy direction addressed a number of matters relating to domestic water charges including the provision of a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply and a free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as the child benefit allowance while customers with specific medical conditions which require increased water consumption will have their charges capped.<br/><br/>In its determination, the CER has decided that all customers will have their total water charges capped at the unmetered &ldquo;assessed charge&rdquo; for 9 months. The cap will apply from the start date of the next billing period after installation of the meter or 1 October 2014 , whichever is the later.<br/><br/>In addition to the above, the Government has agreed to put in place further affordability measures to assist pensioners, persons with disabilities, and carers who receive the Household Benefits Package. The conditions and administrative approach to this additional measure are being developed by the Department of Social Protection. There are no plans to provide additional allowances or affordability measures, other than those announced in the Government decision.</p></reply>

The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020.  Over-achievement in any one year can be used in any other year where there is under-achievement.  Furthermore, there are various other flexible mechanisms available to Member States to reach their targets such as Certified Emissions Reductions, that is, the unit of the Clean Development Mechanism as defined under the Kyoto Protocol, along with the inter-Member State trading of units. <br/><br/>The extent of the challenge posed by these emission reduction targets is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development and the General Scheme of the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill, both of which were published in April this year.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by the Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy.  Proposed statutory authority for the plans is set out in the General Scheme of the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill.<br/><br/>In anticipation of the planned legislation, work is already underway on developing a low-carbon plan - the National Low-Carbon Roadmap to 2050 - the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures and identify additional measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low-carbon transition agenda.  As I am satisfied that Ireland is on course to comply with the annual mitigation targets in the first half of the 2013 to 2020 compliance period, the immediate focus of the national low-carbon roadmapping process will be the compliance challenge in the years 2017 to 2020.<br/><br/>As Ireland intends to meet its greenhouse gas mitigation targets over the period to the year 2020, the issue of fines or penalties does not arise.</p></reply>

I am also advised that the SEAI has not, to date, derived speeds on a county by county basis for the 2013 SEAI wind atlas, but is considering the potential benefits and costs of a future project of this nature. <br/><br/>Set out below are the average annual windspeeds, obtained from the SEAI, for the proposed locations of the Oweninny and Cluddaun wind farm sites at hub heights of 50m, 75m, 100m and 125m, for both the 2003, and the newer 2013, SEAI wind atlases. The speeds are set out in metres per second, m/s. <br/><br/><b><i>2003 SEAI Wind Atlas</i></b><br/><br/><b>Oweninny:</b>50m: 8.3m/s 75m: 8.8m/s 100m: 9.1m/s 125m: not available for 2003 wind atlas<br/><br/><b>Cluddaun:</b>50m: 7.9m/s 75m: 8.7m/s 100m: 9.2m/s 125m: not available for 2003 wind atlas<br/><br/><b><i>New (2013) SEAI wind atlas</i></b><br/><br/><b>Oweninny:</b>50m: 6.3m/s 75m: 7.1m/s 100m: 7.7m/s 125m: 8.1m/s<br/><br/><b>Cluddaun:</b>50m: 7.3m/s 75m: 8m/s 100m: 8.55m/s 125m: 9m/s<br/><br/>Neither the 2013 nor the 2003 wind atlases directly provide the wind energy density at particular locations. The SEAI is currently considering whether the allocation of time and resources to a project of this nature would be worthwhile.</p></reply>

An integrated and co-ordinated transport system is an important consideration when it comes to future decisions on transport investment. In making decisions as to future expenditure, my Department has been active to ensure that a co-ordinated approach is taken and that we do not look at land, maritime or aviation transport in isolation from each other. In previous times, this was a legitimate criticism of transport investment but I believe that, in recent years, this has been addressed.     </p><p>  At a European level, my Department continues to actively engage with the Trans European Network for Transport (TEN-T) and to ensure it is integrated into Irish transport policy-making. The TEN-T regulations set out a multi-modal transport network across the European Union and aim to ensure integration between the various modes. This multi-modal EU policy is supported by domestic policy such as the new National Ports Policy launched by my predecessor, Minister Varadkar, in March 2013. For example, the National Ports Policy's designation of Shannon-Foynes, Dublin and Cork as Ports of National Significance (Tier One) and Rosslare Europort and Waterford as Ports of National Significance (Tier Two) mirror the TEN-T designations of these ports as Core and Comprehensive ports on the TEN-T network. These designations are then taken into account by the National Transport Authority and the National Roads Authority when decisions are being made in terms of future planning.</p><p>  Other policy work is ongoing in my Department and I expect to publish two significant new transport policy papers before the end of 2014. An aviation policy is now approaching completion while, in relation to land transport,  a draft strategic framework for investment in land transport has been published and is out for public consultation until mid-October. Both the framework for investment and the aviation policy will help clarify transport priorities and will help to ensure that there is appropriate co-ordination and integration between modes. In a similar vein, the National Transport Authority have a statutory remit to develop an integrated transport plan for the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) and they are currently in the process of completing their implementation plan for transport investment in the GDA for the period to 2018. </p><p>  A new Statement of Strategy for my Department is currently being drafted which will also include the issue of a co-ordinated and integrated transport sector. This must be submitted to the Minister within six months of his appointment.</p></reply>

It is accepted that they should be given the opportunity beyond 2014 to grow to a viable, self-sustaining position, particularly considering the contribution that they make to their regional and local economy. As a result, Exchequer supports for the four regional airports, where appropriate and in accordance with the 2014 EU Guidelines on State aid to airports and airlines, will continue beyond 2014. This decision will facilitate the airports in developing and implementing new business plans leading to self-sufficiency within a ten-year period. Central to these will be the need for regional and local business investment.     </p><p>  A framework (Regional Airports Programme 2015 &ndash; 2019) has also been prepared by my Department and  is currently with the EU Commission for approval. That framework should provide a level of certainty around support over a multi-annual period, where regional airports can provide a business plan leading to stand-alone commercial viability. It is envisaged that future funding post 2014 will ultimately be provided from a mix of local authority, local business and exchequer sources.</p></reply>

In relation to air services and connectivity the draft National Aviation Policy proposes that Ireland will continue to pursue a policy based on competition between at least two airlines with significant home bases in the Irish market as the best means of ensuring a competitive aviation sector and the widest possible range of services to and from Ireland.  In relation to the potential for a national air transport hub the draft policy proposes that Dublin airport will be promoted as a secondary hub airport and that the roles of Shannon and Cork airports as key tourism and business gateways for their regions will be supported.</p><p>  Submissions in response to the draft policy were invited up to the end of July. More than 70 have been received and these will be fully considered in finalising the National Aviation Policy.  It is my intention that the Policy will be finalised and adopted before the end of the year.</p></reply>

The most recent CSO figures for overseas visits to Ireland show that visitor numbers grew by 9.4% in the period from January to August 2014 when compared to the corresponding period of 2013. 2014 looks set to be the fourth consecutive year of growth in overseas visit numbers and the total number of international visitors coming to Ireland is likely to exceed 7 million this year.</p><p>  In view of the ongoing work of the tourism agencies, increased air access to Ireland and other measures already introduced by this Government such as the 9% VAT rate for tourism services, the reduction of the air travel tax to zero and the joint visa initiative between Ireland and the United Kingdom, I am confident that the prospects for Irish tourism remain positive.</p><p>  With regard to longer term priorities, I am currently completing a review of tourism policy, which is intended to set out the overall direction for tourism up to 2025.  A draft of the new Tourism Policy Statement was published by my predecessor in July.  I expect to publish the finalised Tourism Policy Statement in the coming weeks.</p></reply>
