I hope to be in a position to make an announcement shortly. I believe that this will demonstrate this Government's understanding of the value of sport from both an economic and health perspective.  Sports capital funding is essential for the provision of modern fit-for-purpose facilities that provide opportunities for people to participate in sporting activities throughout the country. The 2012 round of the SCP saw a record number of applicants, indicating a continuing high demand for such grants.</p><p>  A new portal has been developed on the Department's website which must be used by organisations to register, to apply for funding (when the Programme is open for applications) and to manage the drawdown of any new grants allocated after 2013.  Any interested organisation should register on   .</p></reply>

This has safety implications for other road users, residents and pedestrians. In addition by using local and regional roads instead of custom-built motorways, HGVs are adding to the wear and tear of the legacy roads network.   For this reason I asked the National Roads Authority (NRA) to examine at the feasibility of lifting tolls for heavy goods vehicles for one month on a number of motorways across the country, including the M1and M3, as a trial. The purpose of the trial on these routes was to see if HGV operators could be persuaded to use the motorways more by providing HGV operators with an opportunity to evaluate the time and efficiency benefits of using the motorways.</p><p>  As regards the traffic figures, the NRA informs me that HGV traffic in Slane was down 36% in the first half of November, and over 43% down in the second half. The second half figures may have been affected by some local road works. The NRA has said that this data is fully consistent with the their previous assessments that about 40% of HGV traffic in Slane was avoiding tolls on the M1 or M3. </p></reply>

A detailed study to evaluate the economic impact of The Gathering is being undertaken and it is hoped to have this complete by April. Of course, the Gathering was not just about visitor numbers and revenues.  It is also about community pride and strengthening links with the diaspora.  </p><p>  The Gathering helped to strengthen existing links with Irish communities abroad and create new connections.  Tourism Ireland will continue to work with the diaspora networks and will include these as part of its future promotional work overseas.  The networks and databases created through The Gathering will also remain as a valuable asset to Irish tourism.</p><p>  A number of Gathering-related events and festivals have already been identified as having potential to run again. Similarly, the success of the Emerald Isle Classic college football game, which was a key part of the Gathering campaign, is being built on with next year's game between Penn State &ndash; with the largest alumni association in the US - and the University of Central Florida in Croke Park.  </p><p>  The Gathering also made a vital contribution to the local community. The Gathering network provided extensive training to more than 2,500 people and these community engagement skills will endure and be available to support other local events.</p><p>  In terms of future policy, as the Deputy will be aware, my Department is currently undertaking a review of tourism policy. Following a detailed analysis of the responses received to the public consultation process, I plan to issue a draft tourism policy document and after a short period of consultation, to finalise the new policy by Easter 2014. The question of any future Gathering type initiatives can be considered in that context but for now, I have no such plans.  As in recent years, Failte Ireland will continue to run a Home Holidays Marketing Campaign to foster growth in the domestic market next year.</p></reply>

I am aware that F&aacute;ilte Ireland provides an estimated regional breakdown of overseas visits on an annual basis, based on research of its own as well as available CSO statistics. The most recent full year figures available are for 2012 and they show that there were 428,000 visitors to the North West in 2012 generating &euro;112.6 million in revenue. In addition there were 570,000 domestic visitors generating revenue of &euro;106 million. Further data is available, on a regional and county basis, in the research section of the F&aacute;ilte Ireland website under Regional Statistics and Reports. </p><p>  In regard to 2013 figures nationally, it is noteworthy that trips to Ireland for the first ten months of the year were up by 7.3% compared to the same period in 2012. This increase has benefitted all regions. I have asked F&aacute;ilte Ireland to provide the Deputy with whatever information they may have in regard to the number of tourists who visited the North West region to date in 2013. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p><p>  The promotion of tourism in regional areas is an operational matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland. That said, I can say that the main focus of the marketing effort overseas in 2014 will be the development and marketing of the Wild Atlantic Way, which extends along the whole West and North West coast. The allocation of &euro;8m towards the project in Budget 2014 will enable the installation of signage and the development of the discovery points along the 2,500km route.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-19a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900058#WRA01500"><p>The new national aviation policy will outline the actions to be taken by Government to help sustain and develop the aviation sector, in order to create jobs and facilitate business and tourism. A total of 74 submissions were received as part of the public consultation process that took place earlier this year. The number and quality of the submissions received is encouraging and demonstrates the strong interest there is in shaping future aviation policy.  The next step will be the publication of a draft National Aviation Policy Statement early in the New Year. There will be a further opportunity for stakeholder input at that point and I expect that the final policy document will be published in the first half of 2014.  A number of the submissions focused on the regional airports and the views expressed will be taken into account in the review process. The recently completed work of the Study Group on Ireland West Airport Knock will also provide input into the policy. </p><p>  This week the Report of the Study Group was brought to Government. I informed my colleagues that, mindful of the current financial position of the regional airports and of the valuable contribution they make, my Department now intends to develop a framework for approval by the EU Commission, in respect of State support for regional airports, for implementation at the end of the current programme of support (i.e. from 2015). It is envisaged that this new programme will run until 2025.</p><p>  In the case of capital expenditure (CAPEX), any Exchequer support, in line with EU guidelines, will be limited to safety and security related expenditure and require clear business plans and matching regional (Local Authorities and business) investment as well. The regional airports now need to develop business plans for their on-going sustainability and long-term sustainability without Exchequer support in line with EU State aid guidelines.  </p><p>  The Action Programme for Effective Local Government <i>Putting People First</i>   published in October 2012 focuses on the widening of the role of Local Government particularly in the context of supporting local and community development. The greater involvement by local authorities in the oversight of supports for regional airports would be consistent with the general direction of the Programme and I intend to engage with my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government on this matter.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-19a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900058#WRA01700"><p>The National Transport Authority (NTA) entered into separate contracts with the three CI&Eacute; companies for the provision of Public Service Obligation (PSO) services. Among other things,  the contracts set standards of operational performance and customer service and contain penalties for non-performance. The NTA monitors the contracted performance of each PSO operator on a quarterly basis and the reports are available on the NTA's website. If the Deputy has some specific instances of poor punctuality, I am happy to raise it with the NTA and the companies involved separately. </p><p>  The Government continues to provide substantial Exchequer investment in the public transport network despite the significant financial challenges.   Over the three years 2011-2013, the total Exchequer allocation to the three CIE companies, in respect of PSO services, free travel, school transport and capital expenditure, has been more than &euro;1.5 billion.  The priority must be to get a better return from the public transport system, through targeted investment, better use of existing resources and by using technology to make public transport more responsive and user friendly.</p><p>  My Department has also provided funds in both Dublin and the regional cities to promote sustainable travel including further developing bus lanes, improving rail and bus stations, bus stops and shelters and also to improve the accessibility of public transport. Through the NTA, my Department is also funding the use of smart technology to make public transport easier to access and more reliable for the user.  Significant progress has been made with the Leap card, Real Time Passenger Information, and the National Journey Planner which maps all public transport services across the country. The use of Wi-fi on trains and busses has also improved the transport experience. The NTA will continue to progress these consumer friendly initiatives which make using public transport more attractive. The public-transport experience has improved significantly and that is where we must target our efforts in future.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-19a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900058#WRA01900"><p>The core objective of National Ports Policy is to facilitate a competitive and effective market for maritime transport services. The long-term international trend in ports and shipping is toward increased consolidation of resources in order to achieve optimum efficiencies of scale. This has knock-on effects in terms of vessel size, the depths of water required at ports and the type and scale of port hinterland transport connections. The National Ports Policy aims to ensure that Ireland can adapt to these international trends.   Ports differ greatly in size, in current capability and future potential. The previous structure in place was a laissez-faire policy where &lsquo;one size fits all&rsquo;. This is no longer appropriate. As the Deputy will appreciate, treating Wicklow Port Company and Dublin Port Company as the same in legislative and policy terms is absurd.  At the core of the National Ports Policy was the introduction of a clear categorisation of the ports sector into: </p><p>- Ports of National Significance (Tier 1); </p><p>- Ports of National Significance (Tier 2); and </p><p>- Ports of Regional Significance.   </p><p>The purpose of this categorisation is to help provide clarity to the sector as to future developments and ensure that the goals of individual ports are aligned to those of their shareholder. It recognise reality rather than trying to create a new reality that does not exist. Therefore, the five ports that primarily have a national function and are responsible collectively for over 90% of all trade into and out of our ports, will remain under the shareholding of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. Ports that have a regional purpose, be it as regional transport hubs or in relation to maritime tourism, marine leisure or public amenity will be transferred to local authority control.</p><p>  Officials have commenced drafting proposals of the Heads of a new Ports Bill that will allow for Ports of Regional Significance to be transferred to local authority control. The officials have met with stakeholders including ports, local authorities and others to discuss the proposed transfer arrangements and they will continue to engage with stakeholders as drafting of the Heads progresses.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, Ports are self-financing and it is not intention that the transfer of any of these ports will adversely impact on any port's future developments. Indeed, the transfer is intended to strengthen future developments in the Ports of Regional Significance as they will now be clearly aligned with regional interests through local authority ownership. It is my experience that companies, be they state owned or private sector, that wish to raise finance need a robust, credible business case to convince potential investors that there will be a return on investment for them (i.e. that the revenues for any development will exceed the costs within a reasonable timeframe). Such a business case is a pre-requisite to securing investment and in its absence, anything else is an aside.</p><p>  In relation to other work on the National Ports Policy, a strategic review of Rosslare Europort has been completed and I expect to be able to make recommendations on the report very shortly. A review of New Ross Port Company within the context of National Ports Policy has also been completed and its conclusions have been accepted by the Company who have commenced implementation.</p></reply>

The assessment of specific projects required to meet current and future demand will, however, remain subject to detailed appraisal of the benefits and costs of each individual project.   Many issues shall be addressed in this investment framework. Future transport demand depends on a wide array of drivers, such as  projected demographic changes, land use and spatial patterns, employment levels, economic activity, the impact of climate and technological changes and indeed the levels of future car ownership. Work analysing historical investment levels in transport and trends in transport demand is complete and current work is focusing on assessing the broad impact of transport investment on the economy and on projecting future scenarios of transport demand. </p><p>  A steering group is guiding this work, and stakeholders and advisers such as Forfas have been involved in identifying strategic priorities to ensure that our transport system best facilitates economic growth and human needs. A public consultation on the framework will take place to ensure that wider stakeholder needs and concerns are fully addressed. It is hoped that the Framework will be completed in the first half of 2014.</p><p>  With regard to investment along the corridor in question I have received the NTA Implementation Plan to 2018 for the GDA,  for my approval. That Plan proposes a Bus Rapid Transit Scheme as an interim solution to the short term demand needs of the Swords/Airport  corridor. I am awaiting further details from the NTA on the proposal which I hope to receive in January but I believe the BRT option could offer a very feasible medium term solution to public transport demand on this important corridor.</p></reply>

I am aware that the NTA recently approved a range of fare increases.  It is, however, important to point out that significant savings can be made by passengers who choose to avail of the integrated ticket, the Leap card. In many cases, passengers will be paying fares that are below 2011 cash fares when using the Leap card.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the NTA's statutory responsibilities, the Government recognises the need for the CI&Eacute; companies to respond to the challenge of reduced PSO subvention funding, reduced fares income arising from reductions in passenger numbers and increased costs, such as fuel costs, which are outside their control.  It is important to remember that public transport remains heavily subsidised by the State and fares would be much higher if people had to bear the full cost of providing PSO services.</p><p>  The Board of CI&Eacute; is pursuing a number of measures to address the financial position, including cost reductions across the three operating companies.  Improved bank facilities have been agreed, which will ensure that the Group has sufficient funding into the future. Good progress has been made recently with cost savings agreed in Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus and passenger numbers have stabilised as the economy is recovering.  In our submission to the next comprehensive expenditure review, Minister Varadkar and I will be proposing that there be no further cuts to the PSO subvention from 2015.</p></reply>

Any changes to rail services provided under the PSO contract with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann require the approval of the NTA.  The NTA reviews on a regular basis Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s performance obligation under the PSO contract with the objective of continuously improving the delivery of rail services. Since the beginning of the Contract, performance obligation targets have either been revised upwards or reporting frequencies improved where it was considered appropriate to do so. Details of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s performance against its targets are published at regular intervals on the NTA website. The NTA is undertaking a national rail review at present in conjunction with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. This review is due to be completed in early 2014. The aim of the review is to better match service levels and service capacity with demand for travel.</p><p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has indicated that it is in the process of implementing new energy saving fleet utilisation initiatives on its DART and Intercity services to generate fuel savings, which will reduce fuel and maintenance costs by &euro;3.2m per annum. Concerns about overcrowding have been raised with the Chief Executive of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and I understand that the company has already responded and re-introduced larger carriages to accommodate passengers where this has been considered necessary.  The Chief Executive has agreed to continuous monitoring of carriage levels on both DART and Intercity services to ensure they match passenger demand. </p><p>  It should be noted that carriages were only reduced at off-peak times. Overcrowding on Dart services which has occurred at peak times was caused by other issues including technical faults, industrial relations and leaf falls. </p><p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has stated that full loading (involving standing by passengers) is the norm internationally on urban rail systems similar to Dart and Commuter services and can be safely accommodated.</p><p>  In the run-up to Christmas, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has boosted off-peak DART services from 2-carriage to 4-carriage, to cater for additional demand from Christmas shoppers and leisure travellers.  The company is also operating late night services on the two weekends before Christmas and on New Year&rsquo;s Eve. Specific weekend Intercity services are also being increased in size in the run-up to Christmas to address additional demand.</p><p>  The Railway Safety Commission (RSC) have received an increased number of public representations relating to crowding. The RSC will be monitoring crowding levels on Intercity trains in the coming weeks and the inspections will be unannounced.  They have already met with Irish Rail regarding DART services and are satisfied that corrective measures have and are being taken with regard to crowding on DART.</p></reply>

The future of Dun Laoghaire Harbour Company is not as a major freight or transport hub, but rather in maritime tourism, marine leisure and public amenity. In that regard, the most appropriate share-holding body is not the Department of Transport, but rather Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council. In order to facilitate this and other transfers, the current Harbours Acts 1996 - 2009 must be amended to provide the legislative framework to allow for later transfer by Ministerial Order.     </p><p>  My Department published a Regulatory Impact Analysis consultation document in August regarding these proposed amendments and requested submissions from a range of stakeholders. A copy of the document is available on my Department's website. The consultation process has now concluded and work is now well advanced in the drafting Heads of the proposed Bill. I expect to seek approval from Government in Quarter 1 of 2014 for the Heads of the Bill. Subsequent to Government approval, my Department will present the Heads to the Oireachtas Committee for their consideration.</p><p>  The future operational structures of the port companies concerned is primarily a matter for agreement between the relevant council and port company. Therefore, my Department has begun discussions with these stakeholders to identify the particular transfer arrangements appropriate in each case.  My Department will continue to engage with stakeholders as drafting of the legislation continues. If the Deputy has any suggestions in relation to the legislation that is being drafted, it will of course be given appropriate consideration.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for each local authority.</p><p>  The Irish Government supported the original decision by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) to approve the allocation of EU funding to the Narrow Water bridge project and committed an upfront funding contribution of &euro;3.9 million in January this year. The funding which was to be provided by my Department for the Narrow Water Bridge Project represented a significant commitment given the current financial circumstances. This funding contribution was due to be matched with a contribution from the Northern Ireland authorities in line with the agreed funding ratios for the Programme. </p><p>  The Government was disappointed that the tender process resulted in a doubling of the initial estimated cost budgeted for by the project partners for the construction of the bridge. The Government has indicated on many occasions that it would be willing to help to address the shortfall in funding for the Narrow Water Bridge, but this depended entirely on matching contributions from the other parties, including the Northern Ireland Executive. Also, we could not agree to be solely responsible for any further overruns.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, as part of the recovery programme that this Government has had to pursue to put the country back on its feet, unfortunately, there will be a further reduction in regional and local roads spending in 2014 of over &euro;60 million. Ultimately it is from this budget that any additional funding from this State would have had to come and we would not have been in a position to provide a further &euro;10 million towards this project as well as to underwrite any potential further overspend. The estimated figure of a requirement from my Department of &euro;10 million was based on correspondence received from SEPUB and Louth County Council. Given the significant difference between the initial estimates and the returned tender prices, the Deputy will  appreciate the need to take a conservative approach to the funding requests.</p><p>  The progression and importance of this project has been discussed with my government colleagues and on a number of occasions at the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) most recently on the 8th of November. The priority is to avoid the loss of the EU funding involved. </p><p>  It is important to note that there are time constraints with regard to the INTERREG funding. It has to be spent by 2015. SEUPB has now decided to withdraw the letter of offer and has indicated that it proposes to re-allocate the funding to eligible projects capable of being delivered before the end of 2015. I know that officials in my Department and the Department for Regional Development have identified possible replacement projects, that will benefit cross-border communication in the transport sector and are working up proposals for consideration by SEUPB.</p></reply>

At end October, the manufacturer informed my Department that an analysis had shown a microprocessor within the unit to be defective.  The manufacturer then issued a safety alert on 4 November advising all owners of the EPIRBs in question to undertake certain checks to confirm their equipment is working.</p><p>  Under EU Directives, Bureau Veritas is responsible for certifying the devices.  My Department is not the approval authority.  Nonetheless, adopting a concerned and active approach, a range of initiatives was undertaken.  My Department issued a Marine Notice on 11 November on the matter, the first country in the world to do so.  Following my direction, my Department wrote to over 3,300 registered EPIRB owners informing them of the Marine Notice and reminding them of the importance of periodic self-checks.  Advertisements were placed in the national press and will appear in the maritime press.</p><p>  My Department has notified the Paris MOU, the organisation governing Port State Control in Europe and Paris MOU has now notified its 27 Member States. My officials raised the matter at the EU's Safe Seas Committee, thereby informing the Commission and all EU Member States. My Department is in contact with the European Maritime Safety Agency, with the certifying body Bureau Veritas, with the French Administration, who authorised Bureau Veritas, and with the Australian Administration, as they are the State of Manufacture.  My Department will continue to examine EPIRBs on vessels as part of its normal surveying activities. </p></reply>

The Committee carried out a number of hearings on the matter and published detailed recommendations on the issues that should be included in the legislation.    Following this, in March of this year, the Government approved the drafting of a Regulation of Vehicle Immobilisation Bill 2013. The necessary legislation to give effect to this legislation is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. The outcome of this process will form the core of the Bill which I expect to publish early in 2014. Progress on the drafting of this legislation has not been as quick as was originally hoped given the complexity of legislation that deal with the rights of property owners. </p><p>  Under the principal provisions of the Bill, the National Transport Authority, as Regulator, will ensure the provision of adequate advisory signage in locations where clamping is in operation, set maximum clamp release periods and fees, and establish an independent appeals process. These provisions will apply to clamping activities on the public road, as well as on private property where the public has an explicit or implicit invitation to park.</p></reply>

For the ten month period between January and October, the number of overseas visits to Ireland increased by 7.3% to over 6 million.  Visits from North America were up 14.6%; visits from Mainland Europe were up 5.6% while visits from Great Britain were up 5.1% for the ten month period.  Due to the relatively small numbers involved, the CSO does not publish individual country breakdowns for other long-haul markets.  The Office does provide an overall figure however, and the number of visits from these markets increased by 14.4% compared by the same period in 2012.     </p><p>  Tourism Ireland is the agency with responsibility for the overseas marketing of the Island of Ireland as a holiday destination.  In terms of promoting Ireland in the areas specified, this year's activity includes arranging familiarisation visits for leading travel agents and tour operators from these markets and also cooperative campaigns with airlines and tour operators serving these regions.  The Visa Waiver introduced by Government under the Jobs Initiative has assisted greatly in facilitating more visits from those markets which are visa-required and in encouraging operators from those markets to include Ireland in their itineraries.  I launched the agency's 2014 marketing plans earlier this month and I know the agency will continue to work hard to put Ireland on the map in emerging markets.   </p><p>  With regard to tourism strategies for the medium to longer term, Tourism Ireland  is currently finalising its three year Corporate Plan to cover the 2014 -2017 period which will, inter alia, outline strategies for each of our main overseas tourism markets.  In addition, work on the tourism policy review is now progressing following completion of the first public consultation phase.  One of the issues raised in the public consultation document relates to Ireland's future priority markets/best prospects. </p></reply>

In accordance with the Irish Sports Council Act 1999, all members of the Council are appointed by the Minister.    </p><p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to elect a number of positions on the Irish Sports Council's Board.  It was envisaged that the sporting national governing bodies (NGBs) would elect a number of individuals to the board of the Irish Sports Council.  There is merit in this approach in terms of ensuring that the NGBs have a direct say in how the ISC operates and makes its decisions.  However against that, there are concerns about the appropriateness of having individuals elected to the ISC, the body which allocates funding to NGBs, by the NGBs themselves and the conflicts of interest that would arise.  In the light of corporate governance experience in recent years across the state sector, there is a strong argument to be made against having boards consisting of representative interests given the potential for conflicts of interests but rather to have all board members focused on the broader public interest and the remit of the state agency itself.   </p><p>  Both Minster Ring and I are currently considering this matter in the preparation of the draft Heads of the Sport Ireland Bill, which will provide for the establishment of a new body to replace the Irish Sports Council and the National Sports Campus Development Authority and will combine the relevant functions of the Council and the Authority.  Minister Ring will bring the Heads of Bill to Government for approval early in the New Year, following which the Heads of the Bill will be forwarded to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport for its consideration prior to drafting.    </p></reply>

Obviously the introduction of any such regime raises a number of issues and will require the input from a wide variety of government departments and agencies.  The group will need to take account of issues in relation to the Exchequer impact of a road charging regime, how it would work, the impact this will have on imports and exports, the technology involved in such a system, compliance with European legislation and how it would be enforced amongst other matters.    </p><p>  My Department will chair this group and preliminary discussions have already taken place between the parties involved.  The terms of reference are currently being completed and the group will begin its substantive work in January.  The group will report on the feasibility of a road charging regime by the middle of 2014 and following which a decision can be made on whether to implement such a system in Ireland.  If a decision is taken to implement such a regime, I will ensure that industry groups such as the Irish Road Haulage Association, the Irish Exporters Association, etc, are involved.  </p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is a matter for the local authority.    </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Donegal County Council applied to the Department in 2010 for funding under the Specific Improvement Grant Scheme for funds for the Cockhill Bridge Scheme. The projected cost of the project was &euro;2.95m. Given the costs associated with the project it was not possible to approve this application and no further formal funding application has been received by my Department.  Given the need to prioritise funding for repair and strengthening works, the Specific Improvement Grants Scheme is being suspended in 2014. While provision may continue to be made for bridge repair and rehabilitation works I understand that the Cockhill Bridge proposal as submitted in 2010 would be outside the scope of such works as it involves major widening works.  It is important to reiterate that the role of the Exchequer grant aid is to supplement Councils' own resource spending on regional and local roads.

Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic and consular network is comparatively modest in size and includes 56 Embassies, 7 multilateral Missions and 10 Consulates General and other offices. The size and deployment of the State&rsquo;s network of missions abroad is kept under ongoing review and any possible future reconfiguration would have regard to national priorities and available resources.  Those priorities include the State&rsquo;s strategic economic and political interests, including trade and inward investment, support for Irish exporters, and the promotion of our values as regards human rights, the role of international law and the peaceful settlement of disputes within and among states.   Total trade in goods between Ireland and Iran was &euro;66.4million in 2011, &euro;51.6million in 2012 and &euro;43million from January to September 2013. Comparable statistics on trade in services are not readily available. The total administrative cost of running the Embassy for 2011 was &euro;321,704. This figure includes all expenditure items charged to the Mission budget. Salaries and related costs of staff posted from Ireland are not included as they are a charge on the overall budget of the Department.</p></reply>

We are currently on track for the issuance of a similar number in 2013. Customers applying through the Passport Express service are given a commitment by the Passport Service that ten days from the date of receipt of properly completed applications, a passport will be issued.  Last year over 83% (428,000) of all persons applying for their passports in the State used Passport Express.   At present the turnaround time for passport express applications is 5 working days. However passport demand in Ireland is seasonal. Almost 50% of all passport applications are received in the four months April&ndash;July. Currently the passport service is receiving 8,000 applications a week. This contrasts with 19,000 applications per week in July. For this reason, as we advise applicants on the information note accompanying the form and our website, during the peak summer period application processing times for this service can lengthen. Therefore I strongly advise citizens who are planning to renew their passport in 2014 to do so in the off peak period. </p><p>  The minimum turnaround time for a passport is 3 working days. However every effort is made by the Passport Service to meet a travel date in cases of genuine emergency. Emergency passports are issued only in circumstances where the Passport Service is satisfied, on the basis of the application and supporting evidence, that: the proposed journey is related to the death, serious injury or illness abroad of a close relative or a medical emergency relating to the applicant him/herself and that the need to travel has arisen at short notice</p><p>  In 2013 the Passport Service moved from the very successful pilot to full implementation of the appointments service in the Molesworth Street office. This service allows customers to book, via a simple web based system, guaranteed time slots before travelling into the office. The public have responded very well to this and in particular are very welcoming of the fact that the need to queue has been eliminated. Priority in the system is given to those with urgent travel needs (travelling in 3-10 days) with the majority of appointments available to those who fit into this category. </p></reply>

I am firmly of the view that an Irish Language Act should be introduced in Northern Ireland.  All parties to the Good Friday Agreement recognised the importance of respect, understanding and tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity in Northern Ireland.     In the St Andrews Agreement, the British government committed to introducing an Irish Language Act and to working with the Northern Ireland Executive to enhance and protect the development of the Irish Language.  </p><p>  Since the restoration of the devolved Institutions on 8 May 2007, the question of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland has been a devolved matter and is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive and in particular the Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Ms. Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n MLA.</p><p>  Officials in my Department maintain regular and ongoing contact with the Irish language community in Northern Ireland including those involved in cross-community Irish language activity.    </p></reply>

On my regular visits to Northern Ireland, I continue the practice of engaging with civil society representatives.  In my address to the SDLP Party Conference in Armagh on 8 November, I reaffirmed the commitment of the Government, as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to realise its full potential, including through the creation of a Consultative Forum.  In my ongoing contacts with the Secretary of State I take the opportunity to discuss full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  With the Northern Ireland Executive, including in the context of the North South Ministerial Council, most recently on 8 November, the Government has continued to support the re-establishment of the Civic Forum as a valuable and, as yet, unimplemented provision of the Good Friday Agreement.        I welcome the recent consultations which Richard Haass, Independent Chair of the Panel of Parties, and Meghan O&rsquo;Sullivan, Independent Vice-Chair of the Panel of Parties, have undertaken with community groups and with representatives of wider civil society in order to ensure that their views and perspectives are considered in the context of the current Talks process. </p><p>  I hosted a Reconciliation Networking Forum event in Dublin Castle on 30 October 2013 for people who are involved in community, peace-building, public policy or reconciliation work, to discuss what civil society, including the community sector, can and should do to meet the reconciliation challenges ahead.   This is in line with the view of the Government that a strong and resilient civic society can play an important role in building a more reconciled and prosperous Northern Ireland.      </p></reply>

We had a full agenda addressing a wide range of issues. Conclusions were agreed across a number of key policy areas; the full text of these Conclusions may be accessed on the official EU website   .    In opening the Council meeting, High Representative (HR) Ashton briefed Ministers on the recent round of talks with Iran which she led in Geneva on 20-24 November, at which an interim agreement was reached on the difficult nuclear dossier. I took the opportunity to praise the efforts of HR Ashton in leading the negotiations within the framework of the E3 +3 (UK, France, Germany, Russia, China and the US). The agreement represents an important achievement, which opens up a real possibility of resolving this long running and dangerous issue.  Many challenges lie ahead in terms of implementing what was agreed, and translating it into a final agreement, but we welcome this important first step. Short Conclusions were adopted.</p><p>  A major focus of discussions at the Council meeting was the outcome of the recent Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius on 28-29 November, and in particular the decision by Ukraine not to proceed with signature of an Association Agreement with the European Union. HR Ashton reported back to Ministers on her recent visit to Kiev and condemned the use of violence against peaceful protesters.  We expressed our disappointment and deep concern about developments in Ukraine.  We agreed that the door remains open to Ukraine to sign the Association Agreement, together with a Deep and Comprehensive Free trade Agreement, but that the decision is one for Ukraine to make. </p><p>  The Council also considered EU relations with Russia, in light of the Eastern Partnership Summit and in advance of the EU-Russia Summit at the end of January. Ministers were joined at lunch by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, which provided an opportunity for a frank exchange of views. There are a number of areas on which we co-operate constructively with Russia, most recently in the context of the Iranian nuclear dossier, and efforts to destroy chemical weapons in Syria. However, concern was also expressed by Ministers over the pressure from Russia which seems to have led to Ukraine&rsquo;s decision to suspend the Association Agreement process with the EU. In my remarks, I also highlighted concerns relating to the human rights situation in Russia, and in particular the recent LGBTI-related legislation. The forthcoming EU-Russia Summit will provide a further opportunity to discuss these issues. </p><p>  The dramatic deterioration of the situation in the Central African Republic was also addressed by Ministers. Conclusions were adopted which emphasised the need to address the humanitarian situation and to support efforts to stabilise the situation. Ireland, along with other Member States, is increasingly troubled by reports of humanitarian suffering and of gross human rights abuses in the Central African Republic. In my intervention, I welcomed the leadership role being taken by the African Union force (MISCA) and France to date. However, we continue to believe that a UN-led response remains the best mechanism to address the crisis and restore law and order in the country.</p><p>  Ministers considered the latest developments in Syria, including prospects for the Geneva II conference in January, and the ongoing humanitarian crisis which is affecting not only Syria but also neighbouring countries. In particular we discussed Lebanon which has been severely impacted. Council Conclusions were adopted, which acknowledge the important role that Lebanon has played in welcoming refugees from Syria, and reiterate the EU&rsquo;s willingness to provide support to the country. </p><p>  There was a short discussion on the Middle East Peace Process. Council Conclusions were adopted which express support for both sides in their efforts to arrive at a negotiated solution, and confirm EU readiness to contribute substantially to post-conflict arrangements for ensuring the sustainability of a peace agreement. We expect to revisit this issue early in 2014. </p><p>  Finally, the Council had a brief review of developments in the Western Balkans region and in Myanmar/ Burma. Short Council Conclusions were adopted. </p></reply>

While important progress was made, Ukraine announced shortly before the Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius last month that it was suspending the preparations to sign the Agreement.  The decision has been met with protest demonstrations in Kiev and elsewhere.   While the process is now on hold, I would emphasise that the European Union&rsquo;s comprehensive and generous offer remains on the table. We do not believe that what has already been agreed should be renegotiated at this late stage.</p><p>We had an extensive discussion on the situation in Ukraine at the Foreign Affairs Council on 16 December and agreed on the urgent need for meaningful dialogue with all stakeholders to find a negotiated solution to the current political stalemate following the demonstrations.     High Representative Ashton reported to the Council on her visit to Kiev last week where she held talks with President Yanukovych and other government representatives, the opposition and civil society. She delivered the EU&rsquo;s main message, namely the urgent need for dialogue and respect of the right to peaceful protest. </p><p>After our meeting, High Representative Ashton reiterated the EU&rsquo;s readiness to sign the Association Agreement as soon as Ukraine is ready and the relevant conditions set by the Council last December have been met.   I fully agree with her that the Association Agreement offers the best way to address Ukraine&rsquo;s political and economic challenges and that it provides a blueprint for the requisite reforms.    This package was the most ambitious offer made to any partner by the EU. It was also one very much in the interests of Ukraine and its people in terms of the long term benefits it would bring.  Of course, ultimately it is a matter for Ukraine to decide freely what kind of engagement it wishes to have with the EU and it should be allowed to make its choice freely and without external pressure.   </p><p>  In the meantime, I have urged the Ukrainian government to fully abide by its international commitments to respect the rights to freedom of expression and assembly.  In the current very tense and fluid situation, it is incumbent on all sides to show the utmost restraint and I would stress the importance of dialogue to help reduce the tension and to try to find an agreed way forward.</p></reply>

This broadly provides that a person must be an Irish citizen and that his/her identity is known to the Minister for Foreign Affairs before a passport can issue to that person.  Section 6(2)(a) and (b) of the Act provides that:   &ldquo;(2) An application for the issue of a passport to a person shall be &ndash;<blockquote>  made in such form as may be specified by the Minister for that type of passport,<br /><br />  accompanied by such information and documents in relation to the person as the Minister may require under section 7, ...&rdquo;  </blockquote>  This legal provision underpins the information contained in the Application Form Notes that accompanies each application form.  It is long-standing passport policy for first-time applicants to require documents such original long-form civil birth certificates, photo-identity and proofs in regard to the use of the applicant&rsquo;s name and address.  </p><p>  The person in question is a first-time applicant and her application at this stage is practically complete save the requirement for photo-identity.

The series of checks and balances within that process embraces the standard principles, provided for in the Passports Act, of ensuring that the identity of the applicant is known and that the person in question is an Irish citizen.

Neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can require a company to change its rates or prohibit a company from doing so.  The decision to provide any specific form of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is based on the assessment an insurer will make of the risks involved. This risk assessment process which insurance companies apply is essential if a company is to be able to provide its services over the longer term and continue to remain solvent.</p><p>  I am aware of continuing strong competition within the insurance industry which should have an influence on limiting price increases and I have informed the industry that it must be a priority for  them to ensure that insurance cover is provided as competitively as possible consistent with long term commercial sustainability and viability.  There is a delicate balance to be struck between ensuring the long-term sustainability of the insurance industry and at the same time making sure that the consumer obtains good value for money.</p><p>  Consumer issues are covered by the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code which amongst other things sets out a series of general principles about how financial service firms (including all insurance companies) should interact with their customers. The Code, however, does not prohibit or restrict an insurance company from increasing its annual premium rates.</p><p>  In relation to RSA, the RSA Group has now injected a total of &euro;260m capital into RSA Insurance Ireland Limited (RSAII) in November and December. This capital support ensures that RSAII&rsquo;s solvency margin remains in excess of 200%. The Central Bank, as Regulator, remains in close and regular dialogue with RSAII.</p></reply>

The Special Liquidators have been tasked with obtaining an independent valuation of the loan assets of IBRC. The Special liquidators have appointed independent professional advisors who have employed standard valuation methodologies appropriate to each class of asset of IBRC to determine a valuation price. In arriving at the valuation the independent advisers have been advised to apply a discount rate of 4.5% in determining the present value of future cash flows of the asset in the case where a discounted cash flow valuation methodology is employed. Further, a discount of 2.32% will be applied to all loan asset valuations to take into account security and title issues associated with loan assets, to arrive at the Valuation Price. This process is the same for both performing and non-performing loans.</p><p>  There is an obligation on the Special Liquidators to ensure that the assets of IBRC are sold at a price that is equal to or in excess of the independent valuations that have been obtained. Should a bid not be received that is in excess of the independent valuation obtained, the loan asset will be acquired by NAMA.</p><p>  The sales process plan and timeline has been developed following professional advice and in light of requirements of a robust and credible sales process. The Special Liquidators have also corresponded with all IBRC borrowers providing them with an opportunity to make written representations on the method of disposal of their loans and the criteria for determining who may bid for loan assets. Consideration was given to Borrower representations and the Special Liquidators have responded to these Borrower representations.</p><p>  The IBRC loan books have been divided into portfolios and subsequently subdivided into tranches depending on the professional advice obtained for ensuring that the maximum value is obtained for the sale of the Loan Assets. There is no difference in the treatment of performing loans and non-performing loans. All loans are being valued and then sold.</p><p>  Last week we witnessed the successful conclusion of the bidding phase for the first portfolio of assets brought to the market by the Special Liquidators. Binding bids for the Evergreen portfolio consisting primarily of Irish corporate loans with a par value of c.&euro;2.5bn were received on Friday 6th December and the Special Liquidators expect that c.84% of the portfolio (by par value) will be sold to third parties at prices in excess of the independent valuations.</p><p>  The sales processes for the remaining portfolios in IBRC are on-going and are expected to be concluded in early 2014.</p></reply>

However, since July 2011 paper receipts are no longer issued in respect of tax payments.  This decision was taken on the basis that the vast majority of taxpayers conduct business with Revenue via its online service.  The online service facilitates direct access to payment information and therefore customers have no need for a paper receipt.  The change has resulted in significant cost savings in terms of postage, stationery and staff resources.  While customers who pay and file using the paper LPT Return do not receive manual receipts, they have evidence of payment through their own financial institution records.  This arrangement now also applies to LPT, and customers who file online receive an electronic acknowledgement and have ongoing access to their return and payment details.  The only exception in regard to paper receipts is where a person pays LPT online through the telephone Helpline 1890 200 255.  In such circumstances a paper acknowledgement issues within two weeks.</p><p>  I am also advised that where customers pay via third party payment services providers (An Post, Omnivend and Payzone) they receive receipts for each payment made.</p><p>  On the provision of LPT payment clearance in the context of property sales, I am informed that Revenue provides a &lsquo;look up&rsquo; facility to vendors or their representatives via online access to the relevant LPT return and payment details.</p><p>  This service, which is fully secure, provides solicitors/agents with instant access to the LPT data of clients.  The security aspect is controlled through the use of various access codes, which are provided to the solicitor/agent by Revenue (through the online system) or by the property owner.  Alternatively, the property owner can access his/her own LPT payment and return history and print copies of the details for the solicitor/agent.  Where the access codes are not readily available for any reason the property owner can contact the LPT Branch at 1890 200 255.</p><p>  I commend Revenue for providing this secure digital facility to enable the conveyancing process to proceed seamlessly.  When combined with Revenue&rsquo;s eStamping system, this provides a modern and secure digital platform to facilitate timely compliance with tax obligations arising as a result of the transfer of residential properties.  I strongly support Revenue&rsquo;s approach to eservices which is fully in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s digital strategy.</p><p>  Finally I am advised that comprehensive guidelines on LPT obligations in the context of property sales or transfers are available on the Revenue website.  Instructions for solicitors/agents on how to access the &lsquo;look up&rsquo; service are also available on the website at: <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>.</p></reply>

This publication shows an overall decline in the stock of principal dwelling houses (PDH) in arrears of one per cent relative to the end of June 2013 statistics. This is the first decrease in the outstanding balance since the Central Bank series began in September 2009.  In addition, early arrears have declined significantly during the reporting period with a quarter-on-quarter fall of six per cent.  This would appear to demonstrate some success by the lenders in addressing the accounts in early arrears and putting in place appropriate measures to prevent borrowers from going into arrears.  </p><p>  Separately from the Central Bank quarterly reports, a monthly reporting regime on mortgage restructures has been in place by my Department for the last three months (<i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>  ) This data, which represents approximately 90% of the mortgage market, shows a continuing decline in PDH mortgage arrears and an increase in the number of permanent restructures to address mortgages in difficulty. The recently published data by my Department, which is for the end of October, shows that the number of PDH mortgage accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days fell from 82,624 accounts in August to 80,854 at the end of October, a drop of 1,770 accounts in arrears.  </p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that Central Bank&rsquo;s Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) announced last March, set time bound and measurable targets for the main banks, requiring them to systematically address their arrears book.    This is a very important step to resolve the impasse in arrears.  The Central Bank required the main mortgage lenders to propose by end-June 2013 sustainable solutions to 20% of mortgages in arrears (over 90 days) and to 30% by the end of September, The target rises to 50% by the end of December 2013, 70% by end of March 2014 and to 75% by the end of June 2014.  The Central Bank is now also requiring banks to conclude sustainable solutions with 15% of their customers by the end of this year, with 25% by end March 2014 and 35% by end of June 2014. </p><p>  As part of this process, the Central Bank conducted an audit of the banks&rsquo; Quarter 2 proposed solutions which examined the banks&rsquo; processes of determining and proposing sustainable solutions against the Central Bank&rsquo;s sustainability guidelines. The Central Bank has informed me that a number of issues were identified in this audit and which will need to be addressed by the banks to ensure that the solutions being proposed are sustainable in the long term.  However, it also concluded that the issues arising did not result in any bank failing to reach the Quarter 2, 2013 target.  Lenders have also reported that they have met and exceeded the Q3 target. The Central Bank has advised me that audits will be on-going in 2014.</p><p>  The remaining key elements of the mortgage arrears resolution strategy are also now in place.  For example, the new insolvency options provided for in the Personal Insolvency Act are now fully available to debtors; the mortgage advisory function is fully operational, and, following a recent review may be enhanced; the mortgage to rent scheme is also operational.</p><p>  Therefore the overall elements of the framework for dealing with mortgage distress are now in place. Banks should continue to deal with this issue in a structured and proactive manner through engagement with their borrowers and in alignment with the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets set by the Central Bank.</p></reply>

The BRRD proposal provides a common framework of rules and powers to help EU countries manage arrangements to deal with failing banks at national level as well as cross-border banks, whilst preserving essential bank operations and minimising taxpayers' exposure to losses.   </p><p>  There are three pillars to the BRRD framework to facilitate a range of appropriate actions by authorities:</p><p><b><i>- Preparatory and preventative measures</i></b>   including reinforced supervision and robust recovery and resolution planning for major institutions;</p><p><b><i>- Early intervention</i></b>   which would include supervisory powers and implementing recovery plans;</p><p><b><i>- Resolution tools</i></b>   including appointing a special manager, sale of business, bridge bank and asset separation tools and also the use of bail-in mechanisms.</p><p>  I welcome the introduction of this important piece of legislation which is designed to safeguard financial stability and to protect taxpayers&rsquo; funds. The rules will be transposed into national law over the course of 2014.</p><p>  The bail-in tool that the Deputy specifically refers to is, in my view, an essential part of this new resolution framework and an important means of protecting taxpayers&rsquo; money from any future bank crisis. Bail-in will enable resolution authorities to write down or convert into equity the claims of shareholders and creditors of institutions that are failing or likely to fail. This is an important means of ensuring that a bank&rsquo;s losses are absorbed by those who fund its activities and not taxpayers. </p><p>  The introduction of clear EU wide bail-in rules should assist in creating a level playing field for banks and should force market discipline, so that investors&rsquo; decisions to lend to banks and the premiums they charge for such lending are based on the financial health and soundness of the particular bank rather than its geographical location. This should constrain banks from engaging in the excessive risk taking that was at the heart of many bank failures of recent years.</p><p>  Where excessive application of bail-in might lead to significant financial instability, other measures in the BRRD can be considered. This could for example include using the resolution fund to absorb some of the losses. The resolution fund will be funded by the wider banking industry and in a banking union context this will be set up at a European level, thereby increasing the amount of funding available.</p><p>  I am of the view that this new EU framework will reduce both the likelihood and the impact of future problems in the banking system, while also enabling authorities to manage bank crises in a coordinated manner minimising contagion to the wider economy. This represents significant progress in enhancing financial stability within the European banking system.</p></reply>

When compared with other OECD members with a similar marginal tax rate, the Irish marginal tax rate for PAYE income takes effect when the standard rate band is exceed which is &euro;32,800 for a single individual.  </p><p>  Marginal tax rates are important because they influence individual decisions to work more or indeed to work at all.  The OECD working paper Tax and Economic Growth indicates that <i>&ldquo;there is also the possibility that high top marginal rates will increase the average tax rates paid by high-skilled and high-income earners so much that they will migrate to countries with lower rates resulting in a brain drain which may lower innovative activity and productivity&rdquo;</i>  . Higher marginal tax rates for earners may also incentivise a greater level of tax evasion and contribute to the development of a shadow economy.  This is why the Programme for Government contains a very specific commitment that &ldquo;as part of the Government&rsquo;s fiscal strategy we will maintain the current rates of income tax together with bands and credits.  We will not increase the top marginal rates of taxes on income&rdquo;. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware all tax expenditures and reliefs are reviewed in the run up to annual Budget.</p></reply>

I understand that RBS, the parent of Ulster Bank, has appointed Clifford Chance to independently review the treatment of distressed customers by the Global Restructuring Group and report early in the New Year. I also understand that the findings will be applied across the RBS Group. </p><p>  I would refer the Deputy to the revised Code of Conduct for Business Lending to SMEs, which came into effect on 1 January 2012. A specific focus of the Code is the treatment of borrowers in financial difficulties. Lenders are required to provide information to SMEs in relation to the importance of engaging with the lender to address their financial difficulties, the procedures for dealing with SMEs in financial difficulties including timeframes, details of fees which may apply, the type of information they require in assessing cases and information on their right of appeal. Lenders must assess whether an alternative repayment arrangement can be put in place and allow the SME appeal that decision and offer meetings to SMEs which approach them with concerns about meeting repayments.</p><p>  The banks are required to comply with the Code as a matter of law. The Code makes it clear that anybody acting for or on behalf of a bank is subject to its provisions. The Central Bank can invoke its statutory powers to require compliance with the Code. A breach of the Code is a breach of a regulatory requirement and may be the subject of enforcement action by the Central Bank. </p><p>  Additionally, as the Deputy is aware, the two main banks are subject to oversight by the Credit Review Office and the CRO has been active in overturning rejections by the banks of credit applications from the SME sector. </p><p>  It is the customer&rsquo;s decision to take legal action against their bank. However, I would state that should any customer of a bank operating in Ireland be unable to resolve a complaint about the operation of his or her accounts they may refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman.</p><p>  The Deputy can be assured that this is an area that I will keep under review given the importance of the SME sector to fostering and supporting economic recovery.</p></reply>

Indeed the Letter of Intent dated 29th November which was jointly sent by me and by Governor Honohan to Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the IMF, Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, President of the EuroGroup, Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, and Rimantas &Scaron;ad&zcaron;ius President of the EcoFin Council, refers specifically to such measures.</p><p>  In addition to the curtailment of tax reliefs which are generally availed of by higher earners, the Deputy will be aware that the tax system has become more progressive since 2009, meaning that those on higher incomes pay proportionately higher rates of tax on their income than those on lower incomes.  </p><p>  I would also point out the introduction of specific base-broadening measures; examples of these would be the Local Property Tax and the Carbon Tax.</p><p>  In the Medium-Term Economic Strategy the Government has stated its commitment to support economic growth by ensuring any tax increases be effected in the first instance by base broadening through the elimination or curtailment of overly-generous, poorly targeted or otherwise unaffordable tax reliefs.</p></reply>

Paragraph 10 of Section 14 provides that relevant employers must submit an annual return to the Revenue Commissioners detailing, inter alia, the number of employees and the amounts of exempt income claimed under the programme.

This represented the beginning of a process that involves a detailed examination of the proposal, line by line, by all Member States at the Council working group.   Since the Commission's proposal was published, Department of Finance officials, along with officials from the Revenue Commissioners, have been attending the Working Party on Tax Questions which is the forum for discussions on the proposal. To date, officials have attended meetings on a regular basis but there is still some way to go before agreement on the Commission's proposal could be expected. </p><p>  In March 2013 the Irish Presidency circulated a &quot;road map&quot; paper following an orientation meeting of high level officials, setting out the next steps for discussions on the proposal. This roadmap will provide a context for the continuing discussions on the proposal. Work on the proposal is now focusing on a step-by-step approach. The first step will examine issues relating to a common tax base &ndash; consolidation can be examined at a later date. </p><p>  The Irish Presidency also circulated compromise text which reflected the first round of discussions on the proposal. Further meetings took place under the Lithuanian Presidency.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s position is that we are constructively engaging with the discussion. </p></reply>

A RIA is carried out where it is deemed necessary to do so in respect of a policy or programme that is being developed. There are cases where a RIA is not required. For example, a RIA is not required in the case of emergency legislation. Neither is a RIA required for the Finance Bill which is exempted from the requirement in the Cabinet Handbook.    In the period in question a total of twenty two Bills have been published by me as Minister for Finance. They are as follows:</p><p>1. Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011</p><p>2. Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2011</p><p>3. Insurance (Amendment) Act 2011</p><p>4. Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) (No. 2) Bill 2011</p><p>5.

Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2011</p><p>9. Finance Bill 2012</p><p>10  Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Bill 2012</p><p>11. European Stability Mechanism Bill 2012</p><p>12.

Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013</p><p>21. Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013 </p><p>22.

Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011</p><p>2. Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Bill 2012</p><p>3. Credit Reporting Bill 2012 &ndash; in the form of the Report of the Inter-Agency Working Group on Credit Histories.</p><p>4. Fiscal Responsibility Bill 2012 &ndash; in the form of a Screening Regulatory Impact Assessment.</p><p>  In regard to the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 and the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Bill 2012, the RIA in respect of each was published before the publication of the Bill. In regard to the Credit Reporting Bill 2012, the RIA was published at the point of publication of the Bill.   </p><p>  In relation to Deputy Creighton&rsquo;s question about promised Bills, there are currently 8 Bills proposed for publication by the Department of Finance during the 2014 legislative session. As the Bills are in the process of being drafted, the exact titles have not been decided upon but the promised Bills do include, for example, the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Bill, the Irish Collective Asset Management Vehicle (ICAV) Bill, and the Customs (Amendment) Bill 2013.</p><p>  In respect of the 8 Bills proposed, no final decision has yet been made on whether a RIA will be required. In the cases where a RIA is undertaken, we intend to publish it where appropriate.  </p></reply>

If a liable person places an incorrect value on his/her property due to a genuine error or mistake, and as a consequence overpays the amount of LPT due, then Section 26 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that a claim for a refund of the overpaid amount may be made to Revenue, providing evidence for the revised valuation can be provided.   In the case raised by the Minister of State, a form LPT 1 was filed in April in respect of 2013 indicating &lsquo;Band 2&rsquo; as the appropriate valuation band.  An amount of &euro;112 was also paid, which is the correct amount in respect of &lsquo;Band 2&rsquo; for the 2013 half-year.</p><p>  A request to revise the valuation to &lsquo;Band 1&rsquo; was received by Revenue in late October 2013. The request was supported with appropriate documentation confirming &lsquo;Band 1&rsquo; as the correct valuation band. </p><p>  Revenue has examined the information provided by the person and has confirmed to me that the valuation band has been amended from &lsquo;Band 2&rsquo; to &lsquo;Band 1&rsquo;.  Revenue has also confirmed that an overpayment of &euro;67 will be refunded within the coming days as the LPT liability in respect of 2014 has already been paid. </p></reply>

These include:</p><p>- The introduction of a third major transfer point for students between primary level and third level.</p><p>- The question of which school the Transition Year should be placed in.</p><p>- The undermining of Department policy to maintain as common a curriculum as possible for as long as possible to avoid the risk of specialisation too early and school drop out.</p><p>- The potential danger that the senior school will come to be seen as the 'specialist' Leaving Certificate centre into which transfers are sought at senior cycle.</p><p>- The loss of the advantages to be gained when teachers regularly teach students from first year to sixth year.</p><p>- The possibility of students from other schools seeking entry to the senior school with the attendant repercussions for other schools. </p><p>  Apart for these compelling educational reasons, patronage of the new school, was awarded to the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board (KWETB) on the basis that the new school would deliver the prescribed curriculum at both Junior and Senior Cycle. Any change to this stated intention could lead to a challenge or to calls for the patronage determination process to be commenced afresh. This could have the effects of both delaying the establishment of the new school and, of course, re-opening the patronage of the new school to other applicant patrons. </p><p>I have met with a parents' deputation and, in accordance with normal protocol following such meetings, I communicated the outcome of my subsequent consideration of this matter to the Deputies who had requested the meeting. I also recently wrote directly to the Chairperson of the Maynooth Schools Group fully outlining the reasons for my decision to provide Maynooth with two fully-vertical post-primary schools and confirming that I am adhering to this decision.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the enrolment procedures put in place by the management structure developed by the KTWEB for the new campus will ensure a fair and equitable enrolment policy for both schools.</p></reply>

The nationality requirements for the student grant scheme are set out in section 14 of the Student Support Act 2011 and regulation 5 of the Student Support Regulations 2013.</p><p>  In all cases, to qualify for a student grant, it is the grant applicant and not his/her parents that must meet the nationality or prescribed immigration status requirements in their own right. The onus is on the grant applicant to provide the necessary documentary evidence as proof of their nationality or immigration status to the relevant grant awarding authority.</p><p>  Article 32 of the Student Grant Scheme 2013 provides for the review of eligibility for the award of a grant in the event of changes of circumstances in the academic year, including a change in relation to a student's nationality or immigration status. This means that where a student acquires Irish citizenship by naturalisation during the course of their studies he/she may apply to SUSI to have his/her application re-assessed.</p><p>  If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI.</p><p>Where an appeal is turned down in writing by SUSI and the applicant remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his or her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board.

There are also complex changes in the dynamics of this business worldwide, which have knock-on impacts in facilities such as those in Ireland.   As the Deputy will appreciate, the ultimate decision in these cases is made by the parent company, on strictly commercial grounds, and on what is seen by the company as being in the best interests of the group as a whole.  </p><p>  This decision is very unfortunate and a huge blow to the employees and their families.  I am very concerned that everything possible should be dome to try to safeguard as much of this employment as possible.  I have met senior executives of the company on three occasions since taking office and IDA have been engaged with them over recent years in an effort to find solutions to the difficult business environment they face.  Unfortunately however, the challenges are very significant. </p><p>  Since the announcement, IDA Ireland has met with company management and have created a profile of the staff skills and of the plant itself to help market the operation overseas.  IDA will remain in on-going contact with the company and an IDA executive travelled to Germany earlier this month to meet the parent company.  In addition, I have arranged that Enterprise Ireland will engage with the company to explore whatever other options might be possible, taking into account that Agency&rsquo;s remit and experience in supporting the Irish-owned engineering sector.  </p><p>  I am conscious of the highly-skilled workforces and have asked IDA to explore the possibility of securing a takeover for the company and help market the operation overseas.  I want to assure the Deputy that all that can be done by the State&rsquo;s agencies in an effort to help co-ordinate activities to support the employees and secure a positive result for them if possible, is being done.</p></reply>

It also has a licensing appeals function. Neither the Health and Safety Authority nor I have a role in the approval of applications for licenses in respect of retail petrol stations, run by private operators, as this is a matter for Local Authorities.  Consequently I have no information in relation to licences issued by local authorities in recent years.  </p><p>  My Department has lead responsibility for the Dangerous Substances legislative regime.  The Dangerous Substances Acts 1972 and 1979, together with a series of Regulations under this legislation, set out the legal framework under which petroleum and other dangerous substances are regulated.  The storage of petrol is governed by the Dangerous Substances (Retail and Private Petroleum Stores) Regulations, S.I. 311 of 1979, as amended. The Act requires that all petrol storage facilities must be licensed.  The Regulations set minimum requirements that apply equally to private petrol stores and storage for the purpose of retail sale (petrol filling stations).  The 1979 Regulations have been kept under continuing review and while operating within the regulatory regime set out above, Inspectors from the Health &amp;amp; Safety Authority (HSA) are sensitive to the economic situation of the operators to which it applies.  This approach is in line with the general approach taken in occupational health and safety legislation and aims to avoid the imposition of undue hardship on owners of kerbside stations that do not meet the 1979 requirements.</p><p>  In the course of an inspection the Authority will normally require the operator to apply to their Local Authority (LA) for a Dangerous Substance licence if one is not already in place, and will advise the operator that they will be required by the LA to comply with SI 311 of 1979 as far as possible, bearing in mind also the specific exemptions allowed for older &quot;kerbside&quot; petrol stations in S.I. 528 of 2012.  These exemption regulations allow for derogations from certain provisions of the 1979 Regulations, for these &quot;kerbside&quot; petrol stations, as they were in existence prior to the coming into force of the 1979 regulations, and for various socio-economic reasons were allowed to continue in operation under the special exemption provisions.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the approach taken by HSA Inspectors in implementing the 1979 Regulations, it must be reiterated that petrol filling stations are particularly hazardous workplaces which require to be licensed by Local Authorities.  The HSA continues to provide suitable guidance to all petrol station operators to ensure that they can comply with the relevant legislation in this area.</p></reply>

Given that a similar number of people are employed indirectly: the total supported within the sector is therefore over 420,000.  Last year, in order to build on the potential for this sector, I asked Forf&aacute;s to undertake an analysis of Manufacturing in Ireland and the resultant Strategy, which I launched earlier this year, sets a comprehensive suite of recommendations to develop the sector, which are now being progressed.  The Strategy identifies that an additional 20,000 jobs can be created in Manufacturing by 2016.   </p><p>  In addition to that Strategy, I also initiated another research project on issues relating to skills needs, and that report entitled &ldquo;<i>The Future Skills Needs of the Manufacturing Sector to 2020</i> &rdquo; was published by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs/Forf&aacute;s at the same time.  Both of these reports complement each other and will assist Government in reaching that job creation target.   </p><p>  A particularly attractive feature of manufacturing in Ireland is the fact that many of the present jobs are not in the main urban areas, but dispersed into regional locations, thereby providing a valuable employment focus in areas where alternative jobs are scarce.

The Strategy provides an overall framework for social and economic policies that are being developed and implemented across Government to build on the progress we have made to date and set Ireland on the path to sustainable recovery.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s goal, as set out in the Medium-Term Economic Strategy, is to achieve full employment in the economy by 2020.  While we have begun to see encouraging signs of employment growth in the last twelve months, replacing all of the 330,000 jobs which were lost to the economy between 2008 and 2012 will require determined implementation of appropriate policies across Government.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs will continue to be the key vehicle for the identification and delivery of specific policy measures that will support job creation by Government.  I am currently preparing the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government, which will be published in the New Year.  </p><p>  The Action Plan will include a series of clear, tangible measures to continue the Government&rsquo;s focus on building a strong enterprise base that is built on entrepreneurship, innovation and exports.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 80,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided &euro;403 million in 2013. </p><p>  Revised rent limits under the rent supplement scheme have come into force with effect from Monday 17 June 2013 and will be in place until 31 December 2014.  The new rent limits have been determined following an extensive review of the private rental market based on the most up-to-date data available.  The Department currently funds up to 30% of the private rented sector so it is essential that the rent limits are kept under review.  The new rent limits have been set using the 35th percentile ensuring that sufficient housing is available for recipients of the scheme.</p><p>  Under the revised rent limits, there have been increases in the maximum rent limits in Dublin while there have been some reductions across a number of rural counties reflecting the conditions in the rental markets in those counties.  Separate to the county limits, higher rent limits have also been provided for in the commuter areas of North Kildare and Bray.</p><p>  Recently released figures from the Private Residential Tenancies Board, shows that current rent limits are providing adequate supply levels for both North Kildare and County.  The rent limits in place reflect Kildare&rsquo;s current rental levels agreed between landlord and tenant.  It is recognised that there is a general shortage of rental property available for North Kildare, and to a lesser degree the rest of the County, however, this is in line with national trends and has been factored into the current rent limits in place.</p><p>  A key goal of the most recent review was to continue to ensure that rent limits do not distort local market conditions and allow natural levels of supply and demand to set realistic rental values.  This is an especially important for low income working families, that is, to ensure that these families are not priced out of an area of their choice due to unrealistic, too high rental limits.  The Department continues to monitor rent levels throughout the county.  I have no plans to further revise rent limits at this time.</p><p>  Policy in relation to social housing provision and housing lists are a matter for the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

This means that, in the future, the task of financing increased pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the working population as demographic projections indicate the ratio of working age to older people will decrease from 5.3 to 1 at present to 2.1 to 1 by 2060.  Life expectancy in Ireland is also increasing and whilst this is very welcome development, it also presents very real and obvious public policy challenges. </p><p>  It was in this context and taking into account the impact of the economic downturn, that in 2012, discussions on long term pension policy identified the need for a focussed examination on the direction of policy to ensure a modern, sustainable, and adequate pension system.  The OECD was commissioned by the Minister for Social Protection to review long term pension policy in Ireland.  The particular aspects considered by the OECD included; the sustainability of the pension system in the light of demographic and investment challenges; the adequacy and coverage levels, in order to ensure adequate income in retirement with a particular focus on the lower and middle income group; the modernity of pension systems to ensure flexibility in the labour market and supporting mechanisms for longer working; equity within the pension system.</p><p>  During the review process, the OECD engaged extensively with the full range of sectoral interests including the social partners, representatives from the pensions industry and older people and with Government departments.  The OECD published its final review in April 2013.</p><p>  In making its recommendations the OECD noted the that:<blockquote><i>In considering these alternatives, it should be kept in mind that each of the national schemes and reforms discussed in this review was adopted in a specific national economic, social and political setting.  There is no blueprint for reform which Ireland could take off-the-shelf and implement directly.  Any solution has to fit the Irish situation.</i></blockquote>  The findings and recommendations of the OECD report are not prescriptive.  The report provides a wide choice of measures for consideration which involve a number of Government Departments.  The report is being examined in detail and I will shortly bring a response to Government for decision setting out a road map for long term pensions policy in Ireland.  </p><p>  In relation to the challenges facing underfunded Defined Benefit (DB) schemes, the package of measures I recently announced as part of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill (No.2) 2013 addresses the situation where an underfunded DB pension scheme winds up in deficit or elects to restructure.  It can arise at present that pensioners may receive all or almost all the pension fund and the members who have contributed but not retired receive considerably less than expected.  These measures will ensure a more equal distribution of assets in an underfunded scheme when an insolvency/restructuring occurs.  </p><p>  The measures will apply only in a limited set of circumstances, meaning the potential number of schemes affected will be small.  In those limited circumstances, the measures will ensure a fairer deal for employee and former employee members by increasing their future pension entitlements, while prioritising an occupational pension of up to &euro;12,000 for existing pensioners in addition to their State pension entitlements. </p><p>  The typical pensioner in such a scenario would have a State pension (contributory) of &euro;12,000 in addition to their occupational pension, meaning they would therefore receive a retirement income of up to &euro;24,000.  Those pensioners receiving occupational benefits in excess of &euro;12,000 will still retain a significant degree of prioritisation for receipt of benefits. </p><p>  In the case of both a company and the scheme being insolvent, the Government will guarantee that existing pensions will be protected to a level of 50% with pensions of &euro;12,000 or less being 100% protected.  I am pleased that agreement has been reached with the Minister for Finance to use funds from the pension levy to meet any obligations on the State that may occur arising from such double insolvencies. </p><p>  These measures meet Ireland's obligations under the EU Insolvency Directive to protect workers' entitlements.  They also ensure greater fairness within DB scheme structures.</p></reply>

While there is no pre-determined level of replacement rate, which would influence every individual&rsquo;s decision to work, higher replacement rates may indicate lower incentives to take up employment.  In this regard a replacement rate in excess of 70% may be considered to be excessive.  </p><p>  Replacement rate analysis demonstrates that the great majority of people on the Live Register have a strong financial incentive to work and significant numbers leave the Register each year.  In this regard it may be noted that almost three-quarters of the people on the Live Register are only claiming a personal rate for themselves.  They are either single or may have a spouse or partner who is working.  In addition, 53% of the people on the Live Register receive less than the maximum personal weekly rate. </p><p>  High replacement rates are generally associated with a relatively high number of dependent children and/or receipt of rent or mortgage supplement.  However, it is important to note that only some 9% of persons on the Live Register are in receipt of rent supplement, with a further 1.3% in receipt of mortgage interest supplement.  The vast majority of jobseekers do not receive these additional supports. </p><p>  Significant moves have already been taken to address the impact of housing entitlements upon replacement rates.  Arising out of commitments in the Programme for Government to review the operation of the rent supplement scheme, proposals to integrate the systems for providing rent supplement and social housing support have been advanced.  It is intended to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from the Department of Social Protection (currently provided through rent supplement) to housing authorities using a new housing assistance payment.  The effect of this transfer and the introduction of a new form of housing assistance payment will be to address one of the significant disincentives to accessing full-time employment that exists under the rent supplement scheme.  This will have a positive impact on replacement rates. </p><p>  In addition, the <font color="#2F2F2F">Benefit of Work Ready Reckoner, </font>recently launched on <i>www.welfare.ie,</i><i><font color="#2F2F2F"> </font></i><font color="#2F2F2F">will highlight the difference for jobseekers between potential income from work and the welfare payments they currently receive.  It will help jobseekers assess the benefits of taking up work opportunities as the economy recovers.</font></p></reply>

Prior to the 2009 Act, only the benefits of active scheme members could be considered in a restructure of scheme benefits. The Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill further extends the options available to trustees of a scheme to include a portion of benefits payable to pensioners. It essentially provides for the sharing of the risk of scheme underfunding across all scheme members. However, the legislation restricts the extent to which pensioner benefits can be restructured as it is considered that this category of beneficiary has less potential to respond to a restructure of scheme benefits.</p><p>  Deferred and active scheme members are treated the same for the purposes of section 50 of the Pensions Act. A deferred scheme member is a scheme member who has left employment to which the scheme relates and who is entitled to a pension payment at a future date. A deferred member may be close to retirement or may be many years from retirement age   and  may have the opportunity to  accumulate pension entitlements in  number of pension schemes before reaching retirement age.</p><p>  The issue of how these changes might be applied will be a matter for the trustees of the scheme who are required under trust law to act in the best interest of all scheme beneficiaries.</p><p>  Any consideration of a restructure of pension scheme benefits must comply with the provisions in the Pensions Act and with guidance issued by the Pensions Board.  The Pensions Board must be satisfied that these provisions are complied with before the Board will consider issuing a notice to restructure scheme benefits.</p></reply>

In addition the time taken to process claims depends on the volume of claims received in any time period relative to the availability of staff to process such claims.  </p><p>  In setting standards for claim processing I am also conscious that deciding officers of the Department, operate under statute to make decisions regarding the disbursement of  public monies in circumstances where the  decisions made have a significant impact on the wellbeing of clients. Accordingly they must be given the time to take considered decisions and unlike some areas of the private sector cannot, in response to peaks in workload, trade off quality against speed  based on an assessment of the risk of taking a bad decision compared to  the benefit of achieving time based service targets.  Accordingly, I do not plan to offer guaranteed processing times to customers in respect of social welfare claims. </p><p>  However, my Department has set measurable performance targets for the majority of schemes under its remit, generally based on weeks required to award 90% of claims received taking account of process variances at scheme level.

To date, six of these have been enacted. Details are set out in the following table.</p><p>  Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs) are not ordinarily undertaken in relation to the package of measures announced in the annual Budget Day Statements or similar packages of measures.  Accordingly, a RIA was not considered necessary in the case of the Social Welfare Act 2011 and the Social Welfare Act 2012, both of which enacted social welfare measures announced in the 2012 and 2013 Budgets, respectively.  A RIA was not considered necessary in the case of the social welfare measures contained in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011, the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012, the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 and the Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Bill 2013 as these measures either implemented budgetary decisions or made miscellaneous amendments to the social welfare code which were not considered amenable to the undertaking of a RIA.</p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Acts of 2011 and 2012 and the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 also amended the provisions of the Pensions Act 1990.  </p><p>  Part 4 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 transposed Article 17 of Directive 2003/41/EC on the Activities and Supervision of Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision (IORPS Directive) relating to the regulation of occupational pensions.  However, as the types of pension scheme envisaged in Article 17 are not operated in Ireland, a RIA was not considered feasible in relation to these provisions.</p><p>  Part 3 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012 amended the Funding Standard applying to defined benefit pension schemes. A RIA undertaken on these amendments has been published and is available at  .</p><p>  Part 4 of the Social Welfare and Pension (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 implemented the recommendations of the Critical Review of the Pension Board.  This review, which involved a public consultation process, was carried out under the Public Service Reform plan. This review is available at .</p><p>  With the publication of the Social Welfare and Pensions (no. 2) Bill the Department published a report by Mercer on the changes to occupational pensions.  This is available at . This report undertook a detailed modelling exercise of different approaches to the changes to the order of priority given to the disbursement of assets when a defined benefit pension scheme winds up.   A RIA was also undertaken but not published  <font color="#FF0000">.</font></p><p>  As the provisions contained in the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2012 to extend the list of bodies authorised to solemnise marriages were of a minor nature, a RIA was not considered necessary in the case of this Act. </p><p>I intend to publish the following four Bills in 2014:</p><p>- Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2014</p><p>- Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill 2014 </p><p>- Gender Recognition Bill 2014 </p><p>- Social Welfare Bill 2014</p><p>  Due to the nature of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2014 and the Social Welfare Bill 2014 it is not planned that regulatory impact assessments will be prepared in respect of these Bills.

The then Government agreed to cover the full capital costs of the project, which were estimated at that time to be of the order of &euro;35m.</p><p>  It was always the intention that the Ulster Canal project would be funded from the Waterways Ireland annual allocations, as agreed through the annual estimates processes in this jurisdiction, as well as the deliberations of NSMC in relation to annual budgets.  It was a key consideration throughout the process that the Ulster Canal project would be supported by a significant level of projected income from the commercialisation of certain Waterways Ireland assets.  However, the economic downturn has had a negative impact on those plans.</p><p>  I am continuing to explore all possible options to advance this project within the current fiscal constraints. In this regard, I established an Inter-Agency Group on the Ulster Canal to explore ways to advance the project and to examine possible funding options for it, including existing funding streams and the leveraging of funding from other sources. This includes the exploration of any EU funding which may be potentially available.</p><p>  The Ulster Canal project is progressing on an incremental basis. Planning approvals have now been received for the project in both jurisdictions. Work on land maps is continuing, as is consideration of construction and other technical aspects of the project. I welcome these developments, which, I am sure the Deputy will agree, are a significant milestone for the project.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Cork, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at   . </p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market fails to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS). Under that Scheme, all fixed residences and businesses located within certain designated Electoral Divisions, including 96 of the 399 Electoral Divisions within County Cork, are eligible to avail of the NBS service from &ldquo;3&rdquo;, the NBS service provider. The broadband service contracted under the NBS is a basic, affordable product in keeping with EU State Aid clearance for the Scheme in September 2007. Under the terms of the NBS contract, the NBS mobile wireless service is required to offer minimum download and upload speeds of 2.3Mbps and 1.4Mbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 18:1. </p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in County Cork. This will be achieved by providing:  a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. I am aware of at least one service provider announcing that it will be providing advanced broadband services in the Kanturk region from April 2014 and my Department will be happy to discuss this further with the Deputy. </p><p>  The commercial market developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. </p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society. </p></reply>

With regard to the recent increase in UK gas prices, rises in customer prices in both the UK and Ireland have been primarily driven by rises in underlying gas prices rather than any company specific matter.  I have no statutory function in the setting of gas prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated parts of the market. Responsibility for the regulation of the gas market is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body. The position is that the CER regulates the Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariff for its domestic customers. Prices in all other segments of the gas market are deregulated. </p><p>The CER continues to keep deregulation of the domestic consumer segment of the gas market under review.  In its most recent review of the market the CER has concluded that the criteria for deregulation had not all been met to allow for the immediate deregulation of the domestic gas market. Until all deregulation criteria have been met the CER will continue to regulate the Bord Gais Energy retail tariff.</p></reply>

While no Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) was completed specifically for this Bill, a full RIA was undertaken with respect to the provisions of the related Petroleum (Exploration and Extraction) Safety Act, 2010. That Act is concerned with the carrying out of certain functions by the Commission for Energy Regulation, in respect of which borrowings from the Central Treasury Funds are necessary. The 2011 Bill itself was enacted on 23 November 2011 as the Access to Central Treasury Funds (Commission for Energy Regulation) Act 2011. The second was the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011. A RIA for the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011 was published with the Bill on the 27<sup>th</sup> September 2011. The Bill, Explanatory Memoranda and RIA were made available on my Department&rsquo;s website and also on the Oireachtas website. The Bill itself was enacted on the 25<sup>th</sup> February 2012 as the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2012.</p><p>  The third was the Electricity Regulation (Carbon Revenue Levy)(Amendment) Bill 2012. This was emergency legislation on foot of a Supreme Court Decision and therefore was exempt from RIA requirements. The Bill itself was enacted on 25<sup>th</sup>   May 2012 as the Electricity Regulation (Carbon Revenue Levy)(Amendment) Act 2012.</p><p>  The fourth was the Gas Regulation Bill 2013 which was published on 25 July 2013. A RIA on the Gas Regulation Bill 2013, setting out the policy context and rationale for the implementation of full ownership unbundling, including for the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy, was prepared. Some of the material contained in the RIA was considered to be commercially sensitive in light of the ongoing transaction process. Therefore, it is not intended to publish the RIA at this stage. The bill itself was enacted on 3<sup>rd</sup> December 2013 as the Gas Regulation Act 2013.</p><p>  In addition the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011, while not initiated by me, was enacted on 2 August 2011. </p><p>  There are a number of other Bills currently in preparation in my Department which will be brought through the Houses of the Oireachtas in due course and the position regarding RIAs for these particular Bills is set out in the table below.<table><tr><th>Title of Bill</th><th>Current position regarding RIA</th></tr><tr><td>ESB (Electronic Communications Network) Bill 2013 </td><td>RIA has been prepared in respect of the draft legislation and will be published following approval of the legislation by Government</td></tr><tr><td>Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Smart Metering) Bill 2014 </td><td>Preparation of RIA is under consideration and in the event that a RIA is carried out it will be published prior to the publication of the Bill.</td></tr><tr><td>Minerals Development Bill </td><td>Screening RIA to be published with the Bill.</td></tr><tr><td>Geothermal Energy Development Bill </td><td>RIA was approved by Government on 13 July 2010 and was published.</td></tr><tr><td>EirGrid Bill</td><td>RIA will be prepared and published prior to publication of the Bill.</td></tr><tr><td>Common Arrangements for Gas Bill 2013</td><td>RIA will be prepared and published prior to publication of the Bill.</td></tr><tr><td>Inland Fisheries (Modernisation &amp;amp; Consolidation) Bill </td><td>RIA will be prepared and published prior to publication of the Bill.</td></tr><tr><td>Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2014.</td><td>RIA will be prepared and published prior to publication of the Bill.</td></tr></table></p><p>  My Department undertakes RIA in accordance with the procedures set out in the RIA Guidelines published by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p></reply>

The procedures involved allow for action to be taken without legal representation. </p><p>  In addition, section 107 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 provides local authorities with powers to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit noise.  These powers are generally exercised in preventing and limiting noise from commercial and industrial premises within their functional areas. A notice can be served by a local authority on any person in charge of any premises, processes or works, other than an activity controlled by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In addition, under section 108 of the Act, local authorities have the same power as individual citizens to seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated. </p><p>  My Department does not compile statistics on the number of section 108 actions brought by individuals before the District Court. However, local authorities submit annual returns to the EPA on a range of environmental inspection and enforcement activities, including noise complaints, under the Recommendation 2001/331/EC for the minimum Criteria for Environmental Inspections (RMCEI) process. </p><p>  The source of a noise complaint most often dictates the way it is addressed by a local authority, depending on whether the noise nuisance originates from commercial premises, a private rented tenant, a local authority tenant or a private home-owner.   Local authorities will in general aim to resolve noise complaints without recourse to legal action through meeting with the parties concerned, mediation, issuing of warning letters, serving of a section 107 notice, etc. Bringing a case before the District Court remains an option of last resort. </p><p>  An information leaflet on noise pollution and the procedures involved in bringing a complaint is available on my Department&rsquo;s website - </p></reply>

Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing in 2014, the Minister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund.  The funding to be provided to local authorities for the provision of water services in 2014 will be governed by Service Level Agreements between Irish Water and individual authorities.  The following table, based on information supplied by the Local Government Management Agency on 16 December 2013, sets out the revenue received by each local authority to date in respect of the 2013 Non-Principal Private Residence Charge liability date.  The 2014 General Purpose Grant allocations take into account the fact that 2013 is the final year of operation of the Charge.   </p><p>  The information requested concerning General Purpose Grant allocations is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.  However, for a number of reasons, it is inappropriate to make direct comparisons between the General Purpose Grant allocations made in 2013 and those made in 2014.  Among the reasons involved is the fact that a large component of the cost base of each local authority, namely the operational cost of delivering water services, is transferring to Irish Water and therefore direct local authority funding needs are lower in 2014.  In addition, 2014 General Purpose Grant allocations have been made on a city and &quot;county at large&quot; basis, whereas separate town council allocations were made in previous years. <table><tr><th>County/City Council </th><th>2013 <br /><br />&euro;m </th></tr><tr><td>Carlow </td><td>0.72 </td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>0.95 </td></tr><tr><td>Clare </td><td>2.14 </td></tr><tr><td>Cork City </td><td>2.60 </td></tr><tr><td>Cork County </td><td>5.74 </td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>3.19 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City </td><td>13.04 </td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown </td><td>3.27 </td></tr><tr><td>Fingal </td><td>3.73 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway City </td><td>2.39 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway County </td><td>2.19 </td></tr><tr><td>Kerry </td><td>3.26 </td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td>2.17 </td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny </td><td>0.95 </td></tr><tr><td>Laois </td><td>0.75 </td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>0.66 </td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City </td><td>1.25 </td></tr><tr><td>Limerick County </td><td>1.46 </td></tr><tr><td>Longford </td><td>0.56 </td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>1.23 </td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>2.26 </td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>1.50 </td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>0.56 </td></tr><tr><td>North Tipperary </td><td>0.85 </td></tr><tr><td>Offaly </td><td>0.66 </td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon </td><td>0.87 </td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>1.32 </td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin </td><td>2.55 </td></tr><tr><td>South Tipperary </td><td>1.01 </td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City </td><td>0.94 </td></tr><tr><td>Waterford County </td><td>0.87 </td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>1.29 </td></tr><tr><td>Wexford </td><td>2.78 </td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow </td><td>1.53 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>71.25* </td></tr></table>* Difference due to rounding.</p></reply>

A balance is maintained in the Local Government Fund from year to year for cash flow purposes and also to account for variations in forecast income.  Any surplus balance after all commitments have been met at year end is carried forward as an opening balance for the subsequent year.</p></reply>

To date, NAMA has identified almost 4,370 residential properties, controlled by its debtors and receivers, under this initiative as being potentially available for social housing.  Demand has been confirmed by the local authorities for just under 1,980 of these properties with a further 176 properties currently being evaluated, bringing the total that may be deemed potentially suitable to just over 2,150.  The local authorities have confirmed that of the properties identified, 1,413 are considered unsuitable by reference to sustainable planning and housing policy or are located in areas with no demand.  More than 800 other properties have been sold or privately let by their owners or receivers since they were identified by NAMA.  There is considerable complexity in dealing with multiple property transfers with varying degrees of difficulty attached to them.  In the main, this is due to the complexities of getting agreement from multiple parties operating within an environment subject to a range of legal and financial constraints.</p><p>  Within this context, significant progress has been made with 179 properties delivered from the NAMA portfolio for social housing purposes by the end of 2012.  By end November, 2013, that number had increased to 369 properties delivered, with contracts signed in respect of a further 104 properties.  This brings the overall total number of residential properties completed or committed to social housing at that point to 4 73 properties.  It continue s to be my Department's objective to maximise the delivery of social housing using al l resources available, and I expect considerable further progress will be made in delivery of units for social housing from the NAMA portfolio in 2014.  Once the agreements are signed and the units are made available for social housing the allocation or tenanting of such units is a matter for the local authorities in the areas in which they are located.  My Department does not hold data in relation to the tenanting of properties.   </p><p>  The next quarterly updates in relation to the delivery of NAMA sourced units will be available at .</p></reply>

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.   </p><p>  The existing fire station in Kenmare was built in 1977 and the fire brigade responds to some 60 call-outs per year.  In 2008, approval was conveyed to the Council in respect of a new fire station to proceed to planning stage and I understand that planning permission was granted.  In February 2009, Kerry County Council was advised that the proposal was being viewed in the context of budgetary constraints.  Continued investment in the fire appliance fleet has been identified as one of the key national priorities for the fire services capital programme.  In that context and in order to deliver cost efficiencies, a programme involving fire authorities aggregating demand and jointly procuring 17 fire appliances is currently nearing completion.   </p><p>  Given the constraints on public finances, further support from my Department's fire services capital programme to replace Kenmare fire station will have regard to national priorities, the totality of requests from fire authorities countrywide, Kerry County Council's priorities, the extent of previous investment in Kerry fire service, the value for money offered by proposals and the status of existing facilities in relation to the area risk categorisation.</p></reply>

I expect to bring the General Scheme of the Bill to Government for consideration in 2014.  However, as indicated in the Government Legislation Programme published on 18 September 2013, it is not possible at this time to indicate when the Bill will be published, having regard to other priorities in the area concerned and the broader range of legislative priorities to be progressed across my Department's remit.   </p><p>  Currently, a person experiencing noise nuisance may contact their local authority, which may initiate proceedings on grounds of noise nuisance under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  This Act also provides for any person, or group of persons, to seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated.  The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation.  A public information leaflet, <i>A Guide to the Noise Regulations</i>, outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance, is available on my Department's website .</p></reply>

I chair a National Co-ordinating Committee, which was established as a response to the report of the advisory group on unfinished housing developments and which has harnessed the expertise and goodwill of the construction and banking sectors, local authorities, residents representatives and NAMA to ensure that significant progress has been made since its establishment.  Local authorities are continuing to pursue developers and others to comply with their obligations under planning regulations.</p><p>  Predominantly developer/funder/receiver funded site resolution processes will remain the main vehicle to tackle unfinished developments.  553 developments have been brought to a resolution point in this way over the past 12 months alone.  I expect that such processes will continue to make significant inroads into the remaining 992 inhabited unfinished developments.  Additionally, I have secured a Special Resolution Fund of &euro;10 million in 2014 to address the completion of infrastructure on developments which could not be resolved because of absences of, or inadequacies in, planning securities and other unforeseen cost and risk issues.  The fund will be operated by the local authorities and will be carefully targeted mainly to address difficulties in public infrastructure that have arisen on certain developments included in the Department's National Housing Development Survey 2013. </p><p>  It is also necessary to explore resolution of those developments which appear to be commercially unviable due to location, build quality, commercial demand or other factors and where the most prudent course of action may be to seek the agreement of owners/funders to clear all or part of the site.  Accordingly, the National Coordinating Committee established a group to oversee the development of a strategy for these residual developments and to work with stakeholders in identifying and agreeing such sites for full or partial clearance, thereby improving the lives of existing residents and removing dangerous structures from public access.  Some forty such developments have been initially identified and fall to be addressed by the relevant owners, receivers and funders.</p><p>  Responsibility for the clearance of unviable estates remains the responsibility of the funders and I welcome their participation in this pragmatic approach which will further underscore a return to a properly functioning property market.</p></reply>

At the polling station, the returning officer or the presiding officer may, or if required by a personation agent shall, request any person applying for a ballot paper to produce a specified identification document.  The range of documents includes commonly accepted forms of photographic ID including a passport, a driving licence and an employee identity card.  Other types of specified documents, such as cheque books or cards, birth or marriage certificates, which are not photographic ID, must be accompanied by further documentation which establishes the address of the holder in the constituency.</p><p>  If a person fails to produce a required document, or if the returning officer or the presiding officer is not satisfied that the person is the person to whom the document relates, they are not to be permitted to vote.

Investment in housing for private sale is primarily a matter for the market.  My Department is in the process of assessing the amount of residentially zoned undeveloped land in the Dublin area, and in the rest of the country, as part of the Housing Land Availability Survey.  Through this exercise, and the implementation of the National Spatial Strategy, Regional Planning Guidelines and local authority plans, I believe that the planning process is in a good position to respond to all investment initiatives in the housing sector.</p><p>  In terms of social housing provision, the Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, clearly identifies that the priority for Government is to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support in all local authority areas.  I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme is optimised in terms of resources and focus to maximise the response to social housing need.  This must be achieved in a context in which public expenditure necessarily continues to be constrained.  Nonetheless, in July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. </p><p>  In addition to the &euro;525.8 million in housing programme expenditure provided for in my Department's Abridged Estimate for 2014, Budget 2014 provides a further &euro;50 million to fund infrastructural investment primarily in the housing area, including &euro;30 million for the State house building programme; &euro;10 million for an unfinished housing estate resolution project; and an additional &euro;10 million for housing adaptation grants.  When this is taken into account, funding for housing for next year is effectively maintained at 2013 levels.   </p><p>  Delivery of social housing continues to be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  In addition, my Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes.  Approved Housing Bodies will also play a key role in 2014 in the delivery of social housing and in particular in their capacity to attract external financial investment.   </p><p>  In spite of our challenging economic circumstances, I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2013 to be in the region of 5,000 new housing units, and it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will also be provided for social housing in 2014.</p></reply>

While enforcement action in this area is a matter in the first instance for local authorities, my Department has taken a number of actions to address the issue.  In 2012, I introduced a once-off Litter Enforcement Grants Scheme, targeted specifically at the issue of fly-tipping and small-scale illegal dumping, encouraging local authorities to enhance their existing enforcement activities, through measures such as the purchase of CCTV equipment to allow for the effective monitoring of known litter black spots.  I also launched, again in 2012, a national campaign in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency and supported by the print media, to highlight the economic value of our environment and encouraging the public to report all incidences of illegal dumping to the Agency's National Environmental Complaints hotline at 1850 365 121. </p><p>  Existing penalties, available under the Litter Pollution Acts for litter offences, range from an on-the-spot fine of &euro;150, to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction and a maximum fine of &euro;130,000 on conviction on indictment.  The maximum fines for continuing offences are &euro;600 per day for summary offences and &euro;10,000 per day for indictable offences.  A person convicted of a litter offence may also be required by the court to pay the local authority's costs and expenses in investigating the offence and bringing the prosecution.  Penalties for more serious dumping offences provided for under the Waste Management Acts are also substantial.  Persons who are found to be responsible for, or involved in, the unauthorised disposal of waste are liable to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction and/or imprisonment for up to 12 months, and to a maximum fine of &euro;15 million on conviction on indictment and/or imprisonment for up to 10 years.</p><p>  Finally, as part of the root-and-branch review of all aspects of the Producer Responsibility Initiative model in Ireland that I initiated in 2012, my Department published a report earlier this year on packaging in which the possibility of a packaging levy was considered.  My Department also completed a consultation process with stakeholders on this issue<b>. </b> Following completion of the consultation process and the receipt of the consultants' report, I decided, after careful consideration, not to proceed with the introduction of a packaging levy at this time.  The primary reason for my decision is that the introduction of a packaging levy is likely to generate a number of regulatory costs to business and the public sector with few identifiable benefits, given our very successful packaging recovery and recycling performance to date in Ireland.  In addition, the consultants' report does not recommend the introduction of a Deposit and Refund scheme as to establish such a scheme is inappropriate, in view of the operation of the existing packaging scheme (Repak) and policies concerning household waste collection, plus the high administrative costs of introducing such a system. </p><p>  The report is available on my Department's website and can be accessed at: .</p></reply>

Regulation 22(1) of the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provides that a household with alternative accommodation that would meet its housing need is ineligible for social housing support. Paragraph (2) of the Regulation clarifies that paragraph (1) does not operate to exclude from eligibility for social housing support an applicant who owns accommodation that is occupied by his or her spouse, from whom he or she is formally separated or divorced. Under the enactment, a deed of separation is sufficient to set aside this ineligibility ground and it is not necessary to await judicial separation or divorce to get a decision on social housing support in these cases. This provision is reasonable in most cases.</p><p>  I acknowledge, however, that situations relating to household members who have separated may exceptionally arise that may not easily be dealt with under the current Regulations. <b></b>As part of an ongoing review of the 2011 Regulations, my Department is examining such scenarios and in particular whether specific provision is required in respect of separated persons applying for social housing support who own dwellings occupied by spouses from whom they are separated, but where no court order or deed of separation is in place.</p></reply>

The National Model recognises the need for dedicated community police officers and, as at 31 October this year, there were 944 such Garda&iacute; deployed around the country.  It is also worth emphasising, as the National Model does, that all Garda&iacute; contribute to community policing in the course of their day to day duties, and this has always been the case.</p><p>  In relation to the resources provided for Community Policing and how these relate to crime trends, the Deputy will appreciate that the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel among the Garda Regions, Divisions, and Districts, the various Garda national units and of course Garda Headquarters. Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.  I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the publication earlier this year of new Garda Community Crime Prevention Guidelines, which are designed to assist in the establishment of community based schemes, such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch, and which reaffirmed the Garda commitment to supporting communities and tackling crime in all areas of the country.</p><p>  Insofar as Community Alert scheme is concerned, for many years my Department has provided funding for the Community Alert programme which  is operated by  Muintir na T&iacute;re in partnership with the Garda authorities and which supports the operation of  over 1,300 local groups. Funding totalling &euro;152,000 was provided by my Department in 2013 which supports the employment and associated costs of a National Coordinator and Development Officers for the scheme.  The work of Community Alert continues to be highly valued and decisions on the precise level of funding which may be provided by my Department in 2014 will be made as soon as possible in the context of the available resources.</p></reply>

It remains the responsibility of all non-EEA nationals who are resident in the State to ensure that they have an appropriate permission from the Minister for Justice and Equality and the great majority of migrants comply with this condition.  It does not follow logically that the solution to illegal migration is for the Irish State to reward those who engage in it.</i></p><p><i>If a person is undocumented his/her case can be considered on its merits by officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department and part of this consideration involves looking at the extent to which the person's situation is through no fault of his/her own.  Sometimes this consideration will result in a positive outcome for the applicant.   In other cases, the  decision by the Irish authorities, subject to the oversight of our Courts, would be that the person has to go home.  That decision should be respected.</i></p><p><i>Broad regularisation programmes are problematic.  They could give rise to unpredictable and potentially very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services.  At EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments &quot;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&quot;.  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases.  In our case there are also significant considerations based on maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area with the UK which must be taken into account.</i><i>Any significant departure from well established policies in this respect would have a major impact on the operation of the Common Travel Area both here and in the United Kingdom.</i></p><p><i>  Finally, I note that a figure of 30,000 is cited on the number of illegal immigrants in the State; by definition it is impossible to state with any accuracy the number of persons without lawful permission to remain in the State and in this respect, Ireland is no different to any other country.</i></p></reply>

There are currently 41 coroners who service 47 coroner jurisdictions. Some coroners cover two jurisdictions, normally within a county.  Section 8 of the 1962 Act states that the coroner for a coroner's district shall be appointed by the local authority in whose area the district is situated. I understand that there are currently 16 coroners in the State who were appointed through the Local Appointments Commission process referred to in the 1962 Act. In addition, 25 coroners are engaged on an acting basis. Such coroners meet the critical current criteria for all coroners, that of being a lawyer or a doctor of more than five years professional experience.</p><p>  This situation in regard to acting coroners has been in place since the Report of the Coroners Review Group in 2000 as a preliminary policy approach to the reform of the coroner system. The Coroners Bill 2007 which is before the Seanad, having been restored to the Order Paper, provides for a comprehensive reform of the law, practice and structures in regard to the coroner service. The Bill envisaged a move towards having full time coroners as opposed to the current part time model.  The Bill is in the course of being reviewed in my Department and in that context all governance and administrative matters in relation to coroners will be examined to determine how reform can be achieved in a cost effective manner.</p><p>  The 1962 Act, in section 13 (1), provides that each coroner shall appoint a deputy coroner.  Such deputy coroner appointments must be approved by the relevant local authority and, following a statutory amendment in 2011, by the Minister for Justice and Equality. Under section 13(4)(a) of the Act a person appointed a deputy coroner may act for the coroner during the illness or absence of the coroner or where, for example, the office of coroner is vacant.  A deputy coroner acting as coroner has all the duties and powers of a coroner.  In addition a person who is appointed a deputy coroner must fulfil the requirements for appointment as a coroner. </p><p>  With regard to financial payments to coroners, the position is that such payments are made by local authorities. In this context there are, of course, statutory arrangements in place for auditing the accounts of local authorities and they fall within the remit of my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I have also been advised that currently there are two staff members serving in the Coroners' Service in Navan, Co Meath.  In 2012 an overall expenditure of approximately &euro;100,000 was incurred in respect of that office.</p></reply>

In this context the remuneration for a coroner is made up of a basic retainer, which  is intended to cover, for example, on-call duty and office expenses, and a fee per case which is paid in relation to work carried out on the following basis:</p><p>- Death reported: &euro;129.68;</p><p>- Death certified following post mortem: &euro;188.54; and</p><p>- Death certified following post mortem and inquest: &euro;522.97.</p><p>The following table shows the retainers payable in respect of each coronial district.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-19a.662.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900073#WRQ01600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 252 and 253 together.</p><p>  I can inform the Deputy that section 2 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 provides for the short term freezing of assets up to a period of 21 days.  This period may be extended in circumstances where the Criminal Assets Bureau brings subsequent proceedings within the 21 days under section 3 of the Act.  Assets the subject of section 3 proceedings remain frozen until such time as the proceedings are determined.</p><p>  In circumstances where the court determines that the assets represent directly or indirectly the proceeds of crime the assets remain frozen for a minimum statutory period of seven years (unless the respondent consents otherwise). After this period the Bureau may make an application to transfer the assets to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform pursuant to section 4 of the Act.  Of course, Officers of the Bureau continue to exercise their powers and functions as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners and as such assets may be seized through powers other than those available under the Proceeds of Crime legislation.  I am therefore advised that not all assets subject to investigations by the Bureau are seized but may simply be frozen whereby no dealing may be made with the assets without the leave of the Court. This would apply to such assets as bank accounts and interests in land or property.  Where an asset is capable of being seized (for example moveable assets), the Bureau moves to take possession of the asset as soon as practicable.  This also applies to assets over which a receiver is appointed by the High Court pursuant to section 7 of the Proceeds of Crime Act.</p><p>  With regard to current Bureau cases, I can say that the Bureau has a wide range of cases currently before the courts.  These include not only cases brought before the High Court under the Proceeds of Crime legislation but also cases under bankruptcy, judicial review, cases arising from appeals for decisions of the Tax Appeal Commissioners, summary proceedings before the High Court for the collection of taxes and also appeals arising under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act. At present, there are 24 cases before the courts but this number is subject to change on a daily basis as new cases are brought by or against the Bureau and others are disposed of.</p><p>  As outlined, and as the Deputy will appreciate, the Bureau utilises a range of available pieces of legislation to carry out its work.  It would not therefore be feasible, nor would it be appropriate, for me to outline all relevant processes applying in all circumstances where a court decision has been taken on foot of Bureau actions.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Annual Reports of the Bureau which provide details of the activities of the Bureau during the particular year, including detailed statistics concerning actions taken in accordance with the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime, Revenue and Social Welfare legislation.</p></reply>

I will therefore be including two particular measures in the forthcoming Gambling Control Bill that are targeted at this particular issue. These measures are in addition to a comprehensive set of new measures applicable to all operators. </p><p>  The first of the additional measures provides the basis for enhanced cooperation arrangements at the international level between regulators. These arrangements will facilitate contacts and exchanges of information between our authorities and their counterparts abroad, thereby making it very difficult for those operators trying to avoid detection.</p><p>  I am also proposing that the regulator may apply for Court orders to prevent, disrupt or obstruct receipt of the unlicensed service; these orders will result in what is commonly referred to as &quot;blocking&quot; of the website.  Orders may also restrict publicity, including advertising that refers in any way to the service, as well as prohibiting banks from executing financial transactions with the unlicensed operator.  </p><p>  I believe these measures will be effective but I am prepared to consider additional measures if they can be shown to add to the controls on these sites. </p></reply>

As part of the measures which are coordinated under Operation Fiacla, Operation Acer is in force throughout the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  It is an intelligence driven operation and includes analysis led checkpoints and patrols to target specific areas and case manage targeted offenders.

This would result in an end of year projected strength of 13,087.  This number includes those on career breaks (44) or work sharing arrangements (87 full time members reduced to 43.5 WTE's) but remain available to the Commissioner if the need arises.  Thus the Garda strength is expected to be over 13,000 at the end of the year.</p><p>  It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force and the responsibility of each Garda Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his or her Division taking everything into account, including retirements, the level of absenteeism due to illness, parental leave and other issues as work sharing arrangements.  Recruitment has commenced and new Garda trainees will enter the Garda College next year for the first time since 2009.

The usual acronym for such bodies is the term &quot;quango&quot;  which stands for &quot;quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations&quot;.  As the Deputy is asking whether my Department has any such bodies under its remit I can answer that there are no quasi autonomous NGO&rsquo;s which fall under the remit of my Department.</p><p>  In relation to Parliamentary Question 278 I am interpreting the Deputy&rsquo;s question in a broad manner so as to provide the information which I believe she is seeking.  In the context of the Deputy's question, State Agencies is taken to refer to statutory independent bodies, often (but not exclusively) with a Board which has governance oversight responsibility for an organisation.  In this regard I have detailed below the sixteen agencies under my remit. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; Courts Service; Equality Authority and Human Rights Commission (to be merged); Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission; Irish Film Classification Office; Insolvency Service of Ireland; Legal Aid Board; Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board; National Disability Authority; Office of the Data Protection Commissioner; Office of the Inspector of Prisons; Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner; Private Security Authority; Property Registration Authority (to be merged with the Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSI) and Valuation Office); Property Services Regulatory Authority; Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p><p>  Many of the above bodies of course do not have Chairpersons.  However, I can inform the Deputy that there are four chairpersons of State Boards, Agencies and Regulators who were chairpersons when I became Minister and still continue to be.  Those details are provided below: Mental Health Review Board; National Disability Authority; Property Registration Authority; Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland.</p><p>  Finally, as the Deputy is aware, the radical streamlining of State bodies is a key deliverable of the Public Service Reform Plan, published in November 2011.  As part of the implementation of the Reform Plan, the Government announced on 31 October 2012 that it would proceed with the merger of the Property Registration Authority with the Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland.  Work is underway to advance the implementation of the merger under the supervision of a Project Board comprised of senior officials from the three Government Departments concerned and the Chief Executive Officers of the three Agencies.  The merger is expected to deliver considerable efficiencies and synergies.</p></reply>

Defence (Amendment) Act 2011 &ndash; The Act provides for amendments to the Defence Acts to expand the potential candidature for appointment to the post of Military Judge and the Director of Military prosecutions to persons other than members of the Defence Forces and for an amendment to the powers of the Selection Committee to determine a candidate&rsquo;s qualification for appointment to these posts.  It also provides for the appointment of a Circuit Court Judge to perform the functions of the Military Judge where the Military Judge is not available.  2. Civil Defence Act 2012 - This Act repealed the Civil Defence Act 2002, dissolved the Civil Defence Board and transferred its functions, property, rights, liabilities and other responsibilities back to the Department of Defence. 3. Defence Forces (Second World War Amnesty and Immunity) Act 2012 - The Act provides for the granting of an amnesty and apology to those members of the Defence Forces who served with forces fighting on the Allied side<i></i>during<i></i>World War II<i></i>and who were subsequently found guilty by a military tribunal or who were dismissed from the Defence Forces pursuant to the provisions of the Emergency Powers (No. 362) Order 1945.  In addition, it also provides immunity from prosecution, to those who were, or who still are, liable to be prosecuted for desertion or being absent without leave.</p><p>  There have been no Regulatory Impact Assessments carried out by my Department since March 2011.  The Department of Defence is not a regulatory authority as commonly understood.  The Defence Acts and Regulations made thereunder are for the most part, focused on the Defence Forces only and do not apply to the ordinary citizen or to business.  Notwithstanding this, the Department applies the principles set out in the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) Guidelines issued by the Department of the Taoiseach where appropriate.  The following proposed Bills are included on the Government Legislation Programme for publication during 2014: 1. Defence (Amendment) (Discipline) Bill &ndash; This Bill will amend the remaining provisions of Part V of the Defence Act, 1954 in relation to disciplinary and certain other matters.  2. Red Cross (Amendment) Act &ndash; This Bill will repeal the 1938 Red Cross Act and ancillary legislation and put in place a new legal framework for the Irish Red Cross Society.  3. Defence (Amendment) Bill &ndash; This Bill will provide for further revision of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006, to specify certain preparatory activities associated with the despatch of personnel overseas which can take place in advance of a United Nations Security Council Resolution.  Further to the above, my Department has no plans to publish Regulatory Impact Assessments in respect of any of the above Bills.</p></reply>

To date this year, some &euro;2.94 million has been paid by my Department to local authorities to assist their work in Control of Horse&rsquo;s Act operations. </p><p>  While local authorities do make efforts to re-home horses to responsible new owners, the reality is that this is not possible in all cases. The advice from the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council (which comprises representatives from a wide range of stakeholder organisations including farming, equine and welfare bodies) is to humanely dispose of horses, where there is no possibility of re-homing or returning to owner. </p><p>  My Department also provides considerable financial support to animal welfare organisations to assist them in the delivery of animal care and welfare services including in relation to equines.

I plan to make an allocation shortly in respect of the coming year.</p><p>  The following table, based on returns to my Department from local authorities sets out details of horses seized under the Control of Horses Act in the period 2010 to date.<table><tr><th>Name of  County/City Council</th><th>No. Horses Seized 2010</th><th>No. Horses Seized 2011</th><th>No. Horses Seized 2012</th><th>No.<br /><br />Horses<br /><br />Seized<br /><br />2013</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>18</td><td>18</td><td>27</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>11</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Clare </td><td>24</td><td>50</td><td>66</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County </td><td>134</td><td>144</td><td>161</td><td>15961</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City </td><td>152</td><td>123</td><td>51</td><td>134</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>20</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City </td><td>446</td><td>342</td><td>254</td><td>249</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown </td><td>23</td><td>38</td><td>7</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal (Dublin)</td><td>341</td><td>161</td><td>145</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Galway City</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>50</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Galway County</td><td>45</td><td>52</td><td>84</td><td>295</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>20</td><td>28</td><td>21</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>66</td><td>103</td><td>130</td><td>245</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>92</td><td>91</td><td>80</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>61</td><td>185</td><td>243</td><td>168</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>26</td><td>40</td><td>18</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City</td><td>179</td><td>259</td><td>215</td><td>91</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick County</td><td>144</td><td>113</td><td>123</td><td>158</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>16</td><td>8</td><td>39</td><td>115</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>20</td><td>193</td><td>200</td><td>143</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>6</td><td>83</td><td>84</td><td>159</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>7</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>14</td><td>59</td><td>0</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>19</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>138</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>22</td><td>81</td><td>34</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin</td><td>133</td><td>304</td><td>379</td><td>257</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary North</td><td>103</td><td>125</td><td>91</td><td>82</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary South</td><td>45</td><td>28</td><td>51</td><td>89</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City</td><td>38</td><td>7</td><td>40</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford County</td><td>4</td><td>14</td><td>5</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>25</td><td>96</td><td>109</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>74</td><td>30</td><td>63</td><td>107</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>112</td><td>138</td><td>151</td><td>202</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>2418</td><td>2936</td><td>2969</td><td>3488</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Given the adverse financial climate in which we all find ourselves, I am very pleased to see this level of payments being made and I think it reflects very positively on all involved. The injection of over &euro;1.4 billion into the rural economy in the relatively short, three-month period since payments commenced, benefits not only individual farmers, but also those businesses with whom farmers interact on a daily basis. </p><p>  I can confirm that the balancing payments under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme started issuing, on target, as and from 2 December. Given their importance to farmers and the wider rural community, I was determined that the payment targets be met. The reason these levels of payments can be successfully delivered year-on-year is due, in very large part, to the very good working relationship between farmers and my Department.

Each year farmers in Ireland benefit from funding of over &euro;1.5 billion under Schemes such as the Single Farm Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the Agri-Environment Schemes, etc. This comprises the entire net income of many thousands of Irish farmers.  The European Commission has an obligation to ensure that Member States manage and use the EU funding granted to them in accordance with the provisions and consequent restrictions governing the Schemes and general financial provisions. Under the Common Agricultural Policy, this is done by way of a Clearance of Accounts procedure.  This is a formal process and both the Commission and Member States are obliged to adhere to the requirements laid down in the legislation.</p><p>  In general, the process involves audit missions to the Member State by Commission officials; follow-up correspondence between the two parties on the findings of the mission and the observations and remedial actions undertaken by the Member States.  There is also a formal bi-lateral meeting between the two parties followed by further correspondence.  At the end of this phase, the Commission issues its letter of findings.  The Member State has the right to ask for the matter to be reviewed by the Conciliation Body.  This body will review the case and seek written and oral observations from each party.  It will make its recommendations and the Commission will consider these before arriving at its final definitive decision.  Ultimately it is open to each Member State to initiate legal proceedings in the European Court of Justice in relation to the Clearance decision.</p><p>  In the case of Ireland, the Clearance procedure is currently covering five financial years involving the 2008 to 2012 scheme-years. The total amount of EU funds under audit scrutiny in the process is approximately &euro;7.5 billion. I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s case and the position of Irish farmers is strenuously argued during the process. It should be noted that as the bi-lateral took place on 25 July 2013, there will be further correspondence and discussions between both parties before any conclusion is reached.</p><p>  I can also reassure the Deputy that every effort is being made to protect the interests of all Irish farmers during the process including the interest of that majority of farmers, who were fully compliant in the declarations they made on an annual basis under the Schemes.  This is an extremely serious process.  During the years 2002 to 2012, the Commission imposed financial corrections amounting to almost &euro;5 billion on Member States.  Ireland&rsquo;s share of this total amounted to 0.5% of the total amount corrected &ndash; one of the lowest percentages among Member States.  Under the EU Regulations, the Commission has to right to impose a flat-rate correction of 2%, 5%, 10% or greater depending of its assessment of the risk to the EU Fund involved &ndash; a 2% correction on the 2008 &ndash; 2012 scheme years would mean a loss of &euro;150m in funding to Ireland.  On the other hand, the level of the correction can be based on the assessed risk if the Member State can establish the risk and the Commission are satisfied with the calculations. In such circumstances,  if the risk is dealt with by the Member State by collecting the debts arising from the over-payments, the amounts collected is taken into account by the Commission in its final assessment.  This is the approach Ireland is following.</p><p>  Finally, there is comprehensive appeals system in place.  The appeal process will initially involve a desk review based on the application and supporting documentation secured by Department&rsquo;s staff.  As I have already mentioned, a series of on the spot farm verifications have begun and will be ramped up in the coming weeks to examine farms on an individual basis.  If the applicant is dissatisfied with the outcome of the appeal, he or she can appeal to the independent Appeals Committee, chaired by Mr Padraig Gibbons.</p></reply>

Pensions, earnings, interest from capital and all other sources of income are included in the means test. </p><p>  The gross income limits for a single person is currently &euro;600 per week and &euro;1,200 per week, in the case of a couple. Under Budget 2014, it was announced that income limits for the over-70s medical card would be set at &euro;500 per week and &euro;900 per week for a single person and a couple, respectively. In setting the limits, the Government recognises that the living costs of an individual living alone are more than half the living costs of a couple living together and that expenditure does not necessarily diminish relative to the number of people in the household. This is reflected, inter alia, through the provision of the Living Alone Increase and differential income limits for medical cards for persons aged under 70 years between individuals and couples. Furthermore, in the assessment for Supplementary Welfare Allowance, a differential applies whereby the rate for a dependent qualified adult is not half the personal rate of the applicant.</p><p>  In that context, the over-70s income limit for a single person has been reduced proportionately less than the income limit for a couple.</p></reply>

Discussions are continuing with the HSE on establishing the PSA initially on an administrative basis within the HSE structures in 2014. This will allow the PSA to become an identifiable entity within the HSE and facilitate a smooth transition of certain functions undertaken by the HSE to the PSA. It is intended that the PSA will ensure an identifiable and distinct leadership responsibility for patient safety and quality at national level, having regard to the need for a robust quality and safety function within the new delivery structures of the Reform Programme. The main priorities for the PSA will be to ensure that patients, their families and carers experience high quality care, as well as ensuring the provision of care which is safe and protects patients from harm.  The PSA will seek to ensure that the care provided is effective and based on the best available evidence and is integrated to support the smooth transition of patients across different care settings.</p><p>  My Department is working with the HSE's Patient Safety Directorate and the State Claims Agency on the use of data which will be generated by the upgraded National Adverse Event Management System (NAEMS).   Phase 1 of the upgrade of the system aims to provide enhanced intelligent adverse event entry screens together with enhanced and powerful reporting capabilities in locations covered by the Clinical Indemnity Scheme.  The State Claims Agency has established an implementation group including representatives of the voluntary hospitals and the HSE. Training will be provided to those who are involved in the existing STARweb adverse event reporting system, and to relevant managers and clinical leads. It is also planned to introduce the system to the staff that will interface with the new system at &quot;point of occurrence&quot;.</p><p>  Phase 2 of the upgrade involves enabling the functionality on the system to provide end to end adverse event management, root cause analysis and policy audit tools.  This will commence roll out in early 2014. The provision of performance benchmarks on clinical and non-clinical risk and claims performance, which will underpin a risk pooling approach to the Clinical Indemnity Scheme, will be developed during 2014. The roll out of the new system will commence with a pilot in a small number of sites, and the system will be expanded to all other sites during 2014.</p></reply>

The first stage in transforming this funding model is to clarify funding streams through the creation of directorates and corresponding programme based budgets. In Vote terms, programme based budgets have already been established for the Primary Care Reimbursement Service and NHSS - Fair Deal.  During 2013, due to the imminent establishment of the Child and Family Agency, the determination of a Children and Family Services budget took primacy, given the need to transfer the provision from the Vote of the Health Service Executive to the Vote of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>  My Department will continue to work with the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to develop a new Programme Based Budgeting system.  However, given the multitude of financial systems in operation in the HSE, this work will be dependant on the development and roll out of an integrated financial management system.  Under the direction of the Finance Reform Board, and with my full support and approval, the HSE is now finalising a business case for submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

Its overall intention was to review the state of the financial management system in place in the health sector in Ireland at the time in the context of the serious overruns projected to occur in 2012, the continuation of a challenging financial environment for the foreseeable future and the radical reforms envisioned in the Programme for Government.</p><p>  The report made a number of recommendations to improve the financial management process within the HSE, with particular reference to managing the transition phase that the health sector was undergoing. The recommendations were grouped into 3 distinct areas: Improving Financial Performance; Policy Considerations; and Effective Transitioning (Managing the Change).  These are set out in the attached table.</p><p>  As part of the process of further strengthening the financial management of the HSE, additional independent expertise was engaged to evaluate the financial performance management system and a Finance Reform Board has been established comprising the HSE Director General (Chair), senior HSE management and representatives from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  Proposals regarding the development and roll out of an integrated financial management system have been endorsed by the Board, with my full support and approval, and the HSE is now finalising a business case for submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>A REVIEW OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN THE IRISH HEALTH SERVICE</p><p>Main Recommendations<table><tr><th>1.

A significant number of the projects underway show how aspects of the new policy will work in practice and will provide a substantial contribution towards the transition to the new model of person-centred supports.

Under its provisions, persons residing in Ireland who are attached to the social security system of another member state are entitled to receive health care services in Ireland at the cost of that member state, provided they are not subject to Irish social security legislation.  Persons in this category are entitled to full eligibility and receive a medical card as evidence of their entitlement.  An estimate on the cost of the issuance of such medical cards under EU Regulation 883/04 is not available.  </p><p>  The EU Regulations provide for the costs to be reimbursed between member states.  The Regulations also allow for two or more states to agree alternative arrangements for reimbursement other than those laid down in the Regulations, or to mutually waive reimbursement altogether.  Ireland has had waiver agreements with a number of member states whereby costs arising under the application of the Regulations were mutually waived.  Many of these agreements have been terminated in recent years.  In view of this and of the increased numbers availing of services since the EU was expanded, the Health Service Executive intends pursuing the recoupment of costs from other member states.  The Executive is currently in the process of preparing claims for recoupment of costs associated with medical cards issued under EU Regulations with a view to issuing these claims in 2014.  The Health Service Executive is also currently working on systems to capture costs associated with the provision of healthcare under the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) so as to enable it to commence the issuing of claims for reimbursement of costs to the relevant competent member states in the near future.</p><p>  It must be noted that Ireland's primary interaction has been and continues to be with the United Kingdom with whom it operates a bilateral healthcare reimbursement agreement, covering such persons as temporary visitors between the two countries, pensioners of one country and their dependants residing in the other country, and the dependant families of persons employed in the other country.  Under the terms of the agreement net liability between the two countries is calculated on a lump sum basis rather than an individual basis. The payment made in any one year is based on an estimate of the number of persons falling within categories eligible for reimbursement and for whom each country is liable and an estimate of the the average cost of providing healthcare treatment.  The amount received by Ireland from the United Kingdom in respect of reimbursement of healthcare costs provided under the relevant EU Regulations was &euro;220 million in 2012.  A similar amount has been received this year.</p></reply>

This reflects a significant level of ongoing vacancies and difficulties in attracting candidates for these posts following recruitment campaigns in Ireland.  </p><p>  While a considerable number of nurses graduate each year, approximately 1,500, it is not possible to offer the vacant posts to such graduates. Candidates for these posts would be required to have  considerable experience and to have undertaken a higher diploma programme. Recent graduates, therefore, would not be eligible. </p><p>  One of the main considerations in developing the Nurse Graduate Scheme was the need to retain recently qualified nurses at a time when job opportunities in the public service are very limited. The Scheme supports the retention of recently qualified graduate nurses and midwives within the Irish health system and enables them to gain valuable work experience and development opportunities post-graduation. In time they could pursue careers as theatre and critical care specialists.</p></reply>

I am advised that the SCA, wherever it is proper to do so, based on expert medical and legal advice, admits breach of duty at the earliest possible opportunity to avoid distress to patients and their families. Many of these cases however, particularly those involving catastrophic injuries, are very complex in nature and require time to investigate the liability and causation issues. This inevitably involves some delay before a formal admission of liability, if appropriate, can be made.    </p><p>In relation to medical malpractice generally, on Tuesday 12 November this year, the HSE launched National Open Disclosure Policy, Guidelines and supporting documents following on from a joint HSE State Claims Agency national pilot project in relation to Open Disclosure.  Open Disclosure is defined as &ldquo;  <i>an open consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in healthcare.

My Department will be insisting on structured induction programmes for all new Board members and a system of independent regular governance audits.  </p><p>  As part of these new induction programmes it will be made clear to new Board members of Section 38 agencies that they have no discretion to make extra payments to staff which are not encompassed by and in line with the Department&rsquo;s consolidated salary scales.  All health sector agencies will be encouraged to publish details of payments, whether salary or otherwise, to all senior managers and senior clinicians in their annual reports and to make details easily accessible on websites.</p><p>  All State agencies under the aegis of, or funded by, the Department of Health are also subject to the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies issued by the Department of Finance and the Framework for Corporate and Financial Governance issued by the Department of Health. Line Units within the Department with governance responsibility for individual agencies meet regularly throughout the year with the agencies concerned to monitor compliance in this regard.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) funds a range of service providers under section 38 or section 39 of the Health Act 2004. The staff in bodies funded under Section 38 of the Health Act, 2004 are classified as public servants and are subject to the standard salary scales for the health sector as well as having public service pension schemes and being counted in public service employment numbers. Employees of agencies that receive grants from the HSE under Section 39 are not public servants and are not specifically subject to the salary scales approved for public servants. </p><p>  The HSE itself is also committed to the development of effective working relationships in line with the provisions of the Health Act 2004 and significant progress has been made in improving the governance and management framework between the HSE and voluntary service providers. A Register of Non-Statutory Agencies covering Service Arrangements and Grant Aid Agreements is in operation.  This provides information on Agencies and facilitates the maintenance of key data on funding arrangements including compliance with requirements under the HSE's formalised national governance framework to manage the funding provided to voluntary organisations. These Governance Documents provide a national standard consistent with the application of good governance and are subject to regular review. </p><p>  In 2013 an additional information return was also added to all Service Arrangements, both Section 38 and 39, requiring agencies to separately report on all individual staff paid at Grade 8 level equivalent or above, detailing their salary including allowances and any other benefits paid. The HSE&rsquo;s internal audit service also provides audit reviews of Agencies either on an individual Agency basis, a sample basis, or across a range of agencies on a specific topic such as the recent Section 38 Agencies Remuneration Audit. The results of these audits have influenced the documentation reviews and also recommendations relating to management structures and corporate processes.</p></reply>

Under EU Regulation (EC) 883/04 persons who are linked to another EU/EEA State for Social Security purposes and who are visiting or on temporary stay in another State are entitled to necessary health care if they become ill or injured while on a temporary stay.  States are entitled to seek reimbursement of the cost of the provision of these services to individuals from the State which is "competent" for the client concerned, i.e. the State which issued the EHIC.  The cost of the provision of such care to persons holding EHICs issued by Ireland is currently in the region of &euro;5.0 million per annum.</p></reply>

These include consultant availability for rostering for any five days out of seven as opposed to weekdays and rostering of consultants on a 16/7 (8 a.m. to midnight) or 24/7 basis in services where this is required.</p><p>  The ability of hospitals to schedule and complete elective procedures is dependent on the availability of sufficient bed and theatre capacity.  In periods where high levels of ED admissions occur, this has an inevitable impact on that capacity.  In instances where there is insufficient bed and/or theatre capacity, the HSE may decide, in consultation with hospital management, to outsource elective treatment to other hospitals which have available capacity at that time.</p><p>  In order to reverse the trend in inpatient and daycase waiting list performance since the start of the year, the SDU/NTPF together with the HSE have developed a national intervention strategy.  All hospitals have commenced necessary action plans to get as close as possible to the national wait time target of 8 months by 31st December, with further decreases in the numbers waiting anticipated before year end.  The HSE is focusing this year on further improving access wait times for both unscheduled care and scheduled care programmes.  In the period from 25/7/2013 to 21/11/2013 there has been a 5% reduction in total numbers waiting and a 42% reduction in total numbers waiting longer than 8 months with the previous growth trend in inpatient/daycare lists now reversed.</p><p>  In terms of usage of private capacity, for public patients in both hospitals and private nursing homes, this is not a new practice; it was first introduced through the National Treatment Purchase Fund in 2003. </p></reply>

The current turnaround is 95.7%. within 15 days.</p><p>  The length of time that it takes for applicants to receive a decision on their medical card applications depends on whether a completed application form was submitted, and if not, how quickly the applicants respond to the subsequent request for additional information.  Applications that remain in process outside of the 15 day period due to incomplete applications, and where the applicant is engaging with the process, are facilitated so that eligibility may be retained in the interim.  Once the documentation is received, their assessment is prioritised without delay.  This process applies to renewal applications also.</p><p>  If a person is a new applicant presenting with an urgent medical need or an urgent medical need in respect of their dependant(s), the HSE will facilitate a prioritised assessment of eligibility, once the applicant has provided all the information necessary.</p><p>  All medical card and GP visit card holders are subject to a periodic review of eligibility to determine continuing eligibility.  Each month, the HSE analyses the Medical Card Register to identify those medical/GP visit cards which are scheduled for review within three months.  A review notification will indicate the card holder should complete a self-assessment or request the card holder to return evidence of household income, assessable outgoings and medical circumstances to enable a full review assessment be conducted by the HSE.  The HSE has increased this time line to four months in respect of those clients who were granted eligibility on the basis of discretion to allow an additional month to ensure that all pertinent medical and other data is provided for inclusion in the assessment process.  All customers scheduled for review are notified and a balance of either full reviews or self-assessments is conducted. </p><p>  A reminder letter is issued a month later if the requested review form details have not been returned at that point.  If a person does not return the review form within the time specified, continuing eligibility cannot be confirmed and the medical card cannot be reissued.  In these circumstances, or where the review process establishes that a person no longer holds eligibility, the eligibility ceases.  Persons are requested to return their completed review forms at least one month in advance of the due expiry date of their existing eligibility, in order to give the HSE sufficient time to carry out the review and/or to get back to the individuals, if the application is incomplete or requires any further details to be furnished. </p><p>  Where a review form is returned, but not fully completed by the expiry date, it is HSE policy to extend the eligibility of the client for a reasonable period of time until the review is carried out and a final decision made on the person's continuing eligibility, once there is appropriate communication from the client.  Medical card holders who genuinely engage with the review of their medical card eligibility will not have their eligibility withdrawn before that review is complete. </p><p>  GPs are advised three months in advance of the review dates of their patients&rsquo; GP visit cards/medical cards and, subsequently, the following month and the month after that, if the patient has not returned the review form by that time.   </p><p>  GPs have full electronic visibility of the medical card panel of patients available to them and have the facility to electronically allow temporary extension of eligibility for expiring cards where a sensitive renewal is appropriate.  The temporary extension may also be allowed where they are aware that a person is still availing of services but there may be something that prevents them from carrying out a standard review, e.g. a blind person with little family support.  GPs can also add new babies to existing cards.  All GPs have appropriate electronic access to the medical card eligibility database and they do not have to confirm medical card details by contacting HSE PCRS.   </p><p>  It should be noted that each person who has eligibility to a medical card/GP visit card receives a plastic card on which a 'valid to' date is printed.  This is the latest date that a review may be conducted in respect of that person.  Notwithstanding the 'valid to' date printed on the card, the HSE  may also carry out random reviews of continued eligibility, to ensure that people who hold cards are still eligible, based on national guidelines.  </p></reply>

The introduction of roadworthiness testing for motorcycles is part of wider roadworthiness proposals currently under discussion at EU level between the EU Commission, EU Council and the European Parliament. The present proposals provide for the mandatory testing of motorcycles in excess of 125cc by 1st of January 2022, unless already provided for in EU Member States national legislation.

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for each local authority.   The Irish Government supported the original decision by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) to approve the allocation of EU funding to the Narrow Water bridge project and committed an upfront funding contribution of &euro;3.9 million in January this year. The funding which was to be provided by my Department for the Narrow Water Bridge Project represented a significant commitment given the current financial circumstances. This funding contribution was due to be matched with a contribution from the Northern Ireland authorities in line with the agreed funding ratios for the Programme. </p><p>  The Government was disappointed that the tender process resulted in a doubling of the initial estimated cost budgeted for by the project partners for the construction of the bridge. The Government has indicated on many occasions that it would be willing to help to address the shortfall in funding for the Narrow Water Bridge, but this depended entirely on matching contributions from the other parties, including the Northern Ireland Executive. Also, we could not agree to be solely responsible for any further overruns.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, as part of the recovery programme that this Government has had to pursue to put the country back on its feet, unfortunately, there will be a further reduction in regional and local roads spending in 2014 of over &euro;60 million. Ultimately it is from this budget that any additional funding from this State would have had to come and we would not have been in a position to provide a further &euro;10 million towards this project as well as to underwrite any potential further overspend. The estimated figure of a requirement from my Department of &euro;10 million was based on correspondence received from SEPUB and Louth County Council. Given the significant difference between the initial estimates and the returned tender prices, the Deputy will  appreciate the need to take a conservative approach to the funding requests.</p><p>  The progression and importance of this project has been discussed with my government colleagues and on a number of occasions at the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) most recently on the 8th of November. The priority is to avoid the loss of the EU funding involved. </p><p>  It is important to note that there are time constraints with regard to the INTERREG funding. It has to be spent by 2015. SEUPB has now decided to withdraw the letter of offer and has indicated that it proposes to re-allocate the funding to eligible projects capable of being delivered before the end of 2015. I know that officials in my Department and the Department for Regional Development have identified possible replacement projects, that will benefit cross-border communication in the transport sector and are working up proposals for consideration by SEUPB.</p></reply>

This policy recognises that the best outcomes in terms of prices and connectivity are likely to come from a healthy competitive market with multiple airlines competing on multiple routes.  Since Ryanair was first set up in the 1980s, Irish aviation policy has favoured having at least two major Irish airlines competing with each other. In addition the policy has encouraged multiple foreign airlines to also serve the Irish market. This policy has served the country and the aviation sector well.</p><p>  Between them the two largest Irish airlines, Aer Lingus and Ryanair, currently provide over 80% of the seat capacity in the Irish market, thus making the competitive dynamic between these two airlines particularly important. However, increasing consolidation in the airline industry, both in Europe and globally, is likely to have implications for Irish airlines and indeed the number of foreign airlines operating in the Irish market in the future.</p><p>  This issue is one of the many raised in the consultation document issued by my Department as part of the review of national aviation policy that is currently underway. The next step in that policy review will be the publication of a draft National Aviation Policy Statement early in the New Year. There will be a further opportunity for stakeholder input at that point and I expect that  the final policy document will be published during the first half of 2014.</p></reply>

All of our main target overseas markets show growth levels with the number of visits from Mainland Europe up 5.6% for the first ten months of 2013; the number of visits from Great Britain was up by 5.1%; the number of visits from North America was up by 14.6% for the first ten months while there was a 14.4% increase in the number of visits from other long-haul markets.  In terms of future growth, I am confident that measures such as the retention of the lower VAT rate for tourism services, the reduction of the air travel tax to zero and the increased air access to Ireland will ensure that Irish tourism continues to grow in 2014 and beyond.  I  recently launched the Tourism Ireland 2014 Marketing Plans which aim to grow visit numbers by a further 4% in 2014. The agency is also finalising its three year Corporate plan which will include targets for the 2014 to 2016 period. With regard to longer term policy,  the Tourism Policy Review was launched on 11th September 2013 by Minister Ring and I.  It was launched with the publication of an issues paper and request for submissions.  The level of interest has been such that I extended the deadline for receipt of responses to the public consultation to 22 November 2013. The views raised and other relevant evidence and analysis will now be considered, feeding into the drafting of the new policy in the New Year with a view to finalising it by Easter 2014. This review will consider what types of targets are appropriate for the tourism industry in the medium to long term (i.e. visitor numbers or tourism revenue) and the appropriate levels of such targets.</p><p>   </p></reply>

In relation to the US market, 2014 will also see the introduction of a year round service between San Francisco and Dublin and additional year round capacity from both Boston and New York to Shannon. This positive outlook for 2014 will help the tourist industry to build on the success of The Gathering 2013 and help further increase employment in the sector.</p><p>   </p><p>   </p></reply>

The hosting of major sports events, both participative and spectator sports, can provide a great showcase for Ireland, drive international visitor numbers and the media coverage of sports tourism events helps to put Ireland onto travel itineraries as a holiday destination.</p><p>  Accordingly I am supportive of the ongoing efforts of the Tourism Agencies and the National Governing Bodies of Sport to attract international events, subject, of course, to an assessment of the costs/benefits involved in any State financial support.</p><p>  In this regard, I look forward to the Giro d'Italia and the Penn State-UCL American Football game coming to Ireland next year.</p><p>  Other important sporting events take place each year, for example the GAA All-Ireland series, the Six Nations rugby and the Irish Open. Where appropriate, the tourism bodies work with these and other sporting bodies to maximise the tourism benefit of events.  For example, the Irish Open receives significant support from F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</p></reply>

This meeting followed up on a series of regional seminars which took place during October and November throughout the country. The views expressed at these seminars together with the submissions received in response to the Policy Review consultation document issued by my Department will be analysed before the drafting of a new tourism policy commences in the New Year.  The Tourism Policy Statement, when finalised, will set out clearly my priorities for future tourism policy.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware tourism makes a very significant contribution to employment in Ireland's economy and the Government has strongly supported employment growth in the sector, in particular through the reduced VAT rate. I am heartened to see that these initiatives have had a positive impact as the most recently published figures by the CSO show that, seasonally adjusted, employment in the Accommodation and Food Services sector increased by 14,200 or 12% to 133,300 in the twelve months to the end of September 2013, which is its highest level in Quarter 3 since 2007.</p></reply>

In relation to maximising the options to the public in terms of an integrated and co-ordinated transport system, this is an important consideration when it comes to future decisions on transport investment. In making decisions as to future expenditure on transport, my Department has been active to ensure that a co-ordinated approach is taken and that we do not look at land, maritime or aviation transport in isolation from each other. In previous times, this was a legitimate criticism of transport investment but I believe that, in recent years, this problem has been addressed.  At a European level, my Department has been and will continue to actively engage with Trans European Network for Transport (TEN-T) and to ensure it is integrated into Irish transport policy making. The TEN-T regulations set out a multi-modal transport network across the European Union and aims to ensure integration between the various modes. This multi-modal policy is supported by domestic policy such as the new National Ports Policy that I launched in March. For example the National Ports Policy's designation of Shannon-Foynes Port, Dublin Port and the Port of Cork as Ports of National Significance (Tier One) and Rosslare Europort and the Port of Waterford as Ports of National Significance (Tier Two) mirrors the TEN-T designations of these ports as Core and Comprehensive ports on the TEN-T network. These designations are then taken into account by the National Transport Authority and the National Roads Authority when decisions are then being made in terms of future planning.</p><p>  Other policy work is ongoing in my Department and I expect to publish two significant new transport policy papers in 2014. An aviation policy is now approaching completion while in relation to land transport, work on developing a strategic framework for investment in land transport is on-going. Both the framework for investment and the aviation policy will help provide further clarity about transport priorities and will help to ensure that there is appropriate co-ordination and integration between the various modes. In a similar vein, the National Transport Authority have a statutory remit to develop an integrated transport plan for the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) and they are currently in the process of completing their implementation plan for transport investment in the GDA for the period to 2018. </p></reply>
