High Representative Ashton, on behalf of the EU, has also expressed her deep concern at the Israeli government&rsquo;s announcement in a statement issued on 2 December.  It is negative and highly damaging to any prospect of peace for Israel to announce this measure in response to an action at the United Nations which, while unwelcome to Israel, was an entirely legitimate political move, and one which was supported by the overwhelming majority of the nations of the world. The acceleration in the overall pace of settlement expansion is also deeply troubling with these settlement measures only the latest in a succession of major settlement announcements which have clearly been in planning for some time. </p><p>  It is also deeply troubling that, at a moment when the Palestinians were signalling that their success at the UN would permit them to re-enter direct negotiations with Israel, that the response of the Israeli Government should be such an action which directly threatens that prospect. It must be reiterated that not only is the entire settlement enterprise contrary to international law, but that the continued expansion of settlements is simply incompatible with the achievement of a comprehensive peace. It is very difficult therefore to do other than conclude that the Israeli Government is not genuinely committed to a negotiated peace deal, unless it moves at once to rescind these decisions.</p><p>  Following agreement on a concerted response at EU level, the Israeli Ambassador was invited in to my Department on 4 December and asked to convey to his Government our deep concern and disappointment at these decisions, and our view that they must be reversed. I understand that a number of EU partners have acted similarly. I expect to be further discussing this matter, and other recent developments, with my colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday, 10 December.  In relation to settlement products, I have recently written to the Deputy and to all Deputies setting out in detail my views on this issue.</p></reply>

These policy issues include clearly determining who is the owner of the Child Benefit payment, whether by taxing the payment, there follows an entitlement to the PAYE tax credit, how the payment is treated for tax purposes in the hands of jointly assessed couples and legal issues surrounding the tax treatment of married couples and co-habiting couples. I understand that the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, established by the Minister for Social Protection, has considered these and other issues in relation to Child Benefit in the context of a report on child and family income supports which is being considered by the Minister. </p><p>  In view of the considerable legal and policy issues involved, it is extremely difficult to estimate the likely yield as a result of taxing Child Benefit. I am advised that the estimated full year yield, based on projected 2013 incomes, could be of the order of &euro;395 million on a 2012 basis, if the Child Benefit were fully taxable as the income of the assessable person in joint assessment cases, and that no new tax threshold, exemption, allowance or personal reliefs would be introduced to offset some of the tax.  </p><p>  Regarding the implementation of any decisions the Government might make, I am further informed that, were the legal and policy issues resolved and legislated for, there are very well established data exchange arrangements in place between Revenue and the Department of Social Protection that could be extended to facilitate the taxation of Child Benefit once there is a suitable lead-in time and resources to facilitate the ICT changes required by both the Department of Social Protection and Revenue.</p></reply>

The tobacco products tax on roll-your-own tobacco is &#8364;248.608 per kilogram.  Details of the tobacco products tax rates applicable to all tobacco products are available on <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>.  The price and tax component of cigarettes in Ireland are amongst the highest in the EU.  Following the Budget increase, the price of 20 cigarettes in the most popular price category is &#8364;9.30.  The total tax (VAT inclusive) on this product is &#8364;7.31. The Budget increase amounts to an increase in tax of 10 cents (VAT inclusive) on a pack of 20 cigarettes in the most popular price category. The increase on roll-your own tobacco amounts to an increase in tax, inclusive of VAT, of approximately 60 cent per 25g pack.</p></reply>

These securities are publicly traded and dealt through market participants and settled by clearing house systems. An issuer does not have any access to the records of the clearing house. At maturity, the bank will instruct its paying agent to transfer the funds due to the clearing house who will then distribute the funds to the holders of the securities as per their records. Even where the bank is presented with lists purporting to represent names of bondholders, I am informed there is no way for the bank or anyone else to verify such lists.  In the circumstances the Deputy will appreciate that there is no way to identify, with certainty, the names of the remaining bondholders.</p></reply>

If an entity wishes to establish a single payments platform for credit unions, this activity may require authorisation under the European Communities (Payment Services) Regulations 2009 (PSRs) as it may constitute a &ldquo;payment service&rdquo; within the meaning of the PSRs.  The Central Bank advises me that due to the confidentiality provisions set out in Section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942 it is not in a position to confirm whether any such application has been received to date.</p><p>  An entity seeking authorisation as a payment institution pursuant to the PSRs would be required to submit an application for authorisation to the Central Bank in accordance with Regulation 10 of the PSRs.  Regulation 11 sets out the capital requirements. Regulation 21 provides that within three months of the receipt of an application (or, if the application is incomplete, of all the information required for the decision), the Central Bank will inform the applicant concerned whether the authorisation has been granted or refused. </p></reply>

Directive 2003/96/EC known as the Energy Tax Directive (ETD) refers. The current ETD provides for minimum excise rates of taxation for energy products based on the volume of a product released for consumption. Member States must respect the minimum rates and not tax products below those rates, but are free to set higher rates for individual fuels as they see fit. The current Irish national rates are generally above the EU minimum rates.  The aim of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal is to revise the ETD to bring it in line with wider EU climate change and energy policy to which all Members States have signed up. Ireland broadly supports the principle of the proposal and welcomes the introduction of a carbon tax element into the EU minimum rates; it will serve to lessen competitiveness concerns arising from Ireland being a lead country in the area of carbon taxes.  Discussions are ongoing and Ireland will endeavour to progress the negotiations during its Presidency.</p></reply>

The person had arrived in Dublin on a flight from Istanbul having started her journey in China.  As a traveller from a non-EU country, the person should not have attempted to exit the baggage hall by way of the Blue Channel.  This is reserved for intra-EU travellers who have no declaration to make.  Travellers from outside the EU must use the Red (Goods to declare) or Green (No Goods to Declare) Customs Channel, as appropriate, and there are notices on display in the area indicating this requirement. On examining the person&rsquo;s baggage, the Revenue Customs Officer discovered 25 well known branded handbags, 14 designer branded belts and 16 make-up sets.  The officer suspected that the goods in question were counterfeit and detained them under section 7 of the Customs &amp; Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1988.</p><p>  On 1 December 2012, having received confirmation from the relevant right holders (brand owners) that the goods are counterfeit, the Revenue Customs Officer seized the goods under the Customs Acts as they are prohibited from import into the EU.  Furthermore, the person concerned has committed a Customs offence by attempting to import the goods.  The normal procedure in such cases is for a report of the offence to be prepared and forwarded to its Investigations and Prosecutions Division for consideration of prosecution, and this is now happening.  Without prejudice to any further action that may be taken, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the re-exportation of counterfeit goods is not an option under current legislation, and it is likely the goods will be destroyed when the outcome of the case is finally determined.</p></reply>

In 2012 my Department has provided support to the value of approximately &euro;740,000 to this School.  The provision includes staffing of an Administrative Principal, 6 teachers and 5 child care workers catering for 95 children, a pupil to adult ratio of approximately 8:1. In addition to the teaching and child care provision, the project receives an annual grant from my Department to fund non-teaching pay costs which provides for the employment of a cook, cleaner and a caretaker.  My Department also provides funding towards the non-pay or running costs of the project. Finally, I wish to clarify that the funding awarded to the Pre-school is based on budget proposals submitted by the Pre-school each year. The funding awarded by my Department for 2012 matches the proposals submitted.</p></reply>

Following oral presentation these proposals were assigned a ranking depending on their relative strengths under each of the evaluation criteria leading to the preferred proposal. Based on the marks awarded by the panel City of Dublin VEC's proposal was the preferred proposal and the selection panel made a recommendation to the Minister for Education and Skills to establish Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) as a unit of City of Dublin VEC.</p><p>  Initially, during the transition period, which migrates the administration from the local authorities and VECs to SUSI, costs are estimated to exceed savings for years one and two, as the 66 grant awarding authorities are processing renewal grant applications, as well as SUSI processing all new grant applications,  However, it is estimated that for future years there will be a saving on the overall cost of grants administration.</p><p>  The composition of the independent selection panel was as follows: 1. Mr. Pat McLoughlin (Chair) - Chief Executive of the Irish Payment Services Organisation (former Chief Executive of the Eastern Health Board, chair of the Local Government Efficiency Review Group and a member of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes); 2. Mr. Jim Duffy - Former Assistant Secretary at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Centre for Management and Organisation Development (CMOD); 3. Mr. Gerry Kearney - Former Secretary General of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs with significant experience with programme management and also former Assistant Secretary of the Revenue Commissioners.  The members of the selection panel were chosen with reference to their relevant knowledge, their significant experience and expertise in the various elements that would be involved in the administration of student grants.</p></reply>

Once these prefabs are no longer required by schools they are returned to the rental companies as the rented prefabs are their property. The following schools in Co. Kildare are currently in the process of replacing their rented prefabs: Scoil Na Mainistreach De La Salle, Kildare Town; St Peters BNS, Monasterevin; Two Mile House NS Straffan NS; St Laurences NS, Sallins; St Brigids Primary School, Kildare Town; St Mochua's NS, Rathcoffey.</p><p>  The first four schools listed above are also replacing old purchased prefabs as part of the initiative and I suggest that the person referred to by the Deputy may wish to contact these schools directly in relation to their plans for the old purchased prefabs. The person in question may also wish to contact rental prefab suppliers to see if they would be willing to donate one of the rented prefabs once removed.</p></reply>

The data provided is at a point in time on 5th December 2012 . It gives the position for student grant applications for attendance at both further and higher education. This data has been provided to my Department by SUSI.  The second table attached provides a breakdown on a county basis of the number of appeals received to date by SUSI.</p><p>The waiting time for processing a student grant application by Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) varies, depending on a number of factors including the volume of applications received at any given time, the complexity of the grant applicants circumstances, and time taken by the applicant to submit all the required documentary evidence to enable a final decision to be made on an application. Every effort is made to ensure that students get decisions on their grant applications as soon as possible. Currently, SUSI has some 272 applications on hand which are awaiting provisional assessment - these are applications received after the closing date. The number of applications being processed has been increasing incrementally in recent weeks. SUSI has indicated that it is on target to progress all applications received to date with the necessary supporting documentation between now and the end of the year.</p><p>Appeals received by SUSI are dealt with in date order, and the waiting time for decisions on appeals can vary depending on the complexity of the grant applicants circumstances which are under appeal. SUSI aims to issue determinations on appeals as promptly as possible and within the specified timeframes defined in the Student Support Act, 2011. The county from which an appeal originates is not a factor which impacts on the waiting time for appeals.</p><p><pcenter><b>SUSI Applications - Processing Position by

In this regard, my colleague Minister of State Brian Hayes is working with Senator Feargal Quinn to develop the Senator&rsquo;s private member&rsquo;s Construction Contracts Bill into a robust piece of legislation. The Bill has passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  During the Second Stage reading of the Bill, Minister Hayes signalled to the House his intention to bring proposals to Government on Committee Stage amendments dealing with issues that would include: </p><p>  Thresholds: In order to ensure that the legislation applies to the majority of Construction Contracts the scope of the legislation will be broadened by reducing or removing the current monetary thresholds contained in the Bill. </p><p>  Adjudication:  This issue of making adjudication awards binding for both the public and private sectors is a complex issue.  It is important to strike the right balance between giving this legislation the necessary enforcement provisions, whilst ensuring that the application of the legislation is equitable and the taxpayer is safeguarded.</p><p>  When these and a number of other issues have been examined, Minister Hayes will bring proposals to Government in advance of Committee Stage early in the New Year. This is an important piece of legislation aimed at creating a more level playing field between contractor and subcontractor in the construction sector. Therefore it is essential that these complex issues are properly assessed so as to avoid imposing unnecessary regulatory or cost burdens on parties in dispute, the State or others. </p></reply>

When I received the judgement, I quickly stated my aim was to ensure that an employer should not benefit from using an illegal contract of employment where he or she was a willing party to its creation. I repeated this assurance personally to the person concerned when I met him and a delegation from the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland and SIPTU.  The Deputy will note that the Government did not oppose Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Private Member&rsquo;s Bill as it concurs with our objectives - to ensure that outcome of the High Court case will not arise again.</p><p>  The issue raised by the High Court judgement is one which has important policy and legal implications in the area of Employment Permits and also in terms of Employment Rights. The question that arises for policy makers is to what extent such workers should be dissuaded from working illegally in Ireland by virtue of there being a statutory offence to do so, versus, to what extent should certain employment rights protect vulnerable migrants who find themselves unwittingly in such employment positions. My Department has received preliminary legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General counselling that the judgement raises matters that are particularly complex. These matters are currently receiving priority attention with a view to identifying the best way in which the legislation may be amended.</p><p>  It is my firm intention to amend the Employment Permits legislation in a precise manner so as to ensure that an employer may not benefit from the illegality of the contract of employment where they are found culpable in not ensuring a valid employment permit was in place for the employee concerned.  To this end, I hope to be in a position to propose the necessary provisions in a new Employment Permits Bill, currently being drafted and which is anticipated to be introduced in the first quarter of next year. I believe that this would be the most appropriate method of dealing with such a technically specific matter. Decisions on the legal options will be made in light of further legal advice and in consultation with other Government departments. I can assure the Deputy that my Bill is a Government priority and I would expect a speedy passage through the Oireachtas after its introduction.</p><p>  Finally, I wish to stress that the judgement relates only to the consideration of the enforceability, or otherwise, of an employee&rsquo;s rights. It does not mean that unscrupulous employers can employ unauthorised third country nationals without running the risk of significant legal consequences. I would emphasise that an employer who engages in this type of activity is open to prosecution under the Employment Permits legislation and could be found guilty of an offence and liable on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;250,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or both. Both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the National Employment Rights Authority actively pursue breaches under the legislation and welcome information concerning possible breaches.</p></reply>

An in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project has recently been completed for the FIS scheme.  This project focused on optimising output, improving customer service and the elimination of backlogs.  Part of the project was a detailed examination of workloads and a full assessment of existing capacity within the area and what capacity is needed in order to process the volumes of claims, both new and renewal, being received on a weekly basis.</p><p>  The outcome of this review is a detailed plan outlining the process required to manage both the continuous weekly intake and backlog claims clearance.  This plan sees the current weekly new claim and renewal intake processed by one team, while the backlog is ring-fenced and a focused team assigned to this work with a clear plan for its elimination. Clearly, claims received before November are not parked and are getting full and focused priority</p><p>  This team including additional temporary resources has been identified and is already assigned and working on the backlog claims.  In order to reduce the time it will take to eliminate the backlog, some claims are being processed outside of Longford Social Welfare Services Office.  This team is fully focussed on the elimination of the backlog of claims in the shortest possible timeframe, concentrating in the first instance on those claims which were previously in payment but where payment has expired and continuing on to first-time new claims within those categories, those waiting the longest will be processed first.  </p><p>  While it is not possible to clear all claims in the backlog before Christmas, every effort will be made to pay as many eligible claims as possible in that timeframe.  It is expected that the backlog will be fully eliminated by the end of March 2013.  Claims which are approved by the backlog team will be backdated to the date of claim or the date of expiry of the previous claim, as appropriate, and all arrears due will be paid.  It is not advisable for an applicant to choose to withdraw their application before it is decided upon and re-apply from a current date because the consequence of this is that they will lose entitlement for the period between the first and the second applications.</p></reply>

The social welfare system provides additionally that an increase for a qualified child (IQC) may continue to be paid where the child is aged between 18 and 22 years while the child is in full-time education.  In order to avoid a situation where such payments would cease in the course of an academic year, the welfare system provides, exceptionally, that where a student reaches age 22 during an academic year, the IQC is continued in payment for the duration of that academic year, provided s/he remains in full-time education till then. There are no plans at this time to change these arrangements.

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.  The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around &euro;2 billion and it is paid to around 600,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children.  Budget 2013 provides for a reduction in child benefit rates to &euro;130 per child per month for the first, second and third child in a family and to &euro;140 per child per month for the fourth and subsequent children. Although the gross savings is about &euro;136 million in 2013, some of these savings have been redirected towards services for children including after school childcare, an area based child poverty initiative and school meals which have the potential to improve outcomes for children generally.</p><p>  While child benefit is an important source of income for families, the social protection system also provides assistance to families with children through the payment of qualified child increases (QCIs) on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement (FIS) payment which both provide assistance which is linked with household income. Budget 2013 maintains both the QCI rate and the FIS income limit thresholds.</p><p>  While issues relating to changes in taxation policy are a matter for my colleague, Michael Noonan T.D., Minister for Finance, the taxation of child benefit would only address one of the main child income support payments and would not address the other child income support payments to low income families, which includes QCIs and FIS.  In this context the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare which I established last year was tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how income employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved. The Advisory Group&rsquo;s report on family and child income supports remains under my consideration and will assist in informing how reform in this area might be progressed.</p></reply>

I would like to emphasise that the National Famine Commemoration is, and will remain, an inclusive event, which recognises the significant impact of the famine on all communities on the island of Ireland.  Indeed, in the context of the Deputy's Question, respected historians have pointed to the significant impact of the famine on Ulster as a whole.  The main objective of the National Famine Commemoration Committee is to ensure that all victims of the Great Irish Famine are remembered in a dignified manner and, as Chair of this Committee, I will seek to ensure that this work continues.  </p><p>  The National Famine Commemoration Committee has agreed that the annual national commemoration should revolve between the four provinces of Ireland.  The Deputy may be aware that the 2011 National Famine Commemoration was held in Ulster, in Clones, County Monaghan, at which President McAleese led the official representation.  Attendance at the National Famine Commemoration is wide-ranging and in this regard, members of the Legislative Assembly in Northern Ireland, as well as organisations and individuals both North and South of the border, were invited to attend.  In the two weeks leading up to the national event, the local community devised a programme of events which took place across Monaghan and Fermanagh.  In addition, schools, North and South, were invited to hold a minute's silence in honour of the victims of the famine.  </p><p>  Members of the Northern Ireland Legislative Assembly were also invited to attend the 2012 National Famine Commemoration in Drogheda, County Louth and, indeed, the Deputy First Minister was among those who attended, together with a number of Northern Ireland Ministers.  The 2015 National Famine Commemoration is due to take place in Ulster.  I and the officials in my Department will be working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of the Taoiseach and all relevant stakeholders, North and South, to ensure that this event will be a fitting tribute to those who perished in Ulster during the Great Famine.</p></reply>

This proposal was developed in line with the requirements of the Workforce Planning Framework document issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER).

In line with the legislative provisions, the Scheme aims, inter alia, to develop local and community broadcasting. In operating the Scheme, the BAI introduces date-specific funding rounds for radio and television on an annual basis, the results of which are subsequently published on the BAI website.</p><p>  The BAI is also responsible for the licensing of independent radio broadcasting services in Ireland, including the licensing of community broadcasters.  An objective of the Authority, provided for under the Broadcasting Act 2009, is to stimulate the provision of high quality, diverse and innovative programming by community broadcasters.  Part 6 of the 2009 Act sets out the licensing process for commercial, community, temporary and institutional radio services.  Further information on this process is also available from the Authority.  In this regard, I have forwarded the Deputy&rsquo;s questions to the BAI and asked that they respond directly to him.</p></reply>

Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992 as amended by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, provides that any person who by act or omission, obstructs an authorised person in the lawful exercise of the powers, or contravenes a provision of, or a regulation made under, section 17, 18 or 20 of the 1992 Act, or fails to comply with an improvement notice, or re-lets a house in breach of a prohibition notice, is guilty of an offence and is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both.

The Act also sets out the grounds for the termination of a Part 4 tenancy. However, the Act does not preclude a landlord giving rights to tenants in a tenancy agreement in addition to those provided for in the Act. Where additional security of tenure rights are given to a tenant in a tenancy agreement, the termination of those rights will depend on the terms of that agreement. The parties to a tenancy may refer any matter relating to the tenancy , in respect of which there is a dispute between them, to the PRTB for resolution.</p></reply>

The Deputy may not be aware that the making of a deportation order against a person requires him or her to leave the State. It is also believed that significant numbers of these persons have left the State. In the same period, a total of 150 deportation orders were revoked under section 3(11) of the Immigration Act (these figures relate to asylum cases only).</p><p>  A breakdown of the annual figures for deportation orders signed, persons granted leave to remain and persons deported for each of the past five years was provided in my reply to PQ Number 540 of 27 November 2012, the relevant portions of which I have appended for the Deputy&#8217;s information. I can further inform the Deputy that the number of deportation orders revoked in each year in the period 2008 to end October 2012 was 25, 14, 21, 15 and 18 respectively.  The penultimate paragraph of my reply to PQ number 540 outlines the complexities of the process and accordingly why it is not possible to provide details of the status of the remaining caseload.</p><p>  It should be noted that the leave to remain figures provided also include persons granted leave to remain made in accordance with the principles set out in the Judgement of the European Court of Justice in the Zambrano case but not those granted leave to remain under the 2005 Irish Born Child Administrative Scheme or other arrangements in place prior to that time. Finally, I might add that I recently approved an initiative to put in place a panel with legal expertise who will assist the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in processing a cohort of repatriation cases thus speeding up the overall process and reducing the time spent by persons in the Direct Provision system. I would expect to see significant dividends from this initiative in the coming months.</p><p><b><i>Extract from PQ reply to PQ number 540 of 27</i></b><b><i><sup>th</sup></i></b><b><i> November 2012 </i></b></p><p><i>I can inform the Deputy that in the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 (to end the October) a total of 3,185, 5,037, 4,326, 2,471 and 1,779 notifications of intention to deport were issued by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS).  During the same period, 757, 1,077, 1034, 1334 and 1,234 deportation orders were signed and a total of 161, 338 343, 280 and 246 persons have been removed from the State together with 529, 539 461, 475 and 387 who have voluntarily returned to their country of origin.  These figures do not include approximately 2,500 persons per annum who have been refused leave to land and are subsequently removed from the State. </i></p><p><i>  As outlined in my response to PQ Numbers 962, 968 and 971 of 18</i><i><sup>th</sup></i><i> April last, a total of 1,052, 512, 232, 1957 and 951 were granted leave to remain in accordance with the provisions of the immigration acts.  The increase in the figures in 2011 and in 2012 to date is mainly due to the impact of the Zambrano judgement which was delivered by the European Court of Justice on 8</i><i><sup>th</sup></i><i> March, 2011. </i></p><p><i>With regard to the numbers evading deportation, it is difficult to produce precise figures.  Persons against whom a deportation order has issued may for short periods fail to report to their local immigration office but many subsequently do so.  In addition, I am informed that a significant number of persons who are the subject of a Deportation Order will have left the jurisdiction.</i></p><p><i>The processing of cases at the repatriation stage is a complex one with obligations to adhere to both domestic and international law and to make decisions in accordance with the UN Convention on Human Rights.   The process can be a lengthy one often punctuated with judicial reviews taken by the applicants at various stages including at deportation stage.  Accordingly, not all cases fit neatly into particular categories.  For example, in the case of families, one member of the family may have lodged a judicial review which in turn may mean that the remainder of the family may not be processed until its outcome is determined.  In addition, some applicants may also be party to an application under EU Treaty Rights or through marriage to an Irish citizen or may have been granted leave to remain as a result of these applications.  Therefore, it is not possible to provide figures in respect of the remainder of the case load without engaging in a very detailed exercise which could not be justified as it would divert resources from case processing.</i></p></reply>

However, in order to be of further assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and have been informed that the Courts Service in undertaking the detailed assessment of all Mayo venues will take into account a whole range of criteria such as caseload, physical condition of the building and availability of cells.  The Service has confirmed that one of the criteria which will be fully considered during the assessment phase will be proximity to an alternative venue which will include an assessment of the impact of the availability or otherwise of public transport to the alternative venue.</p><p>  The Courts Service has again assured me that no decision in relation to the future of any County Mayo courthouse will be taken without prior consultation with local interested parties and court users.  This consultation has already begun and the views received including expressed views on the availability or otherwise of public transport will be taken into account in the decision making process which will be a matter for the Courts Service Board.</p></reply>

As part of this process in 2013, 100 Garda Stations will be closed in both rural and urban areas and includes the stations in  Ballytore and Ballymore Eustace. The Policing Plan also sets out the changes in station opening hours and the amalgamation of 28 Garda Districts to 14 enlarged Garda Districts. These changes will enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make best use of resources to deliver the optimum policing service to all communities.</p><p>  I must stress that the principal aim of this process is to allow the more efficient deployment of personnel and the more effective delivery of policing services to the public across the country, including in the areas referred to by the Deputy. It is also the case that, even after the proposed closures, we will still have a very high number of police stations by comparable international standards.  The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced a significant investment in Garda transport, amounting to &euro;3 million, which will provide for an additional 170 Garda vehicles. These vehicles will be commissioned in the coming weeks. In addition, a further provision of &euro;5m will be made available for the purchase and fit-out of Garda vehicles in 2013. I am confident that this package of funding will considerably strengthen the overall effectiveness of the Force in delivering a policing service to all communities throughout the country.</p></reply>

This fishery has been in place since the early 1980s and occurs on muddy seabeds where dense beds of razor clams exist. I am informed that this fishery is unlikely to contribute to the serious coastal erosion in the Portrane area, which was identified in this House as long ago as 1950.  The fishery occurs sporadically in very local areas of seabed only and no sediments are taken from the area.</p></reply>

Work on the preparation of the legislation is proceeding as a priority and the intention is that the Agency will be established in early 2013.  In order to inform the content of the legislation the Government has decided that upon establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have responsibility for a range of services.  This includes the full range of child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services.  It has also been decided that due to its particular relevance domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services will also be included within the Agency's responsibilities.  The Government has further decided that the new Agency will assume responsibility for the functions of both the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  These two organisations currently operate under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  </p><p>  It is my intention that the work of the new agency will include a particular focus on the provision of services that could help prevent problems arising for a family, that would identify problems and provide supports at an early stage and that would assist children and families in managing serious problems requiring specialised interventions beyond their own resources.  Therefore, in addition to child welfare and protection services there will be an emphasis on prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic care interventions.  I can assure the Deputy that the focus of the new Agency will build on the excellent work undertaken by the Family Support Agency over the last decade.  The additional issues raised by the Deputy are being given consideration as part of the preparation of the legislation necessary to give effect to the establishment of the new agency.</p></reply>

This directive sets out the provision that the tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide (TNCO) yields of cigarettes shall be printed on cigarette packs.  While all tobacco products must include health warnings, the provision relating to the TNCO yields relates to cigarette packs only.  The Tobacco Directive was transposed into Irish law by S.I. No. 425/2003 -  European Communities (Manufacture, Presentation and Sale of Tobacco Products) Regulations 2003.</p><p>  The European Commission has undertaken a public consultation in relation to this Directive in order to ascertain whether the existing Directive is adequately functioning in view of new international, scientific and market developments in the last decade.  The display of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide levels is one of the issues being considered in the context of the revision of the Directive by the European Commission.  It is anticipated that the Commission will publish a legislative proposal in relation to the revision of the Directive in the near future.  Following the publication Ireland will play a significant role in progressing the revision of the Directive with other Member States during Ireland's Presidency of the Council of the European Union   commencing in January, 2013.</p></reply>

Organisational expenses, funded by the HSE for individual organisations, may include the costs of Chief Executive Officers, administration staff, central office costs etc.  In addition, organisations are funded to provide services to people with disabilities, including the provision of information and support to people with disabilities, the provision of information and expertise to health care professional working with individuals with particular conditions and, in some cases, the provision of residential, day, respite and all multidisciplinary supports.  Total funding from the HSE to member organisations of the NAI is in excess of &euro;200m per annum.  The funding level to be provided to member groups of the NAI in 2013 will be decided following the outcome of the HSE service planning process for 2013.</p></reply>

Studies indicate that the health benefits of water fluoridation outweigh its costs. To date there has been a significant reduction in the proportions of decayed, missing and filled teeth of people living in areas supplied by fluoridated drinking water in Ireland when compared to those in non-fluoridated areas. The cost of fluoridation was &euro;3.86 million in 2011. While my Department has not conducted a cost-benefit analysis on this policy, the Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, which monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health, advises that water fluoridation is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population.  </p><p>  Other countries which have water fluoridation schemes include the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, Australia and New Zealand. Water fluoridation is less common in Europe, where fluoridated salt is often available as an alternative, although some populations are supplied with naturally fluoridated public water.</p></reply>

The first stage is an independent academic research report, which is based on an analysis of published medical reports and research. The draft report contains information about how frequently symphysiotomy was carried out in Ireland and compares rates with other countries.  The researcher experienced unforeseen difficulties in accessing information sources and as a result, submitted the first stage of the report behind schedule in late January 2012. The researcher informed my Department that this was due primarily to the challenges with accessing historical data from a time when records on the procedure were not routinely kept. The second stage in the research process, involved a consultation process on the draft report involving patient groups, health professionals and in particular the women who have undergone symphysiotomy.  The researcher is currently finalising the report based on the consultation and it is also planned to have a peer review process. It is hoped that the report will be published early in 2013.</p></reply>

The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.

A key issue highlighted by the international experience is that regulation and the broader quality improvement and patient safety agenda may not be best suited together within one agency and that regulation should maintain its independence and remain separate. I am persuaded by this aspect of the international experience and, therefore, our planning is on the basis that the Health formation and Quality Authority would maintain its role of health and social care regulator.</p><p>  The role and inter-relationship of the PSA with the reforming health system needs to be carefully designed and developed. My Department is liaising with the Health Service Executive on the details surrounding the establishment of the PSA to ensure an identifiable and distinct leadership responsibility for patient safety and quality at national level having regard to the need for a robust quality and safety function within the new delivery structures of the Reform Programme. The functions eventually allocated to the PSA may include patient advocacy, development of leadership capacity in healthcare, development and delivery of patient safety training and education programmes and compilation and dissemination of learning from adverse events in the healthcare system. Our intention is to establish a Patient Safety Agency on an administrative basis in 2013. The optimum statutory framework for the PSA will be identified and developed in the light of experience over time.</p></reply>

Within its allocated budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects, including road maintenance, is a matter in the first instance for the NRA in accordance with Sections 17 &amp; 19 of the Roads Act.  My Department's funding allocation to the NRA for 2012 is &euro;734.6 million, including &euro;605 million for capital projects (&euro;674m in 2011) and &euro;42.26 million (&euro;48.9min 2011) for maintenance of national roads.  The balance relates to contract payments to PPP companies and the cost of running the Authority.</p><p>  In line with the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework 2012-2016 and the outcome of the comprehensive current spending review last year, the NRA's capital budget in 2013 will be &euro;278m while the road maintenance budget next year will be &euro;41.6m.  I meet with the CEO and the Chairman of the NRA on a regular basis, while my Department has ongoing contacts with the NRA at all levels. The scale of the reductions in the allocations to the NRA obviously will present challenges over the course of 2013. Therefore, the key priority is the protection of the existing investment in road infrastructure as against major new expenditure on road design or building. This is a view shared by both myself and the NRA.</p></reply>

The introduction of the new form of licence presented an opportunity to examine the system by which the current driver licence service was being operated. Following a detailed study and careful consideration of the issues involved, the Government supported my proposal to centralise the service under the Road Safety Authority (RSA).</p><p>  The benefits of centralisation are significant in themselves, and a centralised system will be more adaptable to any changes to the licence which may be required in the future.  It offers a more efficient and cost-effective way of delivering driver licensing services to the public, with the added advantages of more robust identity management and security capabilities, standardised and streamlined process improvements, and improved customer service through a single point of contact for drivers.  The RSA will become the driver licensing authority for the country from 12th January 2013. However, for a period in 2013, while the new system is being developed, local authorities will continue to provide driver licence services and applications for licences will be accepted.</p></reply>
