    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-23a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300053#WRA00600"><p>The 2016 Summary of Social Housing Assessments recorded 91,600 households as being qualified for social housing support as at 21 September 2016, an increase of 1,728 households or 1.9% over the 89,872 total recorded by the previous summary in 2013.  Within this overall figure, both Cork housing authorities recorded a significant decrease in their figures, with a reduction of 2,000 in the City Council and a reduction of 563 in the County Council area .  The decreases in the Cork figures cannot be attributed to any one factor.  The reduction of 2,000 households on the Cork City council list was due to the interaction of a number of factors.  A significant factor would have been the work by the City Council to bring vacant council properties back into use and on the acquisition of new social housing units. Across all the build, voids and regeneration and acquisition programmes, over 730 social housing units were delivered by the City Council over 2015/16. In addition, the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) was introduced in the City Council area in June 2015.  Furthermore, Choice-Based Letting was introduced in the city in 2015 and, as part of the roll-out of this programme, households on the housing list were asked to confirm whether or not they were still seeking housing support.</p>  <p>  Similarly, no one single factor can fully explain the reduction of 563 households in the figures for the County area.  However, given that HAP was introduced in the County Council area in September 2014, it has made a significant contribution to meeting the housing needs of applicants.  In addition, a total of 296 vacant social housing units were brought back into use by Cork County Council during the 2015-16 period, with 112 other properties being delivered for social housing use over the same timeframe.   </p>  <p>  As part of the process, households which were found to no longer qualify for social housing support were removed from housing lists.  For example, a large number of households in Cork and elsewhere have had their housing need met through the provision of a housing support such as RAS or HAP.  Another smaller number (approximately 5-7%) were found to have incomes that exceeded the eligibility thresholds.  Where a number of attempts had been made to contact a household (comprising at least two letters and other measures at the discretion of the authority) without success, then the household&rsquo;s application could be closed by the housing authority.  However, as has been the practice on previous occasions, where a household subsequently contacts the authority with the required information within a reasonable timeframe, then the application may be re-activated without affecting the original date of qualification.</p></reply>

The Review represents the completion of an early action in the Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  It involved broad consultation, including with the Department of Finance, on the operation of the current scheme, which was originally developed in 2011.  Arising from the Review and its recommendations, a more formal communication protocol between the lenders and borrowers is being developed; several changes to the eligibility criteria of the scheme are being made which will mean more households in rural areas, in particular, will be eligible; conveyancing, valuation and repairs process are all being refined; and a significant borrower, lender and local authority awareness raising and training programme is   being initiated. </p>  <p>Furthermore, the key role of the &rsquo;Abhaile&rsquo; Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service, the Insolvency Service and the Money Advice and Budgetary Service (MABS) are all being harnessed as critical contributors to the successful delivery of the scheme.</p>  <p>  I and my Department will continue to work across Government to ensure the early implementation of these actions, including the development of the pilot financing projects that look to harness alternative financing arrangements so that the scheme has increased capacity to meet the needs of more borrowers in the most serious situations of mortgage distress.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-23a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300053#WRA01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 16 together.</p>  <p>  As pointed out in response to earlier Questions, Rebuilding Ireland   is fundamentally based on blended delivery of social housing and harnessing the highest quality social housing possible given the capacity of local authorities, the private market and the financial resources available to Government. </p>  <p>A range of delivery mechanisms are operating in parallel. I recently published the first Status Report on Social Housing Construction Projects which shows a strong pipeline of direct construction projects that will contribute to the delivery of 26,000 new homes by 2021, and the 11,000 existing units that will bought directly from the market either at scale, using the Housing Agency&rsquo;s purchase of property portfolios, or at local level by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  It is the intention to update progress on the schemes on a quarterly basis.   </p>  <p>  The capacity of the private market is also being harnessed by maximising the Part V requirements on new residential developments; bringing privately owned vacant units back into productive use for social housing using the new Repair and Leasing and Buy and Renew Schemes; and harnessing the private investment interest in long-term leases or other contractual arrangements with local authorities for the supply of high quality social housing. </p>  <p>Rebuilding Ireland also sets out an ambitious set of targets for the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), which supports households who wish to live in high quality rented accommodation with the security of knowing that their HAP support will continue even if their household income increases.  While the level of supply in the rental market is challenging, 300 new tenancies per week have been supported by HAP so far this year and 18,250 households in total are currently supported under the scheme.   </p>  <p>  A number of financial and economic studies carried out either during the development of the original schemes or subsequently have supported the rationale for the provision of social housing through mechanisms such as the leasing and renting of privately owned accommodation. </p>  <p>  I continue to keep all of the social housing delivery mechanisms under review to ensure that they remain relevant and are responding effectively to housing needs while also ensuring value for money.</p></reply>

    <ques id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-23a.20.q" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1361" speakername="Tommy Broughan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300053#WRA01900"><p><i>17.</i> To ask the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government further to Parliamentary Question No. 159 of 8 February 2017, if he will not be setting up any sort of hostel type accommodation for families experiencing homelessness in order to meet his target of ending the use of commercial hotels to accommodate homeless families by July 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter. <b>[8833/17]</b></p></ques>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-23a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300053#WRA02000"><p>It is fully recognised that the period of time that homeless families spend in hotel accommodation should be minimised.  This is reflected in the commitment in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness that by mid-2017, hotels should only be used in exceptional circumstances as emergency accommodation for families.  It is intended that the long-term housing needs of homeless families will be met through a range of social housing supports, such as the enhanced Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, and general social housing allocations.  The increases in Rent Supplement and Housing Assistance Payment levels from 1 July 2016, along with the recent rent predictability measures which include designated rent pressure zones, are playing an important role in terms of supporting families to remain in rented accommodation.  The Dublin Region homeless pilot of HAP saw over 800 independent tenancies created for homeless households in 2016.  A further 1,200 tenancies are targeted for 2017 across the Dublin Region and this is on track for delivery, with over 300 tenancies for homeless households having been put in place since 1 January 2017.  In addition to the usual local authority delivery channels,   it is also expected that the Housing Agency programme to acquire 1,600 units will make a significant contribution.</p>  <p>  To mitigate the issues associated with the volume of homeless families currently accommodated in inappropriate commercial hotel arrangements, in addition to the actions outlined above, housing authorities are pursuing a range of supported temporary accommodation initiatives.  These supported temporary accommodation arrangements will provide accommodation for homeless families with a greater level of stability than is possible in hotel accommodation,   while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured.  Furthermore, such arrangements will facilitate more coordinated needs assessment and support planning for access to all required services, including welfare, health and housing services.</p></reply>

At 640, the number of built social housing units indicated for 2016 is provisional , while final statistics are gathered from local authorities, for publication by my Department in the usual manner.  Notwithstanding the suggestion in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question, the factual position is that the 2016 delivery of newly built social housing units represents very significant progress compared to recent years.  However, I recognise that we still need to grow this number substantially and this is a key focus with in the overall strategy and ambition of Rebuilding Ireland.  To boost the supply of new social housing, project approvals have continued apace in 2016, adding to the sizeable pipeline already in place to deliver significant additional social housing.</p><p>The strength of this pipeline can be seen in the Status Report for Social Housing Construction Projects, which I published on Monday last, and which is now available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The relevant weblink will be circulated with the official report.</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>The report lists all approved projects up to end - 2016, including those completed in 2016 and those at various stages of advancement through planning, design and construction.  It comprises over 500 construction schemes to deliver almost 8,500 units right across the country.</p><p>Further construction project approvals are continuing and the reforms mapped out in Rebuilding Ireland, along with additional resources that have been made available over the last two years, are restoring local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies to a central position in new social housing build and delivery for the years ahead.</p></reply>

A further 650 rapid build homes will be advanced in 2017, with another 500 units to be delivered in 2018. </p><p>There has been significant pressure to ramp-up rapid build delivery, which local authorities have been responding to positively. Of particular note has been the establishment of a framework of rapid build contractors by the Office of Government Procurement, which means that local authorities across the country can now run quicker procurement competitions and advance rapid build projects to site more efficiently and effectively.</p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific query regarding the 350 rapid build homes that were advancing through various stages of delivery at the end of the 2016, the following are theprojects concerned:</p><p>- Georges Place, Dun Laoghaire - 12 homes</p><p>- St. Aidans, Brookfield - 71 homes</p><p>- Poppintree, Ballymun - 22 homes</p><p>- Cherry Orchard, Ballyfermot - 24 homes</p><p>- Mourne Road, Drimnagh - 29 homes</p><p>- St. Helena&rsquo;s, Finglas - 40 homes</p><p>- Belcamp, Dublin 17 - 38 homes</p><p>- Cherry Orchard, Ballyfermot - 52 homes</p><p>- Woodbank, Rathvilly - 18 homes</p><p>- Wellview, Mulhuddart - 20 homes</p><p>- Pinewood, Balbriggan - 24 homes</p><p>In relation to the timeframe over the course of 2017 for when each of the projects listed above will be ready for occupation, other than the Poppintree project which is already complete and tenanted, this will be dependent on the completion of procurement and construction. The local authorities involved are working hard to ensure that each project is completed and occupied by tenants at the earliest possible date.</p></reply>

However, as the proposal listed at Action 6 therein relates to a planning matter, its delivery falls to my Department.  The proposed action, which was also reflected in the Government's Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness: Rebuilding Ireland, published in July 2016, is indicative of the ambitious priority attached to urban regeneration by the Government, grounded in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  It is one of a series of specific actions to facilitate the regeneration of our urban centres, many of which were adversely impacted by the economic downturn.   </p>  <p>To drive forward consideration and implementation of these actions, a Working Group, which I chair and which also involves senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and other relevant actors, has been established to bring forward proposals for new urban regeneration measures as early as possible.  It is intended that the new measures will complement the existing regeneration activities under my Department's Social Housing Capital Programme, as well as other social regeneration initiatives already underway.</p>  <p>  As part of its deliberations, the Working Group is presently reviewing planning legislation to allow the change of use of vacant commercial premises in urban areas, including vacant or under-utilised areas over ground floor premises, into residential units without having to go through the planning process.

This will help ensure effective alignment and joined-up thinking across Government. </p>  <p>  I have also established a NPF Advisory Group to ensure the participation of relevant non-governmental organisations, professional bodies and technical experts in the process &ndash; this Advisory Group met in December.  The purpose of the Advisory Group is to harness the inputs and leadership of a broad range of interests, including the business, environmental, social and knowledge based sectors. </p>  <p>  Building on the initial Roadmap document in 2015 and stakeholder consultation events in 2016, I recently launched a preliminary public consultation process which runs until mid-March, to inform the drafting of the NPF and I expect to publish a draft for public consultation before the Summer. </p>  <p>My Department is liaising closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in co-ordinating the preparations for both the National Planning Framework and the mid-term review of the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan to 2021. On the basis of the initial public consultation, a draft NPF will be prepared and it is my Department&rsquo;s intention to develop this draft in sufficient time that it will be available to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to input into the Capital Plan review process.   </p>  <p>  I am confident that the ongoing work in developing the Framework, coupled to the proposals to give it a strong legislative underpinning, as set out under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016, and its progression in tandem with the mid-term review of the Capital Plan will ensure that all Departments, other public bodies and stakeholders more generally will work within and drive forward the NPF&rsquo;s implementation.</p></reply>

Indeed, a range of measures have already been taken to reduce the monthly repayments of these borrowers.  An innovative Shared Ownership Restructuring Option has been available to Shared Ownership borrowers from 1 April 2016.  This new restructuring option for SO borrowers involves rolling up all outstanding debt under a SO arrangement into a single annuity loan &ndash; i.e. the new restructured loan principal will comprise any outstanding annuity loan balance, rental equity balance, plus any arrears &ndash; with an all-sums-owing mortgage charge applying to the property.  The term of the annuity loan will be determined by the amount of the monthly repayment deemed to be affordable and sustainable for each SO borrower.  This restructuring option allows the borrower to have a regularised, restructured repayment solution which is more easily understood.  The restructuring option can lead to full home ownership for the borrower and as such allows for up/down sizing to suit household needs.  This arrangement may be of particular benefit to those SO borrowers who are nearing the end of their annuity term but who have not made sufficient provision for the repayment of their rental equity balance.  The option may not be appropriate in all cases. For example, in some instances continuing with the current SO arrangement may be the best option for both the SO borrower and the local authority. In other cases where the outstanding debt may not be sustainable for the borrower in the long-term, the Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) option might ultimately be the appropriate solution.</p><p>Details on the measures available to borrowers with Shared Ownership arrangements are available from their local authority. </p><p>Overall, local authority borrowers are encouraged to engage with their local authority at the earliest opportunity if they are having difficulty making the repayments on their Shared Ownership arrangement. Information in relation to local authority mortgage arrears, the local authority mortgage arrears resolution process (MARP) and the help available to borrowers is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p><i></i><i>.</i></p></reply>

It sets out over 80 actions that the Government is taking through new policy, new legislation and innovative Budgetarymeasures to achieve that aim. </p><p>Pillar 4 of the Action Plan committed to development of a comprehensive strategy for the rental sector and this was delivered, with the publication of the <i>Strategy for the</i><i>Rental Sector</i>on 13 December 2016, which identifies high and rapidly rising rents as the key driver of accommodation insecurity for tenants and a factor in the termination of tenancies.  To address this situation, the Strategy introduced a Rent Predictability Measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where the imbalance between demand and supply of rental accommodation is driving rent levels upwards most acutely.</p><p>The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 gave effect to, and provided for the immediate implementation of, the Rent Predictability Measure.  Areas of the country satisfying the statutory criteria will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones and rent increases in those areas are generally capped at 4% per annum for a period of 3 years.  The measure was introduced with immediate effect in the four Dublin Local Authority areas and in Cork City. A further 12 Local Electoral Areas were designated as Rent Pressure Zones on 27 January 2017.</p><p>The provisions limiting rent increases in rent pressure zones apply both at the commencement of a tenancy and at each rent review. In addition, at the beginning of a tenancy, there is a statutory obligation on a landlord in a rent pressure zone to provide a tenant with details of the rent under the previous tenancy of the dwelling, together with a statement as to how the new rent has been calculated.  The purpose of this provision is to allow a tenant to ensure that their rent complies with the legislation.  The existing prohibition on charging a rent above market rent continues to apply in all areas.</p><p>The Act provides that in confirming whether or not the criteria have been met, the information relating to the area concerned must be determined by the information used to compile the RTB Rent Index quarterly report.  Statistics in the report referred to in the Question are based on asking rents for those properties which are advertised on that company's website, as opposed to the RTB figures which are based on rents paid in all registered tenancies.</p><p>It is important to note that the latest report referred to in the Questions relates to rent price inflation in the period prior to the introduction of the Rent Predictability measures and the Rent Pressure Zones.  The data in the report underline the need for and the relevance of the Government's measures. </p><p>The Government's Rent Predictability measures limit rent increases to a maximum of 4% per annum - less than one third of the rate of rent inflation reported by the company referred to in the Question.  Tenants in Rent Pressure Zones can now expect to see significantly smaller rent increases than those they have seen recently - or would have faced if the measures had not been introduced.</p><p>The prolonged under-supply of new rental units is the key factor underpinning rent inflation.  This is borne out by the company's figures on supply, which indicate that there were fewer than 4,000 homes available to rent nationwide on 1 February, just over 1,600 of which were in Dublin. In designing the Rent Predictability Measure, the Government has sought to moderate rent increases, without negatively impacting on new investment in the sector.</p></reply>

The final   phased implementation of the HAP scheme will be completed with the scheme being made available to all qualified households in the administrative areas of Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council areas from 1 March 2017, subject to the necessary regulations being in place.  Since February 2015,   the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) is also managing a HAP Homeless Pilot for the four Dublin local authorities.  The focus of this pilot remains the transitioning of qualified households from emergency accommodation, including hotels, into private rented tenancies. </p>  <p>  The statutory phased roll- out of the HAP scheme has proved to be an effective approach.  In this context, my Department maintains regular contact with the local authorities in order to learn from their experience of the scheme, and to address operational issues as they arise. </p>  <p>  The Government increased the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) (and Rent Supplement) rent limits in every local authority area, taking account of geographic variations in market rents, with effect from 1 July 2016, meeting its stated commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government and in Rebuilding Ireland.  Furthermore, additional flexibility above the existing HAP rent limits was made available to all local authorities operating HAP from the same date.  These changes have had the effect of providing further targeted supports to those households in most need; providing prospective HAP recipients with access to a greater number of properties in the market; and reducing the number of households falling into homelessness.   </p>  <p>  The HAP Shared Services Centre manages the collection of all HAP tenants&rsquo; differential rents, on behalf of the relevant local authority, and the payment of all HAP rents to landlords on behalf of tenants supported by the HAP scheme. Monthly HAP payments are made directly to landlords on behalf of tenants in respect of rent, subject to rent limits and the conditions of the scheme.   </p>  <p>  The HAP scheme is a demand led scheme funded through a combination of Exchequer funding and tenant differential rents.  The provisional Exchequer outturn for the HAP scheme in 2016 was in excess of &euro;57 million. This funding supported both   the on-going costs of tenancies established in 2015 that continued into 2016, and the costs of the 12,075 additional households supported by the scheme nationally in 2016. Some &euro;14 million of these costs related to tenancies established in the four Dublin local authority areas.  Budget 2017 has increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme to &euro;152.7 million, in order to meet the continuing costs of existing HAP households, and the costs of supporting an additional 15,000 households to be supported by HAP in 2017. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  However, I am satisfied with how the HAP scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland.</p></reply>

This scheme is underpinned by a lease and other legal agreements. These provide that rental payments are made by the State over an agreed long-term time period, typically 20 years. In return, the housing unit is made available for social housing purposes.  Changes are now being proposed to this scheme in order to facilitate larger institutional private investors to become involved in the financing of social housing. The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) is acting as financial advisor to my Department in this work and has undertaken market engagement in the development of the scheme.

On foot of the proposal from the Housing Agency, and in accordance with section 24A(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended), I requested the Director of the RTB to make a report to me as to whether these areas met the criteria for designation as Rent Pressure Zones. </p><p>On 26 January 2017, I received a report from the RTB confirming that 12 out of the 15 Local Electoral Areas examined met the criteria. As required by section 24A(5) of the Act, I made Orders designating the 12 Rent Pressure Zones on 26 January 2017. The Orders came into effect on 27 January 2017.

At end 2016, 336 households were supported by HAP, which was introduced to the local authority on 1 February of that year, and a further 48 had been transferred to RAS.</p><p>In the Galway County Council administrative area at end 2015, seven households were being supported by HAP, which was introduced to the area on 20 November of that year, with a further 391 households supported by RAS. At end 2016, an additional 381 households had been supported by the HAP scheme and a further 22had been transferred to RAS. </p><p>On 16 December 2014, a statutory direction was issued to all authorities involved in the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, instructing them to take the necessary steps to ensure that households benefitting from HAP can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support, should they wish to do so, through a transfer option. Local authorities were also directed that HAP recipients, who apply to go on the transfer list, should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list. Similarly, a special transfer pathway has been provided for some RAS tenants to other forms of social housing support. </p><p>The practical operation of transfer lists is a matter for each local authority to manage, on the basis of their own scheme of letting priorities.  The setting of such schemes is reserved function of the local authority and as such is a matter for the elected members. My Department does not gather or hold any information on households seeking a transfer to an alternative social housing support whether they are currently having their housing needs met through HAP, RAS and or any other form of social housing support. It is ultimately up to the household to choose if they wish to be placed on a local authority&rsquo;s transfer list, and I understand that the majority of HAP households do avail of this option. At the end of December 2016, 240 households across the country have transferred from the HAP scheme to other forms of social housing support.</p></reply>

The RTB may make a declaration as to whether the rent set complies with the legislation and, if it does not comply, may make a declaration as to what amount would comply.  The rent cannot be increased pending the determination of the dispute.  Where a landlord carries out a rent review, a notice of new rent must be served on the tenant.  A notice of new rent must be in writing and include information in relation to the dispute resolution procedures that a tenant can pursue through the RTB if they do not believe the new rent is valid, e.g. if the rent is above market rent or above the permitted increase in a rent pressure zone.  The notice of new rent must also be accompanied by information in relation to the rents of 3 other similar dwellings in the area.  The purpose of this provision is to ensure that tenants are adequately informed in relation to prevailing rents and are aware of their rights under the Act. In a Rent Pressure Zone, the landlord must also include information and calculations in the notice of new rent that demonstrate that any rent increase is not more than the maximum amount allowed since the rent was last set.  In addition, the new legislation provides for a statutory obligation on a landlord at the beginning of a tenancy to provide a tenant with details of the previous rent under a tenancy, and a statement as to how the rent has been calculated under section 19(4), so that a tenant can ensure that the rent set at the start of a tenancy complies with the legislation.   </p>  <p>  Both landlords and tenants are notified by the RTB when a tenancy has been registered.  This notification advises both parties of their rights and obligations in relation to the setting and review of rent, security of tenure, the termination of tenancies, and of the dispute resolution procedures that are available through the RTB.  On-going education and awareness is an increasing focus of the RTB, educating tenants and landlords in relation to their rights and obligations.  One of the objectives of this approach is to encourage compliance with the law through measures which encourage best-practice and promote understanding rather than by means of sanctions and offences. </p>  <p>  A landlord may not terminate a tenancy under Part 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 except on clearly defined grounds which are set out in the Table to section 34 of the Act.  These grounds include that the landlord intends to sell the dwelling, that the landlord wishes to change the use of the dwelling, and that the landlord requires the dwelling for a family member.  A landlord may not terminate a tenancy arbitrarily in order to charge a higher rent to a new tenant.     </p>  <p>  Amendments introduced in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015   strengthen the protections around tenancy terminations by providing for measures that guard against, for example, landlords falsely declaring that the property is needed for a family member, or that it is going to be sold.  In addition, the Act provides for graduated increases in the notice periods that must be given to tenants of the termination of a tenancy so that a landlord must now give a tenant up to a maximum of 224 days&rsquo; notice for tenancies of 8 years or more. </p>  <p>Where there is an abuse of the termination procedure, section 56 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 provides that a tenant may bring a complaint to the RTB that they have been unjustly deprived of possession of a dwelling by their landlord. On the hearing of the complaint the RTB, it if considers it proper to do so, may make a direction that damages are paid to the tenant; that the tenant be permitted to resume possession of the dwelling, or both.</p></reply>

Unlike Approved Housing Body tenancies, social housing provided by local authorities is governed by an extensive legislative code which is set out in the Housing Acts.  This code sets out the law in relation to social housing and provides extensively for the rights and obligations of local authorities and their tenants.  The legislation recognises the democratic nature of local government by assigning certain housing functions to the elected members.  In addition, local government legislation more generally provides for significant roles for the elected members in overseeing the work of the local authority executive.   </p>  <p>  Against that background, I have no plans at this stage to extend the application of the Residential Tenancies Act to the local authority sector, a move which would involve considerable complexity.

Following completion of this analysis, I intend to announce successful applications before the end of March.</p></reply>

Housing-led approaches to homelessness incorporate the provision of adequate support for people in their homes, according to their needs.  Under Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) is committed to tripling the target for tenancies under its &lsquo;housing first&rsquo; programme to 300 by end-2017.  This will require additional resources and supports to be provided by the HSE, housing authorities and service providers.  This &lsquo;housing first&rsquo; programme is operated under a contract which is being delivered through a joint consortium of Focus Ireland and the Peter McVerry Trust.  I understand that 62 tenancies have been created to date under the programme and the DRHE, Focus Ireland and the Peter McVerry Trust will be assigning additional staff to deliver on this action in 2017.  Accordingly, I expect that the target of 300 tenancies by the end of 2017 will be achieved.     </p>  <p>  As well as strengthening the existing housing-led approach in Dublin, Rebuilding Ireland   also commits to extending it to other urban areas, focusing on persistent rough sleepers and long-term homeless households. My Department is currently consulting with the relevant housing authorities, the HSE and other stakeholders with a view to having an implementation programme in place as soon as possible in order to achieve this.</p></reply>

There are various deadlines for meeting the requirements of the Directive, one of which was the requirement for secondary treatment to be provided for all agglomerations which discharge to freshwaters and estuaries and have a population equivalent of over 2,000 by 31 December 2005.    The Commission commenced an infringement process against Ireland regarding its implementation of the directive with a first letter of formal notice in September 2013. This was followed by a supplementary letter of formal notice in September 2015. A Reasoned Opinion was issued on 30 September 2016, with the Commission deciding to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the EU on 15 February 2017. </p>  <p>  The supplementary letter of formal notice of September 2015 identified compliance concerns around a total of 82 agglomerations. In their responses to date, Ireland has satisfied the Commission that 44 agglomerations should be removed from the case. This indicates that considerable progress that has been made in addressing these issues. However, 38 agglomerations remain of concern to the Commission and have now been referred to the Court.</p>  <p>  Since taking over responsibility for water services in January 2014, Irish Water has put in place a prioritised range of projects to deal with the historic deficits and lack of investment in waste water collection and treatment across the country. Irish Water has identified key projects, in both their current and recently approved future capital investment plans, to address all non-compliances in their waste water treatment plants by 2021 for each of the areas identified by the Commission in this ECJ case. The cost of these works is estimated at &euro;1 billion.   </p>  <p>  However, further significant and sustained investment will be essential to ensure ongoing compliance, to cater for growth and to provide waste water services that protect the environment and meet our obligations under the Directive.   </p>  <p>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives. The team can be contacted via email at oireachtasmembers@water.ie or by telephone on a dedicated number, 1890 578 578.</p></reply>

In this regard, Action 5.1 of Rebuilding Ireland commits to the development of a National Vacant Housing Re-Use Strategy by the first quarter of 2017, informed by Census 2016 data, to inform the compilation of a register of vacant units across the country,</p><p>-  identify the number, location and reasons for longer-term vacancies (i.e. over 6 months) in high demand areas, and</p><p>-  set out a range of actions to bring vacant units back into reuse.</p><p>To this end, the Housing Agency, which has lead responsibility for coordinating the development of the Strategy, has established a working group in September 2016 comprising of senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and from the Housing Agency itself to inform the Strategy. The Group is due to report by the end of the first quarter of 2017.</p><p>As indicated, it is intended to facilitate the development of a national database of vacant houses under the auspices of the National VacantHousing Re-use Strategy. The database will aim to include:</p><p>-  the number of vacant homes in each local authority area,</p><p>-  the addresses of the vacant homes,</p><p>-  the length of vacancy in each case, and</p><p>-  the reason(s) for vacancy.</p><p>Work is progressing on identifying possible sources of data and information to assist in the most efficient means of compiling such a database .</p><p>In this context and further to Action 5.11 of Rebuilding Ireland, a Working Group, which I chair and which also involves senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and other relevant actors, has been established to bring forward proposals for new urban regeneration measures as early as possible. It is intended that the new measures will complement the existing regeneration activities under my Department's Social Housing Capital Programme, as well as other social regeneration initiatives already underway.I expect the Working Group to be in a position to report in Q2 2017.</p><p>Insofar as social housing initiatives are concerned, two new initiatives have been introduced to provide funding to bring vacant residential units back into use for social housing purposes. The Buy and Renew initiative offers opportunities for local authorities and, indeed, AHBs to purchase and renew premises in need of remediation, and make them available for social housing. The focus is on older stock, in particular, as part of the response that the authorities make in tackling dereliction and improving streetscapes in urban areas and towns.  In that regard, an initial &euro;25 million is available for Buy and Renew initiatives in 2017 and I propose to increase this to as much as &euro;50 million in 2018 depending on demand, which should result in at least 400 - 500 renewed houses. Following the success of the initial pilot in Waterford and Carlow local authorities, the Repair and Leasing Schemeis being rolled out on a national basis from today. An additional &euro;26m is being provided to fund the scheme in 2017, which brings the total amount of investment available this year to &euro;32m. This additional investment in 2017 means that delivery under the scheme can be accelerated and up to 800 vacant properties across the country can be brought back into use as new homes for families on local authority waiting lists this year.</p></reply>

As set out in Rebuilding Ireland, it is intended that the long-term housing needs of homeless families will be met through housing supports, such as the enhanced Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, and general social housing allocations.  The increases in Rent Supplement and Housing Assistance Payment levels from 1 July 2016, along with the recent rent predictability measures which include designated rent pressure zones, are playing an important role in terms of supporting families to remain in rented accommodation. The Dublin Region homeless pilot of HAP saw over 800 independent tenancies created for homeless households in 2016, well ahead of the target of 550. A further 1,200 tenancies are targeted for 2017 across the Dublin Region and this is on track for delivery, with over 300 tenancies for homeless households having been put in place since 1 January 2017.  In addition to the usual local authority delivery channels, it is also expected that the Housing Agency programme to acquire 1,600 units will make a significant contribution, with approximately 330 units secured or bids accepted to date.</p><p>To mitigate the issues associated with the volume of homeless families currently accommodated in inappropriate commercial hotel arrangements, housing authorities are pursuing a range of temporary accommodation initiatives.  These initiatives include the expanded Rapid Build Housing Programme set out under Rebuilding Ireland but also the procurement of a number of supported temporary accommodation arrangements.  These supported temporary accommodation arrangements will provide accommodation for homeless families with a greater level of stability than is possible in hotel accommodation, while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured.  Furthermore, such arrangements will facilitate more coordinated needs assessment and support planning for access to all required services, including welfare, health and housing services.</p><p>The mid 2017 target is necessarily ambitious but I am happy to note positive progress in relation to family homelessness and the number of associated dependents in recent months. In this regard, the January 2017 national homelessness figures show a marginal decrease on the figures recorded in the previous two months and the volume of families accommodated in hotel arrangements in the Dublin Region has also decreased in a corresponding fashion.  The official homelessness data reports published by my Department are produced using data provide d by housing authorities from the Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System, the single integrated national data information system on State-funded emergency accommodation arrangements overseen by housing authorities.  These reports are published on my Department's website and can be accessed using the following link:</p><p><i></i></p></reply>

However, a range of measures are being taken under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness to increase housing supply overall, with the aim of creating a functioning and sustainable housing system which can meet housing demand at more affordable prices.  The plan is divided into five pillars, with each targeting a specific area of the housing system. Pillar 3, entitled Build More Homes,  has a key objective of increasing the output of private housing to meet demand at affordable prices, including by</p><p>-  Opening up land supply and State lands including the Major Urban Housing Development Sites initiative, which identified large-scale sites in the main cities that are capable of delivering significant homes in the short to medium term to boost overall housing supply;</p><p>-  &euro;200m Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund;</p><p>-  National Treasury Management Agency financing of large-scale &ldquo;on-site&rdquo; infrastructure;</p><p>-  Planning Reforms;</p><p>-  Putting in place a National Planning Framework and land management actions;</p><p>-  Efficient design and delivery methods to lower housing delivery costs;</p><p>-  Measures to support construction innovation and skills.</p><p>Pillar 4 of the Plan, entitled Improve the Rental Sector, provided for the introduction of an affordable rental scheme to enhance the capacity of the private rented sector to provide quality and affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent. As set out in the recently published Strategy for the Rental Sector, this commitment is now being progressed through kick-starting supply in rent pressure zones.</p><p>Other measures taken to increase the supply of housing include -</p><p>-  The enhanced supply of more affordable starter homes in key locations through a targeted rebate of development contributions in Dublin and Cork for housing supplied under certain price levels;</p><p>-  New National Apartment Planning Guidelines, reducing the cost of apartment building;</p><p>-  Changes to aspects of the operation of Strategic Development Zones to enable swifter adjustments to meet market requirements;</p><p>-  A vacant sites levy.</p><p>In addition, the Help to Buy incentive is designed to assist first-time buyers with obtaining the deposit required to purchase or self-build a new house or apartment to live in as their home. The incentive provides for a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid over the previous four tax years to first-time buyers.</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>It might also be noted that a first time buyer who is unable to get a loan from a building society or bank may be eligible for a mortgage from the local authority, in cases where the gross income (before tax) is &euro;50,000 or less for a single income household or &euro;75,000 or less in the case of a double income household.  The loan can be up to 97% of the price of the house subject to a maximum loan of &euro;200,000. Also first time buyers can apply for a Home Choice Loan to purchase a new or second hand property or build their own home.  Home Choice Loan provides up to 92% of the market value of a property purchased, subject to a maximum loan amount of &euro;285,000.

Local authorities do not source accommodation for HAP supported tenancies.    However, a dedicated placement team, the Dublin Placefinder Service, has been established to engage directly with property owners and support homeless households to find suitable tenancies under the Homeless Pilot of the HAP scheme which is being operated in the Dublin Region on behalf of the four Dublin local authorities.</p>  <p>  Cork City Council has established a Cork City Homeless Placefinder Service which will entail a dedicated resource that will operate together with the established HAP delivery team in the local authority. It will be charged with seeking out potential properties suitable for households currently identified as homeless by Cork City Council by establishing relationships with local property agents and landlords and liaising with individual households to establish their specific housing needs. The Service will also support homeless households to negotiate the tenancy agreements and where necessary, secure a deposit and up-front rent payment. I have no plans currently to expand this service beyond Dublin and Cork.   </p>  <p>  With regard to the recruitment of staff for the operation of the HAP scheme, under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each Chief Executive of a local authority is responsible for staffing and organisation arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible. In this regard, it is a matter, in the first instance, for Chief Executives, to ensure that the appropriate staffing and staffing structures are in place.   </p>  <p>  My Department works closely with all local authorities and all have been invited to submit staffing sanction requests to facilitate the delivery of housing services. Each staffing sanction request is examined, on a case by case basis, having due regard to the continued delivery of key services in the context of staffing and budgetary constraints. </p>  <p>  To date, My Department has approved 83 staffing applications from local authorities in relation to the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme. This includes sanctioned posts related to staffing needs of the central transactional shared service being provided by Limerick City and County Council to all local authorities operating the HAP scheme. The HAP Shared Services Centre, which is the primary administrative support to HAP local authorities, is responsible for a range of functions including monthly payments to landlords and the collection of weekly differential rent from tenants and provides a range of efficiencies in the operation of the scheme. </p>  <p>  In order to cover staffing and administrative costs arising from the operation of the HAP scheme in their area, local authorities are provided with a direct once-off administrative payment of &euro;150 per household set up under the HAP scheme. Some &euro;1.8m was paid by my Department in HAP administration costs directly to local authorities in 2016. This stream of funding continues to be available in 2017.</p></reply>

The UN Committee had expressed concern at the housing situation in Ireland, and noted in particular the limited supply of social housing and the level of homelessness amongst families and children. </p>  <p>  However, as I indicated previously, the UN Committee&rsquo;s observations were made on the basis of the position at the end of 2015. Since then the Government has published Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness. Urgent action is being taken to deal with the challenges that currently exist in the housing sector and which were referred to by the UN Committee.  The Plan sets out a clear roadmap to achieve the Government&rsquo;s goals to significantly increase and expedite the delivery of social housing, boost private housing construction, improve the rental market, and deliver on the commitment to see housing supply, in overall terms, more than double to some 25,000 new homes every year by 2020. With regard to social housing, 47,000 new social housing units will be provided by 2021 at a cost of &euro;5.35 billion.   </p>  <p>  The Plan has a particular focus on meeting the housing needs of the most vulnerable members of Irish society. It is recognised that accommodating family units in hotels is inappropriate for anything other than a short period of time and a very clear target has been set to ensure that by mid-2017, hotels are used only in very limited circumstances for emergency accommodation for families.</p></reply>

Accordingly, rather than a pre-set allocation of funding for this year, the level of funding to be provided to local authorities will be directly linked to the scale of delivery they achieve on their projects.  Any projects to be advanced under this initiative will need to be in areas that meet social housing need, as well as providing reasonable value for money.  I have made an initial &euro;25 million available for this initiative this year and propose to increase this to as much as &euro;50 million in 2018, depending on the uptake.  I recognise that such projects may be challenging to deliver and must therefore be balanced with the requirement to deliver social housing as early as possible and also bearing in mind the impact on local authority resources.    </p>  <p>  The Repair and Leasing Scheme has been developed to assist private property owners and local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies to harness the accommodation potential that exists in certain vacant properties across Ireland.  The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property.  Over the period 2016 to 2021, it is anticipated that up to 3,500 units will be secured for social housing under this scheme and I have committed to making &euro;140m available over that period. </p>  <p>  The scheme was launched in Waterford and Carlow in early October 2016, on a pilot basis, and my Department is now working with local authorities to prepare for the wider national rollout of the scheme.  While an amount of &euro;6m had been made available for the scheme to deliver 150 units in 2016, I announced earlier today that I am now providing a further &euro;26m to support the delivery of 800 units under the scheme in 2016.  This brings to &euro;32m the amount of funding I am making available for the scheme this year.       </p>  <p>  Funding will be provided by my Department to local authorities in line with their progress under the schemes.  I am keen that local authorities work together with approved housing bodies in their own areas to maximise the potential of this scheme, and I have assured all local authorities that funding is in place to support their activity in this regard.</p></reply>

The scheme is underpinned by Part 4 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014.  This is distinct from other forms of social housing support where the tenant may not always find their own accommodation and instead are allocated a dwelling in accordance with Section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  </p>  <p>  A key principle of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme is that eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector, which best suits their needs in their area of choice.  The local authority is not party to the tenancy agreement underpinning a HAP supported tenancy. </p>  <p>  As HAP is deemed to be a social housing support under section 19 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, as amended, households in receipt of HAP are not included on the local authority waiting list for social housing support.  However, HAP recipients may access other forms of social housing supports by applying to go on the local authority transfer list.  A statutory Ministerial Direction was issued in Q4 of 2014 instructing local authorities to take the necessary steps to ensure that households benefitting from HAP can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support, should they wish to do so, through the transfer option.  Furthermore, HAP recipients, who apply to go on the transfer list, should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list.  In practice, housing authorities inform HAP recipients in writing of their entitlement to apply to go on the transfer list when they are approved for HAP.    </p>  <p>  Tenancies supported by the HAP scheme are governed by the terms of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended) and are afforded the same protections available to all private rental tenancies, which were recently enhanced.  The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.  In the case where a HAP supported tenancy comes to an end, the tenant can find alternative accommodation and retain their eligibility for HAP support or the local authority may decide to offer another form of social housing support to the tenant in accordance with their scheme of letting priorities.   </p>  <p>  There are more than 18,200 households supported by HAP currently in 28 local authority areas, including homeless households being supported by the DRHE operated scheme for the Dublin Region, and the scheme is working well for the households who are benefitting from the security of the long-term housing support that it offers.</p></reply>

It is a matter for local authorities, when assessing individual households, to consider whether rents payable are in accordance with the authority&rsquo;s rent scheme.  Therefore, decisions on whether or not to disregard either a proportion of income or particular sources of income for the purposes of calculating rents are matters for each individual local authority to consider in accordance with their own rent scheme.  </p>  <p>  Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 allows the Minister to make regulations in respect of various matters to be included in a rent scheme. These can include the sources of household income that may be assessed for the purpose of determining rent levels.  Considerable work has been carried out by my Department in developing a draft framework for a harmonisation of the approach to be taken by local authorities in regard to various aspects of rent schemes.  This includes providing for a common set of income disregards to be applied by all housing authorities in determining a household&rsquo;s assessable income for rent calculation purposes.</p>  <p>  These proposals are now being examined further in the light of the broader commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to review the disparate systems of differential rents for social housing in place across local authorities.  The overall aim is to ensure that housing supports are fair and sustainable, prioritise those on lowest incomes and avoid creating social welfare traps that may prevent people from either returning to work or to the private housing market, while also recognising the fact that a range of approaches to differential rents have become established in different local authority areas.  This review is scheduled to be completed before the end of Quarter 2 2017.</p></reply>

Planning applications are made to the relevant local planning authority with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  </p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development Act, each planning authority's development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned.  Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, inter alia, objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including energy facilities, and many local authorities have developed renewable energy strategies for their areas in this context.   </p>  <p>  In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the local development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any relevant guidelines issued by my Department.  Planning authorities must then make their own decisions based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications.   </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the planning code is sufficiently robust to facilitate the assessment of individual planning permission applications for solar farm developments.

The Government also included in the scheme the laundry that was attached to Stanhope Street Training School and later also decided to include a 12th institution, the Training School in Summerhill.</p>  <p>  In his report, Judge Quirke make a clear distinction between what is required for most women and what is required for those lacking full decision making capacity, including those women that are in an institutional setting.  All women eligible under the Magdalen Ex Gratia Scheme are being provided with their entitlements - lump sum payments, pension payments and enhanced medical cards and, in general, the enjoyment of these benefits and entitlements do not require a personal advocate.  In the vast majority of cases there are no capacity issues and for these women nominated contact people have been identified in the relevant Departments (Justice and Equality, Social Protection, and Health) to assist the women in accessing their entitlements and in advising the women in a professional, confidential and sensitive manner.  Also, the Government has provided grants to the Irish Women Survivors Support Network to provide advice and support to the women who are residing in the UK. </p>  <p>  Where possible capacity  questions raise, officials in my Department are careful to make an initial assessment as to whether the applicant can understand the scheme and sign the relevant legal documentation.  If there is any indication that an applicant has capacity issues, officials cross check with other Departments to establish if there are any issues and, if necessary, a medical assessment is sought.  With regard to those person who lacks capacity, it is important to note that a personal advocate has very limited powers.  A personal advocate does not have power of attorney to make decisions or otherwise to manage the affairs of the person.  That is why the provisions of Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 are so important.  Payments to 19 women are being processed under the terms of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 with proper safeguards having been established.</p>  <p>  It should also that women who were in the Magdalen laundries are already covered under section 21 of the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act, 2009 which makes provision for persons to act as care representatives in respect of any person applying for support under that Act.</p></reply>

This very substantial investment in personnel is driven by our commitment to ensuring that all citizens have the reassurance of a visible, responsive and effective policing service. </p>  <p>  At present there are approximately 2,000 civilians in the organisation carrying out senior management, administrative and technical roles.  4,000 civilians will effectively double this figure and represents a medium term target of 20% civilians over the next 5 years.  This will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently with 14% civilians, more into line with international norms and ensure that trained police men and women, are available for and utilised in operational areas.</p>  <p>  To support the implementation of this vision, Budget 2017 has provided funding for 800 Garda trainees, 300 Reserves and up to 500 civilians.  The recruitment and appointment of these additional civilians will facilitate the Commissioner in addressing capacity and critical skills gaps across the organisation including in corporate supports, change management, human resources and financial management at the national, regional and Divisional levels, and also to begin the phased redeployment of Garda&iacute; to front-line policing roles.   These additional resources will make an important contribution to the delivery of the ambitious reform agenda set out in the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 and will facilitate deeper civilianisation in the coming years. </p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has agreed that the 20% target will be achieved through a twin-track approach: firstly, the identification of Garda&iacute; filling roles that could be done by suitably qualified civilians of whom the Garda Inspectorate has indicated there may be in the region of 1,500, and secondly, the application of a "civilian by default" policy.  Under this policy all new posts, other than operational policing posts, and non-operational policing posts that become vacant, will be filled by civilian staff with the appropriate skills and expertise.  Having regard to the Policing Authority's statutory functions in relation to approving the number and grades of civilian staff in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and making senior appointments, I have requested the Commissioner, in conjunction with the Authority, to prepare a 5 year plan to achieve the 20% target through the rigorous application of these policies.  Work is underway on this plan and I am informed by the Authority that of the 500 civilians to be recruited this year, Garda management has indicated that some 30% will lead to redeployment opportunities which is a very welcome start on a road that has the potential to make a huge contribution to ensuring that we have an effective and efficient police service.</p></reply>

Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who joined the organisation on or after 1 April 2004 may retire on full pension once they have served at least 30 years and have reached 55 years of age.  Accordingly a member has the option of continuing to serve until they reach 60 years of age.</p><p>I am informed that it is projected that in the region of 300 members will retire from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2017 and 2018.  However due to the voluntary nature of the majority of retirements, it is not possible to give an accurate indication of the number of projected retirements on a Divisional basis. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing throughout the country in order to strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and prevent crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the College 838 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am further informed that 750 Garda are scheduled to attest this year.  This will see Garda numbers increasing to around the 13,500 mark by year end when projected retirements are taken into account. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Sligo/Leitrim Division in the coming years.</p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and classroom based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, 838 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed by the Commissioner that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division including the Sligo/ Leitrim, Cavan/Monaghan and Donegal Divisions in the coming years.</p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.</p></reply>

It is encouraging to note that since the launch of the operation in November 2015, the burglary figures have shown a significant downward trend.  Indeed, the most recent CSO official recorded crime statistics for Q3 of 2016 show a decrease of 31% in burglary for the twelve months ending 30 September 2016 compared to the previous twelve month period.  This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor.  If we look at the first nine months of 2016, the figures for the Sligo Leitrim Garda Division show a reduction in Burglary of 38% compared to the same period in 2015. </p>  <p>  If I might illustrate the scale of Garda activity against burglary and property crime &ndash; under Operation Thor we have seen 38,894 crime prevention patrols and in the order of 50,823 targeted checkpoints nationwide.  There have also been in the region of 3,053 arrests and 3,733 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences. </p>  <p>  We have also seen the enactment of specific legislation targeting prolific burglars in the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015.  These provisions are now available to Garda&iacute; in relation to prosecutions arising from the concentrated drive against crime which is being implemented under Operation Thor, which is supported by very significant investments in Garda resources.  The reduction in burglaries as a result of Operation Thor will not of course be indicated in the detection rate statistics when they become available for the relevant period but the prevention of crime is always preferable to crimes having been committed which must then be detected.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act was commenced a year ago and introduced the DNA database, which provides Garda&iacute; with investigative links ('hits') between people and unsolved crimes including burglaries.  It is anticipated that this should significantly assist in improving detection rates for burglary over the coming years. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, Operation Thor and the drive against burglary is supported by the commitment to increase Garda numbers to a Force of 15,000 as well as the very significant resource allocations which the Government has made to ensure by a strong and visible police presence throughout the country.</p></reply>

The transitional arrangements apply to certain applications for refugee status and subsidiary protection which were made before the commencement date (31 December, 2016) and were not finalised for processing by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT).</p>  <p>  The planning for the commencement of the Act took place during 2016, involving consultation with Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and correspondence with applicants alerting them to the transition arrangements.  I am informed by the Chief International Protection Officer that, as is required by the 2015 Act, in late January/February 2017 the IPO, in addition to placing advertisements in the national media, wrote to approximately 3,000 applicants whose cases were not finalised by the ORAC or the RAT, to inform them of the commencement of the relevant provisions of the 2015 Act and how the transitional provisions would affect their applications.  All applicants received the following documents with the mailshot:</p>  <p>   - Information Note - Transitional Arrangements (IPO 12),</p>  <p>   - Information Booklet for Applicants for International Protection (IPO 1) and,</p>  <p>   - Application for International Protection Questionnaire (IPO 2).</p>  <p>  I understand that the relevant mailshot was sent on an incremental basis initially to both adult applicants in Direct Provision and to those with private addresses. That information was sent out first in English followed by material in 17 other languages.  Forms are currently being sent out to minors who have applications in their own right.</p>  <p>  On 30 January 2017, the IPO wrote to all legal representatives on record, providing comprehensive information on the new legislation.  In addition, notices were circulated to Direct Provision centres in relation to the mailshot.</p>  <p>  I am also informed by the Chief International Protection Officer that he has held a number of meetings with NGO's and the UNHCR over recent months, through the IPO Customer Liaison Panel, to brief them on the arrangements for the commencement of the Act and for the notification of applicants in relation to the transitional provisions and how these will be operated in practice.</p>  <p>  Early access to legal advice is a recognised success factor in the operation of a single applications procedure and the position in with regard to the Legal Aid Board and its role is set-out in my response to PQ Number 87 also for answer today.  </p>  <p>  In order to ensure applicants had sufficient time to familiarise themselves with this new system, there is no deadline, statutory or otherwise, set in any correspondence sent out by the IPO.  I can inform the Deputies that the information sent to applicants in January/February 2017 made clear in Paragraph 7.3 that the Application for International Protection Questionnaire (IPO 2) should be returned "if possible, no later than 20 working days from the date of the covering letter".  The next paragraph 7.4 went on to state clearly that opportunities to add to the information supplied exist up to two weeks before the scheduled interview.  The word deadline or statutory deadline does not exist and no negative consequences for failing to meet an 'if possible' time frame were included or implied.  The twenty working day time frame reflects the willingness of the IPO to begin work on the new single procedure as soon as possible in respect of legacy applications.</p>  <p>  I am happy to restate that this is purely an administrative time-frame and NGOs and service providers have been informed of that throughout the planning process.  Flexibility is being provided by the International Protection Office, a call centre is available to answer any queries and if extra time is required for its completion, as the wisdom of accessing legal advice is stressed in the questionnaire, no impediment or disadvantage exists to prevent the careful filling out of the new single application form.  I understand, so as to remove any false impressions that may be circulating abroad that the 'if possible' time-frame is some sort of statutory deadline, the IPO has again written to the members of the Customer Liaison Panel in the past few days to confirm the arrangements and that similar clarification is being provided on the IPO website.</p>  <p>  Applicants have also been clearly advised, as referred to above, that should they or their legal advisors need to provide supplementary information to the International Protection Office after the they have submitted the questionnaire, they can also do so, up to two weeks prior to the date of their scheduled interview, if possible.  This timescale will facilitate the translation of documents if required and ensure that the IPO interviewer has all their papers available and considered in advance of the interview date.</p>  <p>  In relation to the processing of cases, when the application for International Protection Questionnaire and other supporting documentation is returned by applicants, I am advised by the Chief International Protection Officer (CIPO) that he intends to schedule applications in the IPO primarily on the basis of date of application (oldest cases first).  The prioritisation of international protection applications is provided for in the International Protection Act 2015 subject to the need for fairness and efficiency.  The CIPO intends to publish a Statement shortly on the planned approach to prioritisation, having consulted the UNHCR and relevant NGO's on the matter.</p>  <p>  There are over 100 staff assigned to the IPO at present all of whom have been authorised to perform the functions of international protection officers.  These staff will be used to support the single procedure process and in undertaking a variety of functions such as the registration and fingerprinting of applicants, the issue of Temporary Residence Certificates, the scheduling of cases for interview as well as interviewing applicants and preparing and issuing international protection recommendations and decisions in relation to permission to remain.  The permanent staff are supported by a Panel of some 35 persons with legal expertise who are retained on a contract for service basis to undertake interviews and prepare international protection recommendations and permission to remain decisions.</p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of training, Deputies will wish to be aware that all staff employed in the IPO, as well as Panel members, have previously served in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner so they have considerable expertise in the protection area.  In addition to this expertise and training already provided, case processing staff and Panel members in the IPO have received substantial training on the assessment of applications in the context of the introduction of the single procedure process and more training is planned over the coming weeks.  Such training is provided by a combination of in-house experts in that Office as well as by the UNHCR. In this regard, UNHCR protection and training experts have been located in the ORAC for the purpose of supporting the protection determination process there for a number of years.  In the context of the single procedure, a UNHCR expert from Canada with considerable expertise in the operation of a single procedure process is currently working in the IPO for the purpose of developing internal procedures, providing protection training and supporting quality assurance systems.  That international expert is supported by other UNHCR experts as required.  </p>  <p>  You will appreciate that the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015, which provides for the introduction of the single application procedure, represents the most fundamental reform of the international protection process in the State for nearly two decades.  Therefore it is essential that no statutory deadline is imposed on applicants by the IPO.  The single procedure process, unlike the previous process which involved multiple bodies and procedures, will result in a more streamlined approach contributing to the determination of status for applicants at a much earlier stage than has been the case to date, and consequently, shorter stays in the Direct Provision system.</p>  <p>  While it is recognised that, for a transitional period, applicants will be required to become familiar with the new arrangements, I can assure the Deputies that support will be provided by the International Protection Office and other relevant State authorities to ensure that clarity is available to applicants on the new arrangements and how they will impact on individual cases.</p></reply>

This approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, 838 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed by the Commissioner that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division including the Divisional Drug Units in the coming years. </p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will  support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling all criminal activity.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out below in tabular form the strength of the Waterford Divisional Drugs Unit  for the years 2014, 2015 and 2016 as provided by the Garda Commissioner.

It was chaired by then Senator Martin McAleese and it is commonly referred to as the McAleese report.  The material in the Report relates to 10 different institutions which were run by 4 different Orders of nuns over a period of 70 years.  Although there was no finding in the McAleese Report which indicated that the State had any liability in the matter, following the report&rsquo;s publication the Taoiseach issued a State apology to the women. Mr. Justice Quirke was asked by the Government to make recommendations on an appropriate redress scheme for those who were in the 10 Magdalen laundries that were the subject of the McAleese Report.  The Government also included in the scheme the laundry that was attached to Stanhope Street Training School and later also decided to include a 12th institution, the Training School in Summerhill..</p><p>The Quirke Report recommended that the Magdalen women should receive the same range of medical services as those provided to women who were infected by Hepatitis C as a result of State actions.  This has happened.  In his report Judge Quirke noted that not all of the services provided to the Hep C victims may be directly relevant to the Magdalen women and, so for example<i>,</i>Hep C-specific medicines and treatments do not apply to the Magdalen women.</p><p>Judge Quirke made no mention of alternative therapies in his report nor are they mentioned in the<b></b>Health (Amendment) Act 1996 or the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act, 2015, which made specific medical provision for Hepatitis C and Magdalen women respectively.  The question of alternative therapies has been raised before, including in a D&aacute;il Question from this Deputy on 24 March, 2015.  If a case were to be made for the provision of effective and proven alternative medical therapy services for Magdalen women, such provision being on an administrative basis outside of the aforementioned legislation, I would consult with my colleague the Minister for Health on the request.</p></reply>

All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  Section 15 of the Act provides that the Minister may, in her absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation if satisfied that certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  In particular, these conditions require that an applicant is of good character.  </p><p>It would be neither possible or appropriate, given the wide range of possibilities, for me to publish precise criteria on how specific offences will be considered in any application, as each application is considered on its merits based on the entirety of the case presented at that time.  To do so could be interpreted as a fettering of the absolute discretion given to the Minister in the Act.  I can inform the Deputy that I am concerned to ensure that the threshold of what constitutes good character is, taking all things into account, maintained at an appropriate level and as such is fair to all applicants having regard to their particular<b></b>circumstances.  </p><p>It is open to any individual to lodge an application for a certificate of naturalisation if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  The fact that a person may have had an application refused does not preclude or disqualify them from submitting a fresh application in the future.  Indeed, the letter advising an applicant of a negative decision also informs them that they may re-apply for the grant of a certificate of naturalisation at any time.  The letter advises that, when considering making such a re-application, they should give due regard to the reasons for the refusal which were contained in the submission attached to the refusal letter and that any further application will be considered taking into account all statutory and administrative conditions applicable at the time of application.</p><p>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and I know the Deputy will appreciate that it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p></reply>

The situation remains unchanged.  The person referred to by the Deputy was granted permission to enter and reside in the State in September 2011 pursuant to an application for family reunification made on her behalf by the person's family member who is a recognised refugee in the State.  Family members are granted family reunification for the purpose of entering the State and residing with the refugee.  The permission granted is, in accordance with the provisions of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, in line with the refugee's permission and the subject of the family reunification application must be accompanied by the refugee when registering their permission to reside in the State with the Burgh Quay Registrations Office, INIS, 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 or, should the person reside outside of Dublin, with the Immigration Officer at his/her local Garda station.  </p>  <p>  In circumstances where the refugee is no longer resident in the State, the permission granted to family members pursuant to an application for Family Reunification would have to be reconsidered as the conditions under which the permission was granted no longer exist, i.e., the status of the family member is no longer that of the 'subject of an application for family reunification'.

Claimants are required to complete a two-stage online process; an application and then a claim.  </p>  <p>  First-Time Buyers under the Help to Buy incentive fall into 3 categories as follows:-</p>  <p>  1. Claimants who have contracted to purchase, or drawn down the first tranche of their qualifying loan to self-build, their home in the period between 19 July 2016 and 31 December 2016, inclusive.  This category is known as Retrospective Claimants.</p>  <p>  2. Claimants who draw down the first tranche of their qualifying loan to self-build their home in the period between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2019.</p>  <p>  3. Claimants who contract to purchase their home, in the period between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  Regarding retrospective claimants, I am advised by Revenue that the claim process does not require the developer to pass information to Revenue.  Instead, retrospective claimants are required to submit supporting documentation including a signed copy of the contract, evidence of their mortgage or mortgage drawdown, and details of the property directly to Revenue.  </p>  <p>  Regarding claimants who draw down the first tranche of their qualifying loan to self-build their home in the period between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2019, I am advised that the information supplied by the claimant will require verification by the claimant's solicitor before any refund is paid.  The appropriate refund will be made to the claimant's qualifying loan bank account. Such claims do not require the developer to pass information to Revenue.  </p>  <p>  Regarding claimants who contract to purchase their home in the period between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2019, I am advised that the information supplied by the claimant will require verification by the Revenue-approved qualifying contractor before any refund is paid.  The appropriate refund will be made directly to the qualifying contractor.   </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that as of 10 February 2017 there have been 138 applications for registration as 'qualified contractors', with 55 of these being fully approved.  Given the number of queries they have received from contractors, Revenue anticipates that the number of approved contractors will continue to increase over coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  Requiring contractors to register with Revenue under the Help to Buy incentive in advance of processing any claims is an important element to ensure compliance under the scheme and is necessary in order to safeguard public monies being paid under the incentive.  As such, I do not intend to remove this requirement to register or to allow the rebate be paid directly to the first time buyer when they are purchasing a home from a contractor.  </p>  <p>  The Help to Buy scheme is a generous incentive that facilitates the purchase of a new home by a first time buyer.  For new builds, the rebate is payable on signing the contract to purchase the property rather than upon completion of the sale.  This means that it is necessary that details of the planning permission and ownership of the land are provided to Revenue.  This information is completely within the control of the builder/developer.  The other key condition is that of tax clearance/tax compliance.  If a contractor is not tax compliant, in order to participate in the scheme, he or she should engage with Revenue to bring his or her tax affairs up to date.</p></reply>

He adds, however, that the long-term nature of the financial commitments arising under PPPs require that the use of such arrangements must be carefully planned in order to ensure that they are used to address infrastructural needs in a manner that is sustainable in the long term and which the public finances can afford.  </p>  <p>  It was for this reason that the Government introduced an Investment Policy Framework for PPPs in 2015.  The purpose of the framework is to limit the extent to which PPPs should pre-commit future funding available for capital investment relative to the overall aggregate Exchequer capital allocation available in any individual year.  This includes unitary payment charges in respect of existing PPPs and up-front costs associated with new PPPs, in recognition of the reality that, PPP procurement is a minority procurement option.  There is no limit on the percentage of a PPP that can be privately funded.  In fact PPPs are generally 100% privately funded as off balance sheet projects.  However, it has been agreed that, taken together, costs in respect of PPPs should not pre-commit more than 10% of the overall aggregate capital funding available to future Governments in any individual year.  </p>  <p>  The European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI), to which the Deputy refers, is the joint initiative of the EIB Group and the European Commission aimed at mobilising private financing for strategic investments through loan funding.  Since EFSI's inception, Ireland has seen the main potential beneficiaries of EFSI are likely to be commercial investment projects (including PPP Companies).  In this regard, I am pleased that the Department of Health's Primary Health Care Centres PPP has successfully drawn down EFSI funds.  </p>  <p>  EFSI is an important additional funding possibility alongside others such as the EIB's normal lending, the State's borrowings through the NTMA and other mechanisms such as PPPs and off-balance sheet vehicles.  However it should be remembered that each EFSI loan entered into by the State pre-commits funding for the repayment of such loans, and has to be considered in the context of the expenditure benchmark under the EU's fiscal rules.  The answer, therefore, is not simply about spending more; it is about matching the most appropriate source of funding with investment needs, and ensuring that taxpayers' money is spent wisely.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government's Capital Plan is also overseen by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  In accordance with this, that Minister has responsibility for the approval of Exchequer capital projects, PPP projects and borrowing-led investment, within the broader context of considering the full range of available funding options for State investment.</p></reply>

For instance, in the 2016 Summer Economic Statement, the Government set out plans to invest an additional &euro;5.14 billion over the period to 2021.  This increase is reflected in the gross voted capital projections.  The outturn for 2016 of &euro;4.24 billion will increase to nearly &euro;7.3 billion per annum by 2021.  This increase in gross voted capital relies to a large extent on the capital smoothing feature used in the expenditure benchmark, an in-built flexibility designed to support capital investment.  So the Government is making use of the flexibility in the fiscal rules.  </p>  <p>  I would also point out that my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, is undertaking a capital review this year to ensure that capital spending is fully aligned with national economic and social priorities.  </p>  <p>  At EU level, Ireland supports the European Commission's &euro;315 billion Investment Plan for Europe, which includes the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI).  EFSI commenced operations in July 2015 from which time it has been possible for any project promoter, either public or private, to engage with the European Investment Bank regarding the possibility of receiving loans or guarantees under EFSI for particular projects.  </p>  <p>  Since inception, Ireland has seen the main potential beneficiaries of EFSI as being in the private sector including entities such as PPP companies.  In this regard, I am pleased that the Department of Health's Primary Health Care Centres PPP has successfully drawn down EFSI funds.  In addition, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) has successfully engaged with European Financial Instruments such as the COSME and the InnovFin Guarantee Programme, both of which are made available under the EFSI SME Window.  These support the financing needs of SMEs and aims to ensure that there is an adequate supply of affordable and appropriate credit to meet their needs.  </p>  <p>  President Juncker launched a Commission proposal to extend EFSI both in terms of time and financial capacity on 14 September last and Ireland is fully engaged in the discussions towards securing an agreement that will continue to support investment across the EU including in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Sustainable public finances are a pre-requisite for continued strong economic growth.  My view is that the fiscal rules should not be seen as inhibiting policymakers - they are about ensuring sustainable improvements in living standards for all our citizens.  </p>  <p>  Finally, and as the Deputy will be aware, approval of Exchequer capital projects and PPP projects are the policy responsibility of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and, in this context, he engages with each line Department on an ongoing basis to consider and assess projects and the full range of available funding options.</p></reply>

The scheme only applied in the five cities of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick and therefore did not have application in Co Louth.</p>  <p>  The "Living over the Shop" scheme was one of several tax incentives that were not examined by the independent 2009 Commission on Taxation.

The National Debt is the net debt incurred by the Exchequer after taking account of cash balances and other financial assets. Gross National Debt is the principal component of GGD. GGD also includes the debt of central and local government bodies. GGD is reported on a gross basis and does not net off outstanding cash balances and other related assets.</p><p>The estimated GGD at end-2016, published in Budget 2017, is &euro;200bn (the equivalent of 76.0% of GDP), at an average interest rate of 3.1%. </p><p>Details of the provisional and unaudited composition of General Government debt, its residual maturity and average interest rates as at end-2016 are set out in the following table.</p><p><b>General Government Debt as at end December 2016</b><table><tr><th>Instrument</th><th>Outstanding<br /><br />Balance </th><th>Weighted Average Residual Maturity</th><th>Weighted Average Interest Rate</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>&euro;bn</td><td>Years</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>Government Bonds</td><td>121.6</td><td>11.1</td><td>3.7%*</td></tr><tr><td>EU-IMF Programme</td><td>50.3</td><td>11.2**</td><td>2.1%**</td></tr><tr><td>State Savings </td><td>17.2***</td><td>***</td><td>0.33%-1.5%***</td></tr><tr><td>Other Medium and Long-Term Debt</td><td>1.7</td><td>16.8****</td><td>3.0%****</td></tr><tr><td>Short term debt</td><td>5.9*****</td><td>0.3*****</td><td>-0.3%*****</td></tr><tr><td>Other general government debt ******</td><td>3.3</td><td>****** </td><td>****** </td></tr><tr><td>Total general government debt</td><td>200.0</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Sources: NTMA, CSO, Department of Finance</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr></table></p><p>The 2016 figures are provisional and unaudited.

National Debt figures take account of the effect of currency hedging transactions. </p><p>Notes:</p><p>* The nominal interest rate is displayed, which differs from the yield at issue.</p><p>** EFSM loans are subject to maturity extensions designed to bring the original weighted average maturity to 19.5 years. It is not expected that Ireland will have to refinance any of its EFSM loans before 2027. However as the revised maturity dates of individual EFSM loans will only be determined as they approach their original maturity dates, the weighted average maturity figure above does not fully reflect the maturity extensions. Including certain assumptions for EFSM maturity extensions, the estimated residual weighted average maturity of EU-IMF Programme loans was 13 years at end-2016. The EU-IMF Programme interest rate is an estimated weighted average, euro equivalent interest rate.</p><p>*** State Savings Schemes also include moneys invested by depositors in the Post Office Savings Bank (POSB) which does not form part of the National Debt but is part of other General Government Debt in the following table. Taking into account POSB Deposits, total State Savings outstanding were &euro;20.1 billion at end-December 2016. State Savings include products with original maturities ranging from 310 years. These products generally have a very high re-investment rate. Irrespective of the original term, NTMA State Savings products can be encashed on demand at any timerepayment takes 7 days. Prize bonds can be encashed when 90 days have elapsed after the purchase date. The interest rates shown are the maximum interest rates (AER) payable on the fixed term, fixed rate products available for purchase at end 2016. </p><p>**** The table shows the weighted average maturity and interest rate for Private Placements, Euro Medium Term Notes, and loans from the European Investment Bank and Council of Europe Development Bank.</p><p>***** The table shows the weighted average maturity and euro equivalent interest rate for Treasury Bills, Euro Commercial Paper, Exchequer Notes and Central Treasury Notes. The short-term debt outstanding balance also includes Borrowing from Ministerial Funds.</p><p>******The forecast balance of other GGD includes debt of Local Authorities, the Housing Finance Agency, non-commercial semi-state bodies, voluntary hospitals, and the HSE.  This category also includes consolidation adjustments in respect of debt, including bonds, held by General Government entities. The weighted average residual maturity and weighted average interest are not available for this category.</p></reply>

Given these commitments  I do not have any plans to review the role of Public Interest Directors in State supported financial institutions. </p>  <p>  The rights for the State to appoint Public Interest Directors  to the boards of the Covered Institutions were derived from the terms of the guarantee schemes introduced in 2008 and extend over the period of the guarantee. The last of the guaranteed liabilities are due to mature between now and Spring 2018 and as such I do not expect to make any new appointments of Public Interest Directors to the board of the banks.   </p>  <p>  Going forward however, the State will have the ability to appoint directors to the banks in which it has large equity ownership positions. So in line with the commitment in the PPG, my officials have commenced a process to develop new procedures for any future appointments to bank boards.</p></reply>

These restrictions arise from the European Union excise regime which governs the production, processing and holding of excisable products under duty suspension, within each Member State. This regime also governs all intra-Union movement of excisable products. The key features as they apply to mineral oil imports from Northern Ireland are set out below; </p>  <p>  Mineral oil for use as motor vehicle fuel</p>  <p>  Persons bringing mineral oil fuel for vehicles into the State from Northern Ireland must pay excise duty (Mineral Oil Tax) on that fuel at the rates specified in Mineral Oil Tax law (Chapter 1 of Part 2 of the Finance Act 1999).  Certain exceptions apply to this requirement  where the fuel is present in the fuel tank of a vehicle at the time that vehicle is brought into the State or where the fuel is in a single portable vessel with a capacity of not more than 10 litres that is in that vehicle at the time of coming into the State, and where the proper UK excise duty applicable to the use of that fuel in the vehicle involved has been paid in that jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  In the case of natural gas used for use as vehicle fuel, the liability to excise duty does not arise at the time the gas is brought into the State, but rather where the gas is supplied to a person who supplies or intends to supply it to the tank of a vehicle.</p>  <p>  Mineral oil fuels for use other than as motor vehicle fuel</p>  <p>  Persons bringing fuel into the State for use other than as road vehicle fuel (for example for heating use, or for agricultural tractors or stationary motors) also must pay the Mineral Oil Tax on that fuel. In the case of gas oil or kerosene, where a person wishes to pay only the reduced rate applicable to those fuels when intended for use other than as road fuel, the oil must be marked with the fuel markers prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  In addition, all commercial movements of mineral oil into the State from Northern Ireland are subject to a movement control system.  Movements of duty-suspended mineral oil are subject to  an EU-wide electronic system (known as the Excise Movement Control System or "EMCS").  In the case of movements of duty-paid oils, such movements may only take place under an equivalent paper-based control method.</p>  <p>  Where a person also intends to sell or deal in mineral oil for use as motor vehicle fuel or in gas oil or kerosene for use other than as road fuel, the appropriate Mineral Oil Trader's Licence, issued by the Revenue Commissioners, must also be held.</p>  <p>  Solid Fuel</p>  <p>  Mechanisms have been put in place by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment for control of supplies of solid fuel coming into the State.  Regulations issued by that Department govern the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of solid fuels, require the registration of coal traders and establish higher environmental standards for coal supplied in the State compared with Northern Ireland. Compliance with those Regulations is enforced by local authorities.</p>  <p>  In addition, solid fuel (coal and peat) is liable to excise duty in this jurisdiction in the form of Solid Fuel Carbon Tax. A person making the first supply of a solid fuel in the State must pay Solid Fuel Carbon Tax on the quantity of solid fuel concerned.  The tax is not payable where the person acquires a quantity of solid fuel and personally accompanies it into the State for that person's own private consumption. </p>  <p>  Unlike mineral oils, EU Law does not require compliance with movement controls for solid fuels for excise duty purposes.  Therefore, no excise movement controls apply to imports of solid fuel from Northern Ireland, whether by private persons for their own consumption or by traders or businesses for commercial purposes.</p></reply>

The Group was established by the CSO on foot of the exceptional growth rate in 2015 and the increasing limitations of both GDP and GNP as measures of economic activity in Ireland.

As part of its response to the report, the CSO has undertaken to provide annual data on the adjusted measures of GNI from mid-2017.</p>  <p>  While the adjusted measure of GNI, which excludes the impact of redomiciled companies and the depreciation of foreign owned domestic capital assets, will provide a reliable level indicator of the size of the economy, the CSO will continue to produce GDP, GNP and GNI in accordance with internationally agreed methodologies and our obligations under EU legislation. The use of these statistics for official purposes, which are fixed in legislation, will also continue such as, for example, evaluating government debt levels relative to those agreed in the Stability and Growth Pact, calculating our EU Budget contributions, and also as inputs to the calculations of fiscal space.</p>  <p>  In the context of measuring fiscal space, as the Deputy will be aware, these calculations require estimates of the potential output of the economy, represented by potential GDP, which are prepared in accordance with the EU's harmonised methodology. </p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that when assessing the position of the economy, my Department takes into consideration a wide range of indicators and the government will continue to pursue sensible policies aimed at ensuring sustainable growth and public finances.</p></reply>

The intention to backdate this tax incentive to this date was announced at that time with a view to avoiding any potential interruption in house sales, by purchasers who may otherwise have deferred purchases, pending the commencement of the incentive.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to backdate the scheme prior to 19 July, as to extend eligibility for the scheme further back than the date of its initial announcement would consist entirely of deadweight. One of the primary policy aims of the incentive is to assist those struggling to save for the deposit required in purchasing a house. Individuals who purchased new homes before the announcement of the incentive, did not need the assistance of the State to fund the required deposit. Such individuals made their purchasing decisions on the basis of the information available to them at the time of purchase, and could not have expected a subsequently introduced tax relief to also be available to them. Similarly, those who commenced the drawdown of agreed mortgages in respect of self built properties before 19th of July, could also not have expected a subsequently introduced tax relief to be available to them.</p>  <p>  As with all time bound reliefs, there will always be those who just miss out on qualification. I do not intend to extend the parameters of this new measure any further as it would become less targeted and more costly.</p></reply>

Claimants are required to complete a two-stage online process: an application and then a claim.</p>  <p>  First-Time Buyers under the Help to Buy incentive fall into 3 categories as follows:</p>  <p>  1. Claimants who have contracted to purchase, or drawn down the first tranche of their qualifying loan to self-build, their home in the period between 19 July 2016 and 31 December 2016, inclusive.  This category is known as Retrospective Claimants.</p>  <p>  2. Claimants who draw down the first tranche of their qualifying loan to self-build their home in the period between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2019.</p>  <p>  3. Claimants who contract to purchase their home, in the period between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2019.</p>  <p>  Regarding retrospective claimants, I am advised by Revenue that the claim process does not require the developer to pass information to Revenue.  Instead, retrospective claimants are required to submit supporting documentation including a signed copy of the contract, evidence of their mortgage or mortgage drawdown, and details of the property directly to Revenue.</p>  <p>  Regarding claimants who draw down the first tranche of their qualifying loan to self-build their home in the period between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2019, I am advised that the information supplied by the claimant will require verification by the claimant's solicitor before any refund is paid. The appropriate refund will be made to the claimant's qualifying loan bank account. Such claims do not require the developer to pass information to Revenue.</p>  <p>  Regarding claimants who contract to purchase their home in the period between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2019, I am advised that the information supplied by the claimant will require verification by the Revenue-approved qualifying contractor before any refund is paid.  The appropriate refund will be made directly to the qualifying contractor. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that as of 10 February 2017 there have been 138 applications for registration as 'qualified contractors', with 55 of these being fully approved.  Given the number of queries they have received from contractors, Revenue anticipates that the number of approved contractors will continue to increase over coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Requiring contractors to register with Revenue under the Help to Buy incentive in advance of processing any claims is an important element to ensure compliance under the scheme and is necessary in order to safeguard public monies being paid under the incentive. As such, I do not intend to remove this requirement to register or to allow the rebate be paid directly to the first time buyer when they are purchasing a home from a contractor.</p>  <p>  The Help to Buy scheme is a generous incentive that facilitates the purchase of a new home by a first time buyer. For new builds, the rebate is payable on signing the contract to purchase the property rather than upon completion of the sale. This means that it is necessary that details of the planning permission and ownership of the land are provided to Revenue. This information is completely within the control of the builder/developer. The other key condition is that of tax clearance/tax compliance. If a contractor is not tax compliant, in order to participate in the scheme, he or she should engage with Revenue to bring his or her tax affairs up to date.</p></reply>

Its aim is to increase the availability of funding to Irish SMEs, at a lower cost and on more flexible terms, than has been available in recent times on the Irish Market. The SBCI does not lend directly to SMEs, rather it channels its funds through lending partners known as on-lenders. It currently has three bank and five non-bank on-lending partners and the SBCI is actively seeking to add new on-lenders in 2017, thereby broadening its distribution capability and market coverage. In doing so, the SBCI will promote competition in the SME Finance Market. </p>  <p>  To the end of September 2016, the SBCI has lent &euro;458 million to 10,684 SMEs operating across all sectors of the Irish economy including manufacturing, agriculture, food, retail, healthcare, transport and construction. The SBCI will shortly publish lending figures to the end of December 2016, which are expected to show a significant increase in lending. These figures will be available on the SBCI's website www.sbci.gov.ie. </p>  <p>  The SBCI has a significant funding capacity, over &euro;1 billion, which it is using to support Irish SMEs investing in and growing their businesses. The SBCI also has a COSME risk sharing agreement in place with the European Investment Fund (EIF). This facility will be used to enable the delivery of SBCI guarantee products and further facilitate the provision of additional credit to Irish SMEs.</p></reply>

The 2013 Report showed that there were around 360,000 customers of licensed moneylenders with outstanding loan amounts in the region of &euro;200 million at that time.

This plan contains a significant volume of responses to the current housing crisis, of which the Help to Buy incentive is one. This comprehensive Action Plan takes a holistic approach in addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market in areas such as planning and land use, as well as regulation and skills deficits in the construction sector. While the primary focus of the Action Plan is to tackle structural constraints, fiscal supports can play a supporting and time-bound role in addressing the current problems in the housing sector.</p>  <p>  It is in this context that the Help-to-Buy scheme should be considered. Its role is to complement the other measures in the Action Plan. The extent to which the scheme could lead to an increase in residential property prices will very much depend on the speed and efficiency with which structural supply constraints are eliminated and residential building activity increases. Therefore, the impact of the Help to Buy incentive on property prices cannot be considered in isolation from the impact of other measures contained in the Action Plan, which are primarily designed to increase supply.</p>  <p>  I have already committed to commissioning an independent economic impact assessment of the Help to Buy incentive which will look at, among other issues, the impact on property prices. However, it should be remembered that the high rates of house prices reflect the supply constrained nature of the Irish residential market, and were an issue over the past number of years rather than since the start of the Help to Buy incentive.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department continues to monitor developments in the property market including property prices on an ongoing basis. However, the Help to Buy incentive, which came into effect at the beginning of January, has been introduced for two reasons - to assist first time buyers in putting together the requisite deposit to buy a home, and to encourage the construction of new homes. As such, I am not in a position to consider an alternative methodology to assist first time buyers so soon after implementing the Help to Buy incentive, as this would disrupt the incentive effect which is designed to create the conditions to encourage the construction of new homes.</p></reply>

The DEIS Plan 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of social inclusion in education policy. </p><p>A key element of DEIS Plan 2017 Plan is the availability of a new identification process for the assessment of schools for inclusion in DEIS using centrally held CSO and DES data.  </p><p>The key data sources are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.  Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, social class composition and labour market situation. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools. Further information on the development of the identification process is available in the DEIS Review report which can be found on my Department's website at</p><p><i></i>/.</p><p>In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.  Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools within the DEIS School Support Programme.</p><p>Schools included in the list published by the Department on 13th February are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage.</p><p>Schools which have not been included at this stage, are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new model which is fair and objective.</p><p>The new DEIS Plan provides for a verification process and any school wishing to seek verification of the information used to assess the level of disadvantage of its pupil cohort may submit an application for same to social_inclusion@education.gov.ie</p><p>It is important to note that the school details published on 13th February represent a first step in the application of the assessment process to support pupils in schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS. </p><p>However, as noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.</p><p>Once this work has been completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.</p><p>In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017 we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others.  Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.  The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.  If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.</p><p>It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the DEIS programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources.</p></reply>

At that time there were 46 Rural Coordinator Posts at a cost of &euro;2,714,000.</p>  <p>  Evidence strongly suggests that disadvantage associated with rural poverty does not have the same impact on educational achievement as is the case in the urban context.  While urban and rural disadvantage share many characteristics, such as poverty, unemployment and poor housing conditions such disadvantage in a rural context does not have the same impact on educational performance. Evaluation of educational outcomes in DEIS rural primary schools show that pupils in these schools are performing almost at the national averages in literacy and numeracy.</p>  <p>  Our objective in implementing the DEIS Plan 2017 is to have the maximum possible impact on providing opportunities for students most at risk of disadvantage.  To achieve this, additional resources must be targeted as closely as possible at the students with the greatest need in terms of concentrated levels of disadvantage.  Accordingly, the DEIS Plan 2017 does not include a measure to allocate additional teaching resources to rural schools.</p>  <p>  Rural DEIS primary schools continue to be supported with additional financial provision; access to the DSP school meals programme; access for teachers to a range of professional development programmes to assist in supporting the educational needs of children in these schools.</p></reply>

It also allows institutions to fill positions where the funding for the post is from 'non-core' sources.</p>  <p>  My Department allocates the recurrent funding to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) for direct disbursement to the HEA designated higher education institutions.

It involved the introduction of Italian, Spanish, German and French for 5th and 6th classes.  The MLPSI was a pilot scheme across 550 schools with an annual budget of approximately &euro;2.5 million.</p>  <p>  The decision to end the MLPSI was taken in the context of a very challenging budgetary environment where difficult decisions had to be taken.  A 2008 Report by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment recommended against a further expansion of the MLPSI, citing issues of curriculum overload and difficulties relating to the replicability of the model across the system.</p>  <p>  The priority at primary level is to provide high-quality language learning in our two languages, Irish and English.  A new Primary Language Curriculum, incorporating Irish and English, was introduced in classes from Junior Infants to 2nd class from September 2016.  This curriculum aims to ensure that students acquire transferable language skills which will assist them in learning Irish and English and additional languages at second level.  Work is currently underway in developing the Primary Language Curriculum for third to sixth class.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently finalising a strategy on Foreign Languages in Education and this will be published shortly.  The Action Plan for Education refers to the importance of the roll-out of that strategy, together with the implementation of revised curricula at primary level, in supporting increased levels of participation and competence in language learning.</p></reply>

The issue of promoting healthy eating is addressed in schools through subjects such as Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE), and Home Economics as well as in Physical Education.  The aim is to equip them with such skills and knowledge to enable them to make appropriate choices.  This informed approach will help to reduce the incidence of obesity in our young people.</p>  <p>  The SPHE syllabus at both primary and post-primary levels contains modules which educate students on the elements of a balanced diet and the importance of healthy eating for physical and mental well-being.</p>  <p>  The Government published "Healthy Ireland - A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013 - 2025".  "Healthy Ireland" aims to improve the health not only of our students, but also of our nation.  My Department, having consulted with the Department of Health and the HSE, issued guidance for primary and post-primary schools, on promoting healthy lifestyles, in the form of Departmental Circulars.  At the same time, the Department of Health published updated guidelines for post primary schools on the development of healthy eating policies.</p>  <p>  The Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme is a mandatory part of the curriculum in primary schools and in junior cycle.  The programme is supported by comprehensive teacher guidelines and curriculum support services which provide training and advice for schools and also a resource directory.  Physical Education also forms a mandatory part of the primary curriculum.</p>  <p>  At primary level, one of the SPHE strand units 'Taking care of my body' specifically addresses the need for regular exercise and activity as well as the area of nutrition and food and the need for a balanced diet.  This unit is built upon from Infants classes onwards.  By Fifth and Sixth classes children are encouraged to realise and accept responsibility for making wise food choices and for adopting a healthy, balanced diet, and in that, exploring and examining the food pyramid.  Many primary schools operate healthy eating policies with the support of parents.</p>  <p>  Elements of this strand are supported by the "Food Dudes" programme which encourages children to eat more fruit and vegetables both in school and in the home.  The programme is managed by Bord Bia and funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries and also by the EU through the School Fruit Scheme.</p>  <p>  At post-primary level, SPHE for Junior Cycle builds on the primary SPHE Curriculum.  Nutrition and physical activity are specifically addressed in the SPHE module on 'Physical Health'.  In addition cross-curricular links with other subjects such as Home Economics, PE and Junior Science that deal with SPHE-related topics are encouraged.</p></reply>

At primary level, learning/language support hours are allocated on the basis of mainstream classroom teaching posts in the school.  Schools have autonomy to deploy this resource between learning support and language support depending on the specific needs of the school.  These arrangements also provided for additional permanent teaching posts to be given to schools with high concentration of pupils that require language support.</p>  <p>  On the post primary side, with effect from the 2012/13 school year, learning support and language support has been combined into a single allocation process.  Each school with an enrolment of less than 600 recognised pupils (excluding pupils on PLC Programmes) receives an allocation of .9 of a post.  Schools with an enrolment of 600 pupils or more receive an allocation of 1.4 whole time equivalent posts (wtes).  In addition, schools which had significant concentrations of pupils that required language support in the 2011/12 school year were allocated 0.5 or 1 permanent EAL post with effect from the 2012/13 school year.  These EAL posts have been retained by the schools in the current school year.</p>  <p>  Further additional temporary EAL support is also provided, as necessary, to schools that have high concentrations of pupils that require language (EAL) support. At primary level, these allocations are made on the basis of appeals by schools to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board and at post-primary level to the Post Primary Staffing Appeals Board.</p>  <p>  Last month, I announced that a new model for allocating Special Education Teaching Resources to mainstream primary and post primary schools will be introduced from September 2017.  The new model will allocate teachers to schools on the basis of the profiled educational needs of each school.  This new model will encompass the Learning/Language support allocation that schools were allocated in previous years.</p>  <p>  I will arrange for the information sought by the Deputy in relation to the number of EAL posts to be forwarded to her separately.</p></reply>

The DEIS Plan for 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of social inclusion in education policy.</p><p>A key element of DEIS Plan 2017 Plan is the availability of a new identification process for the assessment of schools for inclusion in DEIS using centrally held CSO and DES data.</p><p>The key data sources are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.  Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, social class composition and labour market situation.  This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  Further information on the development of the identification process is available in the DEIS Review report which can be found on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-/</i>.</p><p>In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.  Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools within the DEIS School Support Programme.</p><p>Schools included in the list published by the Department on 13 February are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage.</p><p>Schools which have not been included at this stage, including the school referred to by the Deputy, are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new model which is fair and objective.</p><p>The new DEIS Plan provides for a verification process and any school wishing to seek verification of the information used to assess the level of disadvantage of its pupil cohort may submit an application for same to .</p><p>It is important to note that the school details published on 13 February represent a first step in the application of the assessment process to support pupils in schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS.</p><p>However, as noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.</p><p>Once this work has been completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.</p><p>In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017 we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others.  Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.  The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.  If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.</p><p>It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the DEIS programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources.</p></reply>

I am in favour of leaving the decisions on what is offered to the discretion of the school, and of students having as broad a range of options to choose from as possible.</p>  <p>  Because the total number of full subjects which can be done for assessment in junior cycle is ten, it is likely that schools will retain most or all of their current subjects in their junior cycle going forward.</p>  <p>  Currently, over 90% of students choose History, although it is compulsory only in voluntary secondary schools, not much more than half our post-primary schools. Curriculum choice is important in motivating students to learn and to remain in school to completion of senior cycle.</p>  <p>  Schools across all sectors offer History. History teachers attract students to their subject through their own love and passion for History, and by engaging the natural curiosity of their students in, for example, the lives of people, the origins of the modern world and in objects and documents from the past.  History is generally the 5th most popular subject in the Junior Certificate examination.</p>  <p>  I have every confidence that, through the implementation of the Framework for Junior Cycle the place of History will be retained and given a new impetus across the junior cycle curriculum.  A new specification for Junior Cycle History is being developed by the NCCA.  This involved extensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public, which finished recently, during which over 200 submissions were received.  The new specification will be available for implementation in all schools from September 2018.</p>  <p>  The Leaving Certificate History syllabus attracts about 25% of the total cohort of students.  The aim is to make the new specification for Junior Cycle History more attractive, so young people can see it as a realistic option, rather than focusing on learning content by heart.  Many people believe that uptake in senior cycle could be improved if the junior cycle History was made more attractive, more relevant and perhaps less of a race against time.</p>  <p>  In the new Framework for Junior Cycle, all schools are expected to provide opportunities for students to achieve 24 statements of learning over the period of junior cycle.  These statements include valuing local, national and international heritage and understanding the importance of the relationship between past and current events, the forces that drive change, and understanding the origins and impacts of social, economic and environmental aspects of the world around them.  Even where students do not take History as a full subject, it is to be hoped that opportunities to achieve such statements through other forms of historical study can be provided to them.</p>  <p>  The minimum time allocated for subjects such as History will be 200 hours over the three years of junior cycle, or the equivalent of three 40-minute periods per week over three years.  For many schools, this will lead to an increased time provision for History as a subject, and it will no longer be nominally linked to Geography as previously.</p>  <p>  This new minimum time stipulation for History as a subject should allow not only for a deepening of a student's historical knowledge but also of his or her ability to analyse, interpret, write and develop historical skills more thoroughly.  Those skills and attitudes can be hugely important in ensuring that students are able to understand and interpret all forms of history, news and current affairs too.</p></reply>

The remaining classes are for children with a range of Special Educational Needs other than Autism.</p><p>The Department considers that it is essential that in assessing the need for special class options in certain areas, the individual needs of children should be properly assessed to determine the appropriateness of special class provision for them.</p><p>It should not be presumed that there should be a special class placement in post primary school for every child that leaves a special class in primary school as many of these children should be able to consider transferring to mainstream or special schools as appropriate.</p><p>With regard to Kildare in particular there are 942 students with ASD attending schools in the county.  Of these 520 students attend mainstream schools and are accessing in-school supports including Resource teaching and S support.  322 students are attending 59 ASD special classes, including 6 early intervention classes, 41 primary ASD classes and 12 post primary ASD classes. A further 100 students with ASD are placed in 4 special schools.</p><p>The NCSE has indicated that it is currently satisfied that there will be sufficient ASD special class placements available to meet demand in the region for the forthcoming school year.</p><p>However both the Department and the NCSE recognise that there have been challenges in opening special classes in some Post primary schools in Kildare.</p><p>The NCSE has indicated that, in general, this is related to the availability of accommodation in these schools.  The Department's Building Unit has advised that Special Needs Units (SNUs) are currently under construction at St Conleth's Vocational School, Newbridge and Ard Scoil na Trion&oacute;ide, Athy.</p><p>In addition, major building projects for a number of schools in Kildare are included on the Department's 6 Year Construction Plan and Special Needs units (SNUs) will be included in these Developments.  The schools in question are:</p><p>St Paul&rsquo;s Secondary School, Monasterevin</p><p>Naas Community College, Naas </p><p>Cross and Passion College, Kilcullen</p><p>Athy Community College</p><p>St Farnan&rsquo;s Post Primary, Prosperous.</p></reply>

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.  Further information on the Section 29 appeals process is available on the Department's website <i>www.education.ie</i>.</p><p>The Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency (EWS) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.

This information has also been provided to the National Council for Special Education and the National Educational Psychological Services.</p>  <p>  Additional educational supports may be made for children, if necessary, with medical conditions such as Narcolepsy.  If it is considered that a child requires additional teaching assistance in school, due to the effect of their illness on their learning ability and participation in school, learning support may be provided for the child from the school's resource teaching/learning support provision. </p>  <p>  A new model for allocating Special Education Teaching Resources to mainstream primary and post primary schools will be introduced from September 2017.  This new model will be a fairer and better way to allocate resources to support children with Special Educational Needs. </p>  <p>  An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  This substantial additional provision will ensure that up to 1,000 schools will receive additional allocations, where the new model indicates additional need.  No school will receive an allocation of resources less than the allocation they received in the 2016/17 school year.</p>  <p>  The Special Education Home Tuition scheme provides a compensatory educational service to children with a significant medical condition which is likely to cause major disruption to their attendance at school on a continuing basis.  Eligibility under this provision is assessed with reference to a completed medical report and attendance records supplied by the school in which the pupil is enrolled.  The maximum allocation of home tuition hours for children with a medical ailment is 10 hours per week, with the allocation reflecting the age of the child and their level of attendance. </p>  <p>  In some instances access to Special Needs Assistant (S) support may be provided for children who do not have an assessed disability, but whose medical condition is such that they require access to care support in order to be able to attend school.  If a school or parent considers that their child has care needs arising from the medical condition Narcolepsy, such that they might require access to S support in order to attend school, the school may assist the pupil from within their existing S allocation or make an application to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) for S support for their child.  The NCSE is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (Ss) to schools. </p>  <p>  Post primary school students with special needs may have special arrangements made for them while sitting State examinations such as the Leaving Certificate and Junior Certificate. Candidates with disabilities can apply through their school for reasonable accommodation during examinations. </p>  <p>  Students with Narcolepsy can access the Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) scheme, which is  a college/university scheme which offers enhanced access routes to third level education for pupils with disabilities.  Further details are available at www.accesscollege.ie/.   </p>  <p>  Details of funding for individual disabilities is not recorded by my Department and is therefore, not available in relation to supports for children with narcolepsy.</p></reply>

Under section 2 of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952, if a vehicle is being used in a manner that would attract a higher rate of tax, the tax becomes payable at that rate.  In other words, if a vehicle is also being used in a private capacity and the relevant private rate applying to the vehicle is higher than the goods rate, then the vehicle must be taxed at the private rate.  Licensing authorities have an obligation under Article 3 of the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 1992 to be satisfied that a vehicle is correctly taxed and it is thus open to a motor tax office to seek appropriate documentation to support a claim for the commercial rate of motor tax.  Such documentation may include evidence of registration for VAT, a certificate of commercial insurance or, at the discretion of the licensing authority concerned, any other documentation that would indicate that the applicant is in trade or business.  It is up to the individual concerned to provide whatever evidence is required by the local authority in order for it to be satisfied that the applicant is entitled to claim what is in effect a concessionary rate of tax.</p></reply>

These include health expenses, income tax, social insurance contributions and levies required by law such as the Local Property Tax, and borrowings in respect of the principal private residence.</p>  <p>  Action 17 of the Strategy for the Rental Sector commits to examining the treatment under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme&rsquo;s financial assessment of income from the rental of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence where they move into long-term residential care.  My Department is currently engaging with the Department of Health in the matter with a view to formulating a joint approach.</p></reply>

It also requires that local authorities take reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site.  To this end, local authorities have been given substantial powers under the Act in relation to such sites, including to:  </p><p>- require specified measures to be taken in relation to a derelict site,</p><p>- impose a levy on sites which are included in their derelict sites register, and</p><p>- acquire derelict site s by agreement or compulsorily.</p><p>Under section 8(1) of the Derelict Sites Act 1990, each local authority was required, within one year after the commencement of the Act, to establish and thereafter maintain a derelict sites register.

Of the funding allocated, &euro;7.7 million was paid out to local authorities and almost 330 developments containing 13,400 units have either been taken in charge or works have taken place and the development will now proceed to be taken in charge by the relevant local authority at an early date.</p><p>Under the terms of the NTICI, only those developments subject to valid taking-in-charge applications were eligible for inclusion in the call for proposals.  It is important to note that the NTICI was not intended to establish a rolling annual funding programme to take in charge all estates not yet taken in charge, but was instead intended to develop better knowledge and systems to support the taking-in-charge of further estates over time.  I intend that the experience and learning from the operation of the NTICI over the course of 2016 will be used to point the way forward in relation to supporting the taking- in-charge process into the future and my Department intends to publish a report on the Initiative&rsquo;s findings and recommendations by this Summer.</p><p>Further information on the NTICI can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p><i>.</i></p></reply>

On 30th September 2016, I made the Social Housing Allocation (Amendment) Regulations 2016 which required that all local authorities must, if they have not already done so, provide for CBL as a method of allocation in their housing allocation schemes by 31 December 2016.   </p>  <p>  I understand that a majority of local authorities have now used CBL as a way of allocating some of their social housing properties.

This additional investment in 2017 means that delivery under the scheme can be accelerated and up to 800 vacant properties can be brought back into use as new homes for families on local authority waiting lists this year.  This funding represents a frontloading of the &euro;140m being made available for the scheme over the next 5 years.</p>  <p>  I will be carefully monitoring the scheme in 2017 to ensure that it works and is cost effective.  Likewise, this analysis will assist in determining its delivery potential for future years, as well as whether additional financial resources are required in that context.   </p>  <p>  The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding required to bring them up to the standard for rental property.  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or an approved housing body (AHB).  This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum of 10 years.  The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease. </p>  <p>  A property owner can either choose to arrange a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead.  Property owners will not be required to take on landlord responsibilities and the local authority or AHB will have on-going management and maintenance responsibilities in respect of the properties.</p>  <p>  The local authority will determine the eligibility for the scheme, having regard to the location and the suitability of the property for social housing and also taking into consideration the extent of the repairs that may be required.  The maximum costs of repairs allowable under this initiative will be &euro;40,000.  My Department is working closely with local authorities to implement the scheme locally.</p>  <p>  The Repair and Leasing Scheme is one of a number of initiatives in Rebuilding Ireland to address vacant properties around the country. Other initiatives include the Buy and Renew Scheme which provides funding for local authorities to purchase vacant properties and remediate them and a new National Vacant Housing Re-Use Strategy which is currently being finalised.</p></reply>

Indeed, I intend that the development of the Framework, one of the most strategically important public policy exercises currently underway by the Government, will be a collaborative exercise, the ultimate success of which will depend on the degree to which all citizens have the opportunity to have their say on how Ireland should develop over the next twenty years or more, and how we can plan for and accommodate the substantial additional population expected by 2040 in a more strategic and sustainable way.  It will be up to the general public, various public bodies and any other stakeholders to put forward their views, including in relation to rural development issues, to my Department which is undertaking a number of technical analyses and assessments of all relevant material submitted in developing the Framework.  To be successful, the Framework will need to address the strategic territorial planning and regional development issues that our country faces between now and 2040, in relation to rural and urban, as well as terrestrial and marine, elements.</p>  <p>  In addition to the draft NPF being subject to public consultation, the Framework will also be submitted to the Oireachtas for its consideration later this year.</p></reply>

Under the SSHA 2016 process, all housing authorities were required to review those households who were on their housing list but were not then in receipt of housing support.  This was to ensure that the details of the applicant households are up to date and accurate and that they remain eligible for, and in need of, social housing support in accordance with the criteria set down in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations.  As part of this assessment, all local authorities wrote to relevant households during 2016, including those in transitional and shared or emergency accommodation if relevant, informing them of the assessment process and seeking updated information where necessary.</p>  <p>  Where a household responded and was found to no longer meet the qualification criteria for social housing support in light of their updated details, they were removed from the list.</p>  <p>  In the event of an initial non-response by a household to a request for updated information, guidance issued by the Housing Agency advised housing authorities to contact the household again and to use all reasonable means of communication available to them in contacting the applicant.  Authorities were also advised to undertake local advertising campaigns informing households about the Summary.  Where a number of attempts to contact a household failed to elicit a response, authorities were advised that it was not unreasonable to then close the household&rsquo;s application.  However, housing authorities were also advised that should the household subsequently respond with the information required within a reasonable time, the application could be re-activated.</p></reply>

I am aware of the difficulties experienced by some households in purchasing their own home where they are not eligible for social housing support on income grounds, and where they are consequently faced with sourcing accommodation in the private rented sector.  The most effective way to reduce and stabilise rents in the long term is to increase supply and accelerate delivery of housing for the private and social rented sectors. <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>, the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, aims to increase and accelerate housing delivery across all tenures to help individuals and families meet their housing needs.  It sets out over 80 actions that the Government is taking, through new policy, new legislation and innovative Budgetary measures, to achieve that aim.</p><p>Pillar 4 of the Action Plan committed to development of a comprehensive rental strategy and this was delivered, with the publication of the <i>Strategy for the Rental Sector</i>on 13 December 2016.  The Strategy identifies high and rapidly rising rents as the key driver of accommodation insecurity for tenants and a factor in the termination of tenancies.  To address this situation, the Strategy introduced a Rent Predictability Measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where the imbalance between demand and supply of rental accommodation is driving rent levels upwards most acutely.</p><p>The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 gave effect to, and provided for the immediate implementation of, the Rent Predictability Measure.  Areas of the country satisfying the statutory criteria will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones and rent increases in those areas are generally capped at 4% per annum for a period of three years.  The measure was introduced with immediate effect in the four Dublin Local Authority areas and in Cork City.  A further 12 Local Electoral Areas were designated as Rent Pressure Zones on 27 January 2017.</p><p>Details of the areas that met the criteria and have been designated as Rent Pressure Zones are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p>www.housing.gov.ie/housing/private-rented-housing/coveney-designates-new-rent-pressure-zones.</p></reply>

Under the Guidelines, planning authorities are required to frame their planning policies in a balanced and measured way that ensures that the housing needs of rural communities are met, while avoiding excessive urban-generated housing and haphazard development in areas near cities and towns.  The Guidelines also aim to ensure that sites being developed for rural housing are suitable with regard to access and wastewater disposal, and also from landscape and design perspectives.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for individual planning authorities to prepare their development plans and the policies contained within such plans, taking account of local and varying geographical and landscape circumstances, as well as the approaches set out under the Guidelines in relation to rural-generated housing.  It is also a matter for planning authorities, as well as An Bord Plean&aacute;la, to implement the Guidelines and local planning policies in assessing and deciding on individual planning applications and appeals under the development management consent process.</p>  <p>  I intend to keep the 2005 Guidelines under review, particularly in view of the commitment in the Government&rsquo;s Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness to accelerate the delivery of housing in order to address the housing supply deficit and projected housing needs over the coming years, contributing to wider objectives, including the need to support sustainable urban and rural development and communities.</p></reply>

The funding for the scheme was increased this year, as part of Budget 2017, by an additional &euro;5.7 million (14% over the previous year&rsquo;s allocation) which will benefit over 50,000 children.  For the current academic year, 2016 / 2017, a total of some &euro;44 million has been allocated to schools under the scheme.</p><p>There are currently a total of some 1,145 schools participating in the scheme, a breakdown of this information on a county basis is provided in the attached tabular statement.  Statistics are not maintained by my Department on the number of schools who do not receive support under the school meals programme.</p><p>In recent years priority for new applications for funding has been given to schools which are part of the DEIS programme.  From September 2016 additional funding is being provided to DEIS schools already participating in the scheme to provide breakfast and lunch to the majority of pupils.  Those DEIS schools not participating in the scheme were recently invited to join the scheme of which 21 have joined for this academic year and 3 more have expressed an interest in joining.  There are a total of 825 DEIS schools of which the vast majority, 770 or over 93%, are currently participating in the scheme.  The Deputy should be aware that the Department is in the process of contacting some 70 schools not currently part of DEIS and deemed to require this support from next September following the recently launched DEIS Plan 2017.  These schools are being invited to join the school meals scheme from September 2017.</p><p>Budget 2017 also provided for the extension of the scheme to breakfast clubs in non-DEIS schools from September 2017 which is the first time in many years that increased payments will be provided to schools outside of DEIS.  Priority will be provided to those schools where there is most need.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Tabular Statement: Number of Schools benefitting from School Meals by County.</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>114</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>339</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>89</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>1145</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The scheme is funded from the social insurance fund.</p>  <p>  Up to 2013, the State paid a rebate to all employers who provided statutory redundancy payments, regardless of a company&rsquo;s ability to pay.  As a result, very significant amounts were paid out in redundancy rebates to employers from the social insurance fund.  This expenditure peaked in 2011, when the total cost of redundancy rebate payments to employers was in excess of &euro;214m.  These payments were often benefitting viable and profitable companies at the cost of the social insurance fund.  To the best of my knowledge no other EU member state or OECD member state provides for redundancy rebates to businesses that continue to trade.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to estimate the cost of restoring redundancy rebates to businesses on a prospective basis however, as an indication, expenditure on redundancy payments (including payments made in the cases of insolvencies) from the social insurance fund has fallen from &euro;312m in 2011 to &euro;31m in 2016, in part because of the abolition of the rebate and in part because of the improvement in the economy.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the contribution made by small enterprises in the creation of employment.  I note the fall in unemployment to just under 7%.  I see no justification for re-introducing rebates either from an employment perspective or in terms of the cost-effective use of the social insurance fund.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported is through on-going engagement with their lender to explore sustainable solutions.</p>  <p>  Customers availing of this support prior to 1st January 2014 have been able to retain entitlement to the scheme up to 1st January 2018.  There are currently approximately 2,000 people in receipt of MIS, for which Government has provided over &euro;4 million in 2017.</p>  <p>  It is expected that over the remaining period MIS customers will continue to exit the scheme through sustainable solutions being put in place with their lenders; securing employment; or exit strategies sponsored by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, such as the Mortgage to Rent Scheme.  A review of all current MIS cases is underway by staff of the Community Welfare Service, gathering information on property type, and lending institutions involved.  As part of this process the cases will be profiled in order to consider appropriate exit strategies for these customers.</p>  <p>  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, assists people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems, in particular those on low incomes or living on social welfare payments.  As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears.</p>  <p>  The role of MABS was expanded in 2015 with the establishment of a Dedicated Mortgage Arrears MABS service (DMA MABS) across the MABS network, to help people specifically with home mortgage arrears.  There are now 32 specialist DMA advisors working across 27 locations countrywide, assisting borrowers to assess the options available to them and, where required, negotiating with lenders on their behalf.  To date, the DMA service has helped almost 3,000 such borrowers.</p>  <p>  Additionally, MABS provides a national network of court mentors who attend each listed repossession Court hearing countrywide.  The mentors provide support to distressed borrowers who are facing the loss of their home and signpost them to the appropriate services.  To date, over 1,300 borrowers have been referred onward to MABS advisors through the court mentor service.</p>  <p>  In 2016, a further initiative was announced by Government, known as Abhaile.  This scheme further extends the free services already available to borrowers through the DMA MABS service and the court mentor service.  The new voucher based scheme, for which MABS is the gateway, provides access for people, who are insolvent and in home mortgage arrears, to access independent expert financial and/or legal advice and assistance, free of charge.  Qualification for help under the scheme is based on the borrower being (a) in mortgage arrears on their home; (b) insolvent; (c) at risk of losing their home because of their mortgage arrears; and (d) reasonably accommodated.  To date, c. 4,400 vouchers for services have been issued, in respect of over 2,800 principle private residences.</p>  <p>  I am continuing to monitor the supports and services which the Department has put in place to assist homeowners in serious mortgage arrears.</p></reply>

Since then over 19,000 Host Organisations have offered work placement opportunities to over 48,000 participants.</p><p>The findings of the recent external evaluation of JobBridge by Indecon Economic Consultants show that the scheme has been very effective in improving the employment outcomes of jobseekers.  It indicates that 79% of participants &ndash; about 38,000 people &ndash; have had some period of employment since completing their placement, with over 64% still in employment.  Jobseekers who participated in JobBridge improved their employment outcomes by 32% when compared with non-participants.  By any measure this is a significant uplift and shows that placements with a direct link to an employer deliver higher employment outcomes than other options.</p><p>Most importantly, the scheme is viewed positively by participants.  A majority of over the 10,000 respondents to a survey rated the scheme positively on 18 out of 20 aspects.  For example, 70% of participants felt that the placement provided them with a quality work experience and gave them new skills.</p><p>The complete Indecon evaluation can be found at:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>While acknowledging that success, it is clear that we can do better.  For example, jobseekers feel that the payment could be improved, and employers indicated a willingness to contribute to the cost of the scheme.  As a &lsquo;catch-all&rsquo; type of programme, there are some deadweight and displacement costs associated with it that could be tackled.</p><p>Having considered the evidence and the suggestions put forward by Indecon and the Labour Market Council, I announced my intention to replace JobBridge later this year with a new work experience programme that would be better suited to the much-improved labour market and addresses criticisms of the scheme.</p><p>I am very conscious that any new scheme would need the support, trust and confidence of employers, jobseekers and the public.  That is why I instructed my officials to consult with key stakeholders on the design principles that should underpin any new work experience programme.  These consultations are well underway and I expect my officials to report back to me on the outcome shortly.  I will announce my intentions on a new programme after I have a chance to consider the feedback from the key stakeholders.</p><p>If you require further assistance with this query please don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact my office.</p></reply>

This represented an increase of over 9% on the previous year.  We expect the number of passport applications to continue increasing throughout 2017.  The increase in demand is driven by a number of factors including a general increase in the number of Irish residents travelling abroad, a growing population, as well as a significant rise in application numbers from Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  The invocation of Article 50 in March is likely to add further to the high levels of increase in passport applications from the UK.  Last year applications from Northern Ireland increased by almost 27% compared to 2015 and applications from Great Britain increased by over 40%.  Total applications from the UK reached almost 132,000.  While this increase in demand from the UK is substantial, it still accounts for only 18% of the total number of passports issued in 2016.</p>  <p>  Significant customer service improvements that are being rolled out as part of the Passport Reform Programme will assist in managing growing demand.  In particular the new online service for adult renewals to be launched in the coming months will result in reduced turnaround times for applicants and significant efficiency gains for the Passport Service.   </p>  <p>  In the immediate term and to respond to the seasonal demand and the more general increases, a total of 230 Temporary Clerical Officers have been recruited into the Department.  Over half of these Officers are already in place and most others will join by early March.  They are assisting permanent staff with passport entitlement checking and customer care, including by responding to queries received via phone calls, emails and social media.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure the effective deployment of staff resources and to minimise the impact of the high demand on turnaround times and on customer service.  The need for additional resources will be kept under review.</p></reply>

Ireland has focused in particular on the process of settlement expansion, and the demolitions, evictions and expropriations which are part and parcel of it.  The EU has taken a number of policy actions directed at illegal settlements, for instance measures to ensure the accurate labelling of settlement goods.  I will continue to work for the elaboration of further such measures.  I have made clear my view that the international community, including the EU, needs to take stronger measures.  Ireland also supports, through financial assistance and actions on the ground, the work of Israeli and Palestinian NGOs who are working on human rights and justice issues on behalf of Palestinians.</p></reply>

The strong international consensus in favour of this position was restated only last month at the Paris Conference, and in Resolution 2334 adopted by the UN Security Council in December.  I hope that, as the new US administration continues to examine its options in the Middle East, the logic of this long standing international consensus will reassert itself.  I am keeping under continuous assessment whether recognition by Ireland of a state of Palestine at this time could help to bring closer the achievement of that solution.

This is the first such agreement between the EU and Cuba.  Its signature marks a further positive step forward in relations between Cuba and the EU, which have improved considerably in recent years.  The agreement is robust and comprehensive, consisting of three main pillars, namely Political Dialogue, Cooperation and Sector Policy Dialogue, and Trade and Trade Cooperation.  The core aim of the agreement is to open channels of dialogue and cooperation between the EU and Cuba in order to assist the modernisation of the Cuban economy and society, strengthen human rights and democracy, and work together to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.  The President&rsquo;s visit was the first by an EU Head of State to Cuba since the signing of the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement (PDCA) in December 2016. The visit was historic in that it was also the first by a serving President of Ireland to Cuba.  A Memorandum of Cooperation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Cuba was signed during the Presidential visit by David Stanton TD, Minister of State with special responsibility for Equality, Immigration and Integration.  I warmly welcome the signature of this agreement, the core aim of which is to open the channels of dialogue and cooperation between Ireland and Cuba, particularly in trade and cultural engagement.  </p>  <p>  My view is that the enhanced relationship between the EU and Cuba as supported by the EU-Cuba PDCA, along with the signature of the Memorandum of Cooperation between Ireland and Cuba last week, together provide a solid framework and welcome opportunity to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral relations with Cuba.  This strengthening of the bilateral relationship was further cemented by the historic visit of President Higgins to Cuba.  I look forward to continued positive developments in the period ahead.</p></reply>

The consultants were tasked with developing a viable, cost effective and sustainable Scheme which built upon the findings the Lee Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Plan published in January 2014.</p><p>The Scheme must provide the standard level of protection provided for such schemes in accordance with international best practice which is taken as dealing with the 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (commonly known as a 100 year flood event) for fluvial events and the 0.5% Annual Exceedance Probability (commonly known as a 200 year flood event) for a tidal event.  Significant detailed work was undertaken in arriving at the preferred option for the proposed Scheme.  The project involved the review of historical flooding data, hydrological analysis and hydraulic modelling to define flood mechanisms and the extent of the problem.  A multi criteria analysis, taking into account technical, environmental, social and economic factors, was carried out of the possible solutions resulting in a preferred solution which was brought to formal public exhibition in December 2016.</p><p>Options which were considered either in the Lower Lee CFRAM or during the Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme development included upstream storage, land use management, tidal barrage, direct defences, channel widening, modifications of the upstream dams and a flood forecasting system, among others.</p><p>The preferred option, at an estimated cost of &euro;140m, was not the lowest cost option and is the least intrusive from a visual perspective and effects the least amount of channel.  While the proposed Scheme considerably reduces the flood flow of water through the City in a peak flood event, the volume of water still to be conveyed would result in considerable damage to residential and commercial premises if direct defences as proposed are not installed.  The scheme has been designed by a multidisciplinary team, including Cork City Council, to ensure that there would be no loss of relationship with the river.  During the development of the Scheme<i><font color="#004080">,</font></i>Cork City Council drew on the services of the City Architect, the Heritage, Parks and Roads Sections in arriving at its position in relation to the finishes to be used on the Scheme.  In many areas where there are existing railings, the proposed defence is a low wall with railings and of those new walls being constructed, their heights will be consistent with other existing walls in the City thereby ensuring that there will be no dramatic change of a pedestrian&rsquo;s view of the river. </p><p>The OPW welcomes all submissions on the proposals as part of the Public Exhibition which is the final stage of a comprehensive consultative process all the way through the design of the Scheme that included a public awareness event at the inception of the project, a public information day at the stage where an emerging preferred option was identified, briefings for elected representatives and business groups in the city and consultation with a wide range of stakeholders including a large number of personal consultations by members of the Project Team with those who might be affected directly by the project.  So far, approximately 150 submissions have been received, which will all be given careful consideration by the Design team. A meeting has also been arranged with the savecorkcity group during which the group will be given every opportunity to put forward its views on the proposals. </p><p>The Scheme, if implemented, will bring huge benefits to Cork City and upstream to Inniscarra with over 2,100 properties benefitting in the design flood events with a further 1,000 properties benefitting from a reduced risk from more extreme events.  In addition, approximately &euro;20m will be invested to repair circa 4kms of historic quay walls in the City as part of the Scheme.</p><p>The OPW is committed to working closely with all relevant stakeholders in progressing the much needed flood defence scheme for Cork city.  The overriding objective for all concerned is to construct a scheme that will protect the businesses and other property owners from the 1 in 100 year fluvial flood event and the 1 in 200 year tidal flood event.  The OPW and Cork City Council are satisfied that, overall, the design of the Scheme as proposed  is sympathetic to the cultural and heritage aspects of the city and does not fundamentally alter the relationship of the river to the city and its inhabitants and visitors.</p></reply>

In 2016, the CL&Aacute;R programme funded over 650 projects under three separate measures which were administered by Local Authorities:</p><p>- Measure 1: Safety Measures for Schools and Community/Sports Facilities</p><p>- Measure 2: Playgrounds and Multi-Use Games Areas</p><p>- Measure 3: Local Access Roads.</p><p>I have secured an allocation of &euro;5 million for CL&Aacute;R for 2017. Details of the particular measures to be funded will be announced shortly and I envisage that, following on from last year&rsquo;s scheme, the measures will be administered mainly by the Local Authorities.  Proposals will be invited from Local Authorities in line with the criteria which will be set out for the funded measures. </p><p>My objective for the 2017 programme will be to maximise the impact of the funding which is available for the benefit of communities in CL&Aacute;R areas.</p></reply>

The participants, who were key stakeholders, were asked, inter alia, to suggest actions that Government or others might take now in the context of Brexit.  The dialogue provided an opportunity for me and my officials to hear directly from stakeholders in sectors served by my Department regarding the impact Brexit may have on these sectors, including in relation to arts, culture and the creative industries.  The Government&rsquo;s preparations for Brexit, which are based on consultation, analysis and prioritisation, will incorporate the input from participants at the sectorial dialogues hosted by all Government Departments. </p><p>Meanwhile my Department will continue to promote arts, culture, creativity and economic development across its work programme. Recent initiatives include the <i>Creative Ireland Programme</i>and the <i>Action Plan for Rural Development</i>.  These initiatives will take Brexit into account as they are being implemented.</p><p>Creative Ireland is a five-year all-of government initiative, from 2017 to 2022, which places creativity at the centre of public policy to mainstream creativity in the life of the nation so that individually and collectively, in our personal lives and in our institutions, we can realise our full creative potential.  The programme for year 1 outlines 10 initiatives to be completed by the end of 2017, including 'An industry-wide, long-term plan, for Ireland as a global hub for the production of Film, TV Drama, and Animation'  <i>.  </i></p><p>I recently announced the commissioning of an economic analysis of our screen-based creative industries by my Department in partnership with the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  This study has commenced and will examine the economic impact and potential of the Irish film, TV and animation sector and analyse the scale and economic contribution of the screen-based creative industries and examine its potential to expand further.  The study, when complete, will help to inform Government strategies and initiatives as we seek to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a home of creative talent.  </p><p>I am keenly aware of the potential of the creative sector to contribute to sustainable jobs growth.  My Department continues to work with other Departments, in particular with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation which has responsibility for intellectual property rights, to promote and support Ireland&rsquo;s cultural and creative sectors.</p><p>The <i>Action Plan for Rural Development </i>is the first whole-of-government strategy aimed at people living and working in rural Ireland.  It aims to unlock the potential of rural Ireland through a framework of supports at national and local level which will ensure that people who live in rural areas have increased opportunities for employment locally, and access to public services and social networks that support a high quality of life.  The Plan is spread across five pillars and the fourth pillar is Fostering Culture and Creativity in Rural Communities.  The key objectives of this Pillar are to:</p><p>- Increase access to the arts and enhance cultural facilities in rural communities.</p><p>- Further develop and enhance culture and creativity in rural Ireland through the establishment of culture teams and creativity hubs as part of the Creative Ireland Programme</p><p>- Promote the Irish language as a key resource in Gaeltacht and other rural communities.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The HSE operates a Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS), for persons entitled to treatment in another EU/EEA Member State or Switzerland under EU Regulation 883/04, as per the procedures set out in EU Regulation 987/09, and in accordance with Department of Health Guidelines.  Patients apply to the HSE TAS seeking access to public healthcare outside the State through model form E112.  The application requires the patient's Irish-based public referring hospital consultant, following clinical assessment, to certify, among other things, that the treatment is medically necessary and will meet the patient&rsquo;s needs.  The treatment must not be available within the State or not available within a time normally necessary for obtaining it. </p>  <p>  The result of the EU referendum in the UK means that the UK electorate have declared their wish to leave the EU.  It is important to be clear that until the UK formally withdraws from the Union, it remains a full member, with all of its existing rights and obligations.  I wish to assure the Deputy that there are no immediate changes in the area of health as a consequence of the UK's decision to leave the EU.  Irish patients who had planned to travel to the UK under the Treatment Abroad Scheme may continue to do so as planned. </p>  <p>  An extensive programme of engagement with all other EU Governments and the EU institutions, including the Commission&rsquo;s Brexit Negotiations Task Force, is under way.  The Taoiseach and Ministers will continue to meet and engage with their EU counterparts over coming weeks to emphasise Ireland&rsquo;s concerns and to ensure that they are fully reflected in the EU position once negotiations commence.   </p>  <p>  The programme for Government contained a commitment to extend medical card eligibility for all children in receipt of Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA).  I received permission from Government to draft the new Bill in December.  This new legislation will effectively mean that all children in respect of whom a DCA payment is made will automatically qualify for a medical card and, therefore, no longer be subject to the medical card means test at any point in the future while in receipt of DCA.  The drafting of the legislation is at an advanced stage and will be brought before the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.  The HSE has commenced the process of planning for the introduction of the scheme and my objective is that this measure be put into effect as soon as possible.</p></reply>

As a result of investment, we made some progress but there is much more to do to provide the level service that is needed.  </p>  <p>  I recently met with the CEO of the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group and of Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin (OLCHC) to discuss immediate action that can be taken to reduce waiting times for children and adolescents with scoliosis.  </p>  <p>  While the new theatre in OLCHC was commissioned in 2016, it is only now being used  for scoliosis surgery due to challenges with recruiting nurses.  The hospital has undertaken an aggressive recruitment drive to attract new theatre nurses with the necessary paediatric training.  As a result four new nurses will be in place by April.  A further 16 international nurses have been offered posts, and have commenced the registration process.  The recruitment of these nurses means that the new theatre will be used to provide the additional capacity for scoliosis procedures in OLCHC from April.  This will allow an additional day of procedures to be carried out in the medium term.  I am advised by OLCHC that an orthopaedic surgeon post in the hospital will also be filled by June.  This means that from July, the hospital expects that the theatre use will be further increased.  In addition I will receive an Action Plan for Scoliosis from the HSE by the end of February which will take on board the concerns of the advocacy groups.</p></reply>

With increasing travel and trade in food, drug resistance can spread rapidly and new resistance mechanisms are emerging, which make it difficult or impossible to treat certain infections.  If Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) continues to rise it will become increasingly difficult and expensive to control and treat infections in medical care and more difficult to maintain animal health and welfare.  </p>  <p>  The WHO Global Action Plan 2015   sets out five Strategic Objectives:</p>  <p>  (1) to improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance;</p>  <p>  (2) to strengthen knowledge through surveillance and research;</p>  <p>  (3) to reduce the incidence of infection;</p>  <p>  (4) to optimise the use of antimicrobial agents and</p>  <p>  (5) to develop the economic case for sustainable investment that takes account of the needs of all countries, and increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions.</p>  <p>  The WHO expects that countries will develop their own national action plans on antimicrobial resistance in line with the Global Plan.  European Council Conclusions - &lsquo;The next steps under a &lsquo;One Health approach to combat antimicrobial resistance' adopted at the June 2016 EPSCO (Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs) Council meeting call on Member States to have in place before mid-2017 a national action plan against Antimicrobial Resistance based on the &lsquo;One Health&rsquo;   approach and in line with the objectives of the WHO Global Action Plan. </p>  <p>        In 2011 a national Health Service Executive/Royal College of Physicians in Ireland (HSE/RCPI) Clinical Advisory Group on HCAI/AMR (Healthcare Associated Infections/antimicrobial Resistance) was established to provide expert advice to the public health system and a HCAI Clinical Programme within the HSE was put in place.</p>  <p>  The HSE established a National Taskforce on HCAI and AMR in 2015 to support and advise on providing effective system-wide response to the issue.  The Taskforce will oversee the continuing development and implementation of an Action Plan to address HCAI/AMR across the Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations with support from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) and Public Health Directorate of the HSE.  </p>  <p>  The National Healthcare Quality Reporting System (NHQRS) publishes data on antibiotic prescribing in the community as well as MRSA and Clostridium difficile(C. difficile) rates. The second annual report of the NHQRS was published in June 2016.  As the majority of human antimicrobial consumption in Ireland takes place at community level it is important to have a measure of  consumption.  Measuring rates of MRSA infection is used as a quality measure in many countries while C. difficile  rates in hospitals are recognised and used internationally as a good measure of the quality and safety of a healthcare service.  </p>  <p>  In recognition of the serious and increasing threat of AMR and the requirement for a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach to health issues, the Department of Health&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) established a high level National Interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee to address this issue.  The Committee has a clear role and mandate across the human and animal health sectors.  Committee membership consists of representatives of both Departments and of the relevant HSE and veterinary specialist agencies, including other relevant bodies with a remit across the two sectors; membership is representative of major stakeholders.  The Committee meets Ireland&rsquo;s requirements to have an Intersectoral co-ordination mechanism for addressing AMR at European level, as outlined in Council Conclusions.  The Committee meets bi-annually and its next scheduled meeting will take place on 6th April 2017.    </p>  <p>   The Committee and the Departments of Health and Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine are currently working to finalise Ireland's National Action Plan on AMR.  This work is ongoing and it is expected that the Plan will be published in 2017.  The Plan is examining strategies to optimise Ireland's response to AMR and this examination will include both timelines for implementation and resource requirements.  I am considering seeking cross-Government support for the National Action Plan.  I welcome the recognition by the Deputy of the seriousness of AMR.</p></reply>

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria:</p><p>1  the health needs of the public; </p><p>2  the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p><p>3  the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement; </p><p>4  the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p><p>5  the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;</p><p>6  the clinical need for the item or listed item; </p><p>7  the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety; </p><p>8  the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and </p><p>9  the resources available to the HSE. </p><p>I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier submitted in March 2016 on the cost effectiveness of Orkambi. This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets including those associated with hospitalisation, disease management costs, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising in patients not taking Orkambi.</p><p>The NCPE has completed its Health Technology Assessment and this is available on its website. It was submitted to the HSE in June 2016. The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug. The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis. In line with the HSE's assessment process, the HSE Drugs Committee considered the NCPE recommendation, the manufacturers submissions and commercial offer and other information. Following this consideration the Drugs Committee did not recommend reimbursement at the current price. The HSE Directorate considered the Drugs Committee&rsquo;s recommendation in December and the Directorate took the decision not to reimburse at the current price offered by the company. </p><p>The HSE has since re-entered into negotiations with Vertex, the manufacturer of Orkambi, with a view to significantly reducing the cost of Orkambi. A meeting was held in December and again in early January.

It made 48 recommendations. It is available on my Department's website at  . </p><p>The National Rare Disease Plan recommended that an Oversight Implementation Group of relevant stakeholders, including patients' groups, be established to oversee and monitor implementation of the plan's recommendations. This group was established by my Department  in 2015 and it has met on a number of occasions. </p><p>One of the principal recommendations in the Plan was the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases. This programme was to be responsible for, over time and among other functions, assisting with mapping and developing care pathways for rare diseases; facilitating timely access to centres of expertise - nationally and internationally; and developing care pathways with European Reference Centres for those ultra-rare disorders where there may not be sufficient expertise in Ireland.</p><p>In line with this recommendation, a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases was established in 2013 under the National Clinical Strategy and Programmes Division of the HSE. The programme is a joint initiative between the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. This clinical programme is the channel for assisting with the advancement of a number of other recommendations in the plan, such as those on National Centres of Expertise for rare diseases; and in this vein, the programme designed a framework for the designation of Irish Centres of Expertise in cooperation with the HSE Acute Hospitals Division in line with the recommendations stipulated in the national plan.</p><p>The Rare Diseases National Plan also recommended that  &lsquo;the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases through a National Office for Rare Diseases develop the clinical and organisational governance framework that would underpin care pathways and access to treatment for rare disease patients, particularly in the context of transition from paediatric to adult care'. As such the National Clinical Programme has developed a draft transition model of care which is currently in the public consultation stage.</p><p>The National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and my Department encouraged designated centres of expertise to participate in European Reference Networks (ERNs) for Rare Diseases in line with the national plan. ERNs are European networks connecting health care providers and centres of expertise so that international expertise on specific rare diseases may be pooled together for the benefit of patients.  Any centre applying for membership of an ERN must have strategies in place to ensure that care is patient-centred; that patients' rights and preferences are respected; and must show a research component to their work.  Hence, the recommendations in the national plan that related to empowering and protecting patients and carers, and research on rare diseases will be fulfilled in part through this process.  It is expected that ERNs will have a major structuring effect by linking thematic expert centres across the EU.</p><p>With the encouragement of the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Department of Health, five centres of expertise were designated in June 2016 during the first round of calls from the European Commission for participation in European Reference Networks.  Three of these designated centres applied for membership of ERNs and two were approved.</p><p>In 2014, the Minister for Health announced &euro;850,000 for investment into charity-led research priorities, which particularly benefits rare disease research. Five charities were to provide matching funding bringing the total investment to &euro;1.9 million.  They were to share &euro;850,000 in State funding to take part in international research into rare medical conditions.  In 2016, the next cohort of projects was funded by the State with &euro;1.686M, matched by charity funding of &euro;1.224M. The total funding of &euro;2.91M is shared between 11 charities.  Six of the 15 projects with a total value of &euro;1.1M address rare diseases.  The next round of this joint funding initiative will open in autumn 2017.  The EU commission now intends to explore the possibility to further strengthen the collaboration between Member States and the Commission in the area of research on rare diseases.</p><p>The establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) featured prominently in the recommendations of the Rare Disease plan.  The national office has now been established by the HSE. Its work is currently led by the NCPRD Clinical Lead supported by an Information Scientist, part-time Administrative Officer, part-time Genetic Counsellor and by a 0.2FTE Consultant Geneticist.  It is, among other functions, providing up-to-date information regarding new treatment and management options, including clinical trials.  In addition, the post of Information Scientist for the office is being funded jointly by the HSE and the EU Commission.  The NRDO has already performed a preliminary situation analysis of the existing rare disease registries and is in the process of assigning these known registries on our national Orphanet site, which is the international rare disease reference and information portal funded by the EU. </p><p>A number of recommendations about access to appropriate drugs and technologies were contained in the plan. One chief recommendation in this regard refers to the HSE developing a Working Group to bring forward appropriate decision criteria for the reimbursement of orphan medicines and technologies; and that the approach should include an assessment system similar to that for cancer therapies established under the National Cancer Control Programme. The HSE Acute Hospitals Division is developing the terms of reference, required membership and reporting relationship for this committee. The Committee will also be supported by the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases Clinical Advisory Group.</p><p>The national plan for rare diseases recommended that the Health Identifiers Bill and the Health and Patient Safety Bill be published. The former was published in 2013 and enacted in 2014.  The Individual Health Identifier part of the project is now being implemented by the HSE.  A revised and much expanded General Scheme of a Health Information and Patient Safety Bill was approved by the government in November 2015 and published on the Department's website.  It is currently with the Attorney-General's Office for formal drafting and with the Oireachtas Committee on Health for Pre-Legislative Scrutiny.</p><p>Two recommendations referred to training in rare diseases for healthcare professionals.  The Department of Health has contacted formally the various healthcare representative and professional bodies about implementing these recommendations.</p><p>Finally, rare diseases have already been tabled on the agenda for North-South meetings.  Therefore, future work to deepen cooperation between both jurisdictions on rare diseases is anticipated.</p></reply>

Since Healthy Ireland was launched in March 2013, my Department has launched the following health and well-being initiatives:</p><p>The National Sexual Health Strategy 2015 - 2020;</p><p>Tobacco Free Ireland - Report of the Tobacco Policy Review Group;</p><p>The National Positive Ageing Strategy;</p><p>Get Ireland Active - National Physical Activity Plan for Ireland;</p><p>A Healthy Weight for Ireland - Obesity Policy and Action Plan;</p><p>The National Healthy Cities and Counties of Ireland Network; and</p><p>Healthy Food for Life - The Healthy Eating Guidelines and Food Pyramid.</p><p>It is not possible to identify in totality how much funding is currently spent on improving health and well-being across all Government Departments and agencies and in wider society. </p><p>Since the launch of Healthy Ireland, expenditure on its implementation from within the budget of the Department of Health has amounted to the following:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Amount &euro;</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;89,315.07</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;586,470.90</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;607,706.83.02</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>&euro;1,156,405.67</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>&euro;69,959.03.</td></tr></table></p><p>In addition to the expenditure noted above, other expenditure arising within the Department could also be described as &quot;Healthy Ireland&quot; depending on classification. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, operational responsibility for the delivery of specific initiatives promoting health and well-being by the health services is a matter for the HSE. Expenditure arising in the HSE, particularly in the Health and Well-being Division, could also be described as implementation of Healthy Ireland. However, it is not possible to disaggregate expenditure on promoting and improving health and well-being generally from overall HSE expenditure. Again, for example, within overall HSE expenditure, and in addition to work which is an integral part of the Health and Well-being Division, a large component of health promotion and improvement work takes place across the acute and primary care services as part of normal day to day activity. There is also expenditure arising in relation to communications campaigns by the HSE.</p></reply>

It is also important to note that treatment which requires an overnight stay must be approved in advance. This facilitates the provision of the patient of an estimate of the costs which will be reimbursed and allows a period of reflection regarding the decision to access treatment abroad. </p>  <p>  All hospitals have been provided by the HSE with text on the Directive to be included in waiting list correspondence. This text advises patients of the provisions of the Directive, and their entitlement to access healthcare under it in another EU/EEA country if they so choose.  Information sessions with hospitals on the Directive continue to be offered, and promoted, by the acute hospital division of the HSE.</p></reply>

As well as supporting other paediatricians, the Consultant also provides clinical support and advice to maternity hospitals and neonatologists.  The Programme also included the appointment of eight Children&rsquo;s Outreach Nurses  whose role is to ensure that children being cared for at home by their families have access to co-ordinated and supportive services.  The nurses liaise closely with statutory and voluntary service providers including local GPs, Public Health Nurses, Disability Services, the Jack and Jill Foundation and LauraLynn.  A further two Children's Outreach Nurses are being recruited under the Programme, one in Letterkenny and the other to the Children's Hospital Group. </p>  <p>  The Letterkenny post, which will be offered to the successful candidate this week, will be entitled Clinical Nurse Co-ordinator for Children with Life-limiting Conditions.  This nurse will work closely with the existing Paediatric Liaison Nurse based in Donegal and will provide a service to children and families in Donegal as well as acting as an informed resource for colleagues in Sligo.</p>  <p>  A review of the Children's Palliative Care Programme, published in late 2016, confirmed that the Programme is adding significant value to service provision for children with life-limiting conditions and their families.  The review makes twenty recommendations, one of which is the need to provide adequate and needs-based respite services.  The HSE is currently considering how both in-home and in-patient respite services might be made more available for children in Donegal and surrounding areas.  All possibilities will be considered, including through cross-border co-operation or collaboration with relevant voluntary groups.</p></reply>

The majority of these reports relate to children/adolescents (latest numbers).</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills continue to work together to provide a wide range of services and supports for those affected by narcolepsy following the administration of pandemic influenza vaccine.</p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s Advocacy Unit acts as liaison with service and support providers and other Government Departments to facilitate access to required services.  It is in regular contact with individuals affected and regularly meets with representatives of the SOUND (sufferers of unique narcolepsy disorder).  Regional co-ordinators have been appointed to assist individuals by providing advice, information and access to local services.</p><p>The ex-gratia health supports include clinical care pathways to ensure access to diagnosis and treatment, multi-disciplinary assessments led by clinical experts, counselling services for both the individuals and their families, discretionary medical cards for those who have been diagnosed have been provided to allow unlimited access to GP care and any prescribed medication, ex-gratia reimbursement of vouched expenses incurred in the process of diagnosis and treatment, including travel expenses for attending medical appointments; physiotherapy, occupational therapy assessments, dental  assessments and dietary services all on a needs basis. </p><p>The cost of these supports provided by the HSE is a service matter and I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy.</p><p>As of 6 February 2017, 53 individuals have begun the process of taking legal proceedings against the Minister, the Health Services Executive and GlaxoSmithKline Biological SA. Of these, 34 have initiated formal legal proceedings.  The plaintiffs allege personal injury in which they claim the development of narcolepsy (cataplexy) resulted from the administration of the H1N1 pandemic vaccine.  On 15 October 2013 the management of the cases transferred to the State Claims Agency when the National Treasury Management Agency (Delegation of Claims Management Functions) (Amendment) Order 2013 came into effect.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment further on matters relating to liability which may impact on this ongoing litigation. In spite of this litigation, my Department, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills will continue to work together to provide the services and supports on an <i>ex gratia</i>basis.  </p><p>As Deputies are aware, work is underway on the proposed Centre of Excellence for Narcolepsy based in St James's Hospital which will cater for all people diagnosed with narcolepsy, including those diagnosed with narcolepsy after receiving pandemic influenza vaccine.  It is not possible to give an exact date for the opening of the centre at this time and I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy with an update on the current position.</p><p>I am aware that representatives from SOUND have requested a meeting and arrangements are being made for officials from my Department and the HSE to meet with representatives from SOUND in the near future.</p></reply>

One of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some sectors, which have caused cash flow difficulties for farmers.  The Scheme, which was developed in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), makes &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at interest rates of 2.95%.  Distributed through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, the Scheme provides farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.</p>  <p>  My Department is contributing &euro;25 million in total.  This includes &euro;11.1 million from the EU&rsquo;s &lsquo;exceptional adjustment aid for milk and other livestock farmers&rsquo; and &euro;14 million in national funding. SBCI uses the &euro;25 million to leverage the fund, i.e. the other &euro;125 million is being provided by the &lsquo;finance providers&rsquo; (i.e. the banks).  SBCI are not providing funding, but along with European Investment Fund&rsquo;s COSME (the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs) is providing the guarantee required to underpin the loan&rsquo;s flexibility and lower the cost of the loans. </p>  <p>  The loans are available to all those involved in primary agricultural production, i.e. livestock farmers, tillage farmers, horticulture producers (including mushroom growers) and others (including poultry producers).  To satisfy the requirements of the EU aid package, applicants also need to satisfy at least one of the following eligibility criteria:</p>  <p>  - Application of environmental and climate friendly production methods</p>  <p>  - Implementation of quality schemes or projects aiming at promoting quality and value added</p>  <p>  - Implementation of cooperation projects</p>  <p>  - Training in financial instruments and risk management tools.</p>  <p>  Contracting services of any kind are not included. </p></reply>

However, I can provide you with our working figures for the purposes of preparing our analyses of the potential implications of Brexit for the Irish fishing industry.</p>  <p>  Our figures show that the total EU Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (200  miles) is 7,044,000 square kilometres.  The Irish EEZ is 438,000 square kilometres, this amounts to 6.22% of the EU EEZ.  The UK EEZ is 747,000 square kilometres, which is 10.6% of the EU EEZ.  Once the UK leaves the EU, the total EU EEZ will be reduced to 6,297,000 square kilometres.  The Irish share will then be 6.96% of the total EU EEZ.</p></reply>

The loans are for amounts up to &euro;150,000 for up to six years and are flexible with interest only facilities of up to three years.</p>  <p>  As an additional support to cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, I also informed the stakeholders at the Forum that to date &euro;1.177 billion has been paid out to 123,454 farmers and payments are ongoing.  Payments of &euro;199.6 million have also been made to 93,341 applicants under the Areas of Natural Constraints scheme. </p>  <p>  I can confirm to the Deputy that a wide ranging discussion took place among all the stakeholders who attended the Forum, including on the issue of compensation for crop losses as a result of the poor harvest conditions of last autumn.  As I stated at the Forum, I will look at this issue further and revert in due course.</p></reply>

A derogation applies where sheep introduced during the standstill period are completely isolated from all other animals on the holding.  To avail of this derogation, isolation must be notified to and pre-approved by my Department. Sheep being exported for slaughter must be resident on the holding of origin for 21 days but a standstill period is not required if the animals are consigned directly to a slaughterhouse in another Member State.  A 21 days standstill period is required in the event that sheep for slaughter are exported from an approved assembly centre or dealer's premises and/or stop at a staging point in another Member State (transit or destination). </p>  <p>  The rules on intra-Community trade in sheep, in particular, the "standstill" requirement, stem from the foot-and-mouth outbreak in 2001, the general view being that movements of sheep largely contributed to the spread of the disease.  The rationale for these requirements is to ensure that sheep going for export do not come in contact with other animals or become infected following such contact. </p>  <p>  Sheep exports rose to nearly 47,000 head last year, up from 32,000 in 2015.</p></reply>

The objective of the pilot is to validate, in an Irish context, the international evidence that suggests making homes warmer and more energy efficient can have a positive effect on the health and well-being of people in energy poverty who are also living with a chronic respiratory condition.  As it is a pilot scheme, eligibility is necessarily limited. In 2016 the operational area for the scheme was selected as Community Health Area (CHO) 7, following consultation with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive (HSE). This CHO encompasses Kildare/West Wicklow, Dublin West, Dublin South City and Dublin South West.  Within CHO 7 the need to build capacity in the local public health and SEAI teams, and establish communications with the local community, meant that a further localisation was necessary and Dublin 12 and 24 were selected as the initial operational areas. </p><p>With the increase in capital for the pilot to &euro;8m for 2017, the steering committee for the scheme, made up of representatives from my Department, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), the Department of Health and the HSE, determined that the area covered by the scheme could be expanded to cover Dublin 8, 10 and 22 and that eligibility could be expanded to cover families with young children. By including families with young children it is hoped that the scheme can also show a positive impact on school attendance and social inclusion. </p><p>To date, 352 successful applications have been processed by the HSE team and referred to SEAI for surveying and works. Of these, the number from each area is listed below:<table><tr><th>Postal Area</th><th>Number</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin 8</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin 10</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin 12</td><td>144</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin 22</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin 24</td><td>182</td></tr></table></p><p>The lower numbers in Dublin 8, 10 and 22 are due to the fact that the pilot has only recently been extended to these areas.  I would be very keen that public representatives continue to help to raise awareness of the pilot in their communities. Nevertheless, this represents a strong pipeline of works and I am confident that the scheme will achieve its objectives for 2017.</p><p>The scheme is intended to run for at least a further two full years (2017-2018). In parallel with the scheme&rsquo;s delivery, an independent research project is in the process of being commissioned by my Department, which will assess the impact of the scheme.  At the conclusion of the scheme, and with independent evidence on its effectiveness, the potential for a wider roll-out will be considered.</p><p>In addition to the Warmth and Wellbeing pilot, the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme is available on a nationwide basis to low income households who are at risk of energy poverty.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State Intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband roll-out so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.

Any customer, including those in Clonbullogue in County Offaly, who experiences service difficulties should raise the matter with the service provider in the first instance. If this fails to resolve matters, customers can and should refer a complaint to the independent regulator of the telecommunications sector, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), which will investigate the service provider's compliance with its contractual obligations.</p>  <p>  The provision of telecommunications services, including mobile phone services, is a matter for the service providers concerned who operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by ComReg. I do not have a statutory authority to require commercial companies to roll-out services to particular locations. However, mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage. However as mobile services are a radio based technology, services can be affected by topography, quality of handsets and the capacity of the network, as well as by and proximity to mobile telephone antennas. The rate of demand for data services has increased by 500% in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for mobile operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.</p>  <p>  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force. In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. The report of the Task Force was published in December and is available on both Departments' websites.</p>  <p>  In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.</p>  <p>  The work of the Task Force will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band. This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.</p>  <p>  In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band. ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage. The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.  </p>  <p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  In parallel, the National Broadband Plan aims to deliver high-speed services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland, through private investment and a State intervention in areas where commercial investment plans have not been fully demonstrated.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State Intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p><p>Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint. </p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the extent of the State Intervention area:  </p><p>The areas marked BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services. </p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>Individuals can check whether their premises are in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode. </p><p>Ballylongford in the townland of Aghanagran Middle Co Kerry falls within an AMBER area and will there be included In the State Intervention procurement process under the NBP.</p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.

Funding of &euro;23.2 million was allocated to this Programme alone in 2016. The NTA also manages a similar sustainable transport grants programme &ndash; the Regional Cities Programme &ndash; in the four regional cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. Overall funding for these two programmes in 2016 was &euro;36.7.</p><p>In 2017, we will be investing 355m in public transport and sustainable transport infrastructure.  Of this figure over 10% (more than &euro;37m) will be allocated to Smarter Travel and Sustainable Transport measures. I am sure the Deputy was pleased to see, as I was, the significant increase in the numbers cycling and walking into Dublin City Centre in the Canal Cordon Report published last week. We are now seeing more than two thirds of people using sustainable transport modes (public transport, cycling and walking) to enter Dublin in the morning peak. It is important that we continue to build on that progress in the coming years.</p><p>The Government is embarking on a Mid-Term Review of the Capital Plan, which will take stock of progress under the Plan to date and provide the Government with an opportunity to consider the scope for increased levels of investment.  In addition, with the scheduled completion of the Luas Cross-City Project later this year, which was one of the more capital intensive projects under my Department's remit in recent yeas, I hope that more funds may become available to support cycle routes. I will certainly be making the case for increased investment in public transport and cycling and walking infrastructure in discussions on the review of the Capital Plan.</p><p>The Deputy will also be interested to know that my Department is presently establishing a fund to support low carbon technologies in public transport vehicles including a Green Bus Fund.  These various initiatives demonstrate my Department's commitment to continued investment in infrastructure to support walking and cycling and in the development of clean transport technology.</p></reply>

The targets contained in the NCPF were ambitious and were predicated on substantial investment under the Transport 21 investment plan at the time, which given the economic crisis which ensued could not be delivered on.</p>  <p>  Implementation of the various actions falls to a wide range of public bodies including local authorities, transport agencies, my Department and other Government Departments.  The National Cycling Policy Framework has been integrated into the Development Plans of the majority of local authorities so as to ensure that the objectives and policies to support and promote cycling are taken account of in current and future planning.</p>  <p>  In 2013 and 2015 the Department asked local authorities and other stakeholders for an update on progress on implementation of the NCPF. The Department now intends to undertake a full review of the framework and we will be pursuing this over the coming year.</p>  <p>  Despite the reduced level of funding available since the publication of the framework, compared to that envisaged under the Transport 21 investment plan, good progress has been made to date.  To mention a few, the Dublin and Regional Public Bikes Scheme have been successfully delivered and are operating successfully.  Also, the roll out of the new National Cycle Training Standard for Ireland "Cycle Right" which was developed by Cycling Ireland with funding from my Department commenced in January of this year.  The Deputy will also be aware of the very heartening figures published recently in the 'Canal Cordon Report 2016' which shows significant increases in the numbers cycling and walking into Dublin City Centre in the morning peak.</p></reply>

My Department is working closely with the new Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment (DCCAE) and the Department of Agriculture to prepare this National Mitigation Plan.</p>  <p>  Specific focus is being placed on the four sectorial areas of electricity generation, the built environment, agriculture and transport.  The responsibility for emissions reduction is, of course, a collective one and Ireland's EU emission reduction targets are national and not sectorial in nature. When all sectorial inputs have been co-ordinated, the draft mitigation plan will be available for extensive public consultation before being submitted for approval to Government.  It is expected that the draft plan will be available for public consultation in March.  Transport will of course have to play a significant role on the national mitigation effort.  The measures under consideration for transport will be wide-ranging and will focus on modal shift, movement to alternative fuels, and targeted behavioural change. To date, considerable progress has been achieved through measures aimed at promoting improved technologies and changing behaviour.</p>  <p>  My Department has also recently developed a National Policy Framework on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport, which will be published in the coming weeks, following our recent public consultation on the draft Framework.  Furthermore, my Department is working closely with the DCCAE on an interdepartmental Low Emissions Vehicle (LEV) Task Force which is charged with presenting a range of measures and options to the Government that will assist in accelerating the deployment of LEVs in Ireland.</p></reply>

There is however regular and ongoing engagement and contact at all levels involving my Department in order to plan for and mitigate the risks associated with Brexit and to identify opportunities arising.</p>  <p>  The aviation sector is critical to Ireland and I am very concerned about the potential impacts of Brexit on Irish aviation and the implications for tourism and for the wider economy. As previously stated, these concerns have been conveyed to the European Commission's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier and his team. Through the Department of the Taoiseach, I expect to be able to make the specific transport case to the Barnier team shortly. Staff from my Department in the Permanent Representation in Brussels and all Departmental staff attending meetings in Brussels are naturally at the forefront of this ongoing engagement and assessment, and report back regularly to the Department's Brexit co-ordinators. Departmental staff are actively engaging with stakeholders across the various modes of transport.</p>  <p>  The Secretary General of my Department and members of the Department's Management Board also had an extensive four hour meeting with their UK Department for Transport counterparts on January 19th 2017 in London on the transport implications for both States of Brexit, including the implications for and the challenges facing the aviation sector as a result of the UK exit.</p>  <p>  Once the UK has triggered Article 50 and negotiations commence, I will be seeking to ensure that aviation features among the top priorities for Ireland throughout these negotiations. In order to achieve the best possible outcome for Ireland and the single aviation market as a whole, my department will prioritise Brexit in the coming months by influencing and seeking strategic alliances among other EU member states for the purposes of the negotiations.</p></reply>

Arising out of the conclusion of the Taskforce&rsquo;s work, an atypical work permission scheme was introduced for non-EEA fishermen working on Irish fishing vessels. The scheme is administered by the Department of Justice and Equality and the Irish National Immigration Service (INIS) on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  A number of agencies and organisations are involved in the monitoring and enforcement of the scheme and have signed up to a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in order to provide a rigorous and effective inspection system. They include An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, INIS, the Marine Survey Office of the Department of Tourism, Transport and Sport, the Naval Service, the Health and Safety Authority, the Revenue Commissioners, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  The WRC&rsquo;s responsibilities relate to the enforcement of the Employment Permits Acts and employment rights legislation including minimum wage legislation. The Marine Survey Office in the Department of Tourism, Transport and Sport is responsible for enforcing legislation relating to the rest periods and maximum working time of seafarers and fishing vessel crews.</p>  <p>  By the end of 2016, the Inspectorate and Enforcement Division of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) had inspected two-thirds of the fleet that comes within the aegis of the Atypical Worker Permission Scheme and the remainder will be inspected by Summer of this year. Case files relating to all vessels will remain open until such time as WRC inspectors are satisfied that compliance has been achieved.</p>  <p>  - 157 contraventions were detected in 2016 including</p>  <p>  - 28 instances of illegal workers </p>  <p>  - 58 records contraventions </p>  <p>  - 12 contraventions of the Atypical Scheme </p>  <p>  - 59 other employment rights contraventions</p>  <p>  2 prosecutions have to date been initiated. The WRC's objective is to facilitate voluntary compliance insofar as contraventions notified are concerned. In this regard, Employers/Vessel Owners are afforded all reasonable opportunity to rectify contraventions and, where relevant, pay any unpaid wages and/or make good on entitlements arising from these contraventions.  However, it is the policy of the WRC to issue Compliance Notices or Fixed Payment Notices and/or to initiate legal proceedings in cases where an Employer/Vessel Owner has failed or is unwilling to effect compliance. </p>  <p>  The WRC informs me that it is committed to engaging with all stakeholders, including employee/fisher and employer/vessel owner representatives, with a view to facilitating awareness, and effective enforcement, of employment rights legislation.</p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority (HSA), as part of its broader national remit also undertakes inspections of fishing vessels as these are defined as workplaces under health and safety legislation. In 2016 the HSA carried out 23 inspections of fishing vessels under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. Planned actions in the HSA's Programme of Work for 2017 include 50 inspections of fishing vessels and continued support for the memorandum of understanding agreed by relevant state enforcement bodies to provide an effective inspection system for the sector.</p></reply>

A contract of employment will generally contain a retirement age but this is a matter of contract between the parties. </p><p>The upper age limit for bringing claims under the Unfair Dismissals Acts was removed by a provision in the Equality Act 2004. It is now the case that a person of any age, when dismissed, may take a case under the Unfair Dismissals Acts unless she or he has reached the &ldquo;normal retiring age for employees of the same employer in similar employment&rdquo;, if one exists. In such circumstances, the burden of proof is on the employer to prove the normal retiring age. Furthermore, the upper age limit of 66 years for receipt of statutory redundancy payments was removed by the Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Act 2007. </p><p>As the issue that arises around compulsory retirement at a given age is whether this entails discrimination on age grounds, the more usual avenue of redress for employees compulsorily retired is to take a claim, under the Employment Equality Acts, to the Workplace Relations Commission. Responsibility for employment equality legislation rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that an Inter-departmental Group (IDG), chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER), was established by the Government in 2016 to consider policy around retirement age in both the public and private sectors. </p><p>The Report recorded that the recently enacted Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2015 amends Irish equality legislation to bring it into line with the judgments of the CJEU interpreting the relevant provisions in EU Directives, as follows:</p><p>Section 34 of the Act of 1998 is amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (4):</p><p>&quot;(4) Without prejudice to subsection (3), it shall not constitute discrimination on the age ground to fix different ages for the retirement (whether voluntarily or compulsorily) of employees or any class or description of employees if&mdash;</p><p>(a) it is objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim, and</p><p>(b) the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.&quot;.</p><p>The amended legislation sets out the grounds on which employers will have to justify the setting of particular retirement ages, such grounds being underpinned by the provisions of the Employment Equality Directive.</p><p>The Report points to examples of objective justification including: </p><p>- To create opportunities in the labour market for those looking for work </p><p>- To encourage recruitment and promotion of young people and prevent possible disputes on the fitness of employees to work beyond a certain age</p><p>- To ensure better distribution of work between the generations</p><p>- To ensure quality of service provision and address an age imbalance within a workforce</p><p>- To ensure motivation and dynamism through the increased prospect of promotion due to senior staff being retired.</p><p>The IDG made a number of recommendations, one of which related to my specific area of responsibility. On foot of that recommendation I wrote to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to request them to prepare a Code of Practice under Section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 around the issue of working longer, which should set out best industrial relations practice in managing the engagement between employers and employees in the run up to retirement, including requests to work beyond what would be considered the normal retirement age in the employment concerned.

In some Countries the basic national minimum wage is not fixed at a monthly rate but at an hourly or weekly rate and Eurostat for comparison purposes converts Countries hourly or weekly rates into monthly rates.   These figures are also affected by currency fluctuation that exists for Countries listed that are outside the Eurozone, such as the UK, and the fact that some Countries have lower national levels of hours worked per week. Thus these Eurostat figures provide a comparison between European Countries of the monthly national minimum wage in Euros at a point in time using the Countries standard national level of hours worked per week. It should be noted that monthly national minimum wage rates are gross amounts. Income tax and social security contribution deductions vary greatly from Country to Country. </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that disparities in minimum wages across the EU States are considerably smaller once price level differences are eliminated: minimum wages in those Member States with relatively low price levels become relatively higher when expressed in purchasing power standard, and relatively lower in those Member States with higher price levels. Ireland  minimum wage rank&rsquo;s sixth highest in the EU when adjusted by the purchasing power standard.  </p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Low Pay Commission was established in 2015 through the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Act 2015.  The Commission&rsquo;s main function is to, on an annual basis, examine and make recommendations on the national minimum wage, with a view to securing that the national minimum wage, where adjusted, is adjusted incrementally over time having had regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels. The Commission made its first recommendation in July 2015 when it recommended that the rate be increased by 50 cents per hour. That increase came into effect on 1st January 2016. The Commission&rsquo;s second recommendation that the rate increase to &euro;9.25 per hour was made in July 2016. It was subsequently accepted by Government and came into effect on 1st January last.</p></reply>

However, we are working intensively to make sure we have an initial system that works for parents from that date.  This may involve, for example, having an automated version of the universal element, with quick turnaround times for parents, while leaving somewhat longer turnaround times to complete the means assessment for applications for the targeted element of the system.  DCYA will then continue work, with Pobal, on building a fully automated system.</p>  <p>  Full information on the Scheme will be made available to parents and childcare providers well in advance of September, and change management supports will be provided to childcare services.</p></reply>

As you are aware the Scheme has two elements, universal and targeted.  This means that the Scheme is available to all families with children under 3 years of age.</p>  <p>  It is an imperative of the targeted element of the scheme that those on the lowest incomes receive the greatest subsidies.  The most transparent, and fairest, way in which to achieve this is to base this element of the scheme on the net income on families.  It is fairer and more accessible than the current targeted subsidy programmes, under which many low-income families are not currently able to access subsidised childcare because of the requirement to be in receipt of certain State benefits or attending certain training programmes.  If it was based on disposable income, this allowance would generally benefit higher-income earners more, which would run counter to the intention of the Scheme to target supports primarily at those with the lowest incomes.  This approach to assessing means is very much in line with most means-assessment Government schemes currently in operation.</p>  <p>  While all targeted schemes, by their nature, have thresholds and cut-off points, the new Affordable Childcare Scheme is designed to be flexible, with the ability to adjust income thresholds, subsidy rates and income taper rates, over time and as further Government investment becomes available.</p></reply>

The Committee issued its report in November 2015 and included reference to the issue of refusal to disclose birth certificate information where Tusla, the Child and Family Agency considers that there are compelling reasons, such as may endanger the life of a person, for so doing.</p>  <p>  My Department considered the report of the Committee and a revised policy was developed to reflect concerns raised.  The Bill provides that where a birth mother has registered her details on the Register, Tusla will notify her, in writing, of the adopted person&rsquo;s application for his/her birth certificate information.  She will be offered support and guidance by the Agency and advised that the adopted person has also been also been offered support and guidance.  The birth mother will be advised that the information will be provided to the adopted person unless she advises Tusla within 12 weeks that she considers that there are compelling reasons not to release this information.  Where the Agency having considered any information, either provided by a birth parent or otherwise available to it, considers that there are compelling reasons for not disclosing information, it will refer the matter to the Circuit Court for determination.  Any court hearing will be held in private.  Compelling reasons are reasons that, having regard to all the circumstances, are likely to endanger the life of a person.  This process only applies to the provision of birth certificate information to an adopted person, as such information which identifies the birth mother is being provided to an adopted person without the birth mothers consent.  Any information about an adopted person will be only provided to a birth parent, where the adopted person consents.</p></reply>

It provides clarity around the information that can be provided and the circumstances in which it can be provided to those affected by adoption.

As a result of this process in January 2005 the Department of Health and Children published "Adoption Legislation: 2003 Consultation and Proposals For Change".  The Report has served to inform the legislative developments that have taken place since then in particular the Adoption Act 2010 and the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016.</p>  <p>  The Adoption Authority of Ireland has operational responsibility for adoption in Ireland.  In this regard I am advised by the Authority that it is proactive in its consultation with stakeholders.  The Authority continues to meet with  various stakeholder groups on a regular basis.  These include Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, the Departments of Health and Children and Youth Affairs, and the various Bodies accredited to provide adoption services and various country-specific adoption support groups (e.g. Viet South and the Irish Chinese Contact Group).</p>  <p>  I am also advised that during 2016, the CEO and/or members of the Authority's Senior Management Team met with the Adoption Rights Alliance, Irish Foster Care Association, Childrens' Rights Alliance and Treoir.  The Authority also resumed meetings 'on circuit' which allowed it to meet locally based groups, e.g. 'Know My Own' (Cork), the Sligo Family Resource Centre and Danu.  The Authority intends to meet with local adoption groups in Galway and Waterford later this year.  Furthermore the Authority has held a variety of information seminars involving all stakeholders.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to establish the stakeholder adoption advisory groups but I have asked the Adoption Authority to keep me advised of any issues which arise in their consultation.</p></reply>

For this reason, it has not been considered necessary to publish regulatory impact assessments on legislative proposals on the Department&rsquo;s website.  Notwithstanding this, the Department applies the principles set out in the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) Guidelines issued by the Department of the Taoiseach where appropriate.</p></reply>
