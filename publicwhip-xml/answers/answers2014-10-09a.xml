We monitor their drawdown of funds from the Exchequer against the published expenditure profiles with information published monthly as part of the Exchequer Statement.</p><p>  In recent years, there have been a number of cases in which Government Departments have required supplementary estimates. Much of the expenditure overruns, that resulted in these supplementary estimates, were due to the exposure of certain areas to the economic cycle and expenditure pressures arising across a number of Government Departments due to increased demands for services.  For example, in periods where the numbers on the Live Register were increasing, this had the effect of both increasing expenditure on Jobseeker's payments, while also increasing the numbers of citizens eligible for a Medical Card.</p><p>  In the coming year, as the Government looks to bring the deficit below 3 per cent of GDP in 2015, there is an ongoing requirement to ensure that Departmental expenditure is managed to meet this key fiscal policy objective. As such, the prioritisation of resources and effective management of expenditure within allocations will continue to be a key responsibility of all Ministers and their Departments. </p></reply>

As the Consent Authority for flood alleviation schemes under Section 7 of the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 &ndash; 1995, the Regulations require the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to:-<br/><br/>(A) carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment of drainage or flood relief schemes prior to Confirmation or approval of the proposed schemes<br/><br/>(B) Publicise his decision to Confirm or refuse to Confirm a proposed drainage scheme, inform the Commissioners and the public of the decision and to provide for a process for appeal/review of the decision and inform the public of this process<br/><br/>The Clare River (Claregalway) Drainage Scheme was submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) for Ministerial Confirmation on 2nd November 2013.  In accordance with normal procedure, the scheme documentation submitted to DPER included an Environmental Impact Statement which is a consultants report of the environmental impacts of the works and the OPW's proposals to mitigate these impacts as far as possible.<br/><br/>The Claregalway scheme is the first flood relief scheme submitted for Confirmation following the coming into effect of the 2012 Regulations and DPER needed to fully consider the implications for the Confirmation process of the new Regulations. <br/><br/>Consultations took place with the Attorney General's Office in order to get clarification on how the new Regulations should be interpreted and implemented in the context of the Confirmation process for drainage schemes under the Arterial Drainage Acts.<br/><br/>Based on advice received from the Attorney General's Office, DPER is in the process of engaging experts to carry out an independent review as part of the assessment of the Environmental Impact Statement of the Claregalway scheme that was submitted by the OPW.<b></b>The tender process is nearing completion and DPER expects to be in a position to place a contract shortly.  <br/><br/>Pending the outcome of the expert's review and the conclusion of the required public notification process, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is not in a position to confirm the Claregalway scheme. It is not possible therefore at this point to say when the scheme can proceed to Construction.<br/><br/>However, I am confident that the proposed works will be found to be environmentally acceptable and therefore that the scheme can be confirmed by the Minister and proceed without too much further delay. I would like to assure the House that I and the OPW remain committed to ensuring that the scheme will be completed as soon as possible. The OPW has provided for the cost of the works in its profiles of capital expenditure to 2016.</p></reply>

The circular provides that the persons selected to act as Private Secretary should be drawn from the grades of Executive Officer, Higher Executive Officer or Administrative Officer in the Civil Service. </p><p>  It is my understanding that most, if not all, officials appointed as Private Secretary to a Minister are appointed by way of a lateral transfer of a serving civil servant within the Minister's Department. </p></reply>

This commitment for enhanced powers for the Comptroller and Auditor General is being progressed as part of the wider public service reform agenda.  </p><p>  Any consideration of the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General must take account of initiatives for the management and reporting of public expenditure. This includes, for example, as part of the annual estimates process, the introduction and development of performance budgeting;  developments at EU level regarding the introduction of common standards for the accounts of public bodies; and, as part of a joint initiative with the Department of Finance, in which the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is participating, consideration of enhanced fiscal transparency measures. Other related and significant developments include civil service accountability and performance.</p><p>  The strengthening of accountability systems requires a clear sighted examination of the forms and structures of accountability that best support the broader agenda of public service reform and its core objective of high quality and more efficient provision of public services. This wider accountability framework includes the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General in terms of both financial auditing and value for money reports.</p><p>  The Programme for Government commitments and associated reform proposals, including those relating to the Comptroller and Auditor General,  focus on enhancing  performance and accountability arrangements so that the public service can be empowered to be more effective and to demonstrate that well informed choices are being made as to how public money is spent.</p></reply>

Under the provisions of this Act, if an employee is employed on two or more successive fixed term contracts in continuous employment for a period of four years then extending that contract for a further fixed term is unlawful (unless the employer can justify the award of a further fixed term contract on objective grounds), and the employee is entitled to a contract of indefinite duration.<br/><br/>It is a matter for Human Resource Units in all Departments/Agencies etc. to have procedures in place for dealing with the recruitment and employment of fixed-term employees and the management of their contracts.  My Department issues Guidelines on &quot;Best Practice for the Recruitment and Management of Fixed-term Employees in the Irish Civil Service&quot;. These are revised from time to time as required. The most recent version issued in April 2014 and took account of changes arising as result of the Single Pension Scheme and the Haddington Road Agreement. The Guidelines can be found on my Department's HR Management website at <br/><br/>The position in relation to my own Department and those Offices under its aegis is as follows:<br/><br/><b>Department of Public Expenditure and Reform</b><br/><br/>My Department was established in July 2011 and in the period since then there has only been one request for a contract of indefinite duration. This was refused on the grounds that the person concerned did not qualify for such a contract. <br/><br/><b>Office of Public Works</b><br/><br/>The Office of Public Works received requests for contracts of indefinite duration from three of its State Industrial Employees and all three were granted CIDs<br/><br/><b>Valuation Office</b><br/><br/>The Valuation Office issued two contracts of indefinite duration to cleaning staff since 2007.  <b></b></p></reply>

While this estimate for labour intensity is used as a general rule of thumb, it is important to note that the amount of employment generated by capital expenditure depends on how that expenditure is invested. For example, the purchase of new rail rolling stock would typically generate little direct employment in Ireland as such stock is generally produced abroad. Furthermore, different types of public construction project have different levels of labour intensity. Smaller scale projects such as school building and repair, or smaller local and regional road-works, tend to be more labour intensive than major national infrastructural projects.</p><p>  As part of the capital review process, my Department has revisited the 2009 Department of Finance work in this area and updated the analysis. The results of that piece of work will be published on my Department's website in the coming weeks.</p><p>  In July 2012, I announced a new Government Stimulus Initiative amounting to a package of &euro;2.25 billion aimed at leveraging funding to support a new PPP programme of projects in key areas of infrastructure across the Education, Health, Justice and Transport sectors. This is a significant construction programme and the projects are of the construction type that promote employment.</p><p>  All of the projects have been issued to market. Construction has started on the N17/18 Gort to Tuam route and financial close is targeted for the remainder of the programme at varying dates during 2015. Construction commencement will follow shortly thereafter.</p><p>  The National Development Finance Agency Act, 2002 provides that all Government Departments and Agencies must seek the advice of the NDFA on the best financing approach, traditional or Public Private Partnership, before undertaking a capital project.

The recently published Comptroller and Auditor General Report on the 'Accounts of the Public Service 2013' is part of the wider accountability framework for the delivery of these services. </p><p>  The report in question is concerned with the accountability of departments and offices in respect of their administration of public funds. As outlined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, it was prepared on the basis of audited information, where available, and other information, documentation and explanations obtained from the relevant government departments and offices. Drafts of relevant parts of the Report were sent to the departments and offices concerned and their comments were requested. Where appropriate, those comments are incorporated into the Report. As such, the Report itself contains information on the actions being taken across the relevant Departments on foot of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General. In this context, the majority of the recommendations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General have been agreed by the relevant Accounting Officers and indeed, where appropriate, by my own Department. </p><p>  In due course, the Committee of Public Accounts will examine and report to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on this Report and my Department will prepare a formal response to the recommendations, (the 'Minute of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform') in consultation with the departments and offices concerned. </p></reply>

It promotes changes to the way individual public servants go about their daily work and greater flexibility in the way services are provided, for example with greater use of technology and shared services.  With the establishment of the Office of Government Procurement, reform in the area of procurement is focussed on delivering better value for the tax-payer by centralising procurement expertise, driving further professionalisation of the function and reducing risk for the State.</p><p>  The Government's overarching fiscal policy objective for 2015 continues to be delivering a budget deficit below 3% of GDP. Given the improved fiscal and economic outlook, and the ongoing expenditure restraint, it is expected that the  budgetary objective of a deficit of less than 3% of GDP can be achieved with a broadly neutral budget.</p></reply>

They can be used in public procurement in cases where they are targeted at factoring into the procurement process consideration of social issues such as employment opportunities, equal opportunities and social inclusion.  In order to be compatible with EU law, they must be made known to all interested parties at tender stage and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States.</p><p>  On 9 June I announced the establishment of a Social Clauses Project Group to be led by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) to pro-actively look at projects with a view to including social clauses to ensure those awarded contracts contribute to employment or training opportunities for long term unemployed. </p><p>  Specific projects that are currently in planning and are deemed potentially suitable for the inclusion of employment opportunities and social inclusion will be identified and targeted to maximise the potential opportunities from these projects.</p><p>  The Project group has the following functions:</p><p>  - Departments with responsibility for employment and training will identify the important social considerations and actively assist the procuring bodies and successful tenderers through the provision of training and accreditation,</p><p>  - the OGP will assist departments/agencies in the design of the social clause most suited to the specific contract,</p><p>  - the procuring body will monitor the impact of the social clause(s),</p><p>  - the OGP will collate this information. </p><p>  I have asked the Office of Government Procurment to review this approach after 12 months and then to issue guidance. The objective is to learn from the practical experience of the pilot projects, as well as from the experience of other jurisdictions, in order to develop a robust social procurement framework that is effective.</p><p>  To date the Social Clauses Group has met twice; on 10 July and 11 September.  A range of priority areas to be addressed by the inclusion of social clauses in public contracts have been identified including assisting the long-term unemployed, training and apprenticeships. These priority areas have been forwarded to the relevant procurement sectors with a view to identifying potential projects where social clauses can be usefully inserted.</p></reply>

The aim of these European rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular bidders on grounds of nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. </p><p>  The Office of Government Procurement produces statistical information in relation to above-EU threshold procurement activity by the Irish public sector and for providing these statistics to the European Commission. The EU average for cross-border activity in relation to activity above these thresholds is 1.4%. The following is based on data available on above EU threshold awards. </p><p>  In 2011, the value of contracts that were awarded above this threshold to non-domestic companies was &euro;240 million.  This represents less than 5% of the overall 2011 annual public procurement spend (approximately &euro;13.1 billion). I am advised by the Office of Government Procurement that more up to date data on above EU threshold contracts for 2012 and 2013 will be available shortly.</p><p>  The reasons for this level of cross-border procurement would include:</p><p>  - a significant number of procurement categories are not supplied locally (i.e. fuel, vehicles, aircraft, heavy machinery and certain pharmaceuticals); and,</p><p>  - that the vast majority of public procurement opportunities in Ireland are advertised in English which makes our tender documents accessible to businesses across Europe, for whom English is the preferred second language;</p><p>  The reform of public procurement across the public service is on-going and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business.  My Department continues to introduce changes to assist SME's in competing for government contracts. In April 2014, I introduced Circular 10/14 which provided guidance to contracting authorities on measures to reduce barriers for SME's in tendering for public contracts. In addition, the Office of Government Procurement continues to engage with industry bodies through the SME Working Group to identify issues in public procurement and implement solutions. </p><p>  The public procurement market in the EU is estimated to be valued in excess of &euro;2.4 trillion. It is important to remember that open tendering is a two way street and that it provides Irish companies with opportunities to compete abroad and reliable EU studies indicate that many Irish businesses are successful in this regard.</p></reply>

The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) was launched in July 2013 and operates as an office of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The OGP is responsible for procurement policy and procedures and together with the four key Sectors of Health, Education, Local Government and Defence will source goods and service for the whole of the public sector.  A key enabler to the success of this project is the ability to centrally collect and analyse historical, current and future spend (non-pay) data from all Public Service bodies and extract and analyse other procurement data from various systems to generate intelligent reports to help drive procurement strategy and reform. The IT system that will enable this data collection and reporting is called a Business Intelligence system. </p><p>  This data collection project is currently managed by one Product Manager who is responsible for delivering this Business Intelligence system and one Data Analyst who assists with the data collection and performs analysis of the procurement data. OGP are currently recruiting for a second data analyst and a system administrator for the business intelligence solution. The Data Analysts and the System Administrator are at the EO grade (&euro;40,760 mid-point of the pay scale) and the Product Manager is at HEO grade (&euro;51,581 mid-point of the pay scale). The Product Manager's time on the project is planned reduce to approx. 50% from Q2 2015.  In addition, the Office has also engaged the services of an IT contractor to assist in the devlopment of the interim solution and processes for data collection. This engagement is for a period of 8 weeks. </p><p>  The manual data collection phase of the project commenced at the start of this year.  Approximately 55% of non-pay addressable spend (excluding drugs, capital expenditure etc.) estimated at approximately &euro;6.5 bn in total has been collected so far for 2011-2013. To date an interim solution developed by the OGP which is largely manual has been used.  OGP is planning to go to market for an enterprise Business Intelligence solution which will improve efficiency and permit a broader scope of data sources for this initiative.</p><p>  There is a requirement on all Public Sector bodies to publish contract award notices above EU thresholds on the e-Tenders website and on Official Journal of the European Union.  The OGP has reported on data available on e-Tenders for above threshold contracts awarded on many occasions.  Circular 10/14 requires the use of eTenders for publication of all tenders above &euro;25,000 for goods and services and &euro;50,000 for works.  The Circular also requires entry of the contract award details into eTenders with effect from 1 August 2014. This requirement will expand the award detail information available for reports for tenders published post-1 August  and the OGP will collect that information from e-Tenders into the Business Intelligence solution and generate reports once sufficient data is available. </p><p>  It is anticipated that quarterly reports will be published on procurement, i.e. on frameworks and contracts awarded above &euro;25,000.</p></reply>

Currently, child benefit is paid to around 604,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children with an estimated expenditure of around &euro;1.9 billion in 2014. <br/><br/>The needs of the children are the priority consideration in the payment of child benefit. Under Section 220 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005, child benefit is payable to the person with whom a qualified child normally resides and the child will not be regarded as normally residing with more than one person. Regulations governing normal residence for child benefit purposes are contained in S.I. 142/2007 (Article 159) and they provide <i>inter alia</i>for the following: <br/><br/>(1) In the event that a qualified child is resident with both mother and father, he or she will be regarded as normally residing with the mother or step-mother.<br/><br/>(2) If mother and father are resident in separate households, the qualified child shall be regarded as normally residing with the person with whom he or she resides for the majority of the time.<br/><br/>In practice, child benefit is paid to the child&rsquo;s mother in all cases except where the parents are separated and the father has responsibility for the full-time care of the child for more than 50% of the time.  <br/><br/>The regulations governing the scheme does not provide for the splitting of the payment between parties in cases of shared residency arrangements for the child.  <br/><br/>If the Deputy wishes to have a particular case considered in further detail by the Department, I will arrange this if she sends me the details.</p></reply>

The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only. There are currently approximately 6,700 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement for which the Government has provided &euro;17.9 million for in 2014. </p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy to assist those in mortgage difficulty is built around the following measures, as recommended in the 2011 Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group (Keane Group), in four main distinct areas:</p><p>  - Lenders providing sustainable and durable resolution options to their borrowers.</p><p>  - A social housing response (Mortgage to Rent).</p><p>  - Comprehensive advice to borrowers.</p><p>  - Personal Insolvency Reform. </p><p>  In the context of the overall strategy, the continued payment of mortgage interest supplement does little to assist recipients in improving the long term difficulty in addressing their mortgage problem and provides little incentive for the lender to provide sustainable solutions. </p><p>  The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported is through engagement with their lender under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) which explores the various options available to the person and provides sustainable solutions. </p><p>  As part of the fiscal adjustment required for Budget 2014, provision was made for the discontinuation of entitlement to mortgage interest supplement for all new applicants from 1 January 2014. Existing customers were not affected by this measure and may retain entitlement to the scheme, up to 1st January 2018. However, it would be expected that during this four year period, existing customers would no longer require this support through sustainable solutions being put in place with their lenders, securing employment or exit strategies sponsored by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, namely the mortgage-to-rent scheme. </p></reply>

The programme is supported by a combination of student fees, State funding and other income.  <br/><br/>While in this case the fees could be considered high, in the majority of cases where third level tuition fees are payable they are at much lower levels.  In addition, those participating in the programme must already have acquired an undergraduate degree, the fees for which would have been covered by the State in the vast majority of cases. <br/><br/>I would point out that tax relief at the standard rate of 20% is available in respect of qualifying fees paid by an individual for a third level education course, including a postgraduate course.<br/><br/>Qualifying fees mean tuition fees in respect of an approved course at an approved college and includes what is referred to as the &quot;student contribution&quot;.  No other fees e.g. administration fees, examination fees, capitation fees, qualify for tax relief.  Tuition fees that are, or will be, met directly or indirectly by grant, scholarship, employer contribution or other means are deducted in arriving at the net qualifying fees. A claim for relief may be made in respect of a number of students.  <br/><br/>In making a claim for relief for the tax year 2014, the maximum amount of fees that can qualify for the relief is &euro;7,000 per student, but an amount set out in the legislation must be disregarded from each claim (whether in respect of one or more students).  Where a claim for relief includes fees paid on behalf of at least one full-time student, the disregard is &euro;2,750.  Where a claim for relief includes fees solely paid on behalf of a part-time student or part-time students, the amount disregarded is &euro;1,375.  Thus, for example, an individual undertaking a graduate entry medical course on a full-time basis, where tuition fees of &euro;15,000 per student apply, would attract relief of &euro;850 made up as follows:<table><tr><th>-</th><th>&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Tuition fees</td><td>&euro;15,000</td></tr><tr><td>Capped at </td><td>&euro;7,000</td></tr><tr><td>Less </td><td>&euro;2,750</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;4,250 @ 20% = &euro;850</td></tr></table><br/><br/>It is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions. However, as with all tax reliefs, the introduction of tax relief for loans taken out to pursue the graduate entry medical programme will be considered in the context of the forthcoming Budget and Finance Bill and any announcements will be made on Budget Day.</p></reply>

These works are being funded by the OPW and are being undertaken by OPW direct labour.

The Office of Public Works (OPW) has no flood defence assets in Ballylongford and, therefore, has no direct responsibility for maintaining or improving existing flood defences.  However, Ballylongford was identified through the national Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment as an area where the flood risk was potentially significant.  It is therefore designated as an area for which detailed analysis is being carried out under the Shannon Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study, which OPW is currently undertaking in partnership with the relevant local authorities including Kerry County Council.  The engineering consultancy company Jacobs Engineering has been commissioned to carry out the work on behalf of the OPW.</p><p>  The analysis under the CFRAM project will enable flood maps to be produced in 2014 and the identification of flood risk management options for this area in 2015.  There will be public consultation on the draft flood maps within the next couple of months and this will be advertised locally. </p><p>  Following the significant flood events earlier this year, Jacobs were on site at Ballylongford collecting data on flood extents, levels and flood mechanism etc.  This information will contribute to calibrating any flood modelling being produced for the town and thus ensuring any future mitigating measures proposed are robust and effective.</p><p>  On a recent visit to Ballylongford, I met with local residents, Councillors and County Council officials and had the opportunity to see the flood prone areas and hear of the problems at first hand.  At that meeting Kerry County Council indicated that it would be making a submission shortly to the OPW for funding under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme to undertake some interim flood protection measures that could be carried out pending the completion of the CFRAM process.  Any application received will be assessed under the eligibility criteria of the Scheme, including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of funding.  It is also open to local authorities to carry out flood mitigation and coastal protection works using their own resources.</p></reply>

My Department is in regular communication with all Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being controlled and we monitor the drawdown of funds from the Exchequer against Departmental published expenditure profiles.  Overall net expenditure to end-September, 2014 amounted to &euro;30,982 million.  This was broadly on target at just &euro;14 million ahead of profile.  The year-on-year reduction in expenditure amounted to &euro;630 million, a decrease of 2.0%.  </p><p>  With regard to the progress made on reform, since this Government took office, sustainable and far reaching Public Service Reform has been a key element of our strategy to meet the challenges that have faced the country in recent years.  Public Service Reform will also continue to play a key role in our recovery.  </p><p>  We published our first Public Service Reform Plan in November 2011.  A Progress Report on the Reform Plan was published in September 2012 and a second Progress Report was published in January this year (www.reformplan.per.gov.ie).  These reports set out the significant progress that has been made to date.  </p><p>  Some examples of this progress include:</p><p>  - while meeting increased demand for services, we have reduced staff numbers by around 32,000 or 10% since 2008 and the paybill has been reduced from &euro;17.5 billion in 2009 to a forecasted &euro;13.6 billion net by end 2014;</p><p> - new working arrangements have been introduced, including longer working hours, new rosters, and standardised arrangements for annual leave and sick leave;</p><p> - we are implementing a radical overhaul of our approach to public procurement, with the Office of Government Procurement targeting savings of &euro;500 million over three years;</p><p> - Peoplepoint the Civil Service wide Human Resources and Pensions Shared Services Centre has been operational since March last year and now services over 25,000 employees across 19 organisations;</p><p> - an Action Plan to deliver efficiencies in the State's property portfolio was published in mid 2013 and is currently being implemented;</p><p> - we have issued over 800,000 Public Services Cards, which are currently being used for social welfare payments and the free travel scheme, and will cover a greater range of services over time;</p><p> - the Office of Government Chief Information Officer has been established to maximise the potential benefits of digitalisation in delivering services and information;</p><p> - the Government services portal - www.gov.ie - includes quick links to more than 400 information and transaction services;</p><p> - we have launched a new Open Data portal - www.data.gov.ie - and a consultation process on data sharing;</p><p> - a series of public expenditure reforms have been implemented to bring greater structure, scrutiny and openness to budgeting;</p><p> - we are making good progress in implementing our programme of political and legislative reform, aimed at enhancing openness, transparency and accountability; and</p><p> - we will shortly publish a Civil Service Renewal Plan setting out a new vision and strategy for the Civil Service.</p><p>  In January this year, I published the Government's second Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016.  The actions set out in the Reform Plan include greater use of shared services and innovative approaches to service delivery; increased use of technology and improved engagement with service users; more efficient and effective public procurement and property management; increased accountability and transparency in public decision making; enhanced leadership and performance management; and a continued focus on building the required capacity and capability to deliver reform and service improvements across the Public Service.  Overall, I am satisfied that both the strong progress made to date and our future plans are in line with best practice across Europe and that the progress we are making is well regarded internationally.</p><p>  In relation to the upcoming Budget, this Government has made some very difficult but necessary decisions over the past 3 years, decisions which have resulted in the restoration of a sustainable and viable economic future for the citizens of this Country.  The Comprehensive Review of Expenditure is currently being concluded and will inform Government decisions that will underpin the basis of the multi-annual expenditure ceilings which will be published as part of the Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2015 - 2017.  The exact expenditure measures required to meet these targets will be agreed by Government in the context of Budget 2015 taking into account macroeconomic developments.  </p></reply>

Responsibility in these matters rests with the SFPA.  The SFPA have a challenging job to do.  Its statutory responsibility is to enforce EU and national law under the Common Fisheries Policy.  It also has responsibility to provide a level playing field for everybody in this industry. If one boat or two or six boats are overfishing deliberately, it is not a victimless crime.  It has an impact on others who are law abiding and who are catching in accordance with the quotas allocated to them. The market situation for pelagic fish is currently challenging, as Russia has banned the importation of pelagic fish and Russia has been an important market for mackerel, in particular. If illegally caught fish are being placed on the market, it displaces and reduces prices for those operators, the majority of our industry, who are abiding by the rules set down. In my view, it is in the interest of the industry as a whole to have strong and fair arrangements in place that give confidence that the rules apply across the board and that all operators are abiding by the quota allocations made available to them.</p><p>  In order to inform the Deputy, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority has sent me a report  on the issues that have given rise to the current situation, the actions taken and the current state of consultation between the SFPA and the industry.</p><p>  The permits which allow in-factory weighting had lapsed due to the SFPA's overall lack of confidence in the operation of the weighing systems.  The SFPA has entered into discussions with both catchers and processors to implement systems and procedures that will restore confidence in the weighing systems in factories. The SFPA had set out to the factories certain requirements necessary before permits can be granted, allowing the renewal of in-factory weighing. These requirements include provisions to give assurances that weigh belts in the factories when moving are recording. They include confirmation of product flows into and out of the plant and checks involving weighing of a sample of landings on the pier side as a means of validating factory weighing.</p><p>  The current position is that all pelagic processing premise, have applied for weigh permits and on foot of an undertaking by each to work to a scheduled programme of correction and amendment to in-factory systems and work practice.  Weigh permits under the new requirements, have been issued to all applicants by the SFPA.</p><p>  Ongoing monitoring of the compliance with the in-factory requirements as specified in being undertaken by SFPA while the routine of landing controls and in-factory assessment and verifications of weights attained is also being monitored.</p><p>  A weekly teleconference between SFPA and representatives of the catching and processing sectors is in train and will allow for operational matters as may arise to be tabled, discussed and resolved.</p><p>  I understand and appreciate that the new arrangements sought by the SFPA for the effective control of pelagic fisheries involve some changes in practices.  However, in the long run, I believe that it will be in the interests of the industry as a whole to commit to strengthened controls that give all catchers and processors assurances that there is a level playing field across the industry.</p></reply>

Under management arrangements introduced in 2010 for mackerel and in 2011 for herring in the North West (Area VIaS) smaller vessels have access to these stocks on the following basis. In the North West, an open herring fishery was established of up to 5% of the Area VIa South adjusted quota, to provide modest monthly catch limits, for vessels under 20m length overall. No booking-in is required. Draft ring net fisherman were accommodated under this allocation.</p><p>  In relation to Mackerel there are two fisheries for small boats. Vessels under 18m in overall length, using trawls or gill nets, have access to a periodic boat catch limit (e.g. monthly, bi-monthly), subject to available quota. There is also a Hook and line fishery for vessels under 15m in overall length. Vessels using hooks and line to fish for mackerel may not engage in trawling or gill netting in the same trip as they fish using hook and line fishing gear. 400t of mackerel is reserved each year for the hook and line fishery.</p><p>  Periodic allocations are made available for operators covered by these arrangements. Each month I receive recommendations from industry representatives at the Quota Management Advisory Committee in relation to the monthly amounts available to the small boat herring and mackerel. In some months the North West herring small boat fishing allocation has covered a two monthly period to facilitate smaller boats. The views of the ITIFA and other local groups representing operators should be made known to the Producer Organisations which represent operators at the monthly Quota Management Advisory Committee meetings.</p><p>  The submission from the ITIFA notes the difficulties posed for members due the requirement to notify the SFPA in advance of landings greater the 250kg. The requirement for the prior notification of landing is recommended of the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, which is the competent body for fisheries control. Any difficulties which arise in meeting the obligation should, in the first instance, be taken up with the SFPA.</p></reply>

From my discussions with the Garda authorities I am assured that Garda management in the Dublin Metropolitan Region keep this deployment under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, including with respect to concerns about public order and anti-social behaviour, so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of policing resources.</p><p>  I do of course appreciate the issues of concern which the Deputy has raised and would draw his attention to the Dublin City Centre Policing Plan which has been operational since June 2013.  Garda actions under the Plan include dedicated high visibility patrols in key commercial and public thoroughfares.  These patrols are informed by crime trends, demand studies and footfall in the areas in question.  I am also aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engages extensively with business and community interests in the city centre area with respect to crime prevention, enforcement and policing concerns.</p><p>  The Garda approach includes focusing resources on specific areas of the city according to need.   As part of this, a number of targeted city centre policing operations are in place.</p><p>  These operations include Operation Pier, which concentrates on the South Quays and Temple Bar area.  This operation includes the designation of certain areas as &quot;hotspots&quot; for anti-social behaviour and regular uniformed and plain clothes patrols.  Other Garda Operations in the city centre include Operation Spire which is focussed on the O&rsquo;Connell Street and North Inner City areas, and Operation Stilts which is an ongoing overt policing operation targeting anti-social behaviour and drug-related crime in Dublin city centre locations.</p><p>  I am conscious of the perspectives of business and community interests about the effects of certain types of crime and anti-social behaviour on the environment for business and leisure and on the overall quality of life for residents.  Some of the problems faced are linked to disorder associated with abuse of alcohol and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work closely with a wide range of businesses involved in the entertainment and nighttime economy to address these issues so that people can enjoy themselves without concern for their welfare. </p><p>  Other challenges have their origin in even more complex social phenomena which go well beyond the capacity of criminal justice agencies to address on their own.  Dealing with these matters requires a co-ordinated approach from state agencies involved in social, housing, health and drug treatment services, as well as through partnership with business, community and voluntary groups.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is already a long term partner in a range of local consultative and representative structures in Dublin and elsewhere.  I am considering how we can step up this cooperation with a view to developing collaborative solutions to the range of issues which affect policing and the overall quality of the environment in our urban centres, and I intend to engage further with the Garda authorities in that regard. </p></reply>

This marked a positive step forward for policing in Ireland. It is my intention that there will be ongoing seamless recruitment and I am discussing the details of this with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b><br/><br/>In relation to training, in February 2008 the Garda Commissioner established a group to review training and development for Garda and civilian staff in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The report of the review group was published in May 2009 and the contents were noted by the Government of the time.<br/><br/>The objective of the Review Group was to make recommendations to improve and reinvigorate Garda training in line with best practice in order to meet the new challenges of a changing society.  One of the Key Recommendations identified by the group was that the student/probationer training programme should be radically restructured <br/><br/>The course for Garda trainees is a high level BA course, which necessitates a certain academic capability.  The revised training programme stemming from the recommendations of the Review Group was devised in order to better prepare recruits for the modern policing environment.  <br/><br/>The main differences between the new and the previous programme is that the new programme carries a greater emphasis on operational policing and focuses on real life scenarios which in turn prepare students for the policing challenges they will face. The new programme will also instil a lifelong learning philosophy for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with a suite of mandatory and elective courses made available.<br/><br/>The restructured student/probationer training will be carried out in three phases.  Phase I is for 32 weeks at the Garda College, at the end of which successful students will be attested (i.e. become members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with full police powers).  Phase II is for 65 weeks based in Garda stations, and Phase III consists of seven weeks of exam preparation, exams and assessments (total 104 weeks).  </p></reply>

However, as the Deputy will be aware, Government approval was received on 19 November 2013 to proceed with drafting the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2013. The legislation has now been passed by the Seanad and Second Stage concluded in the D&aacute;il last week. </p><p>  Standardised packaging, also known as plain or generic packaging, means that all forms of branding &ndash; trademarks, logos, colours and graphics &ndash; would be removed from retail tobacco packaging, except for the brand and variant names, which would be presented in a uniform typeface for all brands on the market.  All packs would be in a plain neutral colour, except for the mandatory health warnings and the tax stamp.  This measure is considered proportionate from a public health perspective. </p><p>  The Deputy refers to the position of the American Chamber of Commerce as presented to the EU in relation to trademarks as being universally recognised as rights of property conferring the right to use such a property, the right to registration of which should not be dependent in any way on the nature of the product, and should not be subjected to unjustified restrictions on their use.  </p><p>  A trade mark is the means by which a business identifies its goods or services and distinguishes them from the goods and services supplied by other businesses. The main purpose of trade mark law is to protect the rights holders&rsquo; investment in the reputation of his goods and services and to assist the consumer in differentiating among competing goods and services in the marketplace. </p><p>  The importance of trademarks cannot be understated and Ireland is recognised as having a robust legal framework in place to support this property right. In particular, trade marks have been protected under a number of European and international laws where well-respected principles were established, including the Paris Convention for the protection of Industrial Property dating from 1883 and, the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property rights Agreement of 1994 (TRIPs). The TRIPs Agreement introduced intellectual property (IP) into the international trading system for the first time and remains the most comprehensive international agreement on intellectual property to date. </p><p>  However, whether at international or domestic level, trade mark rights are not, of themselves, absolute rights and States are permitted to apply derogations that allow for the suspension of part of the legal obligation which can operate to restrict some rights under certain circumstances such as in the pursuit of broader compelling public policy reasons or for greater public interest considerations. The Irish Constitution likewise recognises that the State may delimit by law the exercise of property rights where required by the common good.</p><p>  This Government continues to focus on ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s intellectual property regime, including its trademark regime compares favourably with best international practice and to work to further reinforce Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a country where strong intellectual property rights play a crucial role.   </p><p>  Finally, I would like to point out to the Deputy that tobacco consumption is today the greatest single cause of preventable illness and premature death in Ireland, killing over 5,200 people a year; that smokers die on average 10 years sooner than non-smokers; that one in every two children who experiment with cigarettes goes on to become a smoker, and that one in every two of them will die from a tobacco related disease. In this context, the priority is to reduce the consumption of tobacco across the board, to meet our policy target of making  Ireland tobacco free (i.e. with a smoking prevalence rate of less than 5%) by 2025.</p></reply>

While the Programme supports the principle of providing access to mainstream education where appropriate, it also recognises the important continuing role of special schools.  <br/><br/>An additional &euro;4m has been specifically allocated in 2014 to drive implementation of the Programme which equates to approximately 80 therapy posts.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p><p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive (HSE), unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p></reply>

These services include needle exchange provision, together with evidence-based treatment options such as methadone maintenance treatment, counselling and community and residential rehabilitation.<br/><br/>The HSE co-operate with the local community representatives of the North and South Inner City and with local Garda&iacute; to minimise any negative public order issues that may arise in the vicinity of its treatment centres. <br/><br/>The National Drugs Strategy is a high priority in Government and I work closely with my cabinet colleagues, including the Minister for Justice, to ensure its full implementation.<br/><br/>The Oversight Forum on Drugs, which I chair, monitors progress on the delivery of frontline services and addresses operational difficulties and blockages in implementing the Strategy.  This forum brings together the key Government departments and agencies involved in the implementation of the Strategy.<br/><br/>As the specific issues raised by the Deputy are service matters they have been referred to the Health Services Executive for a more detailed response.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-09a.355.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014100900052#WRL00500"><p>The prices of drugs vary between countries for a number of reasons, including different prices set by manufacturers, different wholesale and pharmacy mark-ups, different dispensing fees and different rates of VAT.<br/><br/>The Government has introduced a series of reforms in recent years to reduce the prices of drugs and medicines which are paid for by the HSE.  This has resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001/2002 levels. <br/><br/>A major new deal on the cost of originator drugs in the State was concluded with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) in October 2012.  This agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in nine EU member states (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, and UK)and these are the maximum prices paid by the HSE for originator drugs supplied through the community drug schemes.  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400 million over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will be available to fund new drugs. <br/><br/>A new agreement was also reached with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry, in 2012.  Under this Agreement the maximum price the HSE pays for generic products was 50% of the initial price of an originator medicine, this was further reduced to 40% from 1 May 2014.  This has resulted in the price differential between off-patent drugs and most generic equivalents increasing from 5% to approximately 20%.<br/><br/>The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 introduces a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines.  This is the maximum price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices.  It is estimated that reference pricing will yield &euro;50 million in savings in 2014.<br/><br/>The reference price for Anastrozole is &euro;28 per pack of 28 tablets with effect from 1 May 2014.  In setting the reference price the HSE took account of prices across the EU, where there is significant variation in price, and sought to balance value for money versus sustainability of supply in a small market.  The reference price represents a 39% reduction and is subject to review on an annual basis. <br/><br/>In the case of drugs and medicines which are reimbursed by the HSE, prices are set in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 or the terms of the framework agreements between the Department of Health and the HSE and the representative bodies for pharmaceutical manufacturers in Ireland.  However, neither the Minister for Health nor the HSE has any power to set the prices of drugs and medicines purchased by private patients.  It would nonetheless be disappointing if all pharmacists were not passing on the benefits of lower prices to patients. <br/><br/>The HSE advises the public that if they are being charged prices which exceed the reimbursement price listed on the HSE website (), plus a dispensing fee of between &euro;3.50 and &euro;5, then they should discuss the differential with their pharmacist to ensure they get the best possible price for the medicine concerned. <br/><br/>In addition, measures have been taken to increase price transparency among retail pharmacies.  In March of this year the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland issued guidelines to pharmacists on procedures and minimum standards of information to be provided to customers, including a requirement to provide an itemised receipt of purchase of medicines.<br/><br/>There are no plans to extend access to free medication to cancer patients specifically under the community drugs schemes.  Support for the cost of medication is provided under the Drug Payment Scheme, whereby no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.<br/><br/>In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. </p></reply>

This review placed significant emphasis on international best practice and the application of these practices to existing service provision in Ireland. </p><p>   The major deliverable of the review was a detailed report based on three key components: capacity and data, work practices, admission polices &amp;amp; related clinical issues.  The report recommended that the number of critical care beds should increase from 289 to 579 over the period 2010 to 2020.  It also recommended a model for the delivery of adult critical care that is underpinned by a network approach, whereby &lsquo;hub&rsquo;, &lsquo;spoke&rsquo;, and &lsquo;local&rsquo; hospitals  work together to provide the patient with safe and high quality critical care, in a timely manner.  At the time of the 2008 report adult critical care services were provided in 37 hospitals (52 units) across the country, including in a number of the smaller hospitals where beds were described as critical care beds but in practice treated low volumes of critical care patients.  The report has informed the work of the HSE critical care clinical programme which was subsequently established. </p><p>  On behalf of HSE operations, the critical care programme completes an annual census to collate each hospital providers' critical care bed capacity and medical and nursing staffing establishment.  Based on the 2014 national census of critical care beds, there are 233 adult critical care beds in public hospitals.  The HSE has advised that while there has been a net reduction in the number of critical care beds nationally, the HSE and the Critical Care Programme are working to ensure more appropriate referral of patients requiring higher levels of critical care to major hub hospitals identified by the HSE as meeting a number of criteria in relation to activity volume and strategic importance for the future.  The HSE is focused on delivering improvements in the way that critical care is organised and delivered within the hospital group structure to ensure patients receive the same high quality of care no matter where they are treated.  There is now a more co-ordinated approach to the planning and delivery of critical care, within and across hospital groups, with a focus on small hospitals managing routine urgent or planned care locally and more complex critical care managed in the larger hub  hospitals where the relevant clinical critical care expertise can be provided. </p><p>  The further development of critical care facilities is being considered in the context of service planning process for  2015.</p></reply>

All hospital managers are expected to efficiently manage waiting lists in chronological order, except where clinical need dictates that a patient needs to be prioritised. The HSE does not condone the manipulation of waiting lists and will take appropriate disciplinary action if this can be proved.</p><p>  In late 2013, a number of patients waiting for a first outpatient appointment were outsourced to the private sector for assessment and were then referred back to the public system for surgical procedures.  The HSE has advised that this practice has now ceased.</p><p>  Patients can be removed from waiting lists as part of the HSE waiting lists validation protocol but GPs and consultants concerned are informed if a patient is being removed from the list and if the GP or consultant considers the patient should be reinstated on the list this is done as part of the protocol.</p><p>  The HSE continues to implement further measures to tackle waiting lists.  These include: increasing the throughput of patients in public outpatient clinic, reducing the number of patients who do not turn up for their appointment, and increasing the number of new patients in the clinic rather than just reviewing previous patients who are often better returned to their GP.</p><p>  It is important for the Deputy to note that there is no policy to manipulate waiting lists.  The only waiting lists that I&lsquo;m interested in are accurate ones.  Accurate waiting lists allows us to plan services.  When it comes to negotiating a good budget for health, waiting list figures that make the situation look better than it really is are no benefit to me.</p></reply>

The Act provides, inter alia, for the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and the enhancement of their high standards of professional education and competencies.  The Department of Health is responsible for oversight of the governance of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI). The Department has no role in setting or approving registration fees.</p><p>  The Board is an independent body, answerable to the Oireachtas, with the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all its legal obligations.  The cost of enacting the additional requirements under the Nurses and Midwives Act 20141 was set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis that was carried out prior to the enactment of the legislation.  These costs include an enhanced regulatory process with supporting systems for continued professional development and certain education and training requirements for the professions.</p><p>  It was also made clear at the time of the legislation that the Board would continue to be self-funding and needed to plan and cost how it would fulfil its legal obligations.  Following detailed negotiations with the Executive and Board members in 2013 it was agreed in October 2013 that an initial once-off sum of &euro;1.6m would be granted by the Department to the Board to cover 2013/2014 costs, but that the Board would have to increase its income in 2015 to undertake its commitments in the legislation.  The Board of the NMBI made the decision to increase the annual registration fee at its meeting on 17th September, 2014.  A helpline, email address and website information page have been made available by the NMBI to provide clarification for registrants who may have queries on this matter.</p></reply>

Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable products.

Screening for coeliac disease is not routinely carried out in Ireland.  The simple blood test required is reasonably, but not completely, accurate.  This means that routinely, screening the entire population could potentially produce a high number of false-positive results.  In effect, people would be diagnosed as having coeliac disease when they did not have it.  Thus, screening for coeliac diseases is usually only recommended for people with known risk factors for the condition, such as having a family history of the disease.  Case finding by testing family members of patients diagnosed with the disease may be beneficial, particularly if family members manifest gastrointestinal or other symptoms.<br/><br/>The guidelines for coeliac disease diagnosis and management currently in use in Ireland are the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, available for download at .  This is the policy on which care in Ireland is based and it will be kept under review.  Ultimately though, the clinical decision for the care of people with coeliac disease is for clinicians.</p></reply>

It should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of doctors with expertise in using the product and with a full understanding of the risks of therapy and the monitoring requirements.</p><p>  The guidance to support appropriate use and monitoring of Roaccutane is based on assessment of the currently available data, which changes over time, as new information is generated on an on-going basis from a variety of sources, including post marketing experience, further studies, literature reviews etc.  The current product information reflects these recommendations.</p><p>  Roaccutane (isotretinoin) should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of physicians with expertise in the use of systemic retinoids for the treatment of severe acne and a full understanding of the risks of isotretinoin therapy and monitoring requirements.  The requirements for specific monitoring of the patient are described in detail in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) in relation to psychiatric disorders, sever skin reactions, allergic reactions, liver enzymes, serum lipids and the pregnancy prevention programme.  Monitoring in these circumstances is through ongoing review of the patient by the prescribing doctor, as part of their clinical practice.</p><p>  I have arranged for copies of the guidelines which were in place in 1998 and the current guidelines to be forwarded to your office.</p></reply>

Our policy on International Development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo; clearly sets out our vision for a sustainable and just world, together with our goals and areas of focus for the coming years. The policy restates our commitment to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA), when economic circumstances permit. </p><p>  Since coming to office, the Government has successfully managed to stabilise the budget for development assistance.  This is a significant achievement, particularly in light of the difficult budgetary circumstances we faced and a clear demonstration of our commitment to the aid programme. In 2011 we provided &euro;657 million to ODA, &euro;629 million in 2012, and &euro;637 million last year.  For 2014 we expect to provide in excess of &euro;600 million for ODA.  These are substantial allocations of public funds and represent a genuine investment on behalf of the Irish people to assist those less fortunate than ourselves.  The estimates process for Budget 2015 is now almost completed.  The final allocation to ODA is ultimately a decision for Government, and will be announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on Budget Day next week.  As the Deputy can appreciate I am not in position to announce next year&rsquo;s allocation but, as I have repeatedly stated publicly, and in response to previous Questions, I and the Minster for Foreign Affairs and Trade have been making the strongest case possible for the allocation to the development assistance programme.</p><p>  I am determined to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme continues to be recognised as a world leader, focusing relentlessly on delivering real and sustainable results that provide lasting improvements to the lives of some the world&rsquo;s poorest people.  </p></reply>

The passport was returned on foot of the correspondence and to date he has been unable to provide the evidence requested.

This was the 18th Plenary meeting of the NSMC.</p><p>  At the meeting, discussions covered a wide range of financial, economic and EU matters including the employment situation in both jurisdictions and measures to encourage job creation.  Also discussed were actions to build trade links with developing markets, attraction of foreign direct investment and issues relating to banking, in particular lending to Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, economic and budgetary challenges facing both administrations and measures aimed at rebalancing the Northern Ireland economy.  Progress on the disposal of NAMA's Northern Ireland portfolio was welcomed by the Council.</p><p>  Ministers also welcomed the success of the Giro d'Italia cycling event which secured widespread global media coverage.  We also noted the opportunities for tourism and trade through the hosting of all-island events and agreed to continue to cooperate on a joint bid for the 2023 Rugby World Cup. </p><p>  We noted that the draft Programmes for the new INTERREG V and PEACE IV Programmes for the period 2014 &ndash; 2020 have been submitted to the EU Commission.  As several other new European programmes may present opportunities for cooperation to maximise the drawdown of EU funding to the island, we agreed that these should be further examined.</p><p>  With regard to the St Andrews Agreement Review, the Council noted that discussions on Sectoral Priorities have now taken place, following the decisions taken at the last NSMC Plenary in November 2013 and the NSMC Institutional meeting in January 2014.  These discussions focused on efforts to support economic recovery, job creation, ensuring the best use of public funds and the most effective delivery of services for citizens.</p><p>  Ministers agreed that it had been useful to review progress and identify opportunities within the existing agreed work programmes and noted that a report on other priorities identified during the Ministerial discussions will be brought to the next NSMC Institutional Meeting.</p><p>  The Council also reviewed the progress made on the areas of co-operation by the North/South Bodies and in the other areas for co-operation, and noted the current position on a North South Consultative Forum.</p><p>  We also discussed the North West Gateway Initiative noting the conclusion of the consultation process that had been carried out with regional stakeholders and agreed that further consultation with relevant Government Departments should be undertaken on the issues identified during the consultation process and that there should be a meeting of Ministers in the North West to consider strategic approaches to the development of the region. </p><p>  The Government is firmly committed to developing North South cooperation in every possible respect and I am looking forward to continuing to work with our Northern colleagues in the North South Ministerial Council.</p></reply>

Within the education sector, the Body reviewed 25 grades including Principal, Assistant Principal and Teacher in primary and post-primary schools.  The Body recommended changes to the allowance payable to Principals of primary schools, which would have resulted in a 5.9% to 31.4% increase in the allowance payable depending on the size of school.  The Body also recommended changes to the allowance payable to Principals of small post-primary schools, which would have resulted in a 17.3% to 31.4% increase in the allowance payable depending on the size of school.  The Body did not recommend increases for the grades of Assistant Principal or Teacher.<br/><br/>Under the Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009, it was agreed that the increases recommended in the second report of the Public Service Benchmarking Body would be paid as follows:<br/><br/>(a) 5% from 1 September 2008, or where the total increase is less than 5%, the full increase from that date;<br/><br/>(b) The issue of the payment of any balances will be discussed between the parties in the context of any successor to this Transitional Agreement which might be agreed between the Social Partners, or whatever other arrangements may be in place on the expiry of this Transitional Agreement.<br/><br/>  The pay terms contained in the Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009 were not implemented due to the State's worsening financial circumstances.

The staffing schedule at primary level operates on the basis of 1 classroom teacher for an average of every 28 pupils.  More favourable ratios operate in DEIS schools.<br/><br/>  Each one point adjustment to the current 28.1 schedule at primary level is estimated to cost of the order of 250 posts (&euro;15m). <br/><br/>  A significant amount of analysis would be required to provide an indicative estimate for the costings requested by the Deputy.  It is not possible in the time available, to undertake such an analysis.  This information will be provided to the Deputy as soon as it can be gathered.<br/><br/>  Given the current budgetary environment there is no scope in the short term to consider improvements to pupil teacher allocation ratios.  My Department's focus for the foreseeable future is on targeting any additional resources to cater for the continuing increase in demographics at all levels in the education system.</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that this information is not readily available to the Department.<br/><br/>  As the Deputy will be aware, the reality of our economic situation presents significant challenges that have to be reconciled with limitations on public resources.  This is a very stark reality, which, unfortunately, means that changes to any public service, including the student grant scheme, cannot be ruled out.<br/><br/>  For this reason it is the responsibility of Government to take into consideration all areas of public services when formulating Budget 2015.

This facilitates access to individualised education programmes which can be supported by Special Needs Assistants and fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) as well as the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.</p><p>  The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions is particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues. My Department supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use. However, the Department does not accept, based on research, advice and best practice, that ABA should be the only approach used. While ABA helps to improve behaviour, other approaches, such as a number of those to which I have referred are just as important in developing children's communication and speech skills.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that the NCSE is currently preparing policy advice on the education of children with autism.  Their report which is due in 2015 will identify the nature and extent of educational intervention/s, teaching practices and other supports which should be provided to enable children with autism to achieve educational outcomes appropriate to their needs and abilities and will inform future policy development.

The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level.</p><p>  Schools with significantly increasing enrolments are catered for within the staffing arrangements by being allocated teachers on the basis of their current pupil numbers rather than on a previous year basis which is the case for the majority of schools.</p><p>  The staffing appeals process has been extended to include a new criterion which helps those schools that make a significant contribution to the provision of school places, which assists the response to demographic growth within their area, and as a result are under significant pressure on their class sizes at infants level.</p><p>  The staffing arrangements for the current school year are set out in Circular 0007/2014 which is available on the website.</p><p>  The national average class size at primary level is 24.7 pupils.

The report considered that, on the basis of available research evidence, the use of a school's social context is valid in developing an educational profile, as socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with the incidence of certain types of special educational needs, including low achievement in academic learning and emotional or behavioural disorders.</p><p>  The report also noted that a school within a disadvantaged social context may have a higher share of students presenting with emotional or behavioral disorders. While some of these needs are likely to be reflected in low test scores, others may not, as students with relatively high levels of educational achievement can have emotional and behavioural disorders.</p><p>  Accordingly, it was recommended that consideration of a schools social context should form part of any proposed new resource allocation model.</p><p>  In considering how a social context profile might be developed for schools, the working group noted that the Department currently holds information which underpinned the development of the Developing Equality in Schools (DEIS) schools programme.  However, this information dates from 2005, and was not considered by the Working Group to be current enough to provide a social context component for any new SEN Resource Teacher/Learning support allocation model.</p><p>  The group therefore recommended that a new social context schools survey should be conducted.  Pending the availability of a more objective source of information, the working group stated that it was confident that survey reporting by school principals could produce robust up to date data on school context in a similar manner to DEIS and earlier initiatives.</p><p>  The Department therefore, in conjunction with the NCSE, asked the Educational Research Centre (ERC) to conduct a survey of schools to assist the development of an educational profile.</p><p>  It was considered that the issuing of a new survey was a preferable option to using existing data from 2005, or data from limited sources that may not capture the full current complexity of a school's make up.</p><p>  Though recognising that all schools would not be able to have specific detail regarding all of the questions asked in relation to their pupil populations, schools were asked to provide their best possible estimates in relation to the questions being asked in the survey, in order to ensure that as accurate as possible a social context allocation component of any revised allocation model could be developed for each school.</p><p>  At all stages of the development of the advice and in particular in the work of the working group there was comprehensive consultation with education partners and stakeholders and through this consultation there was awareness and broad support for the proposed approach including the deployment of a survey.</p><p>  The data which schools were requested to return as part of the survey was non-personal, anonymised data.  Schools were not asked to return data in relation to the social circumstances of individual pupils.</p><p>  Schools were also advised that the ERC had put in place a dedicated phone help line in order to provide assistance and support to schools in completing the questionnaire.  I understand that many schools used this help line to gain assistance in completing the questionnaire.</p><p>  Whereas I understand that the return of this survey has caused extra work and some difficulties for some schools, I am confident that having up to date social context data will be highly beneficial to the Department and the NCSE in developing proposals for a new profiled allocation model for schools.</p><p>  I can confirm that my Department has received communications from a number of schools and bodies in relation to the survey, including the school and the organisation referred to by the Deputy in his question, and that my Department will respond to those bodies accordingly.  </p></reply>

The overall value of the measure for the 2013/14 academic year was &euro;16.2m. The management of the Third Level Access Measure Fund rests with the Higher Education Authority and the allocation of funding for the sub-priorities in a particular year is a matter for the authority.</p><p>  The Student Assistance Fund is administered on a local basis by participating higher education institutions and targets those students most in need. The Fund provides financial assistance to students to contribute to the costs of participating in higher education and it is an important element of the student support framework in place. Typically, funding is provided for rent, childcare, travel and general living expenses.</p><p>  The HEA approved in July of this year an allocation for the Student Assistance Fund for the 2014/15 academic year of &euro;6.6m. Each participating institution was advised of its individual allocation in advance of the academic year in order to facilitate timely planning and disbursement to students, and each institution has at this stage received 50% of their allocation in line with procedures for the Fund.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the reality of our economic situation presents significant challenges that have to be reconciled with limitations on public resources. This is a very stark reality, which, unfortunately, means that changes to any public service, including Third Level Access Measures, cannot be ruled out.</p><p>  For this reason it is the responsibility of Government to take into consideration all areas of public services when formulating Budget 2015. Ultimately, our budgetary decisions now will play a major part in creating a sustainable economy and in regaining our economic independence. As the Deputy will be aware all proposals made in relation to education expenditure including changes to student assistance fund will be considered in the context of the Budget 2015.</p></reply>

The circular also clarifies circumstances when SNA support should be reduced or withdrawn, for example where care needs have diminished or where a child may have left a school. Children who require support of an SNA will continue to avail of such support.<br/><br/>There has also been no reduction to the overall number of SNA or resource teaching posts which may be allocated to schools. The number of SNA posts which may be allocated to schools increased from 10,575 posts to 10,965 posts for 2014.<br/><br/>Once SNAs have been allocated to schools, the deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.<br/><br/>The purpose of this Circular is not to reduce the number of SNA posts in schools, but clarifies and restates the purpose of the SNA scheme which is to provide schools with additional support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs. <br/><br/>In June 2011, the Department published a Value for Money and Policy Review of the SNA scheme. In May 2013, the NCSE published its Policy Advice on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools.<br/><br/>Both reports concluded that the SNA scheme has been highly successful in supporting the care needs of children with special needs in schools, and with assisting to facilitate their integration and inclusion. However, the reports also concluded that the intended purpose of the scheme was not always generally well understood by parents or schools and that the scope and purpose of the scheme should be clarified for schools.<br/><br/>There have been no changes to the way in which Resource Teachers are allocated to schools.  The total number of Resource Teaching posts which the NCSE may allocate to schools to support children with special educational needs for the 2014/15 school year is presently set at 6,225 WTE posts.<br/><br/>This is more posts than has ever previously been made available to the NCSE to allocate to schools and shows that there has not been a reduction to the overall number of posts being allocated to schools for resource teaching support. The figure of 6,225 posts for 2014/15 should be compared with 5745 posts for 2013/14, and 5265 posts for the 2012/13 school year.</p></reply>

SUSI was formally established in early 2012, as a new unit within CDETB with sanction for a staffing complement of 65 full-time equivalents.  Subsequently, the additional resources recommended by the review carried out by Accenture were sanctioned in 2013.  The additional resources included three additional management posts and some 23 (FTE) additional processing staff increasing the sanctioned full-time equivalent to 91. The staff complement is made up of a mix of permanent and seasonal staff which are variable during the year to match the flows of grant processing work.<br/><br/>I am informed by CDETB that the level of staffing in SUSI, as at 30 September 2012 was 50, as at 30th September 2013 was 137 and as at 30th September 2014 was 125.<br/><br/>The breakdown of staff between the functional areas of SUSI, at 30 September 2014 as reported was as follows:<br/><br/>Assessment  - 95.

The decision to abolish the Gaeltacht Placement grants, from September 2012, has to be viewed in the context of the prevailing requirement to reduce costs and achieve efficiencies where possible. Priority was given to protecting resources for front line education services as far as possible in the coming years, which is especially challenging with rising numbers of school-going children.<br/><br/>To assist with the costs of the Gaeltacht placement, students in receipt of a student grant which includes a 100% fee grant, or who would have qualified for a full fee grant but for the Free Fees Schemes, can apply for funding towards travel and accommodation costs under the field trip element of a fee grant, subject to the normal terms and conditions of the scheme.<br/><br/>Apart from the student grant system, in circumstances of particular need students may apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund.<br/><br/>I am not in a position to reinstate the funding to this area.</p></reply>

English, Irish and Mathematics are the only subjects offered at two levels.  All other subjects will be offered at a single common level.  This move is consistent with good practice in curriculum specification internationally, and contributes to the development of more inclusive curricula designed for and taken by ALL students, including those with special needs. <br/><br/>  The brief for the development of subject specifications stresses the importance of learning outcomes, including those learning outcomes previously associated with Foundation Level, so students with special needs who may previously have taken Foundation Level will be able to choose from the Ordinary Level or Higher Level in these subjects. In addition, the broader range of assessment approaches and methods to be used in these subjects will also facilitate students with special needs in accessing and achieving well in these subjects.  <br/><br/>  It is important to note that there is a new initiative in the reformed Junior Cycle.  There will be assessment of Level 2 Learning Programmes.  The Level 2 Learning Programme will target the learning and accreditation needs of certain students with general learning disabilities.  These students are small in number and will have Individual Education Plans.  They will be accredited for their work.<br/><br/>  Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) is responsible for quality assurance across higher and further education and training and also makes awards at all levels of the National Framework of Qualifications. In order to have access to QQI's awards, providers of education and training must first agree their overall procedures for quality assurance with QQI, so that QQI can be assured that they meet their rigorous quality standards. The purpose of those standards is to ensure that providers have the capacity to provide quality programmes of education and training to their learners. <br/><br/>  Since its establishment, QQI has been rolling out its own policies and criteria across its range of functions and, in the final quarter of 2013, it published the policies required to allow new providers to gain access to its awards. In addition, QQI determined the fees associated with those policies, and those fees were consented to by the then Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. In the further education and training sector, those fees amounted to &euro;5,000 for approval of quality assurance procedures, and &euro;2,000 or &euro;1,000 for validation of a programme of education and training, depending on the size of the award. The fees which will apply to providers which currently have access to QQI's awards, and which will be required to re-engage with QQI, are yet to be determined.<br/><br/>  There is a significant amount of work involved in assessing applications from providers seeking access to QQI's awards and these fees underpin QQI's ability to ensure and monitor compliance with its standards.</p></reply>

The criteria for the allocation of posts is published annually on the Department website.  Where staff are on career breaks, carer's leave, job sharing, extended sick leave, maternity and extended maternity leave the posts are filled by staff on fixed term contracts, until the post holder returns to his / her position. In the post primary sector it may transpire that schools are forced to employ more than one teacher on fixed term contracts to cover the subject combination of a teacher on a particular leave of absence.  <br/><br/>  There are also arrangements in place whereby schools can apply for temporary full and part-time resource posts to cover their NCSE approved allocation if such schools are unable to access resource hours through a network full time permanent resource posts in place. <br/><br/>  Where a fixed term contract is awarded to a teacher and the allocation continues to support the need for the teacher, after three years and subject to the terms of Department circulars, that person teacher will be offered a contract of indefinite duration in the school.  <br/><br/>  Special Needs Assistants are employed in schools to assist with the care needs of children.  Due to the nature of the work the allocation for SNAs will increase or decrease depending on the numbers of children requiring assistance in any school year.  SNAs are employed on the basis that they will continue to work in the school as long as the resource is required.  If there is no requirement for an SNA and the post becomes redundant, the SNA may opt to take a redundancy payment or remain on a panel for up to two years while seeking a further post as an SNA.<br/><br/>  At the end of the 2013/14 school year there were 935 primary teachers and 2,618 post primary teachers on fixed term contracts.<br/><br/>  The Department does not have a direct role in the recruitment and employment of staff in the education and training board sector and, accordingly, information regarding the number of temporary contracts in place in the sector is not readily available. The recruitment and employment of staff is a matter for each of the sixteen education and training boards and to compile such information would involve an inordinate amount of administrative time. Accordingly the Department is not in a position to provide the information requested for the Education and Training Boards.</p></reply>

The rates of duty applicable for half yearly and quarterly options are 55.5% and 28.25% of the annual charge respectively. This additional cost element takes account of the extra workload for staff in motor tax offices and the National Vehicle and Driver File unit, and the resultant administrative costs and printing costs that arise, including the issuing of renewal notices.  The estimated annual income from the increased charges for half-yearly and quarterly vehicle licences is in the region of &euro;50m. A loss in income from this source would have a negative impact on revenue and would have to be borne elsewhere in the motor tax system, or through the taxation system generally. </p><p>  I have no plans to adjust the basis for paying motor tax on a half-yearly or quarterly basis currently.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. <br/><br/>The Act defines a customer as the occupier of the premises in receipt of water services. As such, third level students who have moved away from home to an alternative primary residence and residents living in sheltered accommodation will be liable for water charges.<br/><br/>The proposed approach to charging was outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan which it submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act. The CER recently held a public consultation on this plan which covered a range of issues relating to water charges. Last week, the CER issued a determination on the water charges plan. Full details and associated documentation are available on the CER website ().<br/><br/>In making its determination on the water charges plan, the CER had to take account of the decisions made by the Government on the funding model for Irish Water and a direction made under Section 42 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 in July 2014. This policy direction addressed a number of matters relating to domestic water charges including the provision of a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply and a free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as for child benefit, while customers with specific medical conditions which require increased water consumption will have their charges capped. <br/><br/>In its determination, the CER has decided that all customers will have their total water charges capped at the unmetered &ldquo;assessed charge&rdquo; for 9 months. The cap will apply from the start date of the next billing period after installation of the meter or 1 October 2014, whichever is the later.<br/><br/>In addition to the above, the Government has agreed to put in place further affordability measures to assist pensioners, persons with disabilities, and carers who receive the Household Benefits Package. The conditions and administrative approach to this additional measure are being developed by the Department of Social Protection. <br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

The WSSP is intended to outline the strategic direction for Irish Water over the short, medium and long-term time frames up to 2040. The WSSP will be a strategic framework which will identify and prioritise the key objectives required to ensure the public water system can meet the challenges of the future. This framework will also allow future capital investment plans to be developed by Irish Water and approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation in its role as economic regulator. I issued a direction to Irish Water under Section 33(3) of the Water Services (No.2) Act, 2013 which sets out matters to be taken into account in developing the water services strategic plan and &ldquo;ensuring a safe and reliable water supply&rdquo; is among the themes to be addressed in the plan in accordance with the direction.<br/><br/>Development of the draft strategic plan involves public consultation and consultation with statutory consultees including my Department, the County and City Management Association, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Commission for Energy Regulation, local and regional authorities and with environmental authorities. A further round of public consultation on the draft plan will be held before year end with a view to its submission to me, as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, for approval in early 2015.<br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

In announcing its decision on the Irish Water water charges plan, the CER determined that customer charges are capped at the relevant unmetered charge for an initial period of nine months after their water meter is installed.

As is the case with any private organisation, its operations are matters for its management and board of directors and I have no powers to direct them to take a particular course of action.<br/><br/>While I have no regulatory function in the area of insurance or insurance-based products, it is my intention to raise this issue with the appropriate statutory bodies and Government Departments involved in the regulation and oversight of insurance and I will be fully supportive of any proposals that may be put forward to bring a satisfactory conclusion to the difficulties being faced by homeowners with pyrite damage even when remediation works have been carried out.<br/><br/>The pyrite remediation scheme, which was published by the Pyrite Resolution Board in February 2014, was developed having regard to the recommendations set out in the Report of the independent Pyrite Panel. The scheme is one of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and applies to dwellings with significant pyritic damage. The scheme is fundamentally a works scheme aimed at remediating pyrite damaged homes to <i>Irish Standard 398-2:2013 Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &mdash; Part 2: Methodology for remediation works</i>, published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland in January 2013, in order to ensure the restoration of quality to homes that affected homeowners expect and are entitled too.<br/><br/>All works under the scheme will be completed to the required standard by competent builders and overseen by construction professionals in accordance with the requirements of the Board and the Housing Agency. At the end of the works, homeowners will be provided with certification to confirm that their home has been remediated to I.S. 398:2013 &ndash; Part 2. Given that the contaminated hardcore will be removed and replaced with compliant material, and all damage remediated, I am confident that any risk to the structural integrity of such remediated homes caused by pyritic heave will be eliminated, thereby removing any impediment towards the future insurance of these homes.<br/><br/>In this context, I would call on all insurance providers to re-consider their policies in these matters and provide the insurance cover that affected homeowners require in order to ensure that their homes are protected against future unforeseen risk.</p></reply>

While each LCDC will plan and manage the delivery of programme activity within its respective local authority area, it would be possible for a single representative organisation to implement programme actions across a number of different LCDC areas where this can be agreed locally within the administrative requirements of the various programmes.</p><p>  Under the LEADER Rural Development Programme 2014-2020, local development strategy areas have been designated to coincide largely with local authority boundaries. While a separate strategy is not envisaged, distinct and separate provision will be made for the islands within the respective county-based strategies in accordance with identified priorities and need. Moreover, where it can be agreed locally between local authorities, local development companies and other key local stakeholders, it is envisaged that the existing companies, such as Comhar na n-Oile&aacute;n, would continue to implement LEADER within their current sub-county areas, albeit under separate county-based local development strategies.</p><p>  The situation with SICAP is somewhat different as it is subject to a public procurement process, which is currently underway. Similar to LEADER, programme delivery across a number of sub-county areas by a single body is possible, with programme funding allocated on the basis of identified need in those areas. Until such time as the outcome of the procurement process is known and contracts are awarded, however, I am unable to confirm the exact delivery arrangements for any area, including the islands.</p></reply>

This procedure was based on achievement of political consensus across the four Dublin local authorities (Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and South Dublin County Council), involving the adoption of a resolution by a majority of each Dublin council for the holding of a plebiscite in relation to proposals set out in the resolution. In the event, that statutory requirement for the holding of a plebiscite was not met.</p><p>  Subsequently, my predecessor, in a meeting with the Mayors of the four Dublin authorities on 7 July, invited them to consider and revert with proposals that would address not only the concept of a directly elected mayor but also the wider governance of the metropolitan area including cost and functional implications. Any subsequent process arising from this would be contingent on political consensus across the four local authorities. </p><p>  Furthermore, as the process under the 2014 Act provided only for a possible plebiscite in conjunction with the 2014 local elections, fresh legislation would be required to provide for any further proposal in this matter, which would have to be viewed in the context of priorities generally, including the heavy programme of important legislation arising over the next 18 months or so. </p></reply>

Last week, the CER issued a determination on the water charges plan and details and associated documentation are available on the CER website (). The final Irish Water Tariff Model, as published by the CER, estimates that just under 1.5 million households are connected to the public supply and will be billable by Irish Water. <br/><br/>However, Irish Water is in the process of compiling the relevant data to ensure that customers can be billed accurately based on the tariff structure approved by the CER. Throughout the last number of weeks, Irish Water has been sending application packs to households, which refer to the effective charging date and the fact that billing for domestic customers in receipt of public water services will start in January 2015.  The application process will enable customers to confirm their details for billing and, by providing the relevant PPS numbers, claim the allowances that they are eligible for.  Until the application process is complete, it is not possible for Irish Water to state exactly how many households will be billed for domestic water charges.<br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.  They may be contacted via email to <i>oireachtasmembers@water.ie</i>or by telephone on 1890 278 278. </p></reply>

This information is reflected in the statutory summary of Social Housing Assessments which provides details of the number of households qualified for social housing support and on housing authority waiting lists.

In February 2013, at the time of publication of the Government&rsquo;s <i>Homelessness Policy Statement,</i>a set of indicators was identified to be used to demonstrate the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed. These indicators will give a clearer picture of homelessness in Ireland and, in quantifying its ongoing extent, will support the implementation of realistic and practical solutions. The Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System (PASS) is now operational nationwide and will assist lead housing authorities in each of the 9 regions to report on these indicators. 2014 will be the first year for which PASS will produce composite national data on homelessness. Quarterly reports from lead housing authorities are being published on my Department's website as soon as these are available. Lead housing authorities are also providing monthly reports on homelessness which identify the number of people utilising State-funded emergency accommodation on a regional and county basis. These monthly reports also provide details of the breakdown of the individuals and the numbers of families and dependents that are in emergency accommodation. Both the quarterly and monthly reports are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at,<i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i></p></reply>

This can result in a certificate of less than 1 or 2 years duration, depending on the age of the vehicle.  No provision exists to permit an extension of the period covered by an NCT certificate beyond the next test due date.<br/><br/>Voluntary early testing refers to vehicles presented for test more than 90 days in advance of their test due date.  Subsequent test due dates are re-set to anniversaries of the voluntary test date and this would result in subsequent test due dates being brought forward.</p></reply>

This advanced booking is to ensure that owners have sufficient time to have their vehicle tested before their current NCT certificate expires.

Pension schemes are closely regulated under Irish and European pension law and the Pensions Authority is the national statutory regulatory authority in Ireland.  There are prescribed procedures and limitations in place governing any reductions in pension rights introduced to address funding difficulties in a scheme such as the IASS.     </p><p>  It has been clear for a long time that any solution to the complex problems of the IASS requires significant contributions from both employers and members of the scheme.  The Expert Panel established earlier this year was tasked with finding the fairest way to distribute the burden, while addressing a range of other impediments. As a result of that Report, there was an uplift in the monies to be provided by the employers outside of the IASS, a significant proportion of which is intended for the deferred members.   </p><p>  The IASS Trustee and the principal employers have recently issued documents in respect of the proposed changes in pension arrangements.  These communications mark the commencement of the formal consultation process which the Trustee is required by the Pensions Act 1990 to undertake in respect of the reductions in benefits that it is proposing.  Each member will also shortly receive a personalised illustration of future pension benefits.  All members have been invited to send their views on the proposals to the IASS Trustee by 27 October 2014.  The target date for implementation of the proposals remains 31 December 2014.     </p><p>  Huge efforts have been put in by all concerned over many years in an attempt to resolve the scheme's funding problems.  A set of clear proposals has now been put forward which offer the best chance to resolve the long-standing problems of the scheme and resolve members&rsquo; uncertainties about their future pension entitlements.  I would urge all parties to accept them.     </p><p>  On the basis that the Trustee decides to proceed with changes to the IAS scheme following the consultation process which is underway, I will sign the Ministerial Orders enabling the IAS scheme trustees to amend the scheme.</p></reply>

One of the key aspects of this Bill will be to further strengthen legislation on intoxicated driving.  Other measures proposed include broadening current &ldquo;alcohol&rdquo; legislation to deal with all intoxicants, providing for roadside testing for drugs and placing an onus on employers to ensure employees are not under the influence of intoxicants when driving on public roads.<table><tr><th><b>Year</b></th><th><b>No. of Fatalities on Irish Roads</b></th></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>279</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>238</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>213</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>186</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>162</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>190</td></tr><tr><td>2014 to 6 October</td><td>146</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The commemorations to mark the centenary of the Easter Rising will be a major event in a programme in place since 2012, commemorating the events leading to the proclamation of the Irish Republic.  These have included the introduction and progress of the third Home Rule Bill in the Westminster parliament, the formation of Volunteer movements, and the outbreak of World War I. Economic and social issues were examined in 2013 on the Centenary of the 1913 Lockout along with the role of suffragettes.  This year has seen significant attention to the mobilisation in Ireland and across Europe for the First World War. In the coming year, alongside the continuing experience of World War I, this commemorative programme will address the cultural revival in Ireland, which reflected the strengthening sense of national identity and determination to achieve autonomous government.</p><p>  As part of the 2016 commemorations, arrangements have been made for a number of significant capital projects. These include the renovation of Kilmainham Courthouse to enhance the visitor experience at Kilmainham Gaol, the development of a permanent exhibition space and interpretative centre at the GPO and the development of visitor facilities at Teach an Phiarsaigh, Ros Muc. The development of a Tenement Museum is moving ahead and I was also pleased to have been present last week at the announcement of the renovation works to take place at Richmond Barracks.  Additionally, a permanent visitor facility is being built at Cathal Brugha Barracks for the Military Service Pensions Archive. Following on the inaugural online release of records in January last, the Minister for Defence last week released the second collection of files from this collection.</p><p>  An inclusive and detailed programme of events for the commemoration of the 1916 Rising is being developed with a view to having a draft of that programme available shortly. This will be subject to consultation with stakeholders before finalisation. </p><p>  Preparation of the plans for 2016 has taken account of the views of the Oireachtas All-Party Consultation Group on Commemorations and the Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations. The membership of these groups is set out below.</p><p>  The Oireachtas All-Party Group on Commemorations is chaired by me, as Minister, with Minister of State Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; Riord&aacute;in, T.D., as Vice-Chair. Membership includes Mr. Michael Conaghan, T.D., and Ms. Anne Ferris, T.D (Labour Party); Senators Mary White and Mark Daly (Fianna F&aacute;il); Mr. Aengus O Snodaigh, T.D., and Senator Kathryn Reilly (Sinn F&eacute;in); Ms. Catherine Murphy, T.D., and Ms. Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan, T.D., (Independent); and Dr. Maurice Manning and Dr. Martin Mansergh (Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations). Additional nominations from Fine Gael will be made shortly, in line with the agreed composition of the Group.</p><p>  The Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations is chaired by Dr Maurice Manning (Chancellor of the National University of Ireland), supported by Vice-Chairman, Dr Martin Mansergh. Membership includes Professor Mary Daly, Dr Eamon Phoenix, Dr Leeann Lane, Ms Sin&eacute;ad McCoole, Professor Eunan O&rsquo;Halpin, Professor Diarmuid Ferriter, Mr Francis Devine and Dr Mary Harris.</p></reply>

In 2007, Ireland was found by the Court of Justice of the European Union to have failed to meet its obligations in this regard. Six sites containing suitable breeding and foraging habitat for the Hen Harrier have now been designated as SPAs. Consented activities within these SPAs - such as wind-farm development and afforestation, for example - can only be undertaken in keeping with the provisions of Article 6 of the EU Habitats Directive, which require ecological assessment of the impact of such development by the consent authority involved. Where an adverse impact cannot be ruled out, the authority is prevented from granting consent, except in exceptional circumstances.</p><p>  A failure by Ireland to adhere to these requirements could result in further infringement action and the imposition of fines, including daily fines, by the Court of Justice. My officials are currently working with their counterparts in three other Government Departments to draw up a threat response plan for the Hen Harrier, which will explore how best Ireland can meet its conservation obligations for this species, while bringing more clarity and certainty to land-owners about forestry, agriculture and wind-farm development within these SPAs.</p></reply>
