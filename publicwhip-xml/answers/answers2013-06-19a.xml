The basis of both these checks is laid down in the governing EU Regulations.</p><p>  The administrative checks and systems validations confirm compliance with a variety of requirements, including confirming that the application was received on time, that the land declared by the applicant was not also claimed by another Scheme applicant, that the necessary minimum stocking density levels have been achieved, etc. Failure to respect one or more of these Scheme requirements must result in a penalty be applied.</p><p>  The annual round of field inspections covers both the eligibility of the land declared to draw down payments and also cross compliance aspects, to ensure compliance with EU regulatory requirements in the areas of public, animal and plant health, environment and animal welfare. These inspections are mandatory and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must take place annually. </p><p>  Land eligibility inspection (either on-farm or by remote sensing) must be carried out on at least 5% of applicants. These checks are carried out to verify that the actual area claimed in the application form corresponds to the area farmed by the farmer and to ensure that any ineligible land or features are not included for aid purposes. In order to be eligible to draw down EU funding, it is a requirement that all land eligibility inspections must take place before any payments can issue to any farmer in the country in a given year. </p><p>  Furthermore, under the 2012 Scheme, applicants&rsquo; holdings were required to have met a minimum stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, or have successfully applied for derogation; in addition, applicants&rsquo; holdings were also required to have met a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units for a minimum retention period of six consecutive months in 2012 and also have achieved an annual average stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare for the twelve months. </p><p>  Payments in excess of &euro;208 million have been delivered thus far to farmers under the 2012 Scheme have issued to 95,449 farmers. To date, 7,188 cases have been subject to partial penalty; these penalties represented, on average, 6% of the individual payments concerned. These penalties arose due to a variety of factors, including late submission of applications, over-declaration of land, cross compliance, etc. In addition, there were 310 cases subject of a full penalty, where no payment issued because the extent of breach of the Scheme requirements was above the threshold allowed. </p><p>  In addition, 2,903 applicants did not meet the revised 2011 stocking density level required for the 2012 Scheme.  Of these, to date, 1,506 unsuccessfully sought derogation, in some cases having gone through the available appeal processes  In addition to the 2,903 cases already referred to, a further 3,832 have not, to date, satisfied the general 2012 minimum stocking density requirements.  This latter number is subject to change in the event that individual applicants demonstrate compliance with the minimum stocking requirements.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-19a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061900066#WRA00700"><p>In 2006, the Forest Service introduced IFORIS which is its computerised geo-spatial and payments system. Like the Single Farm Payment and other schemes, this system uses ortho-photography, which is geometrically corrected aerial photography overlaid onto maps. The IFORIS system captures an image of an applicant's claim map and calculates an accurate measurement of the area being claimed. The process of electronically capturing the claim map is called digitisation. This is not a new process but has been widely used for many years. To ensure accuracy and consistency, digitising is performed using well established standards and procedures.</p><p>  The Forest Service has not introduced any new technology since 2006. It has simply availed of the Department's constantly updated ortho-photography, which is used to detect potential over-claims and overpayments. A simple example would be where a forestry plantation is initially established, the trees planted are not visible when viewed in contemporaneous photographs. However, when viewed on later photography, maturing trees in the plantation will be visible but the more recent photographs may show gaps where trees have failed, were removed, or were never planted. The updated photography therefore provides an effective audit tool to ensure that claims made under my Department's schemes are accurate.</p><p>  The technology used is not new and has been used internationally for many years. Tolerances are applied when capturing and measuring claims in order to avoid penalising applicants due to minor inaccuracies in their claims. My Department has no concerns over the accuracy of ortho-photography and geo-spatial systems for measuring areas. Digitising accuracy depends on the applicant's claim map - if the applicant submits a claim map which does not accurately define the area planted then the digitised image will obviously reflect that.</p><p>Forestry companies are also increasingly relying on their own geo-spatial technology. Furthermore, they now submit 93% of all applications for approval to plant through the Department's <i>IFORIS Online System</i>  . This enables them to submit maps digitally and to verify measurement of the area to be planted and claimed.</p><p>  Where over-claims by applicants under the forestry schemes have resulted in overpayments, the cause has sometimes wrongly been attributed to digitisation by some parties. In fact, such overpayments are due to claim maps claiming an area greater than that actually planted, or to an applicant continuing to claim for a plantation that failed or was destroyed, or to trees being removed from the plantation, or to administrative error. My Department detects such overpayments through random or risk analysis driven inspections; through Single Farm Payment queries by applicants or their neighbours; through forestry queries by the applicant himself; by formal audit of files; or by the Department reviewing newer aerial photography. In the contentious circumstances of an over-claim and overpayment, while measurement of the area involved is often disputed by the applicant, the digitisation process is not relevant in this context - the crux is that the applicant must prove that the all of the area that he is claiming is eligible for payment under the scheme.</p><p>  In all cases, my Department is obliged to recoup all public money that has been overpaid. But, each case is dealt with on an individual basis and, where my Department judges that there may be mitigating circumstances in a case, it will moderate the penalty or recoupment as appropriate.</p></reply>

As part of this process, the Rural Development proposal (EAFRD) is being actively progressed together with the other three proposals which form the overall package. The aim of the negotiations is to reach political agreement by the end of the Irish Presidency. </p><p>  Under the current proposal, Ireland must undertake an ex ante evaluation, a public consultation, and complete a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) and a needs assessment. My Department has contracted an independent evaluator, following a public procurement process, to prepare the ex-ante evaluation report and to advise on the SWOT and drafting of the RDP for the next round. In addition, the initial consultation process has been completed with a further consultation to take place in mid July on the SWOT and needs assessment. Based on the outcome of these processes, my Department will prepare a draft programme and again engage in further consultation.</p><p>  At the present time it is intended to have a draft RDP submitted to the Commission as early as possible in 2014. This process will be interlinked with the submission by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform [DPER] of the overall Partnership Agreement which will form the framework document for EAFRD funding and the other structural funds. It is expected that a period of negotiation of several months with the Commission will follow the submission of the RDP.</p></reply>

AEOS III will build on the success of the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and both AEOS 1 and 2 in delivering an annual payment to farmers in return for farming to high environmental standards.  </p><p>  I decided on a maximum payment of &euro;4,000 per annum for individual applicants under the re-opened scheme which, on the basis of previous experience in implementing the scheme, would allow roughly 6,000 new participants to be accepted into the scheme.</p><p>  A total of 9,703 applications were received by my Department under the re-opened scheme. Based on the annual budget available and following the ranking and selection process, a total of 6,000 applicants have been approved for participation in the scheme based on the prioritised ranking and selection criteria set out in the published scheme documentation as follows:</p><p>  - Applicants within a targeted area of the Boora region of Co. Offaly who select Wild Bird Cover Option B (Grey Partridge);</p><p>  - Applicants with eligible Natura land;</p><p>  - Applicants with at least 0.5 hectares of Utilisable Agricultural Non-Natura Commonage land;</p><p>  - Farm Partnerships;</p><p>  - Previous Participation in REPS;</p><p>  - Farm Size (Favouring smaller holding) based on the utilisable agricultural area;</p><p>  - Location of farms in Less Favoured Areas.</p><p>  4,483 applicants selecting Grey Partridge, Natura and Commonage actions and Partnership farmers were approved into the scheme. The remaining 1,517 applicants approved had all previously participated in REPS and had a reference area of 22.06 ha or less on their 2012 Single Payment Scheme application.</p><p>  Because of the funding constraints and as a result of the selection process, farmers that previously participated in REPS and had a farm size bigger than 22.06 hectares were unsuccessful in their applications as were those who had not previously participated in REPS. </p><p>All approved applicants were awarded a commencement date of May 1 2013, and so their contracts will run for a period of five years and 8 months which will extend their duration beyond the expiry of the current programming period of 31<sup>st</sup>   December 2013. Participants in the scheme will be offered the opportunity to adjust their commitments for the remainder of the period of their contract to the legal framework of the next period which is currently under negotiation. If such an adjustment is not acceptable to the participant he/she may withdraw from the schemes without any requirement for reimbursement of aid already received.</p></reply>

The expenditure performance is based on the quarterly returns to the European Commission and this table reflects the position up to March 2013. Under the current approved financial plan in the Programme close on &euro;4.8Bn is allocated at programme level. This amount includes an allocation of EAFRD funding of &euro;2.49Bn and &euro;2.3Bn of Exchequer funding. Since the launch of the RDP expenditure under the programme up to the end of March 2013 amounted to &euro;3.8Bn<b>. </b>This represents close on 79% of the total value of the Programme and 85% of the EAFRD amount.   Axes 1 and 2 of the Rural Development Programme are administered by my Department while Axes 3 and 4 are delivered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. Details of the allocation and expenditure per measure per fund source under the RDP up to the end of March 2013 are set out in the table below. This table does not include funds already committed but not as yet claimed.</p><p>The programme, like all national spending, is subject to ongoing budgetary constraints but is configured to maximise all available EU funding. Spending under a number of measures may continue until the end of 2015 and this will provide considerable scope to allow all measures to spend up to their full allocation. Adjustments have already been made to the RDP financial plan and further adjustments are currently being made in order to achieve the fullest possible draw down of available funds.

This process includes the following steps:</p><p>  - a detailed data collection in 91 Bays/Estuaries;</p><p>  - detailed analysis of raw data collected;</p><p>  - setting of Conservation Objectives by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in respect of each site;</p><p>  - carrying out Appropriate Assessments of each licence application/fishery plan against the detailed Conservation Objectives set; and</p><p>  - determination of Licences/Fisheries on the basis of the Appropriate Assessment and other relevant factors.</p><p>  The data collection programme is substantially complete.  Analysis of the data, together with the setting of appropriate conservation objectives by the NPWS, will enable all new, renewal and review applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  This work represents a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State in resolving this issue.  </p><p>  While the Appropriate Assessments are carried out on a bay by bay basis, each licence application within the bay must be assessed individually.  Factors to be considered include location within the bay, species, scale etc.  In addition to the Natura requirements, under the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive all licence applications must undergo an Environmental Impact pre-screening assessment. This requires significant input from the Department's scientific and technical advisors. All applications, in compliance with the requirements of the Aarhus Directive, are advertised in order to facilitate public consultation, and submissions or observations received must be considered as part of the licence application determination process.</p><p>  Conservation objectives had been set in relation to a significant number of bays and Appropriate Assessments have been carried in four bays (Castlemaine, Dundalk, Lough Swilly and Roaringwater).  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that as a result of the above process I have made aquaculture licence Determinations in respect of applications in Castlemaine.</p><p>  The prioritised list of bays is kept under continuous review by my Department so as to facilitate the use of scientific and other resources on a flexible basis across the full range of bays including those where oyster farming takes place.</p><p>It is important for all involved in the aquaculture industry to understand that the sustainable development of the industry and the creation of long term employment from aquaculture into the future can only take place if there is full compliance with all EU and national legislation on environmental protection.  Ireland's reputation as a producer of top quality seafood is predicated on the implementation of a sound regulatory system which has the confidence of the public in general and also the EU Commission  <i>.</i></p><p>  My Department continues to make every effort to expedite the determination of aquaculture licence applications having regard to the need to comply with all relevant national and EU legislation.</p></reply>

This would mean that it was possible to know and quantify what every living thing in the entire marine ecosystem is doing at any given time - which is clearly impossible. I am responding therefore on the basis that what the Deputy is actually referring to is '<i>fully documented fisheries</i>  ' (where the activities of individual vessels are effectively monitored) and that what is being asked here is whether or not (i) fully documented fisheries; (ii) the ecosystem approach and  (iii) the precautionary approach were included in the basic regulation. I thank the Deputy for raising these important but complex aspects which I will now deal with separately.</p><p><b>(i)  Fully Documented Fisheries:</b></p><p>  The requirements for all Member States to ensure detailed and accurate documentation of fishing trips is contained in article 15.8 which stipulates that:</p><p>  - Member States shall ensure detailed and accurate documentation of all fishing trips and adequate capacity and means for the purpose of monitoring compliance with the obligation to land all catches, inter alia such means as observers, CCTV and other. In doing so, Member States shall respect the principle of efficiency and proportionality.&#8221; </p><p><b>(ii) The Ecosystem approach </b></p><p>  The requirement to consider the broader marine ecosystem is provided for in Article 2.3 of the basic regulation, which states that:</p><p>  - The Common Fisheries Policy shall implement the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management to ensure the negative impacts of fishing activities on the marine ecosystem are minimised, and shall endeavour to ensure that aquaculture and fisheries activities avoid the degradation of the marine environment.</p><p><b>(iii) The Precautionary approach</b></p><p>  The precautionary approach is provided for in Article 2 of the basic regulation, which states that:</p><p>  - &#8220;The Common Fisheries Policy shall apply the precautionary approach to fisheries management, and shall aim to ensure that exploitation of living marine  biological resources restores and maintains populations of harvested species above levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield.  This exploitation rate shall be achieved by 2015, where possible and by 2020 for all stocks at the latest.&#8221; Recital (9) provides:    &#8220;Sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources should  be based on the precautionary approach, which is to be derived from the precautionary principle referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 191(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), taking into account available scientific data.&#8221;</p><p>  It is important to bear in mind that reform of the Common Fisheries Policy has been a significant achievement for the Irish Presidency and when taken as a whole, delivers on not just a resolution to the long term difficulty of discards but also provides the means for new ways of sustainable fishing, a more transparent and competitive market, as well as empowering fishermen by giving them a central role in decision making for their fisheries.</p></reply>

The slaughter of horses for human consumption within the US ceased in 2006. I understand however that significant numbers of live horses are exported from the US for slaughter in both Canada and Mexico. Some of this meat is then exported to the EU. I am not aware that any of this meat has ended up in Ireland, where the level of consumption of horsemeat is very low. </p><p>  The Regulations relating to the import of meat from third countries are set at EU rather than at domestic level. The basic requirements for imports of meat are set out in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004. The third country of dispatch must be on an approved list for that product and the individual establishment from which the product is dispatched must also be on an approved list. These lists are published on the EU Commission&rsquo;s website. There is also a requirement that imports of meat are only allowed from countries with an approved residue monitoring plan.</p><p>  The EU Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) conducted audits in Canada (in 2011) and Mexico (in 2012). These audits raised some concerns about the identification of US horses being slaughtered in both countries and the question of compliance with standards equivalent to those provided for by EU legislation in relation to non-treatment with certain medicinal substances. </p><p>  The EU Commission is I understand in close contact with the countries involved to have the FVO audit recommendations followed up satisfactorily. </p></reply>

This number comprises of both new licence applications and applications in respect of renewal applications for existing licences.</p><p>  The backlog has developed over a period of approximately nine years and largely arises because the majority of areas for which aquaculture licences are sought are located in areas designated as Special Areas of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive and/or Special Protection Areas under the EU Birds Directive (known as &lsquo;Natura areas&rsquo;). In 2007, the European Court of Justice issued a judgement against Ireland for a breach of the Birds Directive which is indicative of the seriousness of this issue and the need for full compliance with the relevant Directives.</p><p>  To ensure compliance with the Birds and Habitats Directives, all applications in &lsquo;Natura 2000 areas&rsquo; are required to be appropriately assessed. This has required the putting in place of a significant work programme which has considerable time and resource implications. An additional factor is that all aquaculture applications now undergo Environmental Impact pre-screening assessment which requires significant input from the Department&rsquo;s scientific and technical advisors. </p><p>  My Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, is engaged in a comprehensive programme to gather the necessary baseline data appropriate to the conservation objectives of &lsquo;Natura 2000&rsquo; areas.  This data collection programme is substantially complete.  Analysis of the data, together with the setting of appropriate conservation objectives by the NPWS, will enable all new, renewal and review applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  This work represents a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State in resolving this issue.  The Appropriate Assessment of aquaculture applications is being dealt with on a bay-by-bay basis.</p><p>  It is expected that successful completion of the Appropriate Assessment process in respect of the above over the summer/early autumn period will facilitate between 180-200 licence determinations this year.</p><p>  In addition to the continued progress made in relation to Natura areas, 115 Ministerial determinations were made in 2012 in non-Natura areas.</p><p>My Department continues to make every effort to expedite the determination of all aquaculture applications having regard to the complexities of each case and the need to comply fully with all national and EU legislation  .</p></reply>

Successive EU audits have made it clear that compliance with the Regulations must be strictly adhered to and that all administrative checks must be passed and eligibility conditions met before payment issues. As a result, the Department is obliged to ensure that individual payments do not issue until all aspects of a farmer&rsquo;s application are in order, all outstanding documentation provided and all queries resolved. These administrative checks can result in the reduction of payments or the application of penalties, in cases where breaches are identified.</p><p>  Furthermore under these Regulations, on-the-spot inspections must be carried on 5% of all applications to deliver assurance that farmers are complying with the actions they contracted to carry out under the terms and conditions of the Scheme.  Any non-compliances or breaches of these conditions will result in sanctions being applied in accordance with the penalties laid down.  Farmers have the right to appeal these penalties if they feel the sanction is not warranted.</p><p>  A total of 29,500 REPS4 farmers have been paid in respect of 2012, leaving approximately 800 applicants still to receive payment.  The applicants have been written to where officials in my Department require additional information to resolve these applications. The outstanding cases are being resolved on an ongoing basis as queries are resolved. </p><p>  A total of 11,650 AEOS 1 and 2 participants have received payment for the 2012 Scheme year.  A total of 2,100 farmers are awaiting payment for 2012 under AEOS 1 and 2. Officials in my Department are processing these cases on an ongoing basis with a view to finalising them as quickly as possible and, again where additional information is required, the applicants concerned have been written to.  The majority of the outstanding AEOS issues arising relate to inaccurate or incomplete capital investment claims.  The Department continues to actively engage with farmers in these cases in order to expedite payment.</p><p>  Under REPS, participants have undertaken to deliver a number of measures and a penalty schedule applies where there is non-compliance with these measures. The severity, extent and permanence are taken into account in determining the appropriate penalty.  </p><p>  Together with the discovery of irregularities at the on the spot inspections, all applications are subject to an administrative check which can also lead to reductions. The number of applicants who had a penalty imposed to date in respect of 2012 payments was 1,795. To date, it has been established that 28 of these have a 100% penalty. </p><p>  Similarly AEOS applicants undertake to carry out certain actions that they have selected from a menu of options. Penalties are imposed where non compliances are discovered whether through on the spot inspections or through administrative checks. Under AEOS, the number of penalties applied for 2012 applications was 642, with 342 applied to AEOS 1 payments and 300 applied to AEOS 2 payments. Further penalties may be applied as outstanding cases are dealt with and resolved. While the exact number of 100% penalties has not been finalised it should be noted that 100% penalties are applied only in a small minority of cases. Such penalties would apply in respect of a most serious breach of the Scheme conditions such as in the case of non-compliance with underlying GAEC and SMR baseline standards. </p></reply>

This Scheme was fully funded by the Exchequer.  Over the five year duration of the Scheme, in excess of &euro;155 million has already been delivered in support to suckler cow farmers.  The Scheme has made an important contribution to improving the genetic quality of the national suckler herd and enhancing the welfare standards for animals produced from the suckler cow herd.  A number of outstanding cases remain to be finalised.</p><p>  Applicants undertook to carry out and notify to my Department, details of the required measures as outlined in the Terms and Conditions from their year of entry into the Scheme up to the end of 2012.  Because of the nature of the Scheme, failure to comply with its requirements in a given year could give rise to exclusion from the Scheme in subsequent years.</p><p>  Turning specifically to the 2012 tranche of the Scheme, 33,365 eligible applicants continued to participate in the Scheme.  A total of 650 of these herds were found to have no beef breed animals in their herd in 2012 and therefore are not due any payment.  Thus far, penalties ranging from 1% to 5% have been imposed on 4,204 of these applicants where a low degree of non &ndash;compliance with the requirements of the Scheme has been identified.  Some 4,909 cases remain to be finalised because a range of outstanding issues remain to be resolved.  These relate in the main to failure to provide requisite information in relation to measures taken, or where it has proved necessary to contact applicants to resolve details relating to individual animals.  </p><p>  Thus far, almost &euro;20m has been paid under the 2012 element of the Scheme and payments continue to be made as details of required measures are received and as individual issues are resolved.  </p><p>  In December last, I announced the introduction of a new Beef Data Recording Programme for beef animals born between 1 January and 31 December 2013. This Programme will build on the progress achieved under the Suckler Welfare Scheme, in particular, by continuing to provide farmers with a comprehensive database which will assist them in making their breeding decisions with the objectives of improving the quality of beef produced and the overall competitiveness of the Irish Beef industry.</p></reply>

The disease has also been confirmed at 15 horticultural nurseries, 13 roadside landscaping projects, 13 farms (REPS/AEOS), 3 garden centres and 2 private gardens. </p><p>  As a precautionary measure in order to reduce the potential spread of the disease, my Department has written to approximately 175 forest owners instructing them to remove and destroy all ash trees from sites where the disease has been confirmed, as well as from sites where the disease has not been confirmed but was planted with trees from known infected consignments.  Approximately 535 hectares of ash woodlands have been identified for removal so far.  Eradication is also being carried out under Departmental supervision at the non-forest locations (i.e. roadsides, horticultural nurseries, garden centres, AEOS/REPS farms and private gardens). </p><p>  A support scheme has been introduced for forest owners who have been instructed to remove ash trees from forests planted under the forestry grant schemes.  The Reconstitution (Chalara Ash Dieback) Scheme is providing funding to forest owners towards the cost of removing and destroying infected or potentially infected trees and replanting affected sites with alternative tree species.    </p><p>  I am conscious that ash dieback disease could potentially have serious long term effects for the hurley making industry if the disease becomes established in Ireland.  For this reason, in order to try and minimise the risk of the disease becoming established, last November I introduced legislation restricting the importation of ash plants and ash wood.  This has, in some cases, resulted in ash wood supply arrangements being changed to meet the new requirements but we understand that it has not had a significant impact on the current supply of ash to the hurley making industry.  In anticipation of any supply issues, Coillte brought forward the sale of some 40,000 hurley planks and are working with sources in the UK to import additional supplies.  </p><p>  Part of our long term strategy is to breed ash trees for resistance to the disease and my Department is involved in research efforts with our colleagues in the UK to test Irish material planted in several areas in the south east of England in heavily Chalara invested sites.  I understand that there are some positive signs around Europe of ash trees showing resistance to the disease.  </p><p>  I would like to re-emphasise that my Department is currently eradicating this disease wherever it is found.  Department officials with their Teagasc counterparts recently carried out a series of 22 meetings around the country to raise awareness of the disease and what to watch out for in order that as many people as possible are on the lookout for the disease and will report anything suspicious.  My officials are working very closely with our colleagues in Northern Ireland and I am glad to report that to date there is no confirmation of the disease spreading to the wider environment here or in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

The agreement by the European Council on the Multiannual Financial Framework on 8 February provided the necessary clarity to enable the CAP discussions to move forward. This was followed by the adoption by the European Parliament of its overall position on the reform proposals at its plenary session on 12 March. This was in turn followed by the agreement by the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 19 March on its so-called 'General Approach' to the reform package, following the tabling of compromise proposals by the Irish Presidency.   </p><p>  We have therefore moved from a narrower focus on the finalisation of a Council position to the point where the Council position is itself just one of three different perspectives being brought to the table in the so-called &#8220;trilogue&#8221; process. Typically, this represents the final phase of negotiations in areas where the European Parliament has a co-decision role. Indeed, this is the first time that the Parliament has had such a role in relation to a CAP reform package. As President of the Council, Ireland is representing Member States in these negotiations.</p><p>  I am happy to report that progress has been very good so far. The trilogues have been held in a very positive, constructive atmosphere. All of the institutions have responded to the Presidency's call for a collaborative endeavour, and for a spirit of compromise to inform the process. Progress has been achieved on a number of technical issues, facilitated by technical discussions which are running in parallel to the trilogue meetings. In addition, more politically sensitive points that have been encountered so far have been discussed in a preliminary or exploratory way in the trilogues and parked for further consideration later. In this regard I have agreed with the Chairman of the European Parliament's Agriculture Committee, Paolo de Castro, on a further parallel process aimed at making progress on the big political issues that are likely to form the basis of the final political agreement. </p><p>  The final target for that political agreement is the end of June. It is clear that the European Parliament and the Commission are committed to achieving this objective. The Member States have also demonstrated their commitment, and as President of the Council of Ministers, I intend to do all I can to ensure that the deadline is met.   I need to be clear however that the timeline for political agreement by end June is extremely tight and ambitious.  It can only be achieved with a fair wind and an exceptional effort by all three institutions.</p><p>  At the beginning of the Irish EU Presidency an ambitious and demanding work programme was set out in order to pursue a successful agreed reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). After months of intensive negotiations, agreement on a new reformed CFP was finally reached between the Irish Presidency, European Commission and the European Parliament on 30 May.  Coreper (Committee of Permanent Representatives) endorsed the texts of the CFP Reform basic regulation and the Common Market Organisation (CMO) on Friday 14 June last.  The formal political agreement of the European Parliament is expected in the coming weeks.</p><p>  This radical reform will support the rebuilding of fish stocks in our waters as Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas are set to deliver maximum sustainable yield by 2015, where possible, and by 2020 for all stocks, and the wasteful practice of discarding fish is phased out. The changes once implemented will mean real meaningful reform to the Common Fisheries Policy and will determine European fisheries policy for the next decade and beyond.</p><p>  Significant progress in a number of other legislative areas was also made during Ireland's Presidency.  Political agreement was reached on the important <i>Non-Commercial Movement of Pet Animals</i> proposals which will enable EU citizens to travel more easily within the EU with their pets. Agreement between the institutions was also reached on the so-called <i>Breakfast Omnibus</i>   package of proposals concerning several directives relating to certain foods including coffee and chicory extracts, cocoa and chocolate products and certain dehydrated milk products; these are all part of wider measures to allow EU consumers make more informed choices concerning the food they buy.  The new Farm Accountancy Data Network Regulation was also finalised.</p><p>  Following adoption by the Commission in May/early June, discussions have also commenced on what is commonly called the &#8220;<i>5-Part Package</i>&#8221;, a package consisting of 5 separate proposals on <i>Animal Health Law, Protective Measures against Pests of Plants, Plant Reproductive Material Law, Official Controls Regulation and the Regulation on Food and Feed Expenditure</i>.<font color="#004080"> </font> My officials will continue to advance these dossiers over the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Cross-compliance involves two key elements:</p><p>  - A requirement for farmers to comply with 19 Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs) set down in EU legislation on the public health, animal and plant health, animal welfare, and the environment;</p><p>  - A requirement to maintain the land in good agricultural and environmental condition </p><p>  EU regulations governing the area based schemes set minimum standards for GAEC, which must be complied with, by means of the undertaking of appropriate agricultural practices. These standards set requirements relating to the protection of soil from erosion; maintenance of soil organic matter levels; maintenance of soil structure; minimum level of maintenance and avoidance of deterioration of habitats and the protection and management of water. Farmers can keep agricultural land in GAEC by conducting an agricultural activity on it, such as grazing, harvesting forage crops, or by topping. Where a farmer chooses to keep his land in GAEC by grazing, a sufficient stocking rate must be met to ensure compliance with the required standards. </p><p>  Commonage lands form an important part of the farming enterprises of many farmers, particularly along the West Coast. They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism. However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. </p><p>  Under-grazing and, indeed, over-grazing, leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission. It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC, or where there is under-grazing, or over-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC. It is my stated aim that this will be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State Agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders. I readily acknowledge that it will not be an easy task, but it is achievable if all stakeholders work in a co-operative basis. My Department will set out proposals as to how these matters might be progressed in the near future.</p></reply>

One of its main attractions was the showcasing of 28 show gardens from the very best of Irish landscape gardeners and designers, ranging from large, medium, small gardens and concept gardens in an assortment of design styles and budget points. For the first time this year, Bloom hosted a number of specific small gardens (&ldquo;post card gardens&rdquo;) which were designed, prepared and constructed by community gardeners and gardening clubs to demonstrate their abilities and to inspire other non-professional gardeners to experience the joys and benefits of gardening. </p><p>  In addition, a comprehensive range of information and advice on a range of gardening topics was dispensed from the numerous talks by leading experts on the Garden Expert Stage over the five days of the show. Also present at Bloom were a number of organisations who provided instruction and advice on preparing a garden and &ldquo;growing your own&rdquo; vegetables and fruit. </p><p>  The &ldquo;Best in Season&rdquo; fresh fruit and vegetables produce market displayed and retailed top quality locally grown fruit, vegetables and potatoes. Bloom allows visitors to engage with local Irish producers and pick up some tips on how to cook and use the best tasting fresh produce available throughout the Irish fruit, vegetable and potato season. </p><p>  Bloom is now an important date in the calendar of many gardeners and horticulture enthusiasts. </p></reply>

As TAMS applicants generally have two years from the date of issue of Department approval to complete the investment works concerned, actual expenditure lags very significantly behind the financial commitments made in the form of approved projects by my Department under each Scheme at any particular time.

I am acutely aware due to recent weather events that some farmers may be having short-term difficulties in managing their borrowings and in my recent engagements with the banks I requested that they take a flexible approach towards extending credit to their farmer customers arising from the weather related difficulties. The banks have responded to my call for understanding and flexibility and indeed have issued advertisements in national media telling farmers that they are willing to provide short-term facilities to deal with the feed issues.</p><p>  In terms of the medium term trends of indebtedness in agriculture, Central Bank data indicates that the total stock of farm borrowing has been largely stable since the end of 2011, having fallen by &euro;1 billion from its peak of &euro;5.2 billion in early 2009 to its current level of approximately &euro;4.2 billion. While this recent reduction and subsequent stabilisation of indebtedness is positive, I feel it is also important to highlight that financial indebtedness can also be alleviated by improved productivity, enhanced skills and higher prices.  In that context, the implementation of Food Harvest 2020 has a major role to play in improving overall competitiveness at farm and industry level as well in maximising the potential contribution of this indigenous sector to economic recovery. </p><p>  I will continue to meet with relevant parties, including the Irish Banking Federation, on a regular basis to impress upon the lenders the importance of being proactive and flexible with the farming sector in addressing credit-related matters, including levels of indebtedness.</p></reply>

We have therefore moved from a narrower focus on the finalisation of a Council position to the point where the Council position is itself just one of three different perspectives being brought to the table. </p><p>  Typically, this represents the final phase of negotiations in areas where the European Parliament has a co-decision role. Indeed, this is the first time that the Parliament has had such a role in relation to a CAP reform package. As President of the Council, Ireland is representing Member States in these negotiations with the Parliament and the Commission.</p><p>  I am happy to report that progress has been very good so far. The trilogues have been held in a very positive, constructive atmosphere. All of the institutions have responded to the Presidency&rsquo;s call for a collaborative endeavour, and for a spirit of compromise to inform the process. Good progress has been made on a substantial number of technical issues and we are now in the &ldquo;end-game&rdquo; where we are considering the important and politically sensitive points. </p><p>  I said from the start of the Irish Presidency that the final target for political agreement was the end of June. It is clear that the European Parliament and the Commission are committed to achieving this objective. The Member States have also demonstrated their commitment, and as President of the Council of Ministers, I intend to do all I can to ensure that the deadline is met.   </p><p>  I need to be clear however that the timeline for political agreement by end June is extremely tight and ambitious.  It can only be achieved with a fair wind and an exceptional effort by all three institutions.</p></reply>

Under this strategy, capturing is undertaken only in areas where an epidemiological investigation carried out by the Department&rsquo;s Veterinary Inspectorate has found that badgers are the likely source of infection and capturing takes place under licence issued by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Despite considerable research in both Ireland and the U.K., no test on live badgers has proven efficacious in reliably detecting TB infected badgers and thus it is not possible to determine whether a badger is infected with TB prior to culling. </p><p>  The culling programme is undertaken by trained Farm Relief Service contractors as humanely as possible and is monitored and supervised by staff from my Department. The Farm Relief Service staff label and identify the badger carcasses but no further information is gathered at this point. Samples for culture are harvested from a selection (50%) of badgers annually with a view to establishing the general level of infection in culled badgers. The badger carcases are disposed of by rendering.</p><p>  There has been a very significant improvement in the Bovine TB situation in Ireland since the introduction of an enhanced badger removal programme in the early part of the last decade. Cattle herd incidence has fallen from 7.5% in 2000 to 4.1% in 2012. The number of TB reactors has declined from 40,000 to 18,500 during the same period. This is the lowest recorded since the commencement of the TB eradication programme in the 1950s. While it is difficult to quantify the precise impact of badger culling on the incidence of TB in Ireland, my Department believes that much of the improvement in the TB situation in cattle is in fact due to the badger removal programme. It is noteworthy that a recent peer-reviewed study, Bovine tuberculosis trends in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, 1995&ndash;2010 (Abernethy et al., 2013), published in the Veterinary Record, found that, during the period studied, the animal incidence of TB increased by 380% in England, by 190% in Wales and by 74% in Northern Ireland. On the other hand, the animal incidence in Ireland fell by 32% in the same period. </p><p>  The low incidence of TB over the past 4 years in particular is encouraging and indicates that the incidence has moved permanently to a new low level. The incidence of TB in 2013 is running at about 10% below the levels recorded in 2012. The badger culling programme has brought about a situation where, for the first time since the programme was introduced in the 1950&rsquo;s, eradication is now a practicable proposition.</p></reply>

This process includes the following steps: a detailed data collection in 91 Bays/Estuaries;  detailed analysis of raw data collected; setting of Conservation Objectives by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in respect of each site; carrying out Appropriate Assessments of each licence application/fishery plan against the detailed Conservation Objectives set; and determination of Licences/Fisheries on the basis of the Appropriate Assessment and other relevant factors.</p><p>  The data collection programme is substantially complete.  Analysis of the data, together with the setting of appropriate conservation objectives by the NPWS, will enable all new, renewal and review applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  This work represents a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State in resolving this issue.  </p><p>  While the Appropriate Assessments are carried out on a bay by bay basis, each licence application within the bay must be assessed individually.  Factors to be considered include location within the bay, species, scale etc.  In addition to the Natura requirements, under the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive all licence applications must undergo an Environmental Impact pre-screening assessment.  This requires significant input from the Department&rsquo;s scientific and technical advisors.  All applications, in compliance with the requirements of the Aarhus Directive, are advertised in order to facilitate public consultation, and submissions or observations received must be considered as part of the licence application determination process.</p><p>  Conservation objectives had been set in relation to a significant number of bays and Appropriate Assessments have been carried in four bays (Castlemaine, Dundalk, Lough Swilly and Roaringwater).  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that as a result of the above process I have made aquaculture Determinations in respect of applications in Castlemaine.</p><p>  My Department continues to make every effort to expedite the determination of aquaculture licence applications having regard to the need to comply with all relevant national and EU legislation.</p></reply>

Funding for operating, management and development costs in the fishery harbours is ring-fenced in the Fishery Harbour Centres Fund, which is the only source of revenue available for that purpose.  </p><p>  Capital investment in the Fishery Harbour Centres in recent years has underpinned both fisheries activities and their expanding use for leisure and marine tourism and other maritime enterprises.  The House will appreciate that, in the current economic climate, the State must be fully committed to maximising the return on that investment.  Moreover, my Department is required to ensure that the Fishery Harbour Centres are run on a financially-sound basis.  The 500+ parking spaces within the boundaries of the Harbour would assist in balancing the books, and in providing funding for re-investment that would not otherwise be available.</p><p>  A wide range of groups use the parking facilities of Howth Fishery Harbour &ndash; harbour business customers, yacht club members, sport fishermen, Dart users, tourists, walkers and many others.  This combination of uses and the range of users of the Harbour brings its own inherent dangers and safety must be a paramount consideration.  A consequence of the large volume of cars using the Fishery Harbour Centre has been huge pressure on parking, and that pressure has on a number of occasions led to a situation where emergency access to the Harbour area has been seriously compromised.  The Harbour authorities have in the past received specific complaints from elements of the emergency services in that regard - fortunately no serious incident has arisen yet.</p><p>  There was widespread public consultation when pay parking at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre was originally examined in detail in 2007 in conjunction with Fingal County Council.  All of the various views that were expressed and submissions that were made then are still available and I am well aware of and acknowledge their concerns.  I have been getting new correspondence on this matter from a wide range of harbour users.  My officials have consulted with officials of Fingal Council, and with An G&aacute;rda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about this and related matters, and my Department&rsquo;s engineers have met some of the Harbour&rsquo;s business tenants individually about new traffic management and road markings etc.  My officials also attended the Harbour Users Forum in February where pay parking was on the agenda and heard the views of the harbour users at first hand.</p><p>  I am examining all aspects of the matter at present.  I can assure the House that the views of the various harbour users, the potential earnings, the possible impact on the harbour businesses that the Deputy has mentioned and on recreational users, the impact on the local economy and local jobs, and the impact on overall traffic management within the Fishery Harbour, are all matters that I will take into account in coming to a decision.  I can also assure the House and all of the Harbour users in Howth that I am committed to continuing investment in and development of Howth for the future.</p></reply>

The basis of both these checks is laid down in the governing EU Regulations.  The administrative checks and systems validations confirm compliance with a variety of requirements, including confirming that the application was received on time, that the land declared by the applicant was not also claimed by another Scheme applicant, that the necessary minimum stocking density levels have been achieved, etc. Failure to respect one or more of these Scheme requirements must result in a penalty be applied.</p><p>The annual round of field inspections covers both the eligibility of the land declared to draw down payments and also cross compliance aspects, to ensure compliance with EU regulatory requirements in the areas of public, animal and plant health, environment and animal welfare. These inspections are mandatory and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must take place annually.  Land eligibility inspection (either on-farm or by remote sensing) must be carried out on at least 5% of applicants. These checks are carried out to verify that the actual area claimed in the application form corresponds to the area farmed by the farmer and to ensure that any ineligible land or features are not included for aid purposes. In order to be eligible to draw down EU funding, it is a requirement that all land eligibility inspections must take place before any payments can issue to any farmer in the country in a given year.</p><p>Some 123,363 cases paid have been paid to date delivering over &euro;1.2bn to farmers in respect of the 2012 Single payment Scheme.

As part of this process, roadmaps are to be developed for a number of sectors, including agriculture. My Department has commenced work on the development of a sectoral roadmap for agriculture, and has had discussions with Teagasc with regard to the provision of research and advice to inform this work.</p><p>  The roadmap for agriculture will take into account the targets in the industry&rsquo;s Food Harvest 2020 strategy as well as the existing mitigation commitments. However, it is important that the roadmap will also outline a longer term view and will seek to balance the objectives of allowing the food industry to grow so as to meet the food security challenges that face the world; as well as the need to meet future climate change ambition.  Irish agriculture has already achieved significant progress in production efficiency including the use of fertiliser and manure, grassland management, improved breeding and better fertility. The level of emissions from agriculture has been steadily decreasing in recent years and my Department will continue to work with state and industry stakeholders so as seek even greater future efficiencies in a sustainable Irish agriculture sector.</p><p>  The Food Harvest High Level Implementation Committee decided that an independent environmental analysis of Food Harvest 2020 should be carried out on various scenarios by which the industry targets in the strategy might be achieved. This work commenced in April 2012, and the draft report is currently being prepared for an eight week public consultation which will commence in the coming weeks.  In consultation with the Environment Directorate General of the European Commission, the process has closely followed what would be required for a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and for an Appropriate Assessment (AA) in so  far as  the impacts of the possible scenarios  are measurable at such a high level or on a national basis.</p><p>  The analysis has examined the following critical environmental factors : biodiversity, flora and fauna, water quality including drinking water, soil, air quality, landscape and buildings, and climatic factors including greenhouse gas emissions.  On its completion, following the period of public consultation, the report will be very valuable in informing development of the agriculture sectoral roadmap. It will also provide important guidance to the HLIC and to all actors in the agriculture sector in relation to future plans for implementation of the high-level targets in Food Harvest 2020.</p></reply>

Exports in 2012 were valued at &euro;26 million, 83% up on 2010 (&euro;14 million) including an 86% increase in the value of exports to China (from &euro;4.1 million to &euro;7.7 million).  South Korea, China, Japan and Hong Kong together accounted for 95% of export value in 2012. </p><p>  My Department&rsquo;s agencies are working closely with the seafood industry on developing the Asian market and in particular, China, where the demand for premium seafood continues to grow and to outpace production.  Ireland is well placed to capitalise on the opportunity offered by rising incomes and increased spending on dining out by Chinese consumers on quality product. </p><p>  Trade research by Bord Bia identified potential customers in China for boarfish, a new species for which Ireland has a significant quota of ca 57,000 tonnes and together with BIM is developing the market for whole boarfish for human consumption and a range of minced formats for the catering trade. </p><p>  Scale is being developed through companies&rsquo; collaborations and joint ventures as well as investment in seafood processing and competitiveness.  BIM is focusing in particular on China and facilitating joint ventures between key Irish seafood companies.  Joint ventures enable these companies to pool resources, reduce duplication and logistic costs and develop scale in the market to ensure effective market presence and service to customers.  During 2012, two joint ventures were formed between leading Irish seafood companies :</p><p>  Ocean Jade &ndash; a Joint Venture between, Sofrimar, Shellfish De La Mer, Carrs and McBride Fishing and Atlantic Gold &ndash; a Joint Venture between Rockabill Shellfish and Atlanfish.</p><p>  The joint ventures have developed commercial structures with sales and marketing personnel operating on the ground in China and results are very encouraging.</p><p>  Bord Bia operates programmes to assist Irish seafood processors in identifying new customers.  12 companies representing processors from the salmon, shellfish and pelagic sectors, will be represented in the Irish Pavilion at the China Fisheries Show, the largest seafood specialist show in Asia, in November.  A pilot for 4 Irish seafood companies in 2011 resulted in new orders and 12 companies attended in 2012.  Bord Bia works with Irish processors with retail listings in China to inform consumers through in-store tastings and leaflets in Chinese on the species, health benefits and recipe ideas on Irish seafood and also with the Chinese media and chefs.  Chinese and Japanese customers are encouraged to visit Ireland and have been invited to the September conference - &lsquo;Our Food Our Future, Sustainability: The Bottom Line&rsquo;.  Client companies are provided with individual services and tailored itineraries.  Bord Bia Marketing Fellowships give seafood companies an opportunity for a dedicated resource in China.  Two companies now employ their Fellow full time and the next Programme commencing in July will see seafood companies benefit in China and Japan.</p><p>  Food Harvest 2020 has set a goal of increasing the value of the seafood sector by &euro;50 million by 2013 and by &euro;100 million by 2015.  This will require a scaled Irish seafood industry and BIM is promoting an integrated approach to value-added growth with the priorities of expanding the raw material base, maximising the value of raw material through market-led innovation, new product development, branding and eco-certification and developing scale through collaborations and joint ventures, investment in seafood processing and competitiveness. </p><p>  For my part, I consider that the positive outcome of the Irish Presidency in relation to the Common Fisheries Policy provides strong support for the sustainable growth of the seafood sector. </p></reply>

In conjunction with the Joint Research Centre, the EU Commission has proposed a system for designation for the next round which is based on eight biophysical criteria which must be met at a certain threshold level.  These criteria relate to (1) low temperature, (2) dryness, (3) excess soil moisture, (4) limited soil drainage, (5) unfavourable texture and stoniness, (6) shallow rooting depth (7) poor chemical properties and (8) steep slope. In addition 10% of a Member State&rsquo;s territory may be designated as areas facing specific constraint without the need to meet the biophysical criteria.</p><p>  The new method of designation is included in the current Rural Development proposal under the CAP reform package.  This is a co-decision dossier requiring the agreement of both the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. </p><p>  The Commission proposed that the new regime would apply from 2014 with provision for degressive payments until 2017 where Member States have not completed the new designation system by 2014.  The Council of Ministers took the view that the commencement date for the new regime should be deferred to 2016.  It also proposed a number of changes to the qualification thresholds and the cumulation options needed to meet these thresholds.  The European Parliament proposed detaching this issue from the CAP reform discussions and proposed that the EU Commission present a revised proposal by 31 December 2014.</p><p>  The negotiations on reform of the CAP are now the subject of inter-institutional debate in a process of trilogues and it is the outcome of this debate that will determine when the new areas of natural constraint will be designated and the final conditions attaching to such designation.  </p><p>  I am hopeful that we will secure political agreement on CAP reform between the three institutions by the end of this month. </p></reply>

As Minister with responsibility for sea fisheries in Ireland, I directed and co-ordinated the Irish position on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and other issues that were considered by Council. </p><p>  The Irish Government were also represented during this time by experienced senior officials from both my own Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The reforms agreed under the new CFP, secured after many months of complex negotiations with the European Parliament, represent a significant achievement for the Irish EU Presidency team and will be of great benefit in securing a more stable, profitable and secure future for our fishermen and coastal communities dependant on fishing. </p><p>  The reform of the CFP will support the rebuilding of fish stocks in our waters as Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas are set to deliver maximum sustainable yield by 2015, where possible and by 2020 for all stocks and the wasteful practice of discarding fish is phased out. The reform will also, for the first time facilitate real and meaningful regional decision making under the CFP and will give stakeholders a greater say in how their fisheries are managed.  The changes once implemented will mean, real, meaningful reform of the Common Fisheries Policy and will determine European fisheries policy for the next decade and beyond.</p></reply>

This is a significant achievement in the context of the very difficult economic conditions facing the country. We have allocated a total of &euro;622 million for ODA for 2013.

On the contrary, such a step runs the clear risk of contributing to further violence and militarisation of the conflict as well as initiating an arms race in and outside Syria, with daunting consequences for the stability and security of the wider region.    Ireland&rsquo;s view remains that what is now required is a strategy of de-escalation of the violence in Syria and the pursuit of wide-ranging diplomatic efforts aimed at bringing all sides to the negotiating table to agree on a political solution to the crisis. Ireland and the EU have expressed their full support to the recent US-Russia initiative to convene an international conference on Syria (Geneva II) with a view to mapping out a genuine transition towards democracy in Syria. In its May 27 Conclusions, the Foreign Affairs Council, which I attended, urged both sides to respond positively to the US-Russia initiative and to engage openly in a genuine process of negotiation. It also reaffirmed that the EU will spare no effort in helping to create the appropriate conditions for a successful convening of the conference.</p><p>  Ireland will continue to work with all European and international partners, including the US, towards achieving a peaceful political settlement of the Syrian crisis and towards mobilising all possible assistance on the part of the international community to address the appalling humanitarian crisis.</p></reply>

The European Council on 13-14 December 2012 adopted conclusions inviting the High Representative, notably through the European External Action Service and the European Defence Agency, as well as the Commission, all acting in accordance with their respective responsibilities and cooperating closely as required, to develop further proposals and actions to strengthen CSDP and improve the availability of the required civilian and military capabilities, and to report on such initiatives, at the latest by September 2013, with a view to the December 2013 European Council. The European Council underlined three issues: increasing the effectiveness, visibility and impact of CSDP; enhancing the development of defence capabilities; and strengthening Europe&rsquo;s defence industry. Discussions on these three areas have been ongoing during the Irish Presidency of the European Council at ministerial and official level. Last month my colleague the Minister for Defence hosted a seminar in Dublin the theme of which was December&rsquo;s European Council. At the May Foreign Affairs Council, Foreign Ministers had a discussion on CSDP in the context of preparations for December&rsquo;s European Council. During that discussion I highlighted the importance of providing a clear foreign policy direction to the December European Council discussions, and to ensuring that the EU had the capabilities it needed to carry out its activities under CSDP. I also stressed that the role of civilian CSDP Missions should form a component of discussions at the European Council.    High Representative Ashton will produce report on these initiatives by September and the European Commission will issue a Communication on a Global Strategy for strengthening Europe&rsquo;s Defence Industry shortly.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-19a.206.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061900074#WRJ01300"><p>The position is that where a couple is cohabiting, rather than married or in a civil partnership, they are treated as separate and unconnected individuals for the purposes of income tax.  Each partner is a separate entity for tax purposes and, therefore, cohabiting couples cannot file joint assessment tax returns or share their tax credits and tax bands in the same manner as married couples.  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980), which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.</p><p>  However, a cohabiting couple where both partners are working get, in total, the same tax credits as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership (i.e. &euro;3,300).  In addition, the same amount of income is subject to tax at the 20% rate (i.e. &euro;32,800 each).  This equates to the &euro;65,600 threshold in the case of a married couple or couple in a civil partnership.</p><p>  If both cohabitants earn in excess of the standard rate band (i.e. &euro;32,800), then they both pay tax at 41% on any income in excess of &euro;32,800.  Married couples or couples in a civil partnership where both individuals work get the same treatment.</p><p>  The difference between the two groups in relation to income tax is the ability of married couples or civil partners to transfer certain tax credits such as the personal/married credits and part of the tax bands, i.e. the tax band of &euro;65,600 available to married couples or couples in a civil partnership with two incomes in 2013 is transferable between spouses up to a maximum of &euro;41,800.  This is of benefit where one of the individuals earns less than the 20% tax threshold of &euro;32,800 or where one of the individuals has no income.</p><p>  The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Protection. However, it is also based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples.  This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.</p></reply>

The levy will operate for a period of 4 years only (2011 to 2014) and the legislative provisions giving effect to the levy (section 4 of Finance (No 2) Act 2011) were specifically drafted to reflect this. I confirmed in my Budget 2013 Speech that the levy will not be renewed after 2014.</p><p>  Although not formally ring fenced for a specific purpose, the moneys raised from the pension fund levy are being used to pay for the Government's <i>Jobs Initiative </i>introduced<i></i>in May 2011. The measures introduced as part of the <i>Jobs Initiative</i> include a new 9% VAT rate on certain activities, the halving of the lower rate of PRSI and small amounts of additional current and capital expenditure.</p><p>  The implementation of a jobs and growth strategy is a key priority of the Government. The measures announced in the <i>Jobs Initiative</i> are aimed at assisting in employment generation - providing opportunities for those who are out of work, to restore public morale and confidence in the economy and encourage spending by consumers.</p><p>  The chargeable persons for the levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) having the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans. The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.</p><p>  However, the legislation also includes safeguards aimed at ensuring that benefits payable, either currently or prospectively to any member, are adjusted in such a way that the reduction in value of those benefits shall not exceed 0.6% of the market value of the assets accounting for the scheme's liabilities to that member.</p><p>  I am conscious of the concerns of pension scheme members about the impact of a levy in circumstances where the pensions sector, in common with other sectors in our economy and society, is finding the current economic and financial environment very challenging.</p><p>  However, much of the value of pension funds is attributable to the rolled up value of generous tax reliefs that pension savings have historically been granted and continue to receive. To the extent that these pension funds are represented by investments outside the State, the State does not get the benefit from these investments. It does not imply that if the pension fund were invested in the State or in Irish Government bonds that they would not be levied.</p><p>  The purpose of the pension fund levy is to improve the economic environment by providing the means to encourage job creation in areas of our economy most likely to deliver that employment quickly.</p></reply>

Primary issuance is arranged by these syndicates who contact potential investors and advise the bond issuer in terms of timing, tenor and pricing of the bond issue. The bond issuer will likely have little knowledge of the original owners of the bonds; also these initial investors may over time sell the bonds to other investors.   I have been advised that the bank has no means of establishing the underlying ownership of these securities which are freely tradable once issued. These securities are publicly traded and dealt through market participants and settled by clearing house systems. An issuer does not have any access to the records of the clearing house. At maturity, the Bank will instruct its paying agent to transfer the funds due to the clearing house who will then distribute the funds to the holders of the securities as per their records. Even where the bank is presented with lists alleging to represent names of bondholders I am informed there is no way for the bank or anyone else to verifying the veracity of such lists. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-19a.228.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061900075#WRK00800"><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners who have responsibility for the collection of mineral oil tax that they are very mindful of the threat that fuel laundering poses both to the exchequer and to legitimate businesses.  Revenue has made action against fuel laundering one of its priorities and is implementing a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem.  This strategy included strengthening the licensing conditions for auto-fuel traders in 2011 and the introduction of a new licensing system for marked fuel traders last October. In addition, since January, all licenced fuel traders are required to make electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions each month. These measures are designed to make it difficult for fuel criminals to source marked fuel for laundering and to get laundered product onto the market.   Analysis of the monthly returns of fuel trading will enable Revenue to identify suspicious or anomalous fuel transactions and patterns of distribution. Analysis of the first few months of returns data is well advanced and traders involved in suspicious activity will be investigated and if they are unable to account properly for the source or disposal of product will face revocation of their licence, tax assessment and prosecution where appropriate.    In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs in the UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding in May 2012 on a joint approach to finding a more effective marker for use in both jurisdictions. A number of proposals for a new marker submitted in response to an Invitation to Make Submissions are currently being evaluated. The outcome of this process is expected later this year.</p><p>  Revenue, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, continues to intensify enforcement action against fuel fraud. Revenue's strategy has already yielded significant results to date. In the past two years 97 filling stations throughout the State were closed for breaches of licensing conditions. Since the beginning of 2010, over 2.5 million<font color="#0000FF"> </font>  litres of fuel have been seized and 29 oil laundries detected and closed down, including 5 oil laundries in 2013 to date.   </p><p>  I strongly support the work of Revenue in tackling diesel laundering and a critical step in tackling this trade is to close down the supply chain and the retail outlets that sell washed diesel. Revenue has worked closely with the industry in developing and implementing its current strategy.  The legitimate retail trade can also contribute to closing down this illegitimate trade by providing information on the outlets that are selling washed diesel.</p><p>  If the Deputy has more detailed information in relation to fuel laundering in the Tralee area mentioned he should forward it to the Revenue Commissioners. Revenue chairs the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group (HEMG) and has established Regional sub-groups of the HEMG to facilitate the reporting of information by traders through their representative associations. If the local retailers have suspicions or evidence that laundered diesel is being sold in the area they should report this through their representative associations to the Revenue. Such reports are treated as confidential and are fully investigated by Revenue.</p></reply>

They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape. As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools is being gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014. In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement. The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible. If amalgamations do take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by the Department.</p><p>  How best to sustain provision for widely dispersed and small Protestant communities does present as a particular challenge especially in any locality where enrolment in their schools is declining to single figures and amalgamation is not an option because there is no other school nearby. The Government is intent in fostering pluralism in school provision. Supporting minority churches in maintaining their schools is part of that policy.</p><p>  A Value for Money examination of small schools is almost complete and my Department expects to publish the analysis and findings in the near future. I hope that this report will foster constructive engagement both in the Oireachtas and among all interested parties in looking at the challenges ahead and how best to make provision for primary education in rural and dispersed communities. My Department and I will continue to engage with the relevant education sector stakeholders, including the Church of Ireland, in relation to education provision for all areas.</p><p>  In addition to this my Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the schools that are affected by the budget measure. In this regard small schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting sustainable increased enrolments in September 2013 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term. </p><p>  The detailed arrangements in relation to the appeals process are set in the Department's Staffing Circular 0013/2013. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p></reply>

Such qualifying independent TDs are currently entitled to an annual rate of &euro;41,152. A similar provision in the Act provides for an annual payment, currently amounting to &euro;23,383, for independent Senators.  In the context of the Expenditure Estimates for 2013, I announced that a 10% reduction will be applied to the Party Leaders Allowance rates payable to qualifying leaders of political parties and to qualifying independent Members.  Under the legislation, a qualifying leader of a party is required to prepare a statement of expenditure for the Party Leaders allowance, have it audited by an independent auditor and furnish it with the auditor&rsquo;s report to the Standards in Public Office (SIPO) Commission, who report to the Minister and to the Oireachtas.  Allowances paid to independent members are not currently subject to these oversight provisions.  I also announced my intention to amend the legislation to improve the transparency of the Allowance by providing for auditing provisions to apply to independent Members in receipt of such payments.</p><p>I have taken the opportunity to conduct a comprehensive review of the Allowance and a consultation process has been undertaken with leaders of qualifying parties, qualifying independent members and with the Standards in Public Office Commission.  On foot of that review, I intend to bring proposals to Government very shortly on necessary amendments to the legislation underpinning the Allowance, including amendments to implement the measures I have already announced.</p></reply>

Artworks commissioned and purchased by the OPW from 2003 to end 2012 were funded in the main through the Government's Per Cent for Art Scheme.  98% of the State Art Collection is on display in State buildings throughout Ireland.</p><p>The OPW manages the State Art Collection which is an unique entity that has been formed over considerable years for display in a wide variety of locations nationwide.  The overall financial value of the Collection cannot be easily estimated because of its diverse nature.  It contains artworks that are of national and historic significance and contemporary works by emerging artists in the early stages of their careers.  In line with other national collections (such as that of the National Gallery of Ireland) a financial valuation has not been placed on the Collection as a whole.  Financial valuations are only undertaken on individual artworks when there is a need for commercial insurance for exhibition by other organisations.</p><p>Many of the contemporary art works purchased and commissioned in recent years under the Per Cent for Art scheme are of relatively low financial value in terms of the international art market.  In recent times, works have been acquired from artists living and working in Ireland who are in the early to mid stages of their careers.  All of the large-scale contemporary art works in the Collection were commissioned under the Government's Per Cent for Art Scheme and as these large-scale works are site specific, their commercial value is difficult to ascertain in the current art market.</p><p>Many of the works in the Collection form an unique part of Irish history such as the portrait series of former Presidents on display in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in or they are works which are part of the historic fabric of a building, such as the 17th century portrait series in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham.  Works by graduates are of relatively low financial value but they are of huge value in educating and enriching the experience of visiting a public building.  Many of these works will be considered important works in the future and it is with this considered long term view that OPW continues to support the work of artists through the Government's Per Cent for Art Scheme.</p><p>Per Cent for Art</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Per Cent for Art Expenditure Commissioned projects and art works purchased<br />&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>593,182</td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>769,871</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>578,585</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>574,872</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>623,847</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>637,933</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>642,008</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>455,210</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>376,948</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>450,639</td></tr></table></p></reply>

It is imposed in such a way that increasing rates of deduction are applied to increasing bands or slices of an affected public servant's annual pay.  The PRD originally became operative on 1 March 2009 as provided for in section 2 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. Soon afterwards, the PRD rates and bands were changed by section 13 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2009. The resultant amended annual PRD rates and bands, which took effect on 1 May 2009 and which continue to apply today, are as follows:</p><p>First &euro; 15,000 of earnings: exempt</p><p>Earnings between &euro; 15,000 and &euro; 20,000: 5%</p><p>Earnings between &euro; 20,000 and &euro; 60,000: 10%</p><p>Earnings above &euro; 60,000: 10.5%</p><p>  Based on these currently applicable PRD rates, the amounts of PRD arising at a series of annual pay points up to and including &euro;60,000 are as follows:</p><p>Pay of &euro;15,000: No PRD</p><p>Pay of &euro;20,000: PRD of &euro;250</p><p>Pay of &euro;25,000: PRD of &euro;750   </p><p>Pay of &euro;30,000: PRD of &euro;1,250   </p><p>Pay of &euro;35,000: PRD of &euro;1,750   </p><p>Pay of &euro;40,000: PRD of &euro;2,250   </p><p>Pay of &euro;45,000: PRD of &euro;2,750   </p><p>Pay of &euro;50,000: PRD of &euro;3,250</p><p>Pay of &euro;55,000: PRD of &euro;3,750</p><p>Pay of &euro;60,000: PRD of &euro;4,250</p><p>  These PRD money impacts at specified pay levels will, for all annual pay figures at or above &euro;20,000, be &euro;125 less per year with effect from 1 January 2014.  This change is due to section 11 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, which, effective 1 January 2014, reduces the PRD rate on the &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 pay band from 5% to 2.5%.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. Currently, there are approximately 85,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for 2013.</p><p>  There has been no change in policy concerning the treatment of joint custody households for rent supplement purposes.  Every claim for rent supplement is determined having regard to the particular circumstances of the applicant. Any person seeking a rent supplement must first satisfy the Department&rsquo;s representative that they have a housing need that they are unable to meet from their own resources. In addition, the Department must be satisfied that the residence is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant. The Department must also be satisfied that the rent payable is reasonable having regard to the nature, character and location of the residence.</p><p>  Where parents have joint custody of a child, the needs of both parents to have adequate accommodation are taken into account when an application for a rent supplement is being determined, including any obligations placed by the courts. In such cases, documentation is normally required showing that a joint custody arrangement is in place and being availed of before a decision can be made.</p></reply>

I am determined that the Youth Guarantee be implemented as quickly and effectively as possible and will this week lead discussions at EPSCO designed to ensure that each country develops a robust implementation plan and that the provision of EU funding is front loaded over the next two years.</p><p>  In leading these discussions, I am particularly conscious that the scale of the provision required to deliver the Youth Guarantee in Ireland is likely to be large relative to current provision, and the costs involved are therefore likely to be substantial.  Issues will therefore arise as to how a guarantee is to be financed and over what period, given the fiscal constraints currently facing the country.</p><p>  I am also conscious that if the Youth Guarantee is to be delivered in an effective manner, it will also be important to take the time to learn the lessons from the initial rollout of the Youth Guarantee Scheme (YGS).  It is hoped for example, that there will be early lessons from the Ballymun Project that will guide the nationwide rollout of the YGS.</p><p>  An implementation plan is due to be finalised by the end of the year, and this will set out a timescale for implementation.  In the meantime, the Ballymun Pilot if approved by the EU council is expected to start in October.</p></reply>

The latest communication from the Commission has intimated that a decision on proposals will be made by the end of this month.  Hence, if approved, the Ballymun pilot can be expected to start in October.  The various stakeholders will be brought together during the initial meetings of the National Steering Group and the Local Implementation Group, which will take place during the period July - September.</p><p>  With regard to evaluation of the pilot scheme, the Department of Social Protection (DSP) will issue a request for tenders to retain the appropriate evaluation and monitoring service.  All stakeholders have an expressed interest in identifying and capturing lessons for policy and practice as a result of their involvement in the Youth Guarantee Scheme (YGS) pilot.  The learning will be used to inform their own organisations and members of the lessons and issues raised by the pilot.</p><p>  The external independent evaluator will be asked to assess: <i>Quality of delivery of activities/tasks:</i> a quality system will be developed to ensure appraisal of on-going tasks by each partner during the piloting of the model.  <i>Partnership and Communications:</i> the main factors making the partnership successful, the factors making for cooperation within the partnership etc.  <i>Outcomes and Impact:</i> Questionnaires and administrative records will be used to assess the outputs, outcomes and impact of the pilot YGS for the participants and the partner organisations.  Focus groups and questionnaires will be used to determine the qualitative aspects of the learning coming from the pilot.</p><p>  With regards to the transfer of lessons learned from the pilot, a dissemination conference will be organised to highlight the outcomes of the pilot and to feed into the national and EU discussion on the development of future YGS that are relevant to young people and labour market integration.  A documentary account of the programme is a central objective of the DSP to capture learning and ensure that the lessons are distilled and disseminated into mainstream policy formulation.</p><p>  With regards the involvement of youth organisations, the  Ballymun proposal includes both a national and local partnership structure to manage implementation and both youth organisations and organisations which deliver services to young people will have a central role to play in both national and local structures.</p><p>  The National Steering Group will consist of a representative from Department Of Social Protection (Chair), the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI).

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs currently administers the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme and the Childcare Employment and Training Support Scheme (CETS).  CCS funds some 1,000 community-based non-profit child care facilities nationwide to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to disadvantaged and low-income families who avail of their services.  The scheme is available to social welfare recipients and to non-jobseekers if they have low incomes.  CETS is implemented by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on behalf of F&Aacute;S and the VECs.  Under this scheme, parents who are F&Aacute;S/VEC trainees and who need assistance with child care costs to access education and training courses in order to enter or return to employment, can access subsidised child care places.</p><p>  As a result of the reforms to the one-parent family payment (OFP) scheme, once an OFP recipient's youngest child reaches the relevant age threshold, they will no longer be entitled to the OFP payment.  It is expected that the majority of individuals who will continue to have an income support need will apply for either the jobseeker's allowance (JA) scheme or the recently announced jobseeker's allowance transition (JST) arrangement.</p><p>  The JST arrangement will cater for OFP recipients who will lose their entitlement to the OFP payment, who have a<b></b>youngest child aged under 14 years, and who are entitled to the JA payment.  These customers will be exempt from certain JA conditionalities that require them to be available for and genuinely seeking full-time work.  This in turn reduces the need for child care support for these customers as they will have the option of remaining in the home to take care of their children.</p><p>  Lone parents who have an entitlement to jobseekers and who have children under 14 years of age, who are attending primary school, may wish to avail of the subsidised after-school child care scheme.  This scheme is available to jobseekers that avail of an employment opportunity.  Lone parents will also be able to apply for the other Department of Children and Youth Affairs childcare schemes.</p><p>  In addition to these supports lone parents who lose entitlement to their OFP payment and who are working 19 hours or more per week, can apply for the family income supplement (FIS).  If they are eligible for FIS they can also apply for the existing D/CYA childcare schemes.</p></reply>

The change process is ongoing and the Department is committed to the maintaining and improving the programme.  The overall number of places available under community employment has been increased by 2,000 to 25,300 (including supervisors) in 2013 with a budget of circa &euro;352 million.  The composition of participant numbers has changed in recent years with a decline in One Parent Family Clients and an increase in take-up by persons on Jobseeker's Allowance.  The change in participation composition has proved challenging for some sponsors and the Department is working with these sponsors to assist them in filling the places already assigned to them.  The number of approved places on the Community After Schools Project has remained at 39 for the last three project years.  The Local Intreo Office has undertaken a special initiative to ensure eligible persons for community employment are made aware of the opportunities on community employment.  It is anticipated that this initiative will help raise the demand for community employment in the area.  The Department continues its commitment to getting people back to work as set out in the Programme for Government and the Pathways to Work documents.  This additional allocation includes a priority being given to applicants who are referred to a community employment drugs rehabilitation places, child care and social care.  The take-up of community employment places will be closely monitored.  The Department is committed to reforming community employment to ensure value for money, progression of the job seeker and support for community services.</p></reply>

It is normal practice that the customer is given the opportunity either to obtain the information him/herself directly from the financial institution or, alternatively, they can provide a mandate authorising a Social Welfare Inspector to obtain the information directly from the financial institution. Detailed statistics are not available about these requests to banks as this is a standard operational practice which is carried out as part of social assistance claim investigations.</p><p>  The Programme for Government commits to a zero tolerance approach towards social welfare fraud.  The Department&rsquo;s Fraud Initiative 2011 &ndash; 2013 further articulates this overarching policy objective.  A key priority is to ensure that fraudulent activity within the social welfare system is vigorously prevented and combatted. The approach is one which is aimed at highlighting the rights but, importantly, also the responsibilities of social welfare recipients. </p><p>  Section 17 of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act 2009 amended the Social Welfare Consolidation Act and included provision for the appointment of authorised officers who, in certain circumstances and with the consent of a designated officer, have the power to obtain information from financial institutions without the consent of the customer.  This provision was operationalised in June 2012. </p><p>  This particular provision is one that assists in the investigation of serious social welfare fraud and non-compliance cases. The measure is an exceptional one and is, accordingly, used judiciously and proportionally. Notifications are made in circumstances where the individual concerned has failed - or continues to fail - to make a voluntary disclosure and where there is evidence that fraud has occurred. </p><p>  A total of 33 notification orders have been issued to a variety of financial institutions since June 2012. In a further 4 cases, the order was not proceeded with as the individual concerned made a voluntary disclosure before the notification issued to the financial institution. All requests have been complied with by the financial institutions concerned.</p><p>  The provision has been used in the detection of identity fraud cases and instances whereby persons were employed under one identity and concurrently claiming social welfare payments under another.

New structures and processes were set up to deal with the normal weekly intake of new claims along with a dedicated team to clear the backlog of claims that had built up over the course of 18 months or so.  All backlogged claims were actioned by the target date of the end of Q1 2013.  New claims being received continue to be processed without delay.  The current average time taken to decide new carer&rsquo;s allowance applications is 8 weeks and this is continuing to reduce.</p><p>  As a consequence of the very high number of decisions made in the last year, there has been a corresponding substantial increase in the number of appeals being received.   Delays in the preparation of claims for appeal are arising as a consequence and this is regretted. Carer&rsquo;s allowance section is now focussed on reducing the appeals.</p><p>  With regard to the specific claim mentioned; this department received a claim for carer&rsquo;s allowance for the person concerned on 6th December 2011.  The claim was disallowed on habitual residence grounds and the person in question was notified of this decision and the reason for it on 23rd of July 2012. A letter of appeal was received in August 2012. The claim was reviewed by a deciding officer, who did not change her opinion following her review. The deciding officer forwarded all the relevant claim papers to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO) for determination on 20th March 2013.</p><p>  The delays in this case are regrettable. Because of its quasi-judicial nature, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.</p></reply>

Permanently incapable of work is defined as an incapacity for work of such a nature that the likelihood is that the claimant will be incapable of work for life or an incapacity which has existed for 12 months prior to the date of claim and where the Deciding Officer or Appeals Officer is satisfied that the claimant is likely to be unable to work for 1 year from the date of the claim.</p><p>On receipt of an Invalidity Pension Claim the Deciding Officer checks if the applicant may already have been medically assessed. If there is no suitable medical result for the applicant a diagnostic report issues to the applicant for completion by their G.P. Once this diagnostic report is returned it is viewed by a medical assessor who provides an opinion regarding the medical eligibility of the Invalidity Pension applicant. The Deciding Officer then utilises this opinion to establish if the client is medically suitable by either being incapable of work for life or by having an incapacity which has existed for 12 months prior to the date of claim and is likely to continue for 1 year. If the client is considered medically suitable and satisfies the other qualifying conditions for Invalidity Pension the claim is awarded. Applicants are not just assessed on the permanently incapable of work condition.</p><p>When a claim is awarded that applicant satisfied all the qualifying conditions for the Invalidity Pension scheme therefore the medical eligibility conditions as outlined above were satisfied. It is not possible to provide statistics broken down by those who were considered to be permanently incapable of work or incapable of work for at least another 12 months. But the following outlines the numbers awarded in 2012 and 2013 to date.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Scheme </th><th>Number of awards </th></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>Invalidity Pension</td><td>6,352</td></tr><tr><td>2013 to date</td><td>Invalidity Pension</td><td>3,233</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The level of capital funding available has declined significantly in recent years along the lines highlighted in the Medium Term Exchequer Framework for Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016. As a result capital spending on housing programmes is subject to constraint over the short-term.   </p><p>  On 22 February 2013 I announced capital allocations to local authorities under the suite of Grants for Older People and People with a Disability amounting to &euro;42.750 million. In allocating the available funding across all 34 city and county councils I did so in as transparent and as fair a way as possible.   In framing the 2013 allocations, my Department wrote to each local authority requesting details of the numbers and value of grants where work had been approved to commence.  Between them local authorities reported contractual commitments in respect of approved grants totalling &euro;18 million. This year I allocated local authorities the full amount of their contractual commitments.  The balance of the available funding was allocated on the basis of each authority&rsquo;s share of the new applications on hand in January 2013. </p><p>  In order to deal with any acute or particular strain which might arise in the operation of the schemes over the course of the year I have set aside a small capital reserve.  I recently approved additional allocations totalling &euro;1.2 million for 13 local authorities.  Dublin City Council applied for additional funding from this reserve and was notified of a supplementary allocation of &euro;118,063 , bringing the Council&rsquo;s overall allocation for 2013 to &euro;5,050,383.  My Department is closely monitoring expenditure across all the measures under the housing programme.  I will consider allocating further funds to the grants measure in the event of any saving arising elsewhere.   </p></reply>

The Housing Finance Agency's rates are not predicated on base rates afforded by the ECB, as its funding is sourced through the EU/IMF programme of financial support and dictated by EURIBOR. Independently of the ECB rate cuts, the Agency has reduced the rate it charges to local authorities by 0.55% since September 2012.

This programme will target the 25,000 least energy efficient properties and result in warmer homes and lower energy bills for thousands of families and will also create around 1,000 jobs in the sector. </p><p>  Local authorities are responsible for the management and maintenance of their social housing stock and for the preparation and implementation of planned maintenance programmes and pre-letting repairs to vacant properties.  In addition to the new insulation measure, my Department supports an energy retrofitting measure for local authority houses and &euro;10 million is being provided for this purpose in 2013. Local authorities may undertake energy retrofitting works in conjunction with pre-letting re pairs with the objective of getting best value for money and ensuring that the existing stock is available to meet housing need.</p></reply>

The position is unchanged since then.<blockquote>  The person concerned is a failed asylum applicant. Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 25th May, 2006, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her. She was subsequently notified of her entitlement to apply for subsidiary protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.<br /><br />  The person concerned submitted an application for subsidiary protection and, following consideration of this application, it was determined that the person concerned was not eligible for subsidiary protection.  The person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 16th January, 2008.<br /><br />  The case of the person concerned will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.<br /><br />  The Deputy should note that as the person concerned has no current right of residency in the State, she would not be in a position to meet the lawful residency criteria applicable to persons applying to my Department for a Certificate of Naturalisation.  Equally, given that the person concerned has no history of employment in the State under Work Permit or Work Authorisation conditions, the issue of an application for the immigration status of Long Term Residency would not arise.<br /><br />  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</blockquote></p></reply>

International perceptions are also ascertained and monitored through regular contacts with the UNHCR as well as participation generally through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at relevant UN fora.</p><p>  The common travel area, CTA, between Ireland and the UK which for many decades has delivered immeasurable economic, social and cultural benefits to all people on the island is of the utmost importance in public policy. In part informed by the experiences of various organisations such as the tourism bodies and tour operators, the immigration authorities of both countries are working together to introduce reciprocal visa arrangements which will afford greater ease of travel between Ireland and the UK for visa required nationals.</p><p>  In addition, regular feedback on Ireland's visa policy is received from various bodies abroad such as tour operators and the impact of such policies is evidenced by the increased number of visitors coming to Ireland.  For example, Central Statistics Office figures indicate that tourist visits from the countries covered by the visa waiver programme increased by almost 21% in the twelve months after the introduction of the programme compared with the twelve preceding months (from 74,153 to 89,482).  The programme has been widely welcomed by tourism promotion agencies and tour operators.  The Government decided in March last year to extend the programme beyond its original finish date of 31 October 2012 until the end of October 2016 by which time a common travel area visa arrangement should be in place.</p><p>  Ireland, like its EU counterparts, is bound by EU law together with national legislation and international law such as the UN Convention on Human Rights. On the asylum front, Ireland actively participates in relevant EU bodies and during our presidency of the EU a number of important legislative measures were successfully concluded.  As part of these discussions, experiences of the operation of the asylum system across the EU are discussed which contributes to policy formulation and the measures pursued at EU and National level.  Similar sharing of experiences take place in other forum such as GDISC and the IGC. In addition, Ireland is an active participant in FRONTEX and both takes the lead and also participates in various operations organised under its auspices.  INIS also provides a range of annual statistical returns to the UNHCR and EUROSTAT and these figures are used for research and inform opinion on asylum and immigration related matters.</p><p>  The operation of an immigration policy in Ireland, no less nor no more than in any Western European country, is a huge challenge.  On the one hand, it is a legitimate public requirement for any nation state to maintain and operate appropriate border controls in order to decide who may enter or reside in the State.  On the other hand, any such controls have to be proportionate, balanced, fair and commensurate with the State's national interests in the economic sphere, as indeed in other areas of public policy.  Striking the right balance between these often competing requirements is a major challenge and, of course, changes from time to time as wider circumstances dictate.  Ultimately all immigration policies boil down to a country's right to determine who may or may not enter its territory and that is a well established fundamental principle in all countries which experience inward migration.</p></reply>

With regard to interceptions, the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act, 1993 provides for the interception of postal and telecommunications messages.  Under Section 2 of the Act, ministerial authorisation may be given for interceptions solely in the interests of the security of the State or for the purpose of criminal investigation. Such authorisations are only issued following application from the Garda Commissioner or the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, in accordance with the Act. The 2011 Communications (Retention of Data) Act  provides for access to traffic data, location data and subscriber data. An application for such data may be made by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not below the rank of Chief Superintendent to a service provider where the data concerned is required in the context of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of a serious offence, the security of the State or the saving of human life. The content of calls, texts etc. are not disclosed under this Act. A senior officer of the Defence Forces may apply for such data where the data concerned is required in the context of the security of the State and a senior officer of the Revenue Commissioners may apply for data in relation to the investigation of certain revenue offences. Both statutory schemes are subject to judicial oversight. Both the 1993 and 2011 Acts provide for the appointment of a High Court Judge to carry out reviews of their operation and the relevant reports to the Taoiseach are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. In addition, the Acts provide for a procedure whereby a member of the public who believes their communications have been intercepted or that their personal data has been accessed (whichever the case may be) may make a complaint to a "Complaints Referee".

The Deputy will also be aware that a Private Members' Bill seeking to temporarily lift the Statute of Limitations for women who experienced these procedures was published in April of this year. The Government remains committed to dealing with this issue and to finding a just and workable resolution for those victims who have been adversely affected by this appalling practice. This objective informs the approach being taken by the Government in relation to the ongoing consultations being conducted under the stewardship of Minister of Health, Deputy Reilly, and his officials in the Department of Health. In that context, the outcomes of the final phase of consultations under the independent research into the practice of symphysiotomy, which had been commissioned by the Chief Medical Officer, will further help determine the best way to resolve this issue. The real challenge for the Government is to find a solution that will balance the need for an early resolution to this issue with the legal complexities of achieving this by means of an amendment to the legislation governing the limitation of actions. This area of law is also the subject of a report and recommendations published by the Law Reform Commission in 2011. That report considered the existing limitation of actions framework to be unnecessarily complex and in need of reform and simplification. As the Minister, Deputy Reilly, explained in his statement to this House on the occasion of the publication of the Private Members' Bill on 14 April, the Government is not yet persuaded that lifting the bar will resolve the problems facing the women who wish to bring their cases before the courts and we do not wish to see a situation where women who have suffered enough are faced with high litigation costs in potentially unsuccessful challenges. The limitation of actions aspect is, therefore, one in relation to which all options will be examined by the Department of Health in conjunction with my Department, which deals with the framework legislation for this area, and in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General from whom legal advices have been obtained.</p><p>  In conclusion, therefore, I wish to reiterate my commitment and that of the Government to resolving the complex issues presented by the brutal legacy of symphysiotomy at both the human and legal levels. I also wish to acknowledge the wider support being given by Members of both Houses to the early realisation of this objective. I will continue to work with the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, in bringing together the competencies of our respective Departments to achieve this in the most appropriate and fairest way possible for the victims concerned.</p></reply>

These concerns mainly centre on data privacy rights not being adequately respected. Commissioner Reding and myself raised these concerns with the US Attorney General Eric Holder at the EU-US Ministerial meeting last week. I also raised the matter at a bilateral meeting which I had with Attorney General Holder. At these meetings, the US Attorney General provided clarity on a number of issues, in particular that the information collected and processed relates only to metadata i.e. phone numbers, duration of calls etc. but not the content of calls. He also advised that the data was collected under judicial authority and only where there was a reasonable suspicion of serious crime, such as terrorism or cybersecurity/cybercrime. The courts only allow the data to be queried when there is a reasonable suspicion based on specific facts that the basis of the query is associated with a foreign terrorist organisation. He further stated that Congressional oversight applied to these programmes. It was agreed to set up a working group between the EU side and the US security services to continue dialogue in relation to this matter. We cannot ignore the very important fact that there is a recognised need to protect our citizens from terrorist threats and dealing with that does require access to certain data. In doing so, however, it is necessary to ensure that the information used is properly obtained and subject to appropriate safeguards. The importance of protecting individual rights to privacy and ensuring respect for individual human rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights was emphasised to the US side. The crucial need to ensure that any security surveillance undertaken is balanced and proportionate was also emphasised as was the need to give essential assurances to non-US citizens on this score. The US authorities have indicated that their practices are proportionate to the threat they are trying to deal with.</p><p>  We do have, in this country, robust data protection legislation to protect individuals against unwarranted invasion into their privacy. Access to call content is governed by the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 and may only take place under Ministerial warrant. Access to retained data in this jurisdiction is governed by the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011.Under the Act access may only be granted following a request to the particular mobile phone company or internet provider in connection with the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of a serious offence, the safeguarding of the security of the State or the saving of human life. The operation of both Acts is subject to judicial oversight and there is a complaints procedure which individuals can avail of if there is a concern that the Acts have been breached in relation to their calls or their data. There are also procedures in place under Mutual Assistance legislation to cover requests to and from other countries for this type of information.</p></reply>

The European Council will discuss three clusters of issues. These are (a) increasing the effectiveness, visibility and impact of CSDP; (b) enhancing the development of defence capabilities; and, (c) strengthening Europe&rsquo;s defence industry.The process is divided into two phases an informal and then a formal phase.  The informal phase, which will continue until September, consists of a number of meetings such as Ministerial meetings, and others with Policy Directors, European Defence Agency (EDA) Steering Boards and the Political Security Committee.  These meetings will allow the European External Action Service (EEAS) to explore with Member States which topics and priorities should be addressed as part of the European Council debate.    The second phase, which will be more formal, will commence in September when a number of reports due will be available. The High Representative Report will be drafted by September 2013 (based on EEAS' and EDA's inputs), and the Commission&rsquo;s Global Strategy for strengthening Europe's defence industry (in the form of a Communication) is expected to issue shortly. On this basis, recommendations will issue with a view to debate and conclusions next December. </p><p>In relation to discussions within my Department, as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Council, I hosted a seminar in Dublin Castle on 17th   May, 2013, to discuss these issues. The seminar formed an integral part of the preparatory process of developing the agenda for the European Council discussion, with presentations from the European External Action Service, the European Defence Agency, the European Commission, Member States, academia and industry. </p><p>  In my own address, I underlined the importance of this Council meeting and the need for clarity and consensus at EU level to ensure that the EU can effectively respond to emerging international crises. I pointed out that achieving the EU&rsquo;s ambition in Common Security and Defence Policy requires a greater willingness amongst Member States to coordinate their efforts, rather than continuing to act individually. There is also a need to ensure that the Union has the requisite resources and military capabilities, able and willing to effectively respond to emerging international crises that could ultimately have an adverse effect on the EU and on the security of our States and our citizens. Having capabilities is one thing, but as I said at the seminar, the political will to deploy them is a key and missing component, which Heads of State and Government will need to address in December. I also pointed to the important role which the Defence Industry plays in support of jobs, growth, leading edge technology and innovation and, with a particular focus on our own national capacity, the contribution which SMEs can make in this regard. </p><p>  During this preparatory stage it is difficult to foresee what public debate on collective security and defence may occur as no concrete proposals have yet been finalised. </p><p>  The European Defence Agency, in consultation with participating Member States and the EU Military Committee, bring forward projects under the Pooling and Sharing initiative.  Ireland is keen to continue to explore all aspects of this evolving initiative and will continue work to develop specific opportunities for Pooling and Sharing, where appropriate. However, the decision to participate in any specific Pooling and Sharing project is a sovereign decision to be taken by individual Member States.</p></reply>

We have therefore moved from a narrower focus on the finalisation of a Council position to the point where the Council position is itself just one of three different perspectives being brought to the table. </p><p>  Typically, this represents the final phase of negotiations in areas where the European Parliament has a co-decision role. Indeed, this is the first time that the Parliament has had such a role in relation to a CAP reform package. As President of the Council, Ireland is representing Member States in these negotiations with the Parliament and the Commission.</p><p>  I am happy to report that progress has been very good so far. The trilogues have been held in a very positive, constructive atmosphere. All of the institutions have responded to the Presidency&rsquo;s call for a collaborative endeavour, and for a spirit of compromise to inform the process. Good progress has been made on a substantial number of technical issues and we are now in the &ldquo;end-game&rdquo; where we are considering the important and politically sensitive points. </p><p>  I said from the start of the Irish Presidency that the final target for political agreement was the end of June. It is clear that the European Parliament and the Commission are committed to achieving this objective. The Member States have also demonstrated their commitment, and as President of the Council of Ministers, I intend to do all I can to ensure that the deadline is met.   </p><p>  I need to be clear however that the timeline for political agreement by end June is extremely tight and ambitious.  It can only be achieved with a fair wind and an exceptional effort by all three institutions.</p></reply>

Under the terms and conditions governing the Scheme the participant undertakes to implement their farming activities for a minimum period of 5 years under an agri-environmental plan which includes all lands farmed whether owned, leased or rented.

The agreement by the European Council on the Multiannual Financial Framework on 8 February provided the necessary clarity to enable the CAP discussions to move forward. This was followed by the adoption by the European Parliament of its overall position on the reform proposals at its plenary session on 12 March. This was in turn followed by the agreement by the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 19 March on its so-called &lsquo;General Approach&rsquo; to the reform package, following the tabling of compromise proposals by the Irish Presidency.   </p><p>  We have therefore moved from a narrower focus on the finalisation of a Council position to the point where the Council position is itself just one of three different perspectives being brought to the table. Of course, the big question is whether the three institutions can come to an agreement on these and other issues by the end of June. My strong belief is that they can. The vehicle will be the so-called &ldquo;trilogue&rdquo; process. Typically, this represents the final phase of negotiations in areas where the European Parliament has a co-decision role. Indeed, this is the first time that the Parliament has had such a role in relation to a CAP reform package. As President of the Council, Ireland is representing Member States in these negotiations.</p><p>  I am happy to report that progress has been very good so far. The trilogues have been held in a very positive, constructive atmosphere. All of the institutions have responded to the Presidency&rsquo;s call for a collaborative endeavour, and for a spirit of compromise to inform the process. Progress has been achieved on a number of technical issues, facilitated by technical discussions which are running in parallel to the trilogue meetings. In addition, more politically sensitive points that have been encountered so far have been discussed in a preliminary or exploratory way in the trilogues and parked for further consideration later. In this regard I have agreed with the Chairman of the European Parliament&rsquo;s Agriculture Committee, Paolo de Castro, on a further parallel process aimed at making progress on the big political issues that are likely to form the basis of the final political agreement. </p><p>  The final target for that political agreement is the end of June. It is clear that the European Parliament and the Commission are committed to achieving this objective. The Member States have also demonstrated their commitment, and as President of the Council of Ministers, I intend to do all I can to ensure that the deadline is met.   I need to be clear however that the timeline for political agreement by end June is extremely tight and ambitious.  It can only be achieved with a fair wind and an exceptional effort by all three institutions.</p><p>  The reformed CAP will set the policy framework for the future development of the Irish agricultural sector.  I am confident that we can secure a political agreement on the CAP before the end of June that will be good for Irish and EU agriculture and that will allow enhanced development of all of the sectors of importance to the Irish agri-food industry. </p></reply>

They have been very useful in highlighting the main concerns and preferred options of the farming and wider agri-food sector.  Of course, there are variations between the positions taken by different stakeholders and it is my job as Minister to steer a course that will deliver a policy that will be fit for purpose and that will underpin the future of Irish and European farming.  </p><p>  Let me remind deputies that Ireland's priorities at the outset of these negotiations were to ensure in so far as possible:<blockquote>- sufficient CAP financial resources to support sustainable food production in the EU and in Ireland.<br /><br />- flexibility for Member States on farm payment models and transition arrangements, and <br /><br />- a rural development policy that effectively supports competitiveness and sustainability. </blockquote>  I am pleased to state that substantial progress has been made in delivering on all these priorities.  Although the MFF agreement has yet to be endorsed by the European Parliament, there is no question but that a substantial budget has been secured for the CAP, including in excess of &euro;11 billion for Ireland over the coming period.</p><p>  As to the other elements, next week in Luxembourg and Brussels, I am seeking to achieve political agreement between the three EU institutions on the CAP reform package in order to  <blockquote>- Deliver a rural development regulation that will provide the scope for Ireland to implement a rural development programme which targets support to Irish farmers to assist them in increasing their competitiveness and improving their sustainability; and  <br /><br />- Deliver a payment model that is fair to Irish farmers and supports sustainable intensification and active farming by ensuring a fairer distribution of direct payments while avoiding abrupt, large losses to higher paid farmers.</blockquote></p></reply>

These reforms once implemented will support the rebuilding of fish stocks in our waters as Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas are set to deliver maximum sustainable yield by 2015, where possible and by 2020 for all stocks and the wasteful practice of discarding fish is phased out. The reform will also, for the first time, facilitate real and meaningful regional decision making under the CFP and will give stakeholders a greater say in how their fisheries are managed. The changes once implemented will mean, real, meaningful reform of the Common Fisheries Policy and will determine European fisheries policy for the next decade and beyond.</p><p>  Among the most significant aspects of the reforms for Irish fishermen are:</p><p>  - A central role for  the fishing industry through new more regionalised approaches to decision making.  It will empower fishermen by giving them a key role in the decision making for their fisheries.</p><p>  - This reform places long term sustainability at the core of fisheries policy with annual fishing quotas  based, in future,  on sound scientific advice.  Rebuilding of fish stocks so that fishing levels are based on Maximum Sustainable Yield; leading to potentially higher quotas for fishermen over time.</p><p>  - Practical and phased discards policy where in early years of implementation, TACs and  quotas will be set to take account of current levels of discards - this should see quotas for Irish fishermen increase in the short term.</p><p>  - Technical measures to avoid and minimise catches of juvenile fish.</p><p>  - It also involves a strong commitment  to protect juvenile fish and spawning grounds and to develop and strengthen biologically sensitive areas; it commits to continue and further strengthen conservation measures in the biologically sensitive area which includes the BSA off the South and West coast of Ireland (new Irish box).</p><p>  - The Hague Preferences are maintained and given increased reference.  These  are critically important for Ireland and each December have given us an increased share of traditional whitefish stocks such as cod, haddock and whiting in the waters off our coast when stock levels are decreasing.</p><p>  I strongly believe that these reforms once implemented and embedded will provide the basis for a significant period of growth in our Irish fishing industry.</p></reply>

This involves regular consultation with fishing industry interests. Our existing quota management system is designed to ensure the rational management of the available quotas, having regard to fishing patterns and market conditions, the best possible spread both between fishermen and also in terms of take up of quota during the year. A key objective is the avoidance of very early closure of fisheries through rapid exhaustion of quota. Under the current arrangements, fishing industry representatives are consulted formally through the Whitefish Quota Management Advisory Committee on a monthly basis and their views are taken into account as far as possible in the determination of monthly regimes for particular stocks.  The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority is the national body for the control and enforcement of sea fisheries law and work with the Naval Service to control and enforce compliance with quota management arrangements and accurate reporting of landings.   </p><p>  The CFP reform has been completed over recent weeks under the Irish EU Presidency.  The Reform agreed does not impose a requirement to privatise quotas as had been proposed by the EU Commission and vigorously opposed by Ireland.  Under the new CFP, Member States retain full responsibility for implementing systems that are appropriate for their industry and I have consistently argued that in Ireland, quotas must remain a public resource.  On a similar basis, individual EU Member States have responsibilities for the management of their own fisheries quotas and each Member State has primary responsibility for the control and enforcement of these arrangements.  However, catch reporting and other restrictions within the 200 mile Exclusive Fisheries zone are a matter for the control authorities of the Coastal Member State.</p></reply>

Lack of access to affordable, quality childcare is a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families seeking to avail of work opportunities. This initiative will provide an important support measure to enable parents to avail of job opportunities.  This is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment and demonstrates how Departments are working together to deliver the Government's agenda on promoting employment and supporting children's development.</p><p>  The initiative is expected to receive full year funding of &euro;14 million to provide over 6,000 after-school places for children attending primary school in order to support parents to take up employment.  This funding has been made possible through savings from the Vote of the Department of Social Protection. </p><p>  Eligibility for the new After-school Childcare programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  Officials from the Department of Social Protection and my Department are continuing in close collaboration on the operation of the programme.  The first pilot phase has commenced.  Up to 500 childcare places are available with Department of Social Protection local offices in Tralee, Mullingar, Dundalk, Cork City, Finglas, Kings Inn and Limerick City participating.  The second phase of the pilot will be rolled out in July, with the full roll-out of the programme in September 2013, to coincide with the new school year.   </p><p>  For the pilot phase of the programme, those service providers currently in contract with the DCYA in respect of Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) were offered the opportunity to provide for the new School Age Childcare service, by way of amendment to their existing contractual arrangements.  Service providers not currently in contract with the DCYA and seeking to join the programme can apply to participate, with effect from September 2013, in the normal manner.</p><p>  As you know the emphasis now in relation to all childcare support programmes is the delivery of easily accessible, affordable and quality childcare provision. The pilot programmes will assist both Departments in determining the procedural, quality and practical issues that require attention prior to the finalisation of the programme.</p></reply>

The ISPCC has been successful in securing EU Daphne funding to support the establishment of the line. The ISPCC also submitted an application for funding to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to cover the establishment and running of the Hotline. This application has been approved for 2012 and 2013. Future applications for running costs will be considered in the context of the annual budget estimates process.  The funding received from both the EU Daphne fund and from DCYA includes the establishment costs, the national promotion and advertisement of this Hotline service.</p><p>  The promotion of the Hotline has been ongoing since the service opened in 2012.  There have been numerous press releases issued by the DCYA and the ISPCC, the 116 000 Missing Children Hotline has been covered in the print (9 articles) and broadcast (6 radio stations) media since opening in May 2012.  There has also been an on-going website and social media presence utilising ISPCC, Facebook and Twitter to highlight the service as well as information on missing children.  ISPCC staff and volunteers have worked to disseminate posters in local areas and posters have been distributed nationally by the Garda&iacute;.  </p><p>  Memoranda of understanding between the ISPCC and the HSE, my Department and the Garda&iacute;, respectively were finalised in advance of the commencement of the pilot in December 2012.  Following a phased implementation of the service, which commenced in December 2012, operating on a reduced hours pilot basis, the 116000 Hotline became a full-time 24/7 service since Monday the 22nd of April 2013.  It was officially launched on 5 June 2013.  The 116000 missing children website () was also launched on 5 June.  The ISPCC will now escalate the promotion of this service, which will include promotion in schools. The Project Team will be kept informed on an on-going basis of the ISPCC's plans and activities related to awareness raising.</p><p>  It is important to note that the 116000 number is not an emergency number. Emergency calls should always be directed to the 999/112 number in the first instance, where the relevant emergency responses, including the recently launched Garda Missing Children Amber Alert mechanism, may be activated. The establishment of the 116000 line will, however, be of valuable support and assistance to families of missing children and to missing children themselves.</p></reply>

The SCP is one of three services being integrated into a continuum of educational support services under the remit of the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB).  The SCP is a key programme under the Department of Education and Skills DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) action plan to address educational disadvantage.</p><p>  In 2013 an allocation of &euro;26.246m has been provided for the programme.  This supports 124 projects and related initiatives which operate in 470 primary schools and 224 post-primary schools across the country to provide targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people.</p><p>  The review of the SCP was signalled in the context of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, CRE 2012-2014.  My Department is leading this operational review in conjunction with the National Educational Welfare Board, which is responsible for the operational management and direction of the Programme, and in consultation with the Department of Education and Skills.  The objectives of the review are to identify best practice, to clarify roles and responsibilities and to build upon the valuable learning and experience to date across the programme.  It is anticipated that the review will assist in identifying the reforms necessary to consolidate the programme on a sustainable footing for the future and ensure that available funds are targeted to those services which provide the greatest contribution to educational outcomes for pupils at risk of educational disadvantage.  Harnessing the considerable expertise and experience of staff and management across the programme is central to the success of the review process and the terms of reference envisage appropriate opportunities for stakeholders to contribute to the review.  </p><p>  Work is already underway to gather comprehensive information relating to existing organisational arrangements across all local project structures.  This work is a critical step in the review process as it will provide baseline data about the diversity of local arrangements and procedures in place given the development of projects since the programme&rsquo;s inception in 2002. </p><p>  My Department has worked with Pobal and the NEWB to develop an on-line survey which is designed to gather relevant information from projects around local governance, administration and employment arrangements.  Detailed guidance for the exercise has issued to all projects.  The survey provides the opportunity for local management to identify specific areas where they may need additional support.  It is expected that the analysis of this data will be completed before the start of the next academic year. </p><p>  It is proposed to procure external expertise to further support the review process.  The terms of reference for this work are being finalised and it is anticipated that the project will proceed to tender shortly.  The NEWB will manage the necessary procurement and contractual arrangements.  My Department expects this external support to be in place by September, in time for the start of the academic year, and for the review to be completed during the 2013/2014 academic cycle of the programme. </p><p>  It is my intention to publish a report on the outcome of the SCP review.  The process necessary to drive any recommendations and monitor progress will be informed by the finding of the review.  </p></reply>

It is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to geographic based teams for children (0-18 years) as part of the National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years). </p><p>  The Programme is organised at national, regional and local level and includes representatives from the health and education sectors, service providers (both statutory and non-statutory) and parents.  These stakeholders are working together to see how current services can be reorganised in line with agreed policy.  The HSE has stated that it is very cognisant of stakeholder's views particularly of parents within this context.  It has also worked to ensure that information about the Programme is made widely available. </p><p>  The Executive is working very closely with the education sector, which is fully involved in the development of the Programme, to ensure that, from the children's and parents' perspective, the services provided by each sector in so far as possible are integrated.  Detailed Local Area action plans are being implemented with the following objectives: - One clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need, - Resources used to the greatest benefit for all children and families, and - Health and Education working together to support children to achieve their potential </p><p>The purpose of the reconfiguration of existing therapy resources is to ensure that the resources available are used to best effect, in order to provide health supports and ongoing therapy to all children (0-18 years) in line with their prioritised needs.  In particular, it will mean that all children, regardless of where they receive their education services will have equitable access to services based on their needs.  The very essence of this Programme is that the child is placed at the centre of disability services and that their needs are assessed.  To further support the Programme and in recognition of the fact that a child's development has both health and education aspects, a detailed framework designed to aid collaborative working between the health and education sectors at local level has been distributed. </p><p>  Decisions in relation to the local reorganisation of services will be made by Local Implementation Groups, which include representatives of all the service providers in the local area, parents and the education sector.  They have a complex task which includes agreeing the principles which should underpin all disability services, mapping of existing services and gaps, consideration of the changes needed in structures and a detailed plan of how to advance.  This plan will include issues of timing and the phasing of proposed changes. </p></reply>

There is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with a specific illness, such as cancer.  The income thresholds apply to all applications and there are no variations on these where an applicant - or family member -  has a specific illness.  </p><p>  However, under the legislation, there is provision for discretion by the HSE to grant a medical card where a person's income exceeds the income guidelines. The HSE takes a person's social and medical issues into account in determining whether or not &quot;undue hardship&quot; exists for a person in providing a health service for themselves or his or her dependents. </p><p>  The HSE set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for such discretionary medical cards, where there are difficult personal circumstances.  This approach recognises the need to have in place a standard process for considering applications in respect of people who, while over the income guidelines, require a discretionary assessment on the basis of illness, such as cancer, or undue financial hardship.</p></reply>

In the past, some nursing homes would have been allocated a lump sum annually by the HSE.  However, the new scheme supports the individuals in need of long-term nursing home care, not the facilities providing the care.  It is designed to ensure that nursing homes are not being funded for empty beds.  </p><p>  In order to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme all private nursing homes, and voluntary nursing homes which previously received funding for long-term residential care under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, must negotiate and agree a price for the cost of long-term nursing home care with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  This is necessary due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above individuals' contributions.</p><p>  The NTPF is independent in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State.  The NTPF negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process.  If price negotiations break down, a three stage review process can be invoked.  Details of the process are set out on the NTPF website.  Given the independence of the NTPF, the Minister for Health cannot intervene in the negotiations between it and the nursing home referred to by the Deputy. </p><p>  Finally, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is currently being reviewed.  One of the terms of reference of the review is an examination of the overall cost of long term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices.  Work will continue on the review in the coming months with a view to completion by end 2013/early 2014.</p></reply>

This funding is being allocated to each HSE Region based on its percentage of population. Both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of the funding in a creative and flexible manner so as to secure as many places as possible for this cohort.  </p><p>  The demand for services for school-leavers continues to grow. The HSE expects that approximately 700 young people who have finished their education or life-skills training will require services in 2013.  Providing the level of services required within the additional funding provided will continue to be a challenge. Work in this area will be progressed largely in line with the HSE guidance document developed in 2012, which led to the successful placement of 99% of RT graduates and 96% of school leavers last year. </p><p>  It is envisaged that plans will be completed for each region shortly and submitted to Area Managers, Regional Specialists and Regional Director of Operations for agreement.  Arising from completed and approved plans, a communication process will be agreed with service providers to inform families of the services that will be available from September 2013. </p><p>  In respect of the specific question asked by the Deputy, as it relates to service matters I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The selection and prioritisation of road works is also a matter for the local authority.</p><p>A number of best practice guidelines have issued to local authorities in relation to the reinstatement of roads. In particular a document entitled &quot;Guidelines for the Opening, Backfilling and Reinstatement of Trenches in Public Roads&quot; outlines the legal framework in respect of road openings and it prescribes standards which should be attained in respect of such works. In addition my Department has been working with local authorities to implement a pavement management system to link pavement distress to treatment options.  I have been encouraging local authorities as the bodies responsible for the maintenance and repair of roads to utilise this system to its full capabilities. </p></reply>
