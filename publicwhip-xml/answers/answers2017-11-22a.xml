    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-22a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112200080#WRA01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 51 and 75 together.</p>  <p>  As I have advised the House previously, civil aviation is a highly regulated global industry, and there are extensive EU and international rules and regulations which all members states are obliged to comply with.  </p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Irish Aviation Authority is the designated, statutory body for aviation regulation and it is subject to an extensive performance audit regime.  This includes international oversight under ICAO's Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme and under the European Aviation Safety Agency's standardisation audits.  </p>  <p>  In addition, Section 32 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993 provides for an examination and report to the Minister for Transport on the performance of the IAA with regard to its safety regulation functions and air navigation service.  The findings of the most recent Section 32 examination by the expert consultancy firm Helios, as set out in its Final Report of 2015, are in line with the positive views of both ICAO and EASA.  To reiterate, the IAA is subject to three separate, detailed performance audit review processes - one under domestic law by the Minister, one under European law by EASA, and one under international agreement by the UN's ICAO. </p>  <p>  Regarding the Helios Report raised by the Deputy, the Report notes that: the IAA's "level of compliance with European and ICAO safety regulations and standards and recommended practices is very high, evidenced by EASA standardisation audits and other audits over a sustained period where the IAA has consistently performed well.  The IAA is well resourced with a level of industry experience and technical expertise that is amongst the best in Europe".</p>  <p>  As with any good and robust audit process, the Helios Section 32 Report made recommendations for further improvement.  The whole purpose of the audit regimes described above is to verify current perfomance against current requirements and also to push organisations to engage in continuous improvement.  The IAA has established an implementation plan to address these areas for further improvement and is reporting periodically to my Department on progress. </p>  <p>  In the period up to 2007, three examinations were carried out under Section 32.  In 2009, the then Minister for Transport, Mr Noel Dempsey set out in a D&aacute;il reply of 3 November 2009 the reasons for his decision not to carry out an examination under the Section 32 provision at that juncture.  This was due to a number of factors, including plans at the time to restructure the IAA.</p>  <p>  Within my remit, I will consider any request from the association referred to by the Deputy to meet and discuss matters of concern to it, including relating to the outcome of the Section 32 examination.</p></reply>

The purpose of the internal review is to identify the options available for various aspects of the Order. </p>  <p>  The internal review of the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973 is currently underway.  The purpose of the internal review is to identify the options available for various aspects of the Order. </p>  <p>  The Chicago Convention, which is the main international treaty governing the operation of civil aviation, states that no civil aircraft may carry munitions of war over a state without that state&rsquo;s permission.  This requirement is ratified in Irish law by the 1973 Order.  Under the terms of the Order the carriage of weapons and munitions of war is prohibited in any civil aircraft in Irish airspace and on board any Irish registered aircraft, unless an exemption is granted by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the provisions of the 1973 Order, my Department operates a procedure under which airlines wishing to carry weapons or munitions through Irish airspace or airports must apply for each flight at least 48 hours in advance.  My Department seeks the views of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in relation to foreign policy issues and the Department of Justice and Equality in relation to security issues.  The IAA is consulted in relation to aviation safety issues for applications involving munitions that are also categorised as dangerous goods.  If any of these bodies objects, an exemption will generally not be granted. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently liaising with the other departments and agencies concerned and the internal review of the Order should be completed the coming months.</p>  <p>  I should point out that the internal review is examining the Statutory Instrument primarily from an administrative and legal perspective.  There is no proposal to change the long-standing Government policy of permitting aircraft used by the defence forces of various nations to transit through Irish airspace and airports, subject to appropriate terms and conditions. </p></reply>

As I have said, I wish them every success as they turn their attention to delivering what I hope will be an outstanding tournament in 2023.</p>  <p>  Wednesday's result was disappointing, particularly after the years of work put into the bid.  However, in our disappointment, we should not lose sight of the fact that the technical report found that Ireland would be an excellent host country for a Rugby World Cup.  </p>  <p>  Ireland was up against two previous hosts and in the evaluation report we fell behind them based on the quality of their stadia, many of which are recently built as result of hosting Euro 2016 and the 2010 FIFA World Cup.  We presented a different, more sustainable, vision that involved investment in existing stadia to meet tournament standards.  Unfortunately, RWCL's (Rugby World Cup Ltd) evaluators did not agree.  In any event, ultimately the voters did not support the RWCL recommendation.</p>  <p>  We did not win the bid due to not having secured a sufficient number of the votes cast last Wednesday.  Unfortunately, that is the nature of the competitive process used.  In a competition of this nature there always will be a winner and losers.  We will of course learn from this experience and use that learning in any future bids for sporting events, but that does not take away from the excellent work that was done in preparing our bid.  </p>  <p>  My Department took the lead role in co-ordinating the input of Government Departments and public sector in support of the Bid as well putting in place the legislation and guarantees required by World Rugby.  I am satisfied that the Government gave the IRFU all the support that was asked of it in its efforts to secure the Rugby World Cup in 2023.</p>  <p>  I would like to particularly thank the IRFU, our colleagues in the Northern Ireland Executive, the members of the RWC 2023 Oversight Board, those who took on ambassadorial roles for the bid, the civil and public services and many State bodies, and the people of Ireland, all of whom have given such incredible support to this bid.</p></reply>

However, I am not involved in the day to day operations of public transport.  Following the establishment of the National Transport Authority (NTA) in December 2009, the NTA is the statutory body with responsibility for the issues raised in conjunction with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  The PSO subvention for public transport services increased last year, again this year and will increase yet further next year.  Over the three years PSO subvention will have increased by some 35% in total.  This means that in 2018 over &euro;285 million will be allocated via the National Transport Authority (NTA) to support the continued delivery of these socially necessary but financially unviable services that have grown in recent years. </p>  <p>  The upgrade to the Phoenix Park Tunnel in 2016 has seen commuters on the Kildare to Dublin Heuston line have the option of direct trains to Connolly, Tara Street, Pearse and Grand Canal Dock Stations.  The NTA is also continually monitoring and reviewing the operation of contracted bus and rail services in conjunction with the operators to ensure that the needs of the travelling public are met to the greatest possible extent.  The NTA has previously extended the Short Hop Zone for rail travel on the Kildare line to Sallins/Naas and Kilcock stations, which considerably reduced the cost of travel for passengers commuting from those stations.</p>  <p>  The DART Expansion Programme is a cornerstone project of the NTA Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035.  Under this Programme, the DART system will be expanded, providing fast, high-frequency electrified services to Maynooth and M3 Parkway on the Maynooth/Sligo Line, Hazelhatch on the Kildare Line and Drogheda on the Northern Line, while continuing to provide DART services on the South-Eastern Line as far south as Greystones.  The NTA in collaboration with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is continuing to work on the DART Expansion Programme &ndash; Pre-planning Stage.</p></reply>

All parties are agreed on the need to find a resolution to this matter soon, and I expect to receive revised proposals in the near future.  I expect those proposals to be legally robust, and therefore they will be subject to detailed legal scrutiny before a final decision is made.  I can assure the Deputy that there is  strong political support amongst my Cabinet colleagues to have this matter settled as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  I can also assure the Deputy of a number of other things:</p>  <p>  -  As soon as an implementable course of action is presented to me for decision I will advise this House of my intentions;</p>  <p>  -  The interests of residents who live in the vacinity of Dublin Airport will be properly reflected and protected in whatever approach is developed.  Access to public consultation and a transparent and balanced decision making process is paramount.</p>  <p>  -  There will be primary legislation, and therefore the Oireachtas will have full opportunity to examine and help shape the State's approach to implementing EU Regulation 598/14.</p></reply>

As well as serving this area with a new train station, this facility also incorporates a pedestrian/cycle bridge over both the railway and the canal at this location.  This will link with the canal towpath on the north side of the canal, allowing pedestrians to use the canal tow path to walk to Broombridge railway station/Luas stop, where there will be another pedestrian bridge spanning the canal and railway. </p>  <p>  In relation to Pelletstown Station, planning permission is in place and work is currently on-going to complete a detailed design and prepare tender documents for the station's construction.  This work is expected to be completed in the next two months and the NTA expect to be able to advise a firm timeline for the construction of this station very early next year.</p>  <p>  Investment is also planned for the bus network to greatly improve transport infrastructure across the Greater Dublin Area (GDA).  Work is ongoing on the new BusConnects programme, announced by the NTA earlier this year.  Bus Connects will provide a greatly enhanced bus service across Dublin, with high quality infrastructure and services, coupled with major improvements in ticketing and information, all providing a modern, faster, reliable, convenient and attractive public transport solution.</p></reply>

Both of these funding streams have been growing and, as announced recently in Budget 2018, they are now budgeted to continue to grow further.</p>  <p>  The PSO subvention for public transport services increased last year, again this year and will increase yet further next year.  Over the three years PSO subvention will have increased by some 35% in total.  This means that in 2018 over &euro;285 million will be allocated via the National Transport Authority (NTA) to support the continued delivery of these socially necessary but financially unviable services that have grown in recent years.</p>  <p>  Multi-annual capital funding for investment in public transport is provided under the Government's Capital Plan.  An enhanced four-year capital envelope for public transport of over &euro;2.7 billion was announced in Budget 2018, which is a 30% increase over the original Capital Plan allocations for the period 2018-21.  This funding will enable both necessary investment in maintaining the existing public transport infrastructure (especially the rail network) in order to underpin the continued provision of safe and effective transport services, and it will also allow for considerable investment in new infrastructure and facilities so as to expand capacity, address congestion and enhance services.</p>  <p>  The capital allocation provides capital funding to semi State providers of public transport both directly and through the NTA.  In accordance with the requirements of EU law, my Department provides capital funding to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for the maintenance and renewal of the heavy rail network under the Infrastructure Manager Multi-Annual Contract (IMMAC).  The present IMMAC covers the five-year period 2014-2018.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann also receives capital funding, via the NTA, for heavy rail projects in the Greater Dublin Area as well as funding under the Accessibility Grants and Regional Cities Programmes.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides capital funding to the NTA for a rolling programme of bus replacement and refurbishment of the Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath and Bus &Eacute;ireann PSO fleets.  Funding is also provided to these two companies for accessibility projects and funding for Bus &Eacute;ireann under the Regional Cities Programme.</p></reply>

No Irish air carrier can operate its services without maintaining full compliance with all safety regulations.  </p>  <p>  Civil aviation is a highly regulated global industry, with very good reason, and the IAA is consitently found to be amongst the best performing national aviation safety regulatory bodies in the world.  Performance audits by the UN's International Civil Aviation Organisation and by the European Aviation Safety Agency have shown this.  </p>  <p>  Manpower planning is a matter for individual companies, and each airline is entirely responsible for managing its operations to comply with European regulations, provided it is deemed acceptable by the safety regulator.  The airline which the Deputy refers to has accepted full responsibility for what has occurred.

It is not a finding on actual safety performance.  The Report also states clearly that European aviation remains an ultra-safe industry with a highly impressive safety record.  </p>  <p>  In Ireland, the IAA is responsible for the safety oversight of the civil aviation industry.  The Authority has been found to be amongst the very best aviation regulatory bodies in the world, and it ensures that all Irish registered airlines comply fully with all safety regulations to the highest international safety standards.  This includes international standards and requirements relevant to safety culture generally, including an airline's safety management and occurrence reporting systems, regardless of the type of business model or employment model operated within that company.</p>  <p>  As explained in the response to Parliamentary Question 180 of 18 October 2017, there is no statistically based data within Europe to suggest that there is any correlation between business models and safety in aviation. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's question concerning workplace health and safety implications of atypical employment models, I must advise that the question is outside the scope of my remit as it relates to workplace health and safety legislation.  Airline companies have the same obligations under national and EU workplace health and safety laws as all other companies across every other industry.  They are also bound by the same suite of employment laws.  As I have explained in the House before, there are legally binding limitations on flight hours allowable for pilots and air crew, which are set under EU law and with which the IAA ensures Irish registered airlines comply.  </p></reply>

This is due to a complicated legislative history as the port technically forms part of an Anglo-Irish company dating back to the 19th Century known as the Rosslare and Fishguard and Harbours Company.</p>  <p>  The status of the port, and whether its current status potentially inhibits its developments, was most recently considered in a strategic review, commissioned by my Department, and carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants.</p>  <p>  Their report concluded that the creation of an independent port authority would be extremely difficult given the Port's complex legal structure.  Instead, it was recommended that the Port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated.</p>  <p>  In order to assist Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's overall consideration of how best to move forward, the company then engaged consultants to assess market interest.  The assessment was largely positive in terms of the potential for increased private sector investment in the port; however, it did identify possible implementation issues due to the complicated legislative basis of the port.</p>  <p>  Following that assessment my Department sought and received detailed advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter.  That advice identified a number of legal issues with any such proposal and those issues remain under consideration by my Department. </p></reply>

Phase 1, comprising the Dunboyne Rail Line project was completed in 2013.  Phase 2 was to provide for the extension of the Dunboyne line onwards to north Navan.  This development together with a number of other transport projects was postponed in 2011 due to the economic and fiscal crisis. </p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for the development of public transport infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA).  The NTA published its Transport Strategy for the GDA for the period 2016-2035 last year following its approval by my predecessor.  All the main transport corridors in the GDA were examined in the Strategy including the Navan to City Centre Corridor.  The NTA concluded that based on current population and employment forecasts, the level of travel demand between Navan, Dunshaughlin and various stations to the city centre is insufficient to justify the development of a high-capacity rail link at this time.  Instead it is proposed that an enhanced bus service will be provided along the corridor in conjunction with the development of a bus hub in Navan.  The 2017 review of the Capital Plan did not propose any change to this position and no funding was provided for the project in Budget 2018.</p>  <p>  The NTA has indicated that the position will be reassessed as part of the next review of the GDA Transport Strategy and this will take account of the level of development in the catchment area over the next six years.  The NTA has indicated that the corridor identified for a rail link to Navan should be protected from development intrusion in the meantime.  If the review of the Transport Strategy concludes that a rail link is justified at that point, funding can be pursued in the context of the development of future Capital Investment Plans.</p></reply>

In this context, the IAA issues a national SAR Approval to CHCI DAC, who are the operator contracted by the Irish Coast Guard to deliver this service.

The Authority is a hugely respected organisation within international aviation, and it is subject to regular independent, outside audit. </p>  <p>  The Authority has advised me that there is no reason whatsoever for the Irish Aviation community or emergency services to have any concerns about aeronautical maps and charts.

The current funding arrangements in relation to the A5 are governed by the Stormont House Agreement and Implementation Plan - A Fresh Start.  This Agreement reaffirmed the Government's commitment to provide funding of &pound;50 million for the A5 project and committed an additional &pound;25 million to ensure that Phase 1 of the project (Newbuildings to north of Strabane) can commence as soon as the necessary planning issues have been resolved by the Northern Ireland authorities. </p><p><b></b>The Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan published in September 2015 outlined proposed transport investment priorities to 2022.  Maintenance and renewal of the road network will continue to be the main priority over the next period and the bulk of the roads capital budget, approximately &euro;4.4 billion, is earmarked for such essential work with a further &euro;600 million allocated for implementation of the PPP road programme which is already underway.  The Capital Plan provides for significant investment in transport links impacting on the border region including:</p><p>-  the N4 Collooney-Castlebaldwin upgrade scheme;</p><p>-  a rolling improvement scheme on the N56 from Dungloe to Glenties and Inver to Mountcharles to strengthen links in Donegal, and</p><p>-  subject to necessary consents,  the N2 Slane Bypass on the N2 Dublin-Monaghan route.  </p><p>The 57km Gort to Tuam PPP scheme has been completed and was opened officially on 27th September.</p><p>As regards preparatory work on a pipeline of future projects, Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) announced in July that it is re-activating planning work on the N2 Clontibret to the Border Scheme to narrow down the route corridor to a single preferred route.  In addition TII has committed to provide additional funding to develop an online upgrade of the N2, extending from North of Ardee to the south of the Castleblayney Bypass.  The intention is to progress the preliminary design and the achievement of planning consent as soon as possible. </p><p>In relation to the TEN-T road network in Donegal, TII commissioned a Trans-European Transport Network Corridor Needs Study &ndash; Donegal which was completed by Halcrow Barry Consulting Engineers on behalf of Donegal County Council. The report recommends that priority should be afforded to the following three sections of the TEN-T route in Donegal:</p><p>- N15 Ballybofey &ndash; Stranorlar Urban Region</p><p>- N56/N13/N14 Letterkenny to Manorcunningham </p><p>- N14 Manorcunningham to Lifford/Strabane</p><p>Technical Advisors have been appointed to progress preparatory work on these three schemes and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) has allocated &euro;1m in 2017 to this work.  TII intends to continue to advance the planning and design of these projects.

A reduction in carbon emissions of at least 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050 has been collectively targeted across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors, in parallel with an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector. </p><p>The transport sector will play a strong role in contributing to our national emissions reduction effort.  The EPA projects that by 2020 transport will have increased its sectoral share of greenhouse gas emissions to 29%, rising further to 32% by 2030.  Though not unexpected - given Ireland's rising population and welcome return to economic growth with the corresponding rise in transport requirements - this projection nevertheless confirms that, without intervention, greenhouse gas emissions will unquestionably continue to rise.  It places in sharp focus the significant challenge we face to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without hindering social improvement or financial recovery. </p><p>To decarbonise transport we are deploying a diverse range of measures, key among them being the increased uptake and operation of cleaner alternative fuels and technologies as well as promoting modal shift to public transport and active travel modes where possible.  A wide-ranging set of transport mitigation measures and corresponding action points are detailed in the National Mitigation Plan and it is anticipated that these measures will develop further as climate research and technological innovations progress.</p><p>Although emissions from the transport sector are currently increasing, it is worthwhile noting that a number of successful mitigation measures have been introduced which have impacted and are positively addressing greenhouse gas emissions from transport.  They include sustained investment in the public and sustainable transport network, implementation of EU vehicle standard regulations limiting tail pipe emissions, redesigning the Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) and motor tax regimes to promote low carbon emitting vehicles, incentives to encourage alternative fuel and technologies, and the introduction of a Biofuel Obligation Scheme.</p><p>Yet, the transport sector needs to build on these and go further to address this challenge.  A series of measures announced in Budget 2018 clearly reflected this Government&rsquo;s determination to make progress on decarbonising transport.  I am pleased to have secured significant funding commitments to actively address the climate challenge on three key fronts.  Firstly, we are working to enhance the capacity and quality of public transport to ensure that, as far as possible and practical, our increased transport demand is met by greener public transport (over &euro;400m will be invested in public transport infrastructure in 2018 alone with a 4 year capital envelope of over &euro;2.5bn).<b></b>Secondly, we will invest over &euro;100m in a multi-annual cycling and walking programme to support greater uptake of active travel.  And, as recommended by the Low Emissions Vehicle Taskforce, a suite of tax and expenditure measures was announced to clearly indicate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a low-carbon electric vehicle future. </p></reply>

The bridge is the 1st phase of the Shannon Crossing/Killaloe Bypass/R494 upgrade scheme.  In planning the construction schedule for individual projects included in the Plan, account has to be taken of the annual budgets in the Capital Plan and the need to phase different sections of projects to manage the available budgets. </p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of the judicial review relating to the Shannon crossing/Killaloe Bypass/R494 scheme, it is now a matter for the local authority (Clare County Council) to progress the scheme.  Clare County Council has been provided with an allocation of &euro;500,000 in 2017.</p>  <p>  While  a construction timetable has not been decided as yet, my Department will be liaising with Clare County Council in relation to the timing of the construction phases for the Shannon Crossing Section (Phase 1) and the Killaloe Bypass/R494 sections (Phase 2) of the overall scheme.</p></reply>

The project in question is large and will take a great deal of time.  A reasonable estimate at this stage is that a team would need to be allocated to work on it for approximately three years.</p>  <p>  I do not believe that the Law Reform Commission is the appropriate body to undertake this work.  The Deputy may wish to note that the Commission operates on the basis of a multi-annual programme approved by the Government as a whole, and does not undertake such projects at the direction of an individual Minister. </p>  <p>  My Department has, unavoidably, been working in recent years to update aspects of the Road Traffic Acts which require urgent updating.  In light of the fact that my officials are currently working on a number of Bills, most of which are primarily focused on road safety, it is not possible to commence such a consolidation project at this time.</p>  <p>  My priority is the progression of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017.  Following the passage of this Bill, I will give further consideration to the consolidation matter.</p></reply>

Both countries have adopted a whole of Government approach to communications with the citizen placed at the centre. </p>  <p>  Their communication systems aim to simplify how government information  is communicated to the public so that it is delivered in a coherent and accessible manner.  The SCU will continue to consult with international counterparts to seek to adhere to international best practice.</p>  <p>  The decision to set up the SCU was informed by a need to streamline how Government communicates with its citizens.  As an initial step, my Department conducted some research on existing communications activities, including the range of campaigns, brands and channels of communication used by different agencies, which have built up over many years, under successive governments.  This research is ongoing and will be used by civil service management to help frame the work plan of the new unit. </p>  <p>  The initial results of that research will be published shortly.  The former Merrionstreet (GIS) function is integrated within the Strategic Communications Unit; the Government Press Office continues to operate as before in dealing with day -to-day media queries, under the direction of the Government Press Secretary.</p>  <p>  A key part of the modernisation of Government communications is the greater use of social media.  Recent initiatives in my department such as videos relating to Ireland's Rugby World cup bid, information about going back to school, the budget and Treatment Benefits cost approximately &euro;21,895 in total.  Sponsored posts appeared on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.</p>  <p>  I meet with the Director of the Strategic Communications Unit and all of the senior officials in my Department on a regular basis as part of the sub group of the Civil Service Management Board.  The Strategic Communications Unit is a unit within my Department and, therefore, meets with Departmental officials on a regular and ongoing basis.</p></reply>

I was accompanied by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty, and the Minister for European Affairs, Helen McEntee. </p>  <p>  EU Heads of State and Government were joined by social partners and other stakeholders for an open discussion on how to promote fair jobs and growth in the future.  There was a plenary session, followed by three parallel working sessions.  I participated in the second, on the subject of fair employment and working conditions.</p>  <p>  At the Summit, the Interinstitutional Proclamation on the European Pillar of Social Rights was formally signed by the Presidents of the Commission and Parliament, and on behalf of the Council by the Estonian Prime Minister, Mr Ratas.</p>  <p>  The Social Summit was followed by a working lunch for Leaders chaired by European Council President Donald Tusk.  This was the first in a series of discussions under his Leaders' Agenda, as endorsed by the October European Council, and it focused on education and culture.</p>  <p>  There was no discussion on Northern Ireland at the Social Summit in Gothenburg.</p>  <p>  In the margins of the Summit, I met with Prime Minister May.  We discussed the ongoing political situation in Northern Ireland and agreed that our two governments would continue to engage with the parties to support and encourage them to reach agreement on the formation of a Northern Ireland Executive.</p>  <p>  On Brexit, I reiterated the position of the EU 27 that greater clarity and confidence on how a hard border is to be avoided was needed before we could say that sufficient progress had been made to allow negotiations to move to Phase two.</p>  <p>  I have consistently maintained that protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process is a key priority, not just for Ireland but for all remaining 27 Member States.  Given that the UK Government has said that the UK should leave the Single Market and the Customs Union, the onus is on it to indicate how the commitment to avoiding a hard border is to be realised in that context.</p></reply>

The Court's Recommendation followed a referral to the Court under Section 20(1) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969.  While referrals under that Section of the Act requires the referring party to agree to be bound by the Court&rsquo;s Recommendation, there is no obligation on the other party to be bound by, or to accept, the Recommendation.  In the current instance, the responding party, as is their right, did not attend the hearing of the Court and the Court did not have the benefit of their views in framing its Recommendation.</p><p>On the separate issue of trade union recognition that the deputy has raised, it is the case that Article 40 of the Irish Constitution guarantees the right of citizens to form associations and unions.  It has been established, however, in a number of legal cases that the constitutional guarantee of the freedom of association does not guarantee workers the right to have their union recognized for the purpose of collective bargaining.</p><p>It has been the consistent policy of successive Irish Governments to promote collective bargaining through the laws of this country and through the development of an institutional framework supportive of a voluntary system of industrial relations that is premised upon freedom of contract and freedom of association.  There is an extensive range of statutory provisions designed to back up the voluntary bargaining process.</p><p>The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 which came into effect on 1 August 2015 provides an improved framework in this area to facilitate employees&rsquo; right to engage in collective bargaining.  The 2015 Act provides a clear and balanced mechanism by which the fairness of the employment conditions of workers in their totality can be assessed where collective bargaining does not take place.</p><p>It ensures that such workers, aided by a trade union even where the trade union is not formally recognized by the employer, can advance claims about remuneration and conditions of employment and have these determined by the Labour Court based on comparisons with similar companies.  It provides definitions of key terms as well as guidelines to help the Labour Court identify if internal bargaining bodies are genuinely independent of their employer, and it provides policies and principles for the Labour Court to follow when assessing the comparability of the remuneration and conditions in dispute.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is essentially voluntary in nature, and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers, rests primarily with the employer, the workers and their representatives. </p><p>As an independent adjudicative body, the Labour Court has discharged its statutory function in this matter and as Minister, I have no function in relation to this issue.</p></reply>

Employment in these sectors has increased gradually each year since 2011, with an increase of over 35% in the period of Q2 2011 to Q1 2017 &ndash; an increase of 40,500 jobs in the sector.  The rate of increase in employment in this sector was significantly greater than the overall level of employment increase.  In terms of overseas trips to Ireland by non-residents, the number of trips increased from 6.5 million in 2011 to 9.6 million in 2016, an increase of 48%.  However, these benefits could be attributed to other factors, such as the general and very strong recovery in the economy and better economic performance in the target markets.</p>  <p>  I decided in Budget 2018 not to make any change to the 9% VAT rate as it continues to benefit the tourism sector throughout the country and any change in the rate could impact greatly on the tourism sector outside of the capital.  I am also conscious of the impact the decline in the value of Sterling is having on UK visitor numbers and how any increase in the VAT rate might exacerbate this. </p>  <p>  However, I accept that the 9% VAT rate must be subject to ongoing analysis.  In this context I have asked my Department to undertake a comprehensive study of all aspects of the 9% VAT rate ahead of next year&rsquo;s Budget.</p></reply>

Finance Bill 2017 contains transitional measures in relation to extending the previous 2% rate for certain transactions that would have reached an advanced stage in the sale process before Budget day on 10 October 2017.  The 2% rate of stamp duty applies where the seller and purchaser entered into a contract that was binding on both of the parties before 10 October 2017 and where the conveyance is executed on or before 31 December 2017.  I do not propose to broaden the scope of these transitional measures. </p>  <p>  It is not possible to be definitive about whether the payment of a deposit would mean that a purchaser had entered into a binding contract for the purchase of a property or whether the deposit was merely a stage in the process leading up to a binding contract.

The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans. </p><p>Seven Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) have been identified in County Louth as follows: Baltray, Annagassan, Ardee, Dundalk &amp;amp; Blackrock South, Carlingford &amp;amp; Greenore, Termonfeckin and Drogheda.  The feasible measures both structural and non-structural identified for these AFAs are contained in the final plans for the East and North Western &ndash; Neagh Bann CFRAM studies. </p><p>These Plans are currently undergoing an independent review of the strategic level environmental assessments by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Once this independent review of all Plans is completed and observations addressed, I would hope by the end of this year to seek the approval from the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for the Flood Risk Management Plans.  Thereafter, I would hope to announce the proposed structural measures contained within the Plans that will, over the coming years, be taken to detailed design to protect those communities at assessed risk.</p><p>Outside of the CFRAM study areas, Louth County Council has responsibility for investigating and addressing issues of coastal protection and flooding in their area and can apply for funding to carry out proposed works under the OPW Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.

The Report sets out a number of proposals to develop a long term sustainable funding model.  I look forward to receiving the Committee's recommendations.  This will assist in facilitating informed decision-making for the future direction of funding for higher education.</p>  <p>  While the Committee are undertaking this important work, I have been working in the interim to secure additional funding for higher education to address, inter alia, rising demographics.  This commitment is reflected in the recent Budget 2018 announcement in which the higher education sector will benefit from a total investment package of &euro;60m in additional funding in 2018.  This funding is on top of the &euro;36.5m that I secured for 2017 and which is being provided again in 2018.  In total, we will be investing &euro;100m more in higher education in 2018 than in 2016.  This additional funding will allow for targeted initiatives in higher education and will allow for places to be provided for 2,100 additional students in 2018. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, the Government increased Exchequer funding to higher education by &euro;36.5 million and announced a consultation exercise to consider an Employer-Exchequer Investment Mechanism.  This reflected the recommendation in the Report of  the Expert Group on Future Funding of Higher Education that a structured contribution from employers should form a key element of future funding for higher education as employers are major beneficiaries of higher education.</p>  <p>  Following a public consultation process on a proposed Exchequer-Employer Investment Mechanism earlier this year, it was announced in Budget 2018 that the National Training Fund levy will be raised by 0.1% in 2018 from 0.7% to 0.8% and by a further 0.1% in both 2019 and 2020.  This measure allows for additional expenditure of &euro;47.5 million from the Fund in 2018.  The 2019 and 2020 levy increases will be subject to the implementation of the necessary reforms to ensure that employers have a greater role in determining the priorities and the strategic direction of the Fund.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Exchequer will also make an additional investment of &euro;17m in 2018.  Together this will facilitate an increase of &euro;64.5 million in the Department&rsquo;s expenditure ceiling.  This will be used to fund initiatives in the higher education system including targeted skills programmes, performance and innovation funding, technological university development and apprenticeship costs in the higher education sector.</p>  <p>  Also, following the review of the Capital Plan, a total of &euro;357m in capital funding is now available for investment in higher education over the period 2018-2021.</p>  <p>   As set out in the Programme for Government, this comprehensive approach is being taken in order to achieve a sustainable funding model for the higher education sector going forward.  It will be important to build broad political and societal consensus in realising this goal and my Department and I continue to work towards that end.</p></reply>

Findings from research commissioned by the NCCA showed that the quality of engagement &ndash; with the schools, with teachers and with learning &ndash; is central to this phase of education.  ESRI research highlighted that a number of students were not progressing in first year, more were disengaging in second year and that were also students not developing their particular skills and interests.   These findings were further underpinned when the OECDs Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) results for Irish 15 year olds were published, showing a decline in reading and maths scores.  These combined findings indicated that the junior cycle in the existing format did not meet the needs of students and a failure to reform the junior cycle would see a continuation of this decline.</p>  <p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle gives students the opportunity to develop a wider range of knowledge and skills to equip them for further learning, for work, for responsible and active citizenship and for healthy living.  It gives students better learning opportunities and recognises non-academic achievement.</p></reply>

By definition this includes all functions currently carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  - community safety, security and immigration.  The Commission is also to examine the full range of bodies that have a role in providing oversight and accountability for their activities; the Policing Authority, the Garda Inspectorate, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, my Department and the Government.  The terms of reference require the Commission to bring forward proposals addressing five themes:</p><p>-  structures and management arrangements required for the most effective delivery of policing (including all functions currently carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na), </p><p>-  appropriate composition, recruitment and training of personnel,</p><p>-  culture and ethos of policing, </p><p>-  appropriate structures for oversight and accountability, and</p><p>-  legislative framework for policing.</p><p>In relation to the theme of structures I would draw the Deputy's attention to the specific term of reference which requires the Commission to bring forward proposals in relation to the most appropriate structures for delivering all aspects of policing, whether a unitary structure or otherwise. </p><p>The terms of reference also call on the Commission to have regard to:</p><p>-  existing and emerging issues identified as key challenges for Ireland&rsquo;s model of policing,</p><p>-  best practices in the policing models of other countries focused towards greater effectiveness and efficiency, and fostering public confidence in policing,</p><p>-  previous reports concerning policing in Ireland,</p><p>-  any specific challenges to delivering consistent structural and cultural reform in policing. </p><p>The terms of reference require the Commission to consult widely in the course of its work, including with the public and civic society and any other bodies or individuals it considers appropriate.  In line with this requirement, the Commission has launched a consultation process via its website and is encouraging individuals and organisations to share their views on all issues relevant to the Commission&rsquo;s terms of reference as an important input to the Commission&rsquo;s report.</p><p>The Commission is to report by September 2018 and it may, in accordance with its terms of reference, bring forward immediate proposals and rolling recommendations for implementation that it considers are required to be addressed in the short-term and in advance of its final report.</p><p>I met with the Chair of the Commission, Ms Kathleen O'Toole, very recently and she has updated me on their work to date.  The Commission has met with a wide range of key stakeholders including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda Inspectorate, the Policing Authority and my Department.  It has also engaged with policing and security practitioners in other jurisdictions to gain insights into other policing models and oversight arrangements.  Members of the Commission also met political representatives in the Houses recently to hear their views.  I understand that the Commission will continue to engage with bodies key to the future of policing in Ireland over the coming months.  To date the Commission has made no recommendations with regard to how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be structured into the future. </p><p>It is important that the Commission be afforded the time to complete the important and challenging task that has been set for it.  I look forward to receiving the Commission's final report by next September and any interim reports that it may make in the meantime.  </p></reply>

Various categories of cases reverted to the IPO including asylum appeals transferred from the former Refugee Appeals Tribunal and asylum and subsidiary protection cases transferred from the former ORAC.  This has added significantly to the IPO&rsquo;s caseload.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that considerable progress has been made by the IPO in getting the new single procedure process up and running.  To date, the IPO has scheduled over 2,000 single procedure interviews (including in respect of EU relocation cases).  More than 150 additional interviews have been scheduled in the IPO for the coming weeks with more interviews being scheduled on a daily basis.  Some 1,400 recommendations/decisions in respect of international protection and permission to remain have also been made by the IPO.  This includes some 600 recommendations in respect of the grant of international protection.</p>  <p>  At the present time, it is not possible to calculate an accurate current median processing time for international protection applications due to the different case types on hands, which were returned to the IPO under the transitional provisions in the 2015 Act.  Considerable additional resources, have and are, being allocated to the IPO to assist it in undertaking its statutory functions with a view to processing the volume of cases on hands as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  In relation to the scheduling of interviews and the processing of cases in the IPO, I am also advised that the prioritisation of international protection applications is provided for in the International Protection Act 2015 subject to the need for fairness and efficiency.  When the Application for International Protection Questionnaire (IPO 2) and other supporting documentation is returned by applicants, the IPO is scheduling applications for interview primarily on the basis of date of application (oldest cases first).  However, certain categories of applicant are also being prioritised such as those from refugee generating countries (such as Syria) and unaccompanied minors.  The IPO&rsquo;s approach to prioritisation has been agreed with the UNHCR and is available on its website: www.ipo.gov.ie.</p></reply>

It proposed to provide for the possibility of a verdict of Iatrogenic Suicide at a coroner's inquest.  The primary motivation for the Bill derived from the tragic experience of the family of Jake McGill Lynch.</p>  <p>  While accepting that the Senator&rsquo;s intentions were well motivated, the Government could not accept the Bill as such would risk its use at inquest as being interpreted as apportioning some liability on the medical practitioner who may have prescribed any form of treatment or medication to the deceased person prior to taking his or her own life.  As the inquest is an inquisitorial process, it is not permitted to consider questions of civil or criminal liability under section 30 of the Coroners Act 1962.</p>  <p>  The Government had received the advice of the Office of the Attorney General on the Bill to the effect that to introduce a verdict of iatrogenic suicide at inquest would be legally unsound.  </p>  <p>  The Coroners Society of Ireland indicated that it is very much opposed to this proposal, not least given that it might require coroners to reach verdicts that would infer liability on a medical practitioner.</p>  <p>  I believe that a sufficient range of verdicts is available to coroners to draw on in the context of the cases envisaged by the Private Members Bill including those of suicide, open or medical misadventure. </p>  <p>  While I express again my deepest condolences to the family I must make it clear, that the Government does not propose to change the law in this regard.</p>  <p>  That said, I have no objections to meeting with the family at a suitable date.</p></reply>

In this regard consideration of the welfare and best interests of children born through AHR is a key principle underpinning the Scheme.  The wellbeing of women involved in AHR procedures also requires special attention, as women are the main recipients of such interventions due to their biological role in pregnancy and childbirth. </p>  <p>  The General Scheme sets out specific criteria for the provision of AHR treatment.  In addition, the Scheme states that the AHR treatment provider would have to consider the welfare of the child in making the final decision whether or not to provide AHR treatment. </p>  <p>  Those providing AHR treatment need to make a clinical assessment of any prospective patient and ensure that AHR treatment does not represent a disproportionate risk to the health of the patient or to the health of any potential child.  Female age is one of the main factors affecting the outcome of AHR and a woman&rsquo;s ability to conceive a child inevitably reduces with age.  In light of these considerations, the General Scheme sets an upper age limit of 47 years for women for the provision of AHR treatment.</p></reply>

The Deputy may be familiar with the background to the closure of both the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant schemes in February 2013.  Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.  The Health Service Executive has advised that there are currently 4,133 individuals in receipt of this payment.</p><p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Programme for a Partnership Government<i></i>acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs.  The Government's legislative programme for 2017 includes the Health (Transport Support) Bill.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.  The proposals seek to ensure that: </p><p>- There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation; </p><p>- There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme; </p><p>- Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and </p><p>- The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p><p>The draft General Scheme and Heads of Bill were circulated to other government Departments and have been the subject of consultation between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  When the consultation with other relevant Departments has been completed, the next step will be to seek Government approval to the drafting of a Bill for the new Scheme.</p><p>It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.</p><p>Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular Scheme.</p></reply>

On the contrary, the National Maternity Strategy recognises pregnancy and birth as a normal physiological process.  It recognises that all pregnant women require a certain level of support and that some will need more specialised care.  As such, it proposes a woman-centred and integrated care model that encompasses all the necessary safety nets in line with patient safety principles, which delivers care at the lowest level of complexity.  Equally, the model has the capacity and ability to provide specialised and complex care, quickly, as required.  </p><p>In terms of induction rates, the fact is that pregnancy care in Ireland has become more complex.  More challenging cases arise due to increases in obesity levels, diabetes, average age of primigravidas, assisted reproduction, multiple pregnancies etc.  However, we have established a National Programme for Women &amp;amp; Infants Health within the HSE, to drive improvements in maternity services.  In addition, the Programme will lead on the implementation of the National Maternity Strategy.  </p><p>The Deputy may find the following data sources useful: </p><p>1. The Irish Maternity Indicator System (IMIS)  ;</p><p>2. The Maternity Patient Safety Statement (MPSS) .</p><p>In particular, the 2014 &amp;amp; 2015 IMIS reports includes data showing the range of the rate of induction of first time mothers at hospital/unit level for those years, while the national induction rate of all mothers for the years 2008 &ndash; 2014 is available in the 2014 IMIS report.  In addition, since December 2015, the Maternity Patient Safety Statements have detailed the monthly rate of induction, including of first time mothers.  While I am not sure if the further information requested by the Deputy is readily available, I have asked the HSE to reply to you directly with whatever information may be available.</p></reply>

Latest data from September 2017 shows that the public/private mix at a system level stands at 82% public for elective in-patient work and at almost 86% for day-case work.  This is consistent with the typical 80/20 split provided for in the consultant contract. </p>  <p>  The Contract allows consultants engage in differing levels of private practice, depending on the contract type held.  Consultants holding a Type A contract are not permitted to engage in privately remunerated professional practice.  Consultants holding a Type B contract may undertake private practice on-site, up to a limit of 20% of activity on a casemix-adjusted basis, and limited off-site private practice in cases where the individual consultant previously held a Category I or Category II contract under Consultant Contract 1997.  Serving consultants whose public to private ratio in 2006 was greater than 20% are permitted to retain this higher ratio, subject to an overriding maximum ratio of 70:30%.  Consultants holding a B* Contract or a Type C Contract may engage in off-site private practice.  Their in-patient and out-patient private practice activity is also subject to maximum limits.</p>  <p>  Arrangements concerning implementation and monitoring of Consultant Contract 2008, including the provisions in relation to private practice, are matters for the HSE in the first instance.  Section 20 of the Contract provides a framework for the regulation of private practice, monitoring of the applicable ratio and steps to be taken where it is exceeded.  It is incumbent on publicly-funded hospitals to ensure compliance with the terms of the contract, including the provisions in relation to private practice. </p>  <p>  My Department has written to the HSE in recent months requesting that the HSE satisfy itself that no consultant is engaged, or will be permitted to engage, in private practice beyond the level, if any, provided for in their contract.  I have asked the HSE to ensure that more robust measures are in place in 2018 to make sure consultants comply with their contractual obligations. </p></reply>

The design and management of the programme are primarily matters for the local project team, who will work closely with my Department, as this is rolled-out.   </p>  <p>  The design work for the new Hen Harrier programme has already commenced following the appointment of a locally-led Project Team earlier this year.  The Project Team has now completed a series of consultation meetings with farmers in the six designated Hen Harrier Special Protected Areas (SPAs), which more than 500 farmers attended.  A seminar for advisors took place in September, and comprehensive training courses are planned for January 2018 and May 2018.  The scientific officers in the team have carried out Hen Harrier monitoring in all SPAs and preliminary results from this campaign will be available within weeks.  Work is also progressing on detailed Terms &amp;amp; Conditions for the new programme.  </p>  <p>  I understand that the first expressions of interest from farmers in taking part in the new programme will be invited before the end of 2017.  Unlike other schemes, the new hen-harrier programme will not be tied to calendar years and this provides for greater flexibility in both recruitment and payment.  The programme will be action based, with a result based approach.  Most importantly it will be farmer led and tailored to each individual SPA.</p>  <p>  I would like to clarify that my Department has no role in the designation of lands.  That function is exercised through the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The question of compensation does not arise, therefore, in the context of any schemes or measures introduced by my Department.</p>  <p>  I have allocated a budget of &euro;25 million for the hen harrier programme.  It is worth noting that a significant framework of support for farmers with hen-harrier designated land is already in place through my Department's agri-environment scheme GLAS.  Under GLAS, farmers with hen harrier habitat qualify for a payment of &euro;370 per hectare and can earn up to &euro;7,000 per annum through a combination of GLAS and GLAS Plus payments.  The GLAS Hen Harrier action has proved hugely successful, with some 2,678 farmers now signed up.  This accounts for almost 70% of all farmers with hen harrier habitat and represents a major step forward in the conservation of the bird and in securing important additional income for the farmers concerned.</p></reply>

As part of the initial ground work to Food Wise 2025, a public consultation took place which involved 15 background papers and a questionnaire.  These included a particular focus on climate change and sustainability. </p>  <p>  We are committed to ensuring that the sector continues to grow sustainably so that Ireland can play its part in meeting the increasing global food demand while having regard to Ireland&rsquo;s climate obligations.  It is independently and internationally recognised that ours is a climate and resource efficient agri-food production system and we are working with all stakeholders to find even greater efficiencies. </p>  <p>  A number of initiatives are being undertaken to make the farming sector even more environmentally sustainable, including measures under the Rural Development Programme (RDP), which is worth almost &euro;4 billion over 7 years.  The Department&rsquo;s implementation of its RDP has seen significant focus on the targeting of support interventions.  This Programme is aimed strongly towards environmental benefits, including knowledge transfer programmes, which will bring the latest innovative sustainability research and practices direct to farmers. </p>  <p>  The Knowledge Transfer Programme supports the roll-out of best practice on farms, while improved efficiency of the national suckler herd is being achieved through the Beef Data and Genomics scheme.</p>  <p>  The Agri-Environment scheme GLAS has 50,000 participants.  It is based on prioritised eligibility based on environmental objectives such as hedgerow and tree planting, minimum tillage and encouraging the sustainable management of upland peatlands.</p>  <p>  In tandem there is a focus on sustainability through the &lsquo;Origin Green&rsquo; programme.  Under the Origin Green programme Ireland is a world leader in areas such as sustainable auditing and carbon foot-printing.  Origin Green is a strategic priority in Food Wise 2025. </p>  <p>  Initiatives such as the Carbon Navigator tool also assist, as does Teagasc through its advisory, research and education programmes. </p>  <p>  The Pasture Profit Index and the Agricultural Catchments Programme help to reduce carbon emissions per unit of output produced and protect our rivers. </p>  <p>  Furthermore the establishment and maintenance of landscape features (for example Ecological Focus Areas under CAP Pillar I) can assist with achieving other environmental objectives which are expected of land, such as water and biodiversity management, in addition to carbon sequestration benefits.</p>  <p>  Regarding renewable energy Anaerobic Digesters (AD), to date, this has played a limited role in promoting and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions as methane emissions from the storage and management of animal slurries only compose approx. 12% of the total methane emissions arising from agriculture and the scale of Irish farms are small.  Methane accounts for approximately 22% of Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions and, of this, approximately 12% of methane emissions result from the storage and management of animal manures.</p>  <p>  It remains however an opportunity to recover methane with consequent climate change benefits.  AD plants can take in waste animal products including slurry, meat products, waste food, silage etc.  The gas produced in an AD plant may be used to produce electricity, through a Combined Heat and Power unit (CHP), or may be used to supply &ldquo;Green Gas&rdquo; (biomethane) to the gas network.              </p>  <p>  Afforestation is the main cost effective land based climate mitigation tool available to Ireland including the provision of sustainable source of wood biomass for energy purposes.</p>  <p>  Forests have the potential to sequester and store large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which can then be harvested as wood products, and these continue to store carbon over the long term and be employed as a sustainable source of fuel.  In this way forests directly sequester carbon and substitute other materials that are associated with high levels of emissions such as steel, concrete and fossil fuels.  Forests will play an important role in meeting EU emissions reductions targets during the 2021-2030 period.</p>  <p>  Over the period 2021 to 2030, projections show that 4.5 MT of CO2 eq may be removed annually from the atmosphere by afforestation that has occurred since 1990.  Based on proposed accounting rules under the LULUCF proposal 2.2 MT of CO2 eq is forecast to be accountable against our Effort Sharing Regulation targets from afforestation.  In 2016 6,500 ha of new forests were planted in Ireland under the afforestation scheme.  The overall target is to expand Ireland&rsquo;s forest estate from 11% to 18% by mid-century.</p>  <p>  Agriculture and afforestation are intrinsically linked in Ireland.  Every new hectare of afforestation comes directly from agriculture.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to invest in and engage in initiatives aimed at sustainable farming, climate change mitigation and renewable energy.</p></reply>

Neonicotinoid insecticides, like all insecticides, can be harmful to bees but there is conflicting scientific evidence regarding the conditions under which they may cause harm.  </p>  <p>  The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is currently undertaking an assessment of the risks posed by neonicotinoids to take account of all new and relevant information that has become available since 2013.  This assessment is expected to be completed by the end of February 2018.  This will then form the scientific basis for a further Commission proposal expected next year. </p>  <p>  My Department's position on any Commission proposal will be informed by the outcome of the EFSA assessment.  In the interim, we are aware of a draft proposal from the EU Commission to restrict neonicotinoid use to indoor/glasshouse use, where exposure to pollinators can be directly controlled.  This proposal will be examined in detail when it is presented.</p></reply>

No. 125 of 2016) establishes a point system, which will apply to the Licence Holder of a sea-fishing boat when a serious infringement of the Common Fisheries Policy is detected.  It is intended that the new Statutory instrument which I intend to sign shortly will replace S.I. No. 125 of 2016 to change the make-up of the Determination Panel set up under the 2016 S.I. to determine if on the balance of probabilities an infringement occurred and whether it is a serious infringement.  This will involve the appointment of three independent legal professionals nominated by the Attorney General, thereby completely separating the enforcement and the determination functions.  The new SI will, to the extent possible, take on board the issues of concern in relation to procedures and processes highlighted in High Court judgments on this matter.  It will also address certain minor technical and drafting issues arising in S.I. No. 125 of 2016.</p>  <p>  In relation to stakeholder consultation, I discussed with industry representatives my plans to bring forward a new SI at the Sea Fisheries Liaison Group meeting on 20 October 2017 and explained the amendments I am planning and the justification for these amendments.  I can confirm to the Deputy that no further additional amendments are planned other than those outlined above and as discussed at the meeting of 20 October 2017.</p>  <p>  In relation to feedback, the main issue raised by industry representatives at that meeting was their preference for a system of sequential application of EU points in conjunction with the prosecution process.</p>  <p>  I advised attendees that there has been extensive examination and consideration of all the issues in relation to meeting our EU obligations to implement the points system.  I indicated that the firm legal view available to me is that it is not possible to deliver on an effective and dissuasive points system, as required under EU law, by assigning points to licence holders upon successful prosecution.</p>  <p>  I informed the meeting that Pilot Infringement proceedings by the EU Commission for non-implementation of the EU points system have been taken against Ireland.  It remains an option for the EU Commission to proceed to formal infringement proceedings in respect of the licence holders system. </p>  <p>  I also indicated at the meeting that there are also serious implications with regard to the release of funding under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF).  Implementation of the EU Points system was an ex-ante conditionality for the approval of Ireland&rsquo;s European Maritime Fisheries Fund Programme, given that the programme is intended to facilitate implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy in Ireland.  The EU Commission has signalled in writing that the delivery of funding under Ireland&rsquo;s EMFF Operational Programme is firmly linked to the implementation of the points system.  This programme is investing &euro;241m of EU/Exchequer funding in total in the fisheries sector over the lifetime of the programme, which is crucial at a time of Brexit uncertainty.  The immediate concern is with regard to the control and data collection funds.  The EU Commission wrote in July 2017 advising that due to the non implementation of the Points system, EMFF funding allocated for control spend will be suspended.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the new system being impartial, it is intended in this regard that the new SI will provide for the independence of both the members of the Determination Panel and the Fisheries Adjudicator in the performance of their functions.</p>  <p>  In relation to rights of appeal, it is intended that the new S.I. will provide for a right to appeal to an independent Fisheries Adjudicator if the licence holder is dissatisfied with the determination of the Determination Panel.  The Adjudicator is a legal person appointed by the Minister.  </p>  <p>  It is also intended that under the new S.I. the licence holder may appeal on a point of law a decision of the independent Fisheries Adjudicator to the High Court.  In the 2014 S.I., this appeal was &ldquo;final and conclusive&rdquo; - this aspect of the provision has been removed.</p>  <p>  Having an effective, proportionate and dissuasive system of points for all fishing vessels, Irish and non Irish, operating in our 200 mile zone is beneficial to maintaining the sustainability of fish stocks on which our seafood sector is dependant.  This system will ensure that the vast majority of our law abiding fishermen are able to compete effectively and look forward to a sustainable future in the industry.</p></reply>

I am confident that, as market demand for safe, sustainable, high quality dairy products in expanding global markets increases, the Irish dairy sector, from the farm gate to the further reaches of the supply chain, will continue to grow and prosper.</p>  <p>  I am very aware of the impact of Storm Ophelia, particularly of course the tragic loss of life.  I would like to again pay tribute to the joined-up public service response, led by the National Emergency Coordination Group, including officials from my Department.</p>  <p>  The main impact of the storm on the dairy sector was in terms of  power outages.  While this caused inconvenience and expense for some individual farmers, similar issues arose for small businesses across the country. ESB teams worked tirelessly to reconnect electricity supplies.  Many farmers also benefitted from back up generators shared between neighbours and at co-op level. </p>  <p>  While compensation for power outages is not an option, this experience underlines the importance for dairy farmers to have a plan in place to access a back-up power supply in such circumstances.</p></reply>

It has also been analysing the potential practical impact on the day-to-day functioning of trade flows, as well as potential WTO tariffs that might be applied to Ireland's agri-food exports to the UK in the event of a 'hard' Brexit. </p>  <p>  The agencies reporting to my Department have also undertaken important research in relation to Brexit, with Teagasc publishing reports on, for example, the potential implications for the Irish agri-food sector in overall terms and on the implications for family farm incomes, and Bord Bia conducting important work through its Brexit Barometer. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is in contact with the relevant agencies and with other Departments to co-ordinate further research on the implications of Brexit for the agri-food industry.</p></reply>

It confirms that Ireland will be the most severely affected of the EU27 Member States, and that the agri-food sector is the most exposed sector of the economy.  This is because of its particular reliance on the UK market and the highly integrated nature of Ireland-UK agri-food trade.  These findings are consistent with our own assessment. </p>  <p>  Ireland's approach to the negotiations on the future relationship will be to ensure that the future EU-UK trading relationship will be as close to the current arrangements as possible, thereby minimising the potential impact on the Irish agri-food sector.  The position of all of the parties to the negotiation is that there should be no hard border on the island of Ireland. </p>  <p>  The phasing of the negotiation requires sufficient progress to be made on exit issues relating to the rights of citiizens, the UK's financial obligations and the island of Ireland before the discussion can move to the future relationship. </p>  <p>  Progress is being made in some areas, but further clarity will be required, including on island of Ireland issues, before the European Council can determine that sufficient progress has been made to move to the next phase.</p></reply>

There are issues with a small number of cases and these are being resolved on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  The main issue holding up the payment of outstanding 2016 claims, which will also hold up 2017 advance payments, is the fact that some participants have not yet submitted a Nutrient Management Plan (NMP).  This is a core requirement of participation in GLAS.  As of November 17th there were 3,800 NMPs outstanding.  All GLAS participants with outstanding NMPs have been contacted and urged to attend to this urgently so that outstanding balancing payments and future payments can issue and to ensure ongoing participation in the GLAS Scheme.</p></reply>

Renewable technologies supported under the REFIT schemes include onshore wind, hydro, biomass landfill gas, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power (CHP) and anaerobic digestion CHP.  At present, neither ocean energy technologies nor solar photovoltaic (Solar PV), for electricity generation, are supported under any of these REFIT schemes.  This is largely down to the historic higher costs associated with both technologies relative to other commercial renewable technologies.</p>  <p>  The 2015 Energy White Paper and the 2016 Programme for Government recognise that Ireland&rsquo;s long-term interests are best supported by further decreasing our dependence on foreign fossil fuels through the continued development of indigenous renewable energy.  To support the delivery of this ambition, my Department is currently developing a proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which will be designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions out to 2030.</p>  <p>  The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal.  This appraisal compared the cost of supporting a broad range of commercial renewable technologies, including ocean technologies (both wave and tidal) and solar PV, in addition to offshore wind, onshore wind, bioenergy technologies including biomass combustion, biomass CHP, anaerobic digestion CHP, sewage gas, BioGas and waste-to-energy. </p>  <p>  While at this point no final decisions have been made as regards which technologies will be supported, I welcome and have noted with interest the falling costs of renewable technologies over the past year, such as offshore wind and solar PV.  Increasing renewable technology diversity is one of several policy objectives the new RESS is trying to deliver and falling technology costs may lead to increased diversity of the renewable portfolio over the medium term.</p></reply>

Diplomatic channels were used to ensure that the quality of our bid was recognised at all levels in voting countries.  I myself contacted the UK Secretary of State with responsibility for sport, Karen Bradley, MP and had a detailed conference call with the Under Secretary, Minister Tracey Crouch.</p>  <p>  Everything that was requested of the Governments was provided including guarantees and the payment of the tournament fee.  The IRFU has acknowledged that they received the full support of the Governments.  I do not believe that the bid team, who considered the merits of a possible digital campaign, fell short in their preparation or lobbying.  In the end, it was not our day.</p></reply>

It is clear that this, particularly in the couple of years up to 2016, has also affected those working within the Small Public Service Vehicle (SPSV) industry.  While I am informed that there some early signs that this trend is beginning to revert, with recent CSO figures showing that motor premiums generally were 14% lower in September 2017 compared with a year earlier, it is certainly concerning to hear of some very significant motor insurance premium increases, such as cited by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  As he may be aware, the pricing of insurance products is a commercial issue for insurance companies, based on an assessment of the risks that they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I am keenly aware of how insurance issues are affecting the taxi industry.  As the Deputy may also be aware, the Department of Finance Working Group&rsquo;s Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January of this year.  Based on recommendations from this report, the Advisory Committee on SPSVs met with Insurance Ireland on 22 May to discuss cost of insurance issues relating to the taxi industry and a report on the same was issued to me on 21 June.  I have forwarded that report to the aforementioned Working Group, which is already pursuing many of the recommendations arising from the meeting, including the need for further engagement to take place between the Advisory Committee on SPSVs and Insurance Ireland.</p>  <p>  It is my hope that this cooperation and engagement will deliver better rates for all motorists, including taxi drivers.</p></reply>

That does not take away from the excellent work that was done in preparing our bid.  </p>  <p>  The question as to whether or not the bid might have been altered is a matter in the first instance for the IRFU.  This I am sure will be a matter for reflection over the coming weeks and months.  For my part I responded positively to every request that was made of me to ensure that Government support was available at all times.</p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government also has several important commitments on land transport.</p>  <p>  Our Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport (SIFLT), published in 2015, identified a number of implementation priorities and actions for the land transport sector.  The National Transport Authority (NTA) published a Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035, which provides a framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services in the GDA over the next two decades that will be the subject to a number of influencing factors including funding availability.  Other strategic pieces of work that either have only recently, or are expected shortly, to come to completion include: the Mid-Term review of the Capital Plan which has provided enhanced capital allocations for the coming 4-year period; the 10-year National Investment Plan to be published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that will include Exchequer funding envelopes for the period up to 2027; the Rail Review and recent consultation by the NTA; and the Government&rsquo;s forthcoming new National Planning Framework which is being finalised under the leadership of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  All of these will be key enablers to ensuring the development of efficient and effective transport in all areas of the country.</p>  <p>  In the public transport area, we have a shareholder role for the main service providers.  The land transport sector also has a number of agencies: the NTA, the Commission for Railway Regulation, Road Safety Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  Each has important statutory functions and responsibilities in various aspects of land transport regulation, planning, funding and delivery.  We work closely with all of these service providers and agencies, providing policy and legislative leadership, aggregate funding, and governance oversight. </p></reply>

This will pave the way for an intensive construction programme commencing substantially in 2019;</p>  <p>  -  Additional Luas capacity, with additional trams and longer trams on the Luas Network;</p>  <p>  -  Maintaining the heavy rail network to protect investment already made in our national railway system; </p>  <p>  -  Progressing the City Centre Re-signalling Project to improve speeds on mainline rail and the new rail Central Traffic Control Centre.</p>  <p>  -  Continuing the programme of retro-fitting older existing public transport facilities to improve their accessibility features;</p>  <p>  -  Traffic management, bus priority and other smarter travel projects in our cities.</p>  <p>  -  Piloting of emerging low emission technologies, particularly for buses, and also measures to encourage the transition of the national taxi fleet towards alternative fuels and technologies;</p>  <p>  -  Planning and design work for new Metro North.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2018 provided a four-year capital envelope for public transport of over &euro;2.7 billion to 2021.  As I have previously outlined to the Deputy, this includes a multi-annual capital envelope of over &euro;770 million for the BusConnects programme.  This significant funding will enable us to put in place the kind of bus system that is needed to cater for Ireland&rsquo;s future economic growth and growing transport needs, with high quality infrastructure and services, coupled with major improvements in ticketing and information, all providing a modern, faster, reliable, convenient and attractive public transport solution.</p></reply>

The CSP works on a social-enterprise model which means that it does not fully fund contract holders but requires that they generate revenue by charging fees or raising funds.  All CSP recipients are obliged to meet these criteria.  These social enterprises also remain responsible for their own budgets and financial liabilities. </p><p>The organisation referred to by the Deputy received funding under the CSP for one manager and two full-time equivalent (FTE) posts.  This equates to funding in the order of &euro;70,000 per annum.</p><p>The organisation submitted their business plan in 2016, as part of the normal re-contracting process.  During this process, it was found that the service did not meet the required standards in terms of strategic fit, value for money and the demonstration of the continued need for the service. </p><p>Overall, the review found that the service: </p><p>- Is primarily meeting the needs of a membership base, the majority of which are private businesses.  This is not a priority for continued funding under the CSP which is focused on groups that provide services to specific disadvantaged groups, rather than private businesses; </p><p>- Has low levels of foot-fall and opening hours when compared to other tourism operations supported by the CSP.  Given the service primarily benefits private business, rather that CSP target groups, the funding provided to the organisation does not represent value for money under the Programme; and </p><p>- Has not adequately and clearly articulated what the key needs of their clients are and how they propose to meet them, particularly in terms of the target groups of the CSP. </p><p>As a result of these findings, the service was recommended to exit the CSP on 30th of June 2017. </p><p>This decision was appealed to Pobal on 29th November 2016.  An independent review was carried out which upheld the original decision.  This was communicated to the organisation on 20th December 2016. </p><p>Discussions were held between Pobal and the organisation in January 2017, outlining options for alternative funding post programme exit in June 2017. </p><p>In February 2017 the organisation requested an extension to their contract until 30th of September 2017 to allow them to complete their summer schedule and a timely wind-up of operations.  This extension was facilitated and approved by my Department and an addendum to their contract was issued on 21st of February 2017. </p><p>This organisation has now exhausted the appeals process for the CSP.  For the reasons outlined above, I would now urge them to explore other sources of funding, outside of the CSP, in order to continue operating. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As part of Budget 2017, the funding for the scheme was substantially increased by an additional &euro;5.5 million which is benefitting up to 50,000 additional children from September 2017 bringing the total number of schools in the scheme to some 1,700 and the number of children supported up to 250,000.</p>  <p>  In recent years priority for new applications for funding had been given to schools which are part of the DEIS programme, designed to give tailored support to schools who have high concentration of disadvantage.  The school meals scheme provides funding for a breakfast for all children and lunch for up to 90% of children in DEIS schools.  For the first time in many years, breakfasts are also now available to some schools outside DEIS that have been identified in consultation with the Department of Education and Skills which has developed a more robust and responsive framework for assessing individual schools levels of concentrated disadvantage. </p>  <p>  While there have been expansions to the school meals scheme, any further changes to increase the funding to allow an extension to cr&egrave;ches would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Such payments could include basic supplementary welfare allowance, jobseekers allowance or one-parent family payment and child benefit.  Entitlement is assessed on the basis of the rules of the particular scheme.  Apart from child benefit, payment under these schemes is subject to a means test, with the value of the non-cash benefits which they receive, i.e. accommodation, food and other services, assessed in the means assessment, in line with the legislation governing the means test for each scheme.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s recommended values provided to Deciding Officers and Designated Persons for the assessment of the non-cash benefits are set out in the table.  These amounts are designed to ensure a reasonable consistency between the different categories of people living in direct provision (i.e. between those who have not achieved  status,  who are in receipt of the Direct Provision Allowance, and those who have status and so qualify for general social welfare payments).</p><p>Regarding seeking employment, people in direct provision with the right to seek employment have access to the same suite of employment supports as Irish citizens.  Once they engage with their local Intreo office and receive a jobseekers payment, they will receive assistance by way of education, training and activation supports.  Prior to being directed to activation services, they will be assessed with regard to job readiness and any specific obstacles such as, for example, language difficulties are addressed at this stage. </p><p>In addition, as I previously indicated to the Deputy, Exceptional Needs Payments (ENPs) can be made to persons in the direct provision system, including to support their move from direct provision accommodation into the community.

Therefore, the divorce that took place in the United Kingdom, is not recognised in this State.  Consequently, the deceased&rsquo;s marriage to the applicant is not recognised under Irish State law.</p>  <p>  As the deceased&rsquo;s marriage to the applicant is not recognised under Irish state law, the person concerned does not qualify for widow&rsquo;s contributory pension, and was informed in writing of this decision on 10 November 2017. </p>  <p>  If the person concerned is not satisfied with the deciding officer&rsquo;s decision, they can appeal the decision to the independent Chief Appeals Officer, Social Welfare Appeals Office, D&rsquo;Olier House, D&rsquo;Olier St., Dublin 2.</p>  <p>  Additionally, it is open to the person concerned to apply for Supplementary Welfare Allowance from their local community welfare service accessed through the nearest Intreo Centre, if the resources currently available to her are insufficient to meet her needs. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) and the CRU has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.  </p>  <p> Any business connected to a public water supply is liable for charges as a non-domestic customer.  It should be noted that the arrangements in place for all non-domestic customers on 1 January 2014 remain in place with no changes for the time being.  Non-domestic water tariffs are published by Irish Water online and the charges in Monaghan are available at www.water.ie/for-business/billing-explained/charges/monaghan-county-council/.  This shows that the volumetric charge for water supply services for business customers in Monaghan is &euro;1.01 per m3.</p>  <p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) is progressing a review of all aspects of non-domestic water tariffs and in conjunction with Irish Water will establish an enduring non-domestic tariff framework.  The CRU has published an information note informing customers and interested parties about the project and will shortly engage in a period of public consultation on the enduring tariff framework for non-domestic water and/or wastewater customers of Irish Water. </p>  <p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) also has a statutory responsibility to provide a complaints resolution service to Irish Water customers who have an unresolved dispute with the utility.  A Customer Care Team has been setup within the CRU to deal directly with customers who have complaints.  Further information about CRU's complaints procedure is available on their website at www.cer.ie/customer-care/water/complaints.</p>  <p>   Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

Under the treaties, PESCO is firmly set within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and CSDP.  PESCO is seen as the primary initiative in demonstrating EU ambition in advancing the agenda on CSDP.  In this regard, the establishment of PESCO is seen at EU level as a political demonstration of unity, inclusivity and continuing ambition to provide global leadership, in the face of Brexit and the increased security threats in the European Neighbourhood and beyond.   </p>  <p>  There has been significant engagement by all member States in the development of PESCO to ensure that it fully respects the differing security and defence policies of the member States as reflected in the treaties and the treaty protocols including in respect of the development of the &lsquo;Notification&rsquo; to participate in PESCO.  The &lsquo;Notification&rsquo; document recites treaty and protocol provisions, recalls the EU commitment to multilateralism with the UN at its core with a view to increasing the commitment and contributions that Member States can make towards crisis management.  It also sets out the criteria for participation.  Once a country has agreed to join PESCO it can decide on the projects in which it participates on a case-by-case basis. </p>  <p>  En marge of the Council meeting and prior to the working lunch, 23 Member States signed the PESCO Notification.  The five that did not sign were; the UK due to Brexit, Denmark - which has an opt out on military CSDP matters, Portugal, which I understand intends to participate but has yet to complete its decision making process and Malta which has a very small and limited defence capacity and does not therefore intend to participate at this time.  A further FAC Defence, is scheduled for 11 December in Brussels and at which it is expected that PESCO will be formally launched. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, discussions on PESCO were forward looking on the follow-up to the expected launch of PESCO in December.  Discussion centred on the EU&rsquo;s comprehensive approach, encompassing foreign policy, trade, aid as well as security and addressed the need for PESCO projects to strengthen same and the requirement to also strengthen and reinforce civilian capabilities and crisis management tools.  Regarding budgetary commitments, Ministers noted that commitments should not be seen nor presented as prejudging national parliaments' prerogatives in this area.  Ministers also discussed the need for communication to the wider public. </p>  <p>  To date Ireland has participated in all aspects of CSDP and has thus been able to influence the overall direction of CSDP, in particular ensuring ongoing support for the UN and multilateralism.  Given this and the priority being given to the security and defence agenda by our partners in Europe, it will be important for Ireland to participate in PESCO so as to maintain a central influence on the development of CSDP, but also in terms of ensuring access to the latest developments on military capabilities for our Defence Forces on crisis management operations.</p>  <p>  Participation by Ireland in PESCO will be subject to the approval of the Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in accordance with the provisions of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2009.  I am pleased to advise that the Government has approved Ireland&rsquo;s participation in PESCO and D&aacute;il approval will now be sought.  I am satisfied that participation will contribute to both Ireland's and the EU's enhancement of capabilities for United Nations mandated missions engaged in peace keeping, conflict prevention or the strengthening of international security in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.</p></reply>
