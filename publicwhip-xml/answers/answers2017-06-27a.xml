In my conversations, I reiterated my strong commitment to keeping Ireland at the heart of the Union, and I highlighted the unique difficulties the departure of the UK presents for Ireland.  I was heartened to find broad sympathy for our situation and a commitment to work together to find workable solutions.</p>  <p>  In my discussions with other leaders on the subject of security and defence, I offered Ireland&rsquo;s continuing solidarity with Member States which have suffered from terrorist attacks, and our strong commitment to working closely with partners in combating the growing threat of terrorism. </p>  <p>  On the external dimension of security and defence, the European Council was briefed on implementation of the EU Global Strategy, one year from its adoption.  Ireland continues to work closely with our European partners in ensuring the full implementation of the Global Strategy, which underpins the Union&rsquo;s contribution to international peace and stability. </p>  <p>  On Brexit, Prime Minister May made a presentation, setting out some of her ideas around the issue of citizen&rsquo;s rights.  Later, meeting in its Article 50 format, the European Council heard an update from Michel Barnier on the negotiations with the UK which had commenced earlier that week.  There was general agreement that these had got off to a positive start.  I also updated my interlocutors on recent developments in Northern Ireland, and my meeting with Prime Minister May in London earlier that week.</p>  <p>  On the broader agenda for the European Council, I expressed strong support for EU efforts in relation to jobs, growth and competitiveness, including the emphasis on free and open trade, and said that progress here could have real and positive impacts on the lives of our citizens. </p>  <p>  I highlighted a letter to President Tusk calling for greater ambition in relation to the Digital Single Market that I co-signed with 16 other leaders, and I welcomed the focus of the incoming Estonian Presidency on digital issues. </p>  <p>  The European Council also agreed to renew its commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.  As I stated previously, I am determined that the Government should show new ambition on tackling climate change, and this will be the subject of a full day strategic meeting of the Cabinet.</p></reply>

I updated both leaders on developments in Northern Ireland, and we agreed to work closely together to address the challenges facing the Union, including Brexit.  </p><p>On Monday 19 June, I met with Prime Minister May in London.  We discussed Northern Ireland <font color="#2F2F2F">and the need to re-establish devolved Government there; as well as Brexit, particularly the need to avoid any adverse impact on the rights and freedoms of our citizens, on trade and on the economy.</font></p><p>Over the course of last week&rsquo;s meeting of the European Council in Brussels, I spoke with most of my EU counterparts.  In my conversations, I reiterated my strong commitment to keeping Ireland at the heart of the Union and highlighted the unique difficulties the departure of the UK presents for Ireland. </p><p>In addition to these informal exchanges in the margins of the meeting, I had excellent bilateral meetings with President Tusk, President Junker, Chancellor Merkel and Estonian Prime Minister Ratas.</p><p>These meetings addressed a range of issues, with a particular focus on Brexit.  I expressed my thanks for their engagement and support in prioritising Ireland's particular concerns, and I stressed the need to make as much progress as possible on these in the first phase of the negotiations. </p><p>In my meeting with Prime Minister Ratas of Estonia, representing the incoming Presidency, I offered Ireland&rsquo;s best wishes and support to that country as it begins its term-in-office next week, the first time that it will do so. </p></reply>

The Government has responded to all of the Convention's Reports.  One of the Convention's recommendations, of particular importance, is in relation to amending the Constitution to give citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in Presidential elections.  In March of this year, Government approved, in principle, to the holding of this referendum and the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is working on this matter.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Programme for a Partnership Government committed the Government to establish a Citizens' Assembly with a mandate to look at a limited number of key issues, including the Eighth Amendment.  In July 2016 the Houses of the Oireachtas approved establishment of the Assembly.  The Assembly is chaired by a former Supreme Court Judge, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy.  It operates independently of the Government and it will report direct to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Assembly has concluded its deliberations on its first topic, the Eighth Amendment.  The Assembly must now draft its report on the topic.  Ms Justice Laffoy has indicated that she intends to have this completed by the end of this month.  The Oireachtas will then refer it to the recently established Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment which in turn will bring its conclusions to the Houses for debate.  As I have already indicated, it is my intention to hold a referendum on this matter in 2018.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government also says that on foot of the recommendation of the Banking Inquiry, the Government will seek a review of the powers of Oireachtas Committees in conducting inquiries and, based on this review, will consider whether there should be a Constitutional referendum to strengthen Committees' powers.</p>  <p>  Aside from a referendum on the Eighth Amendment taking place next year, no decision has been made as yet as regards timings for any other planned referenda.  Before any referendum would be scheduled, I would of course bring a proposal to Government and hold discussions with Opposition Leaders. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p>  <p>  The NBP has catalysed Commercial investment.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  As a result approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second. </p>  <p>  In accordance with procedures set out by my Department in December 2015, in late 2016 my Department initiated a review of an eir proposal to rollout fibre to over 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.  These premises were in areas that had formed part of the procurement process for the NBP State Intervention area. On 4 April, I signed a commitment agreement with eir in relation to those plans.  Eir has committed to completing the rollout over a 90 week period, an average of 500 premises passed per day.    </p>  <p>  In line with the terms of the Commitment Agreement, the Department meets with eir each month to review their monthly report and to allow them set out progress against each project deliverable.  The Department has also undertaken a field inspection to witness the fibre optical cabling and splicing activities being carried out as part of the 300,000 deployment.  The Department also holds a Quarterly review with eir where the performance of their obligations under the Commitment Agreement is presented and discussed.  To date eir have achieved the aggregate milestones under the Agreement.  The next milestone is due at the end of June.  </p>  <p>  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department's website.  Quarterly updates will also be published on the Departments website.  My Department has informed me that in the period from 1 January to end March 2017, over 30,000 premises were passed by eir.  As at end of Q1 2017, this brings the total number of the 300,000 premises passed to just over 40,000 premises since work commenced in 2016.</p></reply>

It is a complete energy policy update and its actions have been informed by a vision to transform Ireland into a low carbon society and economy by 2050.  This vision is further reinforced by the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  In March, I published a draft of Ireland's first National Mitigation Plan for public consultation and I intend to shortly publish the final version of the Plan.  The National Mitigation Plan will set out what Ireland is doing, and plans to do, to further our transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy, by 2050.</p>  <p>  While Government policy is to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on fossil fuels, it is acknowledged that fossil fuels will have a role in the energy transition.</p>  <p>  This is reflected in the draft National Mitigation Plan which notes the role of peat in power generation.  While it is recognised that Ireland&rsquo;s limited biomass resource would be more efficiently deployed in the heating sector long-term, the use of biomass in the peat stations will help to meet Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy target and reduce carbon emissions in the sector.  </p>  <p>  In keeping with this policy, the public service obligation (or PSO) support for producing electricity from peat has already ended for Edenderry power station and will end for the West Offaly and Lough Ree power stations by 2020.  A new PSO support under the REFIT 3 scheme was put in place to support all three peat fired power stations to transition to biomass co-firing.</p>  <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s power station in Edenderry is now in receipt of this support for up to 30% the size of the plant.  This has allowed the plant to transition from using peat as its only fuel to using increasing levels of biomass. </p>  <p>  The West Offaly and Lough Ree power stations are supplied with peat by Bord na M&oacute;na but owned and operated by ESB.  These power stations are technically capable of co-firing with biomass similar to Edenderry.  Therefore a similar transition path towards increasing levels of renewable energy could be followed.</p>  <p>  In addition, Bord na M&oacute;na has stated that it intends to cease harvesting peat for electricity generation by 2030.  The company has committed to replace large-scale peat production with alternative indigenous energy sources such as biomass.  This was outlined in Bord na Mona&rsquo;s Sustainability 2030 report, published in October 2015.  The strategy includes a target to achieve a 75% reduction in the company&rsquo;s CO2 emissions intensity by 2020, compared to 2007 levels.</p></reply>

Mr. Greg Clarke was reappointed as Secretary for Sate for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).  Mr. Michael Gove is the new Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ms. Karen Bradley has been reappointed Secretary for State for Culture, Media and Sport.</p>  <p>  Since the formation of the new UK Government, I met with Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Coffey MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the Environment and Rural Life Opportunities, on Monday 19th June, at the Environment Council in Luxembourg.  This is the latest in a number of bilateral meetings I have had with my UK counterparts.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, in February I attended two EU Council meetings, the Energy Council and the Environment Council. I used this opportunity to hold bilateral discussions on the potential impacts of Brexit on the Irish and European energy sectors with the UK Under-Secretary of State for Industry and Energy, Mr Jesse Norman.  I also held discussions with Simon Hamilton, Minister for the Economy in the Northern Ireland Executive, on the margins of the North South Ministerial Council in September last.</p>  <p>  My officials also have regular engagement, and are in ongoing contact with their UK counterparts.  They meet at EU Councils and working groups and also at business meetings in Dublin and London.  Officials from my Department have discussed the potential impacts of Brexit on the Irish energy sector with their EU and UK counterparts.  This includes meetings with the European Commission task force for Brexit, the European Commission's Directorate-General for Energy and officials from the UK's Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Department for Exiting the European Union.</p></reply>

With regard to gorse fires in particular, as one of a number of measures to deal with the matter, I am advised that an Inter-Agency Gorse Fire Group has been established.  The Group is charged with exploring issues including the development of risk mitigation strategies and resource deployment to tackle such fires should they occur.  I understand the <font color="#333333">Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine</font>will chair this group, and membership will include the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, particularly the National Parks and Wildlife Service of that Department, the Fire Services, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Department of Housing Planning, Community and Local Government will also participate in this Group, as it has primary responsibility for the response to fire emergencies.</p><p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is responsible generally for the prevention and mitigation of wildland fires, as well as regulating permitted controlled burning of agricultural land.  That Department has published a Prescribed Burning Code of Practice which sets out guidelines for farmers in this regard, together with details of when it is not permitted to start such controlled fires.  The Code of Practice is accessible on the Department of Agriculture's website.  I understand that the Department of Agriculture  has sanctioned farmers who have breached the controlled burning guidelines by suspending single farm payments. </p><p>The Wildlife Act, 1976, which is the responsibility of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, sets out further regulations with regard to burning of uncultivated land.  Specifically, it is an offence under Section 40 of that Act(as amended by Section 46 of the Wildlife Act, 2000) to burn, from 1 March to 31 August in a given year, any vegetation growing on any land not then cultivated.  With regard to fires within National Parks specifically, the National Parks and Wildlife Service is in close liaison with both the Garda&iacute; and the Fire Service on an ongoing basis.  They remain ever-vigilant, particularly when weather conditions exist that might increase the likelihood of fires in our national parks.  Breaches of the 1976 Act as amended, or cases of arson, are criminal matters and as such should be referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation and prosecution.</p></reply>

To date in 2017, a further 6,537 homes have been upgraded with grant support of &euro;7.3m.  This investment has delivered an estimated 120 Gigawatt hours of energy savings, saving grant recipients nearly &euro;9.4 million from their energy bills and reducing Ireland&rsquo;s CO2 emissions by nearly 40,000 tonnes while supporting around 1,000 jobs in the construction industry.</p>  <p>  The Better Energy Homes scheme is just one of a suite of measures that are available to people who wish to upgrade the energy efficiency of their home.  The Better Energy Communities Scheme encourages community groups to come together and develop projects that can improve a range of homes and shared community facilities in a local area.  This year an estimated &euro;26m will support 42 such community projects. </p>  <p>  In addition, I have made &euro;5m available for a new scheme targeted at householders who want to upgrade their home to at least an A3 standard and install a renewable energy based heating system.  Through SEAI, my Department will fund 50% of the cost of such projects on a first come first served basis. </p>  <p>  For those people who cannot afford to invest in their home, the Warmer Homes scheme provides free energy efficiency upgrades on a national basis and the Warmth &amp;amp; Wellbeing pilot scheme offers deep renovations to people who are living in scheme&rsquo;s area of operations and are suffering from respiratory conditions.   </p>  <p>  In total around &euro;80m will be dedicated this year to energy efficiency programmes.  I anticipate that this funding will support the upgrade of around 25,000 homes in 2017 and hundreds of community facilities. </p>  <p>  My Department and the SEAI are continually reviewing how best to support people who want to improve the energy efficiency of their home.  As well as providing grant support we need to measure and communicate the other benefits that energy efficiency can bring such as improved air quality and health benefits.  Alongside this additional capital spend, I have also secured funding that has provided for the creation of a new Behavioural Economics Unit within SEAI.  This unit will bring an inter-disciplinary approach to the improvement of existing energy efficiency schemes and the design of new measures.</p></reply>

The projections indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy not covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020, a deteriorating position in respect of the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s targets for 2020 when compared with previous projections.  Though not unexpected, given the welcome return to economic growth in Ireland, it nevertheless confirms that Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse emissions continue to track broader trends in the economy and serves to underline the difficult decisions ahead of us as we try to reduce emissions in line with our international commitments.</p>  <p>  In relation to the targets for 2020, Ireland has an emissions reduction target for each year between 2013 and 2020 under the 2009 EU Effort Sharing Decision.  For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their level in 2005.  This will be Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the overall EU objective to reduce its emissions by the order of 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.  Ireland&rsquo;s target is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated to EU Member States under this 2009 Decision, which is shared only with Denmark and Luxembourg.  </p>  <p>  The projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself.  In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis. </p>  <p>  In order to maximise Ireland's emissions reductions and address the gap to the 2020 target, it will also be necessary to pursue other available options, in addition to the introduction of further policies and measures planned through the National Mitigation Plan. </p>  <p>  The legislative framework governing the EU&rsquo;s 2020 emissions reductions targets includes a number of flexibility mechanisms to enable Member States to meet their annual emissions targets, including provisions to bank any excess allowances to future years and to trade allowances between Member States.  Using our banked emissions from the period to 2015, Ireland is projected to comply with its emission reduction targets in each of the years 2013 to 2018.  However, our cumulative emissions are expected to exceed targets for 2019 and 2020, which will result in a requirement to purchase additional allowances.  While this purchasing requirement is not, at this stage, expected to be significant, further analysis will be required to quantify the likely costs involved, in light of the final amount and price of allowances required. </p></reply>

Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable energy sources.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has calculated that 25.3% of electricity, 6.5% of heat and 5.7% of transport energy requirements were met from renewable sources at end 2015.  Overall, SEAI analysis shows that 9.1% of Ireland&rsquo;s total energy requirements in 2015 were met from renewable energy sources.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  </font><font color="#0D0D0D">The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes in place  or under development designed to stimulate further progress in the domestic renewable energy sector.  These include the Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff (REFIT) schemes for the electricity sector and the Biofuel Obligation Scheme in transport sector.  These schemes have proved successful at incentivising large-scale investment in the renewable industry in recent years. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">My Department is also currently developing a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme and a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) Scheme, designed to encourage further investment in the renewable electricity and heat sectors, respectively.  The introduction of any schemes - including the overall costs and technologies to be supported - are subject to Government approval and State Aid clearance from the European Commission. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The 2016 Programme for Government recognises that Ireland&rsquo;s long-term interests are best supported by further decreasing our dependence on foreign fossil fuels through the continued development of indigenous renewable energy.  Ireland&rsquo;s dependency on imported fossil fuels &ndash; which increased to 88% of all energy used in 2015 &ndash; means that the Irish economy is particularly exposed to international energy price volatility.  The cost of all energy imports to Ireland in 2015 was approximately &euro;4.6 billion, and while that was down from &euro;5.7 billion in 2014 due mainly to falling oil and gas import prices, further increases would place cost pressures on businesses and households across the country.  Maintaining investment in the deployment of indigenous renewable energy sources will help to break this dependency and ultimately help to reduce costs on businesses and households.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">As Minister for Climate Action and Environment, I recognise that energy and climate action are inextricably linked.  Using less energy, and using it more efficiently, is the most cost effective and accessible way for us all to take action on climate change.  However, increasing the use of renewable energy will also assist efforts to reduce carbon emissions.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  In relation to a European energy grid, Ireland is one of ten North Seas countries that signed a </font><font color="#0D0D0D"> in 2016 to support closer energy cooperation in the North Seas area.  While efforts in this area are at an early stage, </font>the aim is to create good conditions for the development of offshore wind energy in order to ensure a sustainable, secure and affordable energy supply in the North Seas countries.  <font color="#0D0D0D">This is a positive initiative that has the potential to stimulate the further deployment of renewable energy and reduce Ireland&rsquo;s dependency on fossil fuel imports.</font></p></reply>

This is in line with the commitment set out in the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>  The primary objective of the National Dialogue will be to ensure an inclusive process of engagement and consensus building across society towards enabling the transformation to a low carbon and climate-resilient future.  To do this, the Dialogue will seek to create awareness, engagement and motivation to act (locally, regionally and nationally) in relation to the challenges presented by climate change and to establish, on a long term basis, appropriate networks for people to meet periodically to consider evidence-based inputs on the economic, social, behavioural, environmental and public aspects of climate and energy policy. </p>  <p>  I have also indicated that the National Mitigation Plan, which I expect to publish shortly, will become a living document and in the context of this on-going process, and outcomes from the Dialogue will be a key component for consideration in the development of further decarbonisation options.  </p>  <p>  I am currently finalising, and will shortly announce, the membership of a National Dialogue on Climate Action Advisory Group which I am establishing to provide me with advice in relation to the overall strategy, structure and operation of the National Dialogue. </p>  <p>  A key element of the National Dialogue already underway is the Green Schools National Climate Change Action and Awareness Programme which, for 2017, includes the development phase for a Climate Change Ambassadors Programme. </p>  <p>  Further action and initiatives under the National Dialogue will be announced in due course.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  </p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  Since 2012, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  As a result there has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  This footprint is continuing to expand.</p><p>In April, eir signed an agreement with me committing them to follow through on their commercial plans to provide new high speed broadband infrastructure to 300,000 premises in rural areas.  Eir has committed to doing this work over a 90 week period with an average of 500 premises passed per day.  In line with the published Agreement there are regular Review Meetings the purpose of which is to monitor this rollout and ensure that eir meets its obligations under the Agreement.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website .  The decision by eir to invest in infrastructure to deploy high speed broadband services to an additional 300,000 premises in rural Ireland was taken by eir on commercial grounds.  Neither I nor the Department have a statutory authority to direct eir in this regard. </p><p>Quarterly updates on progress of the eir 300k rollout will be published on the Departments website.  The Q1 figures have been verified by my Department and the eir rollout is in line with the Commitment Agreement.</p><p>In April I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie.  This map finalises the State Intervention Area for the procurement process and is an important milestone in the procurement process.  The Map shows the extent of  the State Intervention area and also the areas targeted for commercial services.</p><p>-  The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,</p><p>-  The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>The following table details the number of premises to be covered by the State Intervention and through commercial investment in the areas identified by the Deputies and sets out the position at end 2016.  <table><tr><th>County Name </th><th>Number of Premises </th><th>Number of Premises within the NBP Intervention Area </th><th>Number of  Premises within Commercial Operator&rsquo;s Area </th><th>Number of premises planned commercial rural deployment*</th></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>83,031</td><td>19,370</td><td>50,662</td><td>12,999</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>42,143</td><td>17,150</td><td>17,664</td><td>7,329</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>32,845</td><td>15,792</td><td>12,505</td><td>4,548</td></tr></table>* These figures will reduce as the rural deployment is rolled out.</p><p>There are approximately 2.3m premises covering Ireland&rsquo;s 26 counties, of which approximately 542,000 (23%) premises are located in the AMBER area on the Map.  These premises will require State intervention and are the focus for the State Intervention procurement process.  The remaining 1.8m  premises are located in the BLUE areas and will be/are served by commercial operators. Of the 1.8m premises, 1.4m are already within a high speed broadband area and a further 300,000 premises fall within eir&rsquo;s plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and end 2018 (Light BLUE on map).  Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at  http://fibrerollout.ie/eircode-lookup/. </p><p>My Departments High Speed Broadband map www.broadband.gov.ie. provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county.  Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.</p><p>My Department is running a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers. </p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The  three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.</p><p>With the finalisation of the map and following extensive dialogue with bidders, the procurement is progressing to the next stage.  On 20 June 2017, my Department wrote to the three bidders in the NBP procurement process inviting them to submit their &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; by 26 September 2017.  The 'Detailed Solutions' will then be reviewed before the final tender is issued.  The NBP procurement process will then move to the next stage where a preferred bidder will be appointed.  </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP, once contracts are in place. </p><p>The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.</p><p>The rate of demand for data services has increased exponentially in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for telecommunication operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and is available on both Departments' websites.</p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.</p><p>In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I, together with Minister Humphreys, established an Implementation Group.  This group is driving and monitoring the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions.  I published the first such quarterly progress report on 13th June 2017, which is available on my Department's website at www.dccae.gov.ie/documents/Taskforce%20Q1%20Progress%20Report.pdf and which shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017. </p><p>The work of the Task Force will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p><p>In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg recently announced the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which means an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas.  The Regulator has awarded 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band which will provide a degree of stability and create future investment certainty.  Spectrum was also awarded in lots covering 9 urban and rural regions across the country.</p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.</p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.</p><p>There is no universal service obligation (USO) for high speed broadband provision or mobile voice services in Ireland.  The current EU and national regulatory framework for telecommunications relates solely to voice telephony and Functional Internet Access (28.8 kilobits per second) and is provided for under the current EU regulatory framework governing telecoms.  In September 2016, the European Commission published an ambitious proposal for the regulation of the European telecoms sector, which aims to incentivise and encourage increased investment in high speed broadband networks.  I have raised the issue of a USO for high speed broadband at EU level and I am seeking inclusion of a specific provision in the new framework that would allow Member States to apply a USO for high speed broadband, where such networks are available.</p></reply>

As I stated in my immediate reaction to the decision, we are all vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and we all have a responsibility to address climate change within our respective capabilities.  The withdrawal decision marks a regrettable shift away from the previously strong climate ambition shown by the United States, which played a major role in mobilising global ambition and achieving the agreement reached by 195 Parties in Paris in 2015.</p>  <p>  The Environment Council, which met on 19 June, was unanimous in its view that the Paris Agreement is fit for purpose and is not open to renegotiation.  This position was reaffirmed by the European Council at its meeting last week.  Heads of State and Government agreed that the EU remains fully committed to playing a strong role in implementing the Paris Agreement and to enhancing cooperation with its international partners under the Paris Agreement, in particular with the most vulnerable countries. </p>  <p>  The Government fully supports this stance.  We continue to play a strong role in meeting this objective through our on-going commitment, in particular through Irish Aid programmes, to supporting developing countries to integrate climate action in development plans, including in relation to social protection, disaster risk reduction, and strengthening agriculture and food systems. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to work closely with other EU Member States and international partners to ensure that the Paris Agreement becomes fully operational as soon as possible, giving the international community the means to take the action required to limit the impacts of climate change.</p></reply>

The Agreement is designed to meet this objective through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted by all parties to the agreement.  In this regard, the European Union submitted an NDC committing to a reduction of at least 40% in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, which will be met through reductions of 43% in the Emission Trading System (ETS) and 30% in the non-ETS sector compared with 2005 levels.</p>  <p>  A proposal on the non-ETS targets for individual Member States, the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), was published by the European Commission in July 2016.  Targets have been proposed for Member States based on GDP per capita and the cost-effectiveness of domestic emissions reductions within individual Member States, with the starting point based on average emissions over the period 2016 to 2018.  In the case of Ireland a target of 39% has been proposed, which has been adjusted downwards to 30% to reflect cost-effectiveness of measures within the Irish economy.  </p>  <p>  The Commission proposal recognises different Member State circumstances and the need to provide flexibility to reduce emissions as cost-effectively as possible in the context of the overall EU target.  Ireland has been actively engaged in negotiations in the Council of Ministers, and is working to ensure that these core principles are maintained in the final outcome to the negotiations.  At the Environment Council meeting of Monday 19 June, my EU counterparts and I reviewed progress to date and emphasised the need to prioritise a successful conclusion to these negotiations which retains a high environmental ambition for the EU but provides each Member State the capacity to contribute to that ambition in a cost effective and fair manner.</p>  <p>  The incoming Estonian Presidency has indicated a desire to reach agreement in the Council, allowing negotiations with the European Parliament to commence, during its term.</p></reply>

The Irish Atlantic Margin remains substantively underexplored and its actual potential will not be known without a significant increase in the level of exploration and in particular exploration drilling.</p><p>The Energy White Paper &ldquo;Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015-2030&rdquo; sets out a vision and framework to guide Irish energy policy and the actions that Government intends to take in the energy sector from now up to 2030, aimed at transforming Ireland's fossil-fuel based energy sector into a clean, low carbon system by 2050.  This ambitious vision for Ireland&rsquo;s energy system envisages a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from that sector by 80-95% relative to 1990 levels by 2050.  The White Paper identifies the long-term strategic importance of diversifying Ireland's energy generation portfolio and largely decarbonising the energy sector by 2050. </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon energy future will involve progressively moving to lower emissions fuels e.g. moving initially from peat and coal to natural gas, and ultimately towards an even greater reliance on renewable energy.  In that regard, the Government has introduced a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy and deliver energy efficiency. </p><p>The White Paper<i></i>recognises that oil and natural gas will remain significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply in the transition period.</p><p>Ireland currently sources all its oil from abroad and sources its gas supply from the Kinsale fields (Kinsale, Ballycotton and Seven Heads), the Corrib field and the gas pipeline from Moffat in Scotland.  Corrib and Kinsale are not in a position to meet all of Ireland&rsquo;s annual gas demand and so Ireland will continue to rely on gas via Great Britain for the foreseeable future.  The Kinsale fields are expected to cease production by 2021 while Corrib production is projected to decrease to 50 per cent of its initial levels by 2025.</p><p>Taking this into account, successful exploration in Ireland&rsquo;s Atlantic Margin has the potential to deliver significant and sustained benefits to Irish society and the economy, particularly in terms of enhanced security of supply and import substitution.</p></reply>

Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and is available on both Departments' websites.</p>  <p>  In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.</p>  <p>  In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I, together with Minister Humphreys, established an Implementation Group.  This group is driving and monitoring the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions.  This month, I published the first such quarterly progress report, which is available on my Department's website at www.dccae.gov.ie/documents/Taskforce%20Q1%20Progress%20Report.pdf and which shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017. </p>  <p>  The work of the Task Force will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p>  <p>  A stakeholder forum is planned for October 2017, to be held outside of Dublin, to take stock of progress made in implementing the Taskforce actions and to discuss all the issues impacting on the rollout of telecoms infrastructure</p>  <p>  In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg recently announced the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which means an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas.  The Regulator has awarded 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band which will provide a degree of stability and create future investment certainty.  Spectrum was also awarded in lots covering 9 urban and rural regions across the country.</p>  <p>  In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.</p>  <p>  The Government's National Broadband Plan will provide high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location.  </p>  <p>  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that to date approximately 1.4m or 61% of the 2.3m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second-this footprint is expanding.  In April, I signed a Commitment Agreement with eir who will provide broadband to an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.  Eir has committed to concluding this work over a 90 week period, an average of 500 premises passed per day. My Department is monitoring this rollout.  </p>  <p>  A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area, comprising c 540,000 (23%) premises.  The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.</p>  <p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and broadband services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  In its regulation of the telecommunications sector, ComReg collects data from operators on a quarterly basis, in order to both understand and monitor current trends in the Irish communications market, as well as to inform external users.  ComReg publishes these reports on its website (www.comreg.ie), with the latest available report being the Q1 2017 report.  In terms of mobile phone services, ComReg imposes terms and conditions, such as quality and coverage obligations, on operators when issuing licences.  It monitors mobile operators&rsquo; compliance with these requirements by means of bi-annual drive tests.</p></reply>

Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and is available on both Departments' websites.</p>  <p>  In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions, each with their own timeframe for delivery, that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.</p>  <p>  In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I, together with Minister Humphreys, established an Implementation Group.  This group is driving and monitoring the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions.  On 13 June, I published the first such quarterly progress report, which is available on my Department's website at www.dccae.gov.ie/documents/Taskforce%20Q1%20Progress%20Report.pdf and which shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017. </p>  <p>  In terms of addressing mobile coverage blackspots, my Department is working closely with the mobile operators and local authorities, in conjunction with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, to address a number of key blackspots in every county.  Mobile operators have already made significant progress with blackspots over the last few months and we have put in place a number of measures which will aid them further in addressing additional blackspots in the near term.</p>  <p>  The work of the Task Force will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p>  <p>  In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg recently announced the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which means an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas.  The Regulator has awarded 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band which will provide a degree of stability and create future investment certainty.  Spectrum was also awarded in lots covering 9 urban and rural regions across the country.</p>  <p>  In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.</p>  <p>  In terms of commercial investment, mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction in 2012.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.  However, as mobile services are a radio based technology, services can be affected by topography, quality of handsets and the capacity of the network, as well as by and proximity to mobile telephone antennas.</p>  <p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  A stakeholder forum is planned for October 2017, to be held outside of Dublin, to take stock of progress made in implementing the Taskforce actions and to enable discussion on all the issues impacting on the rollout of telecoms infrastructure.</p>  <p>  In parallel, the National Broadband Plan aims to deliver high-speed services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland, through private investment and a State intervention in areas where commercial investment plans have not been fully demonstrated.</p></reply>

The Plan will focus on measures and actions to progress decarbonisation of four key sectors in our low carbon transition process, namely Electricity Generation; the Built Environment; Transport; and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use. </p>  <p>  The National Mitigation Plan has been prepared having regard to the provisions set out in the 2015 Act in close collaboration with all relevant Government Departments and, in particular, with the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport; Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government; and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It should be noted that these Ministers have direct responsibility under the 2015 Act to prepare and adopt sectoral mitigation measures for their respective areas of responsibility for inclusion in the National Mitigation Plan.  Relevant Ministers will also be obliged to report annually to the Oireachtas as part of the Annual Transition Statement required under the 2015 Act.</p>  <p>  The final National Mitigation Plan sets out almost 80 measures in place and under consideration across the four key sectors and over 100 supporting actions to further progress these measures and to also further enable our decarbonisation transition.  At least half of these measures and actions relate to the Agriculture and Transport sectors. </p>  <p>  It must be recognised that this Plan is a first step in what will be a work in progress, reflecting the reality of where we are in our decarbonisation transition having regard to a number of factors including curtailed public and private investment over the course of recent years.  The Plan cannot provide a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050 but it will begin the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades.  This will be an ongoing process aimed at incremental and permanent decarbonisation.  The Plan will become a living document accessible on my Department's website, and will be updated on an on-going basis as analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate further cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.</p></reply>

This scheme has the potential to support up to 310 MW of biomass plants in Ireland, including support for the co-firing of biomass at the three existing peat stations. Bord na Mona (BnM) is the only plant to have availed of this support to date.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  In addition, my Department is in the process of finalising a Bioenergy Plan to be published later this year.  The Plan will highlight the full range of supply-side and demand-side measures that are needed to release the full potential of the domestic biomass sector in Ireland.  I expect that a revised draft bioenergy plan to go for public consultation in the coming months.  This consultation will be advertised on my Department's website at </font>.</p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">One of the key measures in the bioenergy plan is the proposed Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI).  The RHI is designed as a demand side measure in the bioenergy sector as it is likely to provide commercial opportunities for renewable heat technologies, including biomass boiler installations.  Therefore it is likely that new opportunities will open up for biomass feedstock producers downstream in the biomass supply market.  However, available domestic biomass is limited and therefore any supply side measures that can encourage growth in domestic biomass production will assist in meeting the renewable heat target in a cost effective way. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">In addition, Bioenergy Ireland, now proposed as BnM BioEnergy, will produce synergies between BnM and Coillte Teoranta, in a number of areas including bioenergy and forestry, which will stimulate growth in the biomass sector.  These companies are pursuing a series of initiatives including promoting private afforestation, developing energy crop proposals, incentivising supply mobilisation through aggregation and developing the demand for biomass fuel. </font></p></reply>

While the 2016 EU Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive was largely anticipated in the Strategy, the finalised Directive contains additional provisions which will have significant implications for my Department also.</p>  <p>  The NCSC is presently engaged in a series of activities supporting Departments and agencies in the protection of their networks and infrastructure.  These measures include monitoring threats, developing appropriate responses, and informing constituents of these on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  The NIS Directive requires Member States to take measures to protect critical national infrastructure and ensure the security of Digital Service Providers.  As such, the legislation that will be used to transpose this Directive will set out the means that will be used to deal with infrastructure protection in this space, and the NCSC is already well advanced in developing these in a practical way and identifying the actual infrastructure involved.</p>  <p>  The dynamic nature of this issue, and the risks posed to citizens and the State, are clearly significant.  The NCSC is presently undergoing expansion, both in terms of staffing numbers and funding.  While the precise resourcing and staffing of the NCSC are security sensitive issues and are not published, it can be said that the NCSC has just finished a recruitment process at two separate grades, with a number of additional staff either in clearance or already in place.  </p></reply>

My intention is to introduce an incentivised pricing structure which will provide the flexibility for customers to be offered a suite of pricing options to encourage householders to reduce and segregate their waste. </p><p>This approach is in line with Government waste policy which is articulated in the 2012 policy document 'A <i>Resource Opportunity- Waste Management Policy in Ireland'</i>.  A specific measure in the policy provides that the household waste collection sector will &ldquo;<i>operate pricing structures designed to incentivise environmentally sustainable behaviours by households in terms of waste reduction and segregation&rdquo;</i>.  Incentivised pricing should encourage us, as a community, to prevent and reduce the amount of waste that we produce and to utilise the value of our waste through reuse, recycling and recovery.  This will also enable Ireland to meet its legal obligations as well as current and future targets under EU waste legislation. </p><p>The amount of waste being sent to landfill has increased in the last two years. Last year, local authorities had to exercise emergency powers on two occasions to make additional landfill capacity available.  We must act to encourage further waste reduction in order to avert a return to an over dependence on landfill.  The introduction of an incentivised pricing structure for household waste collection will be an important measure in this regard.</p></reply>

Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which is being designed to assist Ireland in meeting its 2020 renewable electricity targets and will support in delivering Ireland's renewable energy contributions to the 2030 EU renewable energy targets. </p>  <p>  The design of the new scheme is underway, and includes an extensive independent economic appraisal.  This economic appraisal involves comparing the cost of supporting Solar Photovoltaics (PV) - both rooftop and ground mounted, offshore wind, onshore wind and a range of other commercial renewable technologies, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.  The assessment also includes analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.</p>  <p>  My Department will shortly publish a public consultation on key design elements of the new support scheme.  Following the outcome of this public consultation, and before any new scheme is introduced, it will need to secure Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission.  Subject to this, it is expected that the new scheme will become operational in 2018.</p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the level of interest in the solar and offshore wind sector in Ireland, by both state-owned and private-sector companies.  My position remains that while solar and offshore wind have a role to play in Ireland&rsquo;s energy future, particularly in relation to diversification of our renewable portfolio, we cannot have a situation where a new support scheme leads to a disproportionate increase in people&rsquo;s electricity bills through the Public Service Obligation levy.  In designing the new RESS, the cost implications for people and businesses will, therefore be a high priority and I will ensure that the new scheme is designed in a cost efficient manner.</p></reply>

These include parcel delivery companies like Nightline, DHL and CityPost as well as food delivery businesses such as Domino&rsquo;s Pizza, using Eircodes to accurately locate proprieties for timely deliveries.  Also, there are many businesses that use Eircodes free of charge by using a number of free Eircode Finder app&rsquo;s to provide services to their customers. </p>  <p>  Eircodes are being used by public sector bodies including, CSO, OSi, National Transport Authority, Student Universal Support Ireland, Local Authorities, Revenue, Department of Social Protection, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Health Service Executive.  Other state bodies and agencies that interact with the public have incorporated Eircodes into their operational systems. </p>  <p>  The National Ambulance Service (NAS) integrated Eircodes into their Computer Aided Dispatch system and actively encourage people who are seeking an emergency ambulance to have their Eircode available to pass it on to the call taker.  This means that the patient&rsquo;s address and the position of the nearest available ambulance can be accurately pinpointed on a digital map.  This enables an ambulance to quickly and accurately be routed to someone in need of medical help.</p></reply>

In Q2 2016, the unemployment rate as measured by the QNHS was 8.6%. </p><p>The Census of Population 2016 Summary Results - Part 2, published on 15 June 2017 (based on Census night 24th April 2016) provided an alternative measure of unemployment levels and indicated an unemployment rate of 12.7%.</p><p>The main difference in the unemployment rate between the two sources arises as the classifications used in the measurement of unemployment differs for both. </p><p>- In the QNHS, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) classification is used and defines employment, unemployment and the inactive population.  Unemployment is defined as persons who, in the week before the survey, were without work and available for work within the next two weeks, and had taken specific steps, in the preceding four weeks, to find work.</p><p>- The Census uses the Principal Economic Status (PES) classification to establish the labour force situation of the respondent.  The PES classification is based on how respondents would describe their present principal status including a status of being unemployed.</p><p>In addition, differences can arise because:</p><p>- The QNHS results are based on a survey of a sample of the population while the Census results are based on an enumeration of the entire population</p><p>- The Census form is completed by a responsible adult in each household throughout the State in respect of everyone present in the household on Census Night, while the QNHS is by face to face interview</p><p>Notwithstanding these differences, the main strength of the census-based data on employment and unemployment is the provision of data for small geographic areas, analysis on the comparisons between areas, the provision of data on unemployment blackspots, and other analysis across multiple variables such as marital status, detailed nationality, etc.</p></reply>

The Authority&rsquo;s inspections relate to employers at their place of work.  The following tables give the figures for inspections and investigations of all workplaces and construction sites visited since 2014 and the enforcement actions taken by Authority inspectors.  The yearly tables give the numbers of inspections and investigations carried out in each NACE Sector since 2014.</p><p>In relation to ceasing work activities on any workplace including construction sites, the Authority&rsquo;s inspectors can use their powers under Section 67 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 to serve a Prohibition Notice on a duty-holder (e.g. on the employer, sub-contractor etc.,) to stop a work activity.  The Prohibition Notice is issued where the inspector forms the opinion that an activity at that place of work poses a risk of serious personal injury.  The notice requires the activity to stop until appropriate controls are in place to minimise/eliminate the risk of injury.  Once this has been done and the duty holder confirms to the inspector that they are in compliance, and this is verified by the inspector.</p><p>There are a range of other enforcement actions available to inspectors which require improvements to be made to safety and health standards at a place of work but which may not require the duty-holder to cease the work activity.  These include Improvement Notices and Reports of Inspection. </p><p>The Improvement Notice (Section 66) can be issued where the inspector observes a breach of the health and safety legislation.  This Notice must give the duty-holder a period of time to remedy the breach and become compliant.  For this Notice the work does not have to cease. </p><p>If the duty-holder is aggrieved by either the Prohibition or the Improvement Notice, he/she can appeal it to the District Court. </p><p>Inspectors can also provide a Report of Inspection to the duty holder detailing actions needed to be taken to improve health and safety on site. </p><p>The inspectors will take actions including follow up visits to ensure Notices and Reports of Inspection are complied with.</p><p>In addition under Section 71 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 where the Authority or an inspector considers that the risk to the safety, health or welfare of persons is so serious that the use of a place of work or part of a place of work should be restricted or immediately prohibited until specified measures have been taken to reduce the risk to a reasonable level, the Authority can apply to the High Court for an order restricting or prohibiting the use of the place of work or part of a place of work accordingly.  No such applications have been required for some years now.</p><p><b>Total number of inspections and investigations of all workplaces 2014 - 2017</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Inspections and investigations of all workplaces</th><th>Prohibition Notices served on duty-holder</th><th>Improvement Notices served on duty-holder</th><th>Reports of Inspection given to duty-holder</th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>10,739</td><td>515</td><td>387</td><td>4,135</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>10,898</td><td>515</td><td>491</td><td>4,395</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>10,485</td><td>370</td><td>367</td><td>4,287</td></tr><tr><td>2017 (to June 23rd)</td><td>4,853</td><td>227</td><td>189</td><td>2,329</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Total number of construction site inspections and investigations 2014 -

The key objective of these regulations is to increase the resilience of the banking and household sectors to the property market and to reduce the risk of bank credit and house price spirals from developing in the future.</p>  <p>  The regulations introduced proportionate limits for Loan-to-Value (LTV) and Loan-to-Income (LTI) measurements for housing loans secured on residential property in the State.  Income is set out in the regulation and means the total gross annual income, before tax or other deductions, of the borrower. </p>  <p>  However, the Central Bank has advised that the limits are supplementary to individual banks' credit policies and are not designed as a substitute for lenders&rsquo; responsibilities to assess affordability and lend prudently on a case-by-case basis.  This affordability assessment generally involves examining a borrower&rsquo;s net disposable income which takes into consideration a number of factors including for example taxes, other debt obligations and may include pension contributions if applicable as per the individual firm&rsquo;s credit policy. </p></reply>

The DBP was found to be &lsquo;broadly compliant&rsquo; by the European Commission.  This included an expected deviation under the EB of approximately &euro;200 million in relation to increased national contributions to the EU Budget. </p>  <p>  In January of this year the Commission published its updated version of the 2017 Vade Mecum which included a methodological change around the treatment of one-offs.  In the past one-offs were not included in the assessment of compliance with the EB whereas they will be taken systematically into account in the assessment process going forward.  However, the Commission appears to have retrospectively applied this change in its calculations to the EB assessment for 2016 and the combined EB assessment for 2016/2017.  As I have previously stated for the Deputy in PQs number 143 of the 30th of May and number 296 of the 19th of June I do not accept retrospective application of methodological changes, particularly relating to 2016 and the 2016/2017 average.  The Commission themselves have admitted that there may be legal uncertainty with the approach taken and the 2017 version of the Vade Mecum states that &ldquo;in order to preserve Member States&rsquo; legitimate expectations, compliance with already adopted Council recommendations will continue to be assessed on the basis of methodologies described in the 2016 version of the Vade Mecum."  My officials continue to engage bilaterally with the Commission on this point.</p>  <p>  Further, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC) found Ireland to be &lsquo;strongly compliant&rsquo; with the EB in the 2016 Ex-post Assessment of compliance with the Domestic Budgetary Rule 2016.  Therefore there could not have been a significant deviation under the two-year assessment.  The next assessment of compliance with the EB will the DBP due to be submitted in October of this year. </p>  <p>  Based on the European Commission&rsquo;s final ex-post assessment of compliance with the balanced budget rule, Ireland is estimated to have reduced its structural deficit by 0.3 per cent in 2016.  This improvement is considered to be consistent with broad compliance with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.  For 2017, my Department forecasts a further structural improvement of 0.3 per cent, indicating continued broad compliance with the balanced budget rule.  For 2018, a structural improvement of 0.6 per cent is projected, consistent with full compliance with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.  Importantly, my Department estimates that Ireland remains on track to achieve our medium-term objective of a structural deficit of 0.5 per cent of GDP in 2018.  Achievement of the MTO represents an important milestone in ensuring the sustainability of the public finances. </p></reply>

This is a particular type of life assurance taken out for the term of the mortgage and designed to pay it off on the death of the borrower or joint borrower. </p>  <p>  It is an underwriting consideration for an insurance firm to decide whether to take on the risk or not.  Should the insurance firm take on the risk, it may result in a large loading/premium for the customer.  Alternatively, the insurance firm could decide not to take on the risk at all.  This would be a commercial/underwriting decision by the insurance firm.  </p>  <p>  In most cases, a lender is legally required under Section 126 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 to ensure that a mortgage applicant has a mortgage protection insurance policy in place before granting a mortgage loan, with some exceptions.  One of these exceptions is &ldquo;loans to persons who belong to a class of persons which would not be acceptable to an insurer, or which would only be acceptable to an insurer at a premium significantly higher than that payable by borrowers generally&rdquo;, in which case the Act does not require the lender to ensure that mortgage protection insurance is in place.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for relief an applicant must meet a number of eligibility criteria including the possession and actual use of the vehicle outside the State for at least six months prior to their transfer of residence.  As the person concerned did not submit sufficient evidence demonstrating satisfaction of this criterion, her application was refused.</p>  <p>  The person concerned was advised by Revenue by letter dated 11 April 2017 that her application for relief from VRT was unsuccessful and that the vehicle should be registered immediately or exported from the State within 10 days.  She was also advised that should she wish to appeal the decision the vehicle must be registered and the appropriate taxes paid before an appeal could be considered.  While a letter of appeal was submitted by the person concerned, her appeal could not progress as the vehicle concerned was not registered and the VRT was not paid.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the person concerned subsequently submitted documentation in relation to her appeal on 9 June 2017.  Revenue concessionally decided to consider this as a new application rather than as an appeal.  However, as the documentation submitted did not conclusively show that the eligibility criteria were satisfied, the application was refused and the decision advised to the person concerned by letter dated 16 June 2017. </p>  <p>  The option to officially appeal the decision remains open to the person concerned for a period of 2 months from 16 June 2017.  The relevant legal provisions of the two stage VRT appeal process are set out in Sections 145 and 146 of the Finance Act 2001 and are also detailed on the Revenue website (please see: VRT Appeals Process).  The appeals process provides for a Stage 1 review of the original decision by a Revenue officer not previously involved in the case and a Stage 2 appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission.

This is being done over a 5 year period by way of annual increments of 5 percentage points, with the first increase from 75 per cent to 80 per cent having taken effect for interest accruing on or after 1 January 2017. </p><p>Further annual 5 percentage point increments in the rate of deductible interest will apply to interest accruing in each of the years 2018 to 2021 inclusive and full deductibility will be restored for interest accruing on or after 1 January 2021. </p><p>Restoring full deductibility over a period of 5 years allows for the continued effectiveness in the interim of the incentive introduced in Finance Act 2015 whereby landlords who let their property to social housing tenants for a minimum period of three years can obtain a deduction of 100% of qualifying interest.  Further information on this relief is available in section 97 of the Revenue Commissioners &ndash; Notes for Guidance &ndash; Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 &ndash; Finance Act 2016 Edition &ndash; Part 4 Principal Provisions Relating to the Schedule D charge, which is available at: .</p></reply>

A "credit intermediary" is defined as "a person...who in the course of his business arranges or offers to arrange for a consumer the provision of credit or the letting of goods in return for a commission, payment or consideration of any kind from the provider of the credit or the owner, as the case may be".  </p>  <p>  The CCPC provides licenses to credit intermediaries and keeps an online list of credit intermediaries holding a valid authorisation which is available on the CCPC website www.ccpc.ie.  The CCPC deals with complaints about the advertising of Credit Agreements and the advertising of car finance on credit intermediary websites and in the media.  It also has a specific statutory remit to provide personal finance information and education to assist consumers.</p>  <p>  The CCPC has, on a number of occasions, conducted research into the car market and car finance sectors, and has conducted numerous public awareness campaigns on the issue of car finance in recent years.  Its current campaign, which commenced on 5 June, focuses on car finance and specifically aims to provide information to consumers on issues in relation to PCPs, such as the fact that the consumer does not become the legal owner of the car until they make the final payment.  The CCPC plans to conduct further research into PCPs in the second half of this year.</p>  <p>  If a consumer has concerns regarding the activities of credit intermediaries, they may wish to contact the CCPC.  The Financial Services Ombudsman can also investigate complaints from individual consumers about credit intermediaries. </p></reply>

Therefore, Brexit will have a significant impact on EU Budget funding and expenditure and may need to be mitigated by either increased contributions from other Member States, reductions in EU funding programmes, or a combination of both.</p>  <p>  My Department has undertaken some broad analysis to estimate the potential impact of Brexit on our annual EU budget contributions, including the scenario if a decision is made at EU level to ensure there is no net reduction in the EU budget following Brexit.  This analysis will need to be developed in more detail in the coming period, when the parameters of the budget negotiations are better defined.  In particular, a key point will be getting agreement amongst the EU27 on a common approach to the future of the EU Budget.  However, it would not be helpful to speculate or comment on any amounts at this stage in advance of those negotiations. </p></reply>

Further schemes are currently underway at Kings Island in Limerick, Foynes, Athlone, Ennis Lower and Ennis South. </p>  <p>  The core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding is the Office of Public Works (OPW) Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.  The Programme is focussing on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding.  It is the principal vehicle for implementing the EU Floods Directive and national flood policy. </p>  <p>  The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMPs). </p>  <p>  The Shannon CFRAM Study is one of six regional CFRAM Studies commissioned by the OPW to examine in detail the causes of significant potential flooding risk.  It is a significant project covering an area of 17,800 square kilometres with a population of 670,000 in 17 local authority areas.  66 of the 300 AFAs nationally are located within the Shannon CFRAM Study area.  The CFRAM is also addressing the management of the flood risk on the Shannon Callows as part of this programme.  The overall cost of the Shannon CFRAM Study to date is &euro;7.1m.</p>  <p>  There has been an extensive response to the recent public consultation on the draft FRMPs and has provided constructive and wide-ranging observations and comments.  The review and assessment of each of these, while taking longer than expected, is indicative of the nature of the value of the comments received and are informing the final Plans. </p>  <p>  Final Plans, taking account of the submissions received, are now being reviewed by the OPW.  They will then be submitted over the coming weeks to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the environmental assessments of the Plans prior to their formal submission to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for approval, scheduled for the Autumn.  </p>  <p>  Determining which option best addresses the flood risk for each area was decided against agreed Flood Risk Management Objectives.  The Objectives are aimed at considering potential benefits and impacts across a broad range of factors including economic, environmental and cultural, social and technical.  Prioritising schemes for investment in the future will be assessed against the respective costs and benefits each delivers against the Objectives.</p>  <p>  While the information in relation to the costs for each measure are not available at this time the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in September 2015 announced details of a &euro;430 million 6 year programme of capital investment on flood defence measures as part of the Government&rsquo;s overall Capital Investment Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021.  During this time, the annual allocation for flood defence schemes will more than double to &euro;100m. </p>  <p>  In addition to large-scale schemes, funding is available through the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme to Local Authorities to address localised flooding in the Shannon Catchment and throughout the country.  The recent review of the Scheme examined all the existing criteria with a view to strengthening and improving the operability of the Scheme.  As a result, the upper financial threshold has now been increased significantly from &euro;500,000 to &euro;750,000 per project and for the first time, farm yards/buildings will be included as commercial premises in all categories.  Other improvements include lowering the benefit to costs ratio for smaller projects, improved benefit allowances for different property types and updated methodology for diverted journeys due to flooding.</p>  <p>  In January 2016, the Government took decisive action to support the existing plans in place to address flooding on the Shannon and established the Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group to enhance ongoing co-operation of all State agencies involved with the River Shannon and to add value to the CFRAM Programme.</p>  <p>  The Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group has taken the decision to consider developing a plan for strategic maintenance works on the River Shannon that will complement the Group&rsquo;s Work Programme and the specific measures that are identified for the areas at risk in the CFRAM Shannon Flood Risk Management Plan.  The Group has established a sub-committee to explore all of the necessary legal, environmental, technical and other considerations that arise in bringing forward both short term and long term proposals that can benefit flood risk management.</p></reply>

Public contract details, therefore, are held by the individual contracting authority concerned. </p><p>This public procurement process is facilitated through the national eProcurement portal <i>www.etenders.gov.ie </i>which is managed by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP).</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy, that has been input by contracting authorities onto the eTenders portal, is being analysed and collated by the OGP but will not be available within the time allowed.  The information will issue directly to the Deputy.</p><p>In relation to the steps being taken to ensure SMEs can access a greater share of publicly advertised tenders by the government.  Public Procurement is governed by EU and National rules.  The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers the best value for money.  It would be a breach of the EU rules for a public body to favour particular candidates on grounds such as organisation size, locality, nationality etc., and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.</p><p>However, there is a recognition at EU Level of the need to promote and facilitate SME participation in public procurement.  The new EU Directives on Procurement, transposed into Irish law in May 2016, are intended to make it easier for businesses and SMEs to tender for public sector procurement contracts.  Measures specifically designed to improve access for SMEs and start-ups include:</p><p>- financial capacity criterion is generally limited to twice contract value - there are no centrally imposed requirements for a minimum turnover.  Establishing the appropriate suitability criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is, of course, a matter for the contracting authority concerned.  This is because the contracting authority is in the best  position to gauge the appropriate levels of financial capacity that are appropriate to the needs of that specific contract. </p><p>- discretion to divide public contracts  into lots, with the proviso that opting not to divide a contract into lots must be explained in the procurement documents or the report on the procurement process. </p><p>- electronic methods of communication are mandated in parts of the tender process.</p><p>- the introduction of the European Single Procurement Document (ESPD), a self-declaration form aimed at reducing red tape for suppliers </p><p>- provision for &ldquo;consortia bidding&rdquo; may assist SMEs to participate in procurement procedures where they would not have the relevant capability or scale if they were to bid as sole tenderers </p><p>- explicit provision for pre-market discussion with suppliers and independent experts, subject to safeguards against distorting competition or violating transparency and non-discrimination principles </p><p>- reductions in the time limits for receipt of tenders by approximately 30% compared to the position under the 2006 Regulations </p><p>- Member States are required to report back to the Commission every 3 years on SME participation in public procurement </p><p>A number of these measures had been accelerated into policy in 2014 in advance of the transposition of the new Directives by Circular 10/14 - Initiatives to assist SMEs in Public Procurement - issued by the OGP. </p><p>The reform of public procurement across the public service is on-going and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business.  The OGP works with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.  It does this by facilitating quarterly meetings of an SME Advisory Group, which have been chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for public procurement, so that the voice of Irish SMEs (including ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF) can be heard by Government.  SMEs are also encouraged to register with the Government's eTenders portal so that they can be notified of upcoming tendering opportunities.</p><p>The OGP works with the SME industry representative bodies as well as the Department of  Enterprise and Innovation, InterTrade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to promote the engagement of SMEs in public procurement.  Evidence of the work and co-operation in the area can be seen in events such as &quot;Go-2-Tender&quot; workshops and &quot;Meet the Buyer&quot; events.</p><p>The data analysed by the OGP and published last September (2014 Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis Report) indicates that 95% of the State's expenditure is with firms within the State and the majority of spend analysed is with SMEs. </p><p>The OGP will continue to proactively engage with business and strive to enhance the significant measures already in place to support SME access to public procurement opportunities.</p></reply>

The Department of Education and Skills invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling:</p><p>- 63% of students to attend mainstream schools</p><p>- 26% to attend special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, and</p><p>- 11% to attend special schools.</p><p>Some students, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there.  This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.</p><p>Enrolment in an ASD special class should only be considered where it has been demonstrated that a student requires the support of a special class because he/she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day even with appropriate supports. </p><p>Students enrolling in ASD Special Classes must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals (for example, psychologist, speech and language therapist, psychiatrist) stating that: </p><p>- S/he has ASD, and that</p><p>- S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes.</p><p>The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned.  The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  </p><p>The NCSE will establish an additional 157 ASD Special Classes for the 2017/18 school year increasing the number of ASD Special Classes by 18% from 888 to 1,045.  This will include 19 new ASD early intervention classes, 96 new primary ASD classes and 42 new post-primary ASD classes.</p><p>In relation to Co. Wexford, the NCSE has informed my Department that they are satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand in the schools referred to by the Deputy for the forthcoming school year and that they will continue to monitor demand and review the requirement for special class places in the area.  </p><p>The NCSE will establish an additional 6 ASD Special Classes for the 2017/18 school year in Co. Wexford including 1 new ASD early intervention classes, 3 new primary ASD classes and 2 new post-primary ASD classes, bringing the number of classes to 6 Early Intervention, 23 primary and 13 post-primary in 2017/18.</p><p>The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school.  My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools and it does not maintain details of waiting lists in schools.</p><p>Parents/guardians of children with special needs who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) as soon as possible for information on available places.

The Strategy set out a plan to embed ICT in teaching, learning and assessment.  A detailed Action Plan for 2017 was recently launched, based on the objectives outlined in the Digital Strategy.  Timelines and lead responsibility have been assigned, and progress will be measured against the plan and an end of year report will be produced.  The Action Plan can be found at<i><font color="#813F62">: </font></i><i>.</i></p><p>The Strategy recognises that schools require public investment in their ICT infrastructure.  &euro;30 million in ICT grants has been issued to schools under the Strategy so far this year, and a further &euro;180 million will issue to invest in ICT facilities in schools over the next four years.  Circular 0001/2017 Grant Scheme for ICT Infrastructure 2016 &ndash; 2017 School Year contains further details.  No application process applied for this funding.</p><p>It is a matter for a school&rsquo;s Board of Management and Principal to decide how the grant can be best used for their school, in line with the schools eLearning Plan.  All purchases must be in compliance with Public Procurement Procedures.  Existing ICT purchasing Frameworks are in place operated by the Office of Government procurement for Desktop PCs/Notebooks/ etc, with appropriately defined technical specifications.  These Frameworks should be engaged with and taken advantage of as they simplify the process of purchasing ICT equipment for schools.</p><p>However, if having reviewed the market and considered detailed technical specifications, warranties and associated supports, it is clear that better value for money can be achieved from non-Framework vendors, schools should seek concurrent quotes from both Framework and non-Framework vendors.  Care should be taken to ensure that identical technical specification is presented to all vendors at the time of request for written quotations.  Further information on current ICT Frameworks operated by the OGP is available at <i>http://www.pdsttechnologyineducation.ie/en/Technology/Purchasing-Frameworks/, , </i><i></i>and through the School Procurement Unit at <i></i>.  Further information on eLearning planning can be found at <i>.</i></p></reply>

Schools which have not been included at this stage, including the one referred to by the Deputy, are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new model.</p>  <p>  The key data sources used in the DEIS identification process are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.  Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates.  This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the new DEIS Identification Model used to assess the level of disadvantage among the pupil cohort of a school has been applied fairly using centrally held data adopting an objective and scientific approach which has been uniformly applied for all schools in the country including the school referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  For schools who have concerns about their non-inclusion in the most recent round of DEIS, the following process applies:</p>  <p>  - a verification process is currently ongoing in relation to all schools who contacted my Department requesting that their data be validated.  This is aimed at ensuring the model was run correctly and the data supplied by the schools through the POD/PPOD systems was correctly used.  This process is expected to be concluded shortly and schools will be informed of the results.</p>  <p>  - A further process will take account of updated data as it becomes available.  All schools, not just those who queried the outcome of the February 2017 process, are being contacted to request them to ensure that their POD/PPOD data is fully correct and up to date, including Eircodes.  As soon as the 2016 National Census data becomes available later this summer, this data will be run through the identification model with the fully up-to-date POD/PPOD data.  If this exercise reveals that any school which did not qualify for DEIS in the February 2017 round actually meets the criteria applicable to schools with the highest concentration of disadvantage based on the fully up-to-date information then it will be included, subject to resources.</p>  <p>  I also wish to inform the Deputy that a communication to all schools will issue shortly to provide information on the identification model, including details of how the datasets are used to determine a school's level of disadvantage; the importance of data quality to the process and the need for schools to provide detailed and up to date information to my Department's online pupil databases.</p></reply>

The functions of the Charities Regulator are set out in the Charities Acts (as amended).  It is a matter for the Congregation to comply with any relevant regulations in relation to land disposal.</p>  <p>  In respect of the proposed disposal of lands adjacent to the post-primary school referred to by the Deputy, my Department understands from the Christian Brothers Congregation that the lands proposed for sale are the subject of contractual arrangement between the Congregation and a developer.  My Department has written to the Christian Brothers Congregation seeking clarification on a number of points, including whether the land in question is now the subject of a legally-binding agreement.  The Congregation have advised that they will reply to my Department in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The Christian Brothers congregation has an outstanding redress contribution of &euro;8.8 million.  I appreciate that the Christian Brothers wish to follow through on their commitments, having already paid &euro;21.2 million of their voluntary cash offer.  I would hope that the Congregation also takes educational needs fully into account during its deliberations.</p>  <p>  In the case of the primary school referred to by the Deputy, the lands in question are owned by another Congregation.  The lands proposed for sale are outside the boundary of the school site which has been agreed by the school patron.</p>  <p>  My Department does not have statutory CPO powers.  Given the cost of land acquisitions generally, where my Department has requested a local authority to purchase land under CPO, it has been for the purposes of constructing a new school building.  I understand that the school communities referred to by the Deputy wish to retain the right to use the land in question for recreational purposes and playing pitches.</p>  <p>  For the reasons stated above, a CPO would not be appropriate in the circumstances.</p></reply>

Capitation related grants are issued to the majority of primary and post-primary schools to employ such staff.  Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs.  Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools.  My Department has no plans to develop an alternative scheme for schools to employ secretaries separate to the current system of capitation grant assistance.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above, in 2015 my Department agreed to engage with the union side in relation to the pay of School Secretaries and Caretakers who are employed using grant funding and to enter an arbitration process.  The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for School Secretaries and Caretakers comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.  My Department has recently published  circular letter 0025/2017 for voluntary secondary schools and circular letter 0026/2017 for primary schools, setting out the application of the second phase increases of the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendations.  The circulars are available at: </p><p>Circular 0025/2017<i>: </i></p><p>Circular 0026/2017: <i></i></p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrators recommendation applies.  The circulars issued by my Department set out the revised rates of grant funding for schools and an application process whereby schools can apply for additional funding in order to enable them to pay the revised rates set out in the circulars.</p></reply>

Schools will be frontloaded with resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils who need such support.</p><p>Allocations based on the school profiles were issued to all schools, including the schools referred to my the Deputy on 7th March.</p><p>The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.  Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children.</p><p>No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school.</p><p>An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011.</p><p>The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1200 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government.</p><p>The NCSE has published details of the appeals process on the NCSE website: <i>www.ncse.ie.</i></p><p>Schools who wished to submit an appeal were asked to do so by March 31st 2017.</p><p>The NCSE has confirmed that an appeal has been received from the school referred to by the Deputy.</p><p>The appeals are currently being processed and it is intended that schools will shortly be notified of the outcome.</p><p>Schools could appeal whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017/18 allocation.</p><p>DES Circulars 0013/2017 and 0014/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools.</p><p>In advance of any submission of an appeal, schools were asked to read carefully the DES Circulars and in particular the relevant sections, which relate to the breakdown of the allocation, which may be under consideration for appeal.</p><p>The model will also allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model.  The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school.</p><p>Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs have also now been published and are available on my Departments website.</p><p>The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs.  The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants. </p></reply>

No charge may be made, in respect of instruction in any subject of the school curriculum or for recreation or other activities where all pupils are expected to take part.</p>  <p>  However, it is permissible for a school to seek payments in respect of extra-curricular activities provided such activities are not obligatory and individual pupils can choose whether or not to participate.  My Department's Circular 0065/2010 clarifies certain charges that may be legitimately requested from pupils.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, which was published on 6th July 2016, contains a provision prohibiting the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions for an application for admission to a school or for the enrolment or continued enrolment of a student in a school.  The Bill will proceed to Committee Stage on 28th June 2017.</p>  <p>  I believe that schools need to be accountable to parents and we need greater levels of communication, engagement and transparency in how schools serve their communities.  Better information for parents, including information in relation to the collection and use of voluntary contributions, is an issue that I will be looking at in the context of my Department's work on a Parents' and Students' Charter.</p>  <p>  On 5 December 2016, I published the General Scheme of an Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill 2016.  The Government have approved the draft outline of a new law, which when enacted will require every school to consult with parents and students, and publish and operate a Parent and Student Charter. </p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.</p>  <p>  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.</p>  <p>  The Staffing Schedule includes the provision where schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds.  The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.  This process includes a provision in which schools that are not gaining an additional teaching post under the developing schools criterion can submit an appeal to the independent Appeals Board.  This appeal criterion is targeted at those schools that make a significant contribution to the provision of school places and so assist the response to demographic growth within their area.</p>  <p>  The Schools Building Unit of my department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places will arise.  The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Department of Social Protection, in addition to the Department&rsquo;s own databases.  With this information, the Department carries out nationwide demographic analyses at primary and post primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p>  <p>  The analysis of the school planning area, within which the school referred to is located, is not demonstrating a need for additional capacity.  It is important that school size is monitored and that a balance is preserved among all schools in catchment areas to ensure that one school is not expanding at the expense of another school.  My Department considers that there is sufficient capacity in the area to meet current demand.  In that regard, an application for capital funding to providing additional mainstream classroom accommodation was not approved for the school in question.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to IPA therefore comes from our overall contribution to the EU, rather than a specific monetary allocation.</p>  <p>  The Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) supports countries that are candidates or potential candidates for EU membership.  The support goes towards measures aiming at adopting and implementing the political, institutional, legal, administrative, social and economic reforms required to comply with the Union&rsquo;s values and to align progressively with the Union&rsquo;s rules, standards, policies and practices.</p>  <p>  Ireland, along other EU Member States, agrees that Turkey&rsquo;s accession process should not be suspended.  This does not diminish in any way our concerns regarding the negative developments on human rights, rule of law, freedom of expression including media freedom, and democracy in Turkey, particularly since the attempted coup last July, or our concerns regarding the implementation of the referendum passed on 16 April. Quite the contrary.  We have consistently raised these concerns, including about the scale of dismissals and detentions of public servants, academics and journalists at every appropriate opportunity, and will continue to do so.  I am particularly concerned about the arrest of Mr. Taner Kili&ccedil;, Chair of Amnesty International, Turkey on 6 June, and call on the Turkish authorities to ensure that full due process, including the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial is respected.</p>  <p>  Ireland believes that the lines of communication with Turkey must be kept open, bearing in mind the long-term future of all of the citizens of Turkey.  In that context, the EU will continue to work with Turkey to encourage a return to European values.</p></reply>

These are applications that are going through the normal entitlement checking process rather than backlogs.  While the volume of applications in progress remains high, the target turnaround time for Passport Express renewal applications of 15 working days is being met, as it has been over the past six weeks.  The target turnaround time for first-time applications and applications for renewal of lost, stolen or damaged passports through Passport Express is 20 working days.  These categories of application take longer due to the extra security checks involved.  This target turnaround time is also currently being met (down from 24 working days as of 19 June). </p><p>In addition to the 300 full-time permanent staff already assigned within my Department to the Passport Service, almost 230 Temporary Clerical Officers have been assigned to the Passport Offices in Balbriggan, Mount Street and Cork to assist in managing high seasonal demand.  Targeted overtime for the Passport Service has also been sanctioned to increase processing capacity.  The allocation of resources and assignment of work across offices is reviewed continually to maximise efficiency. </p><p>The fact that target turnaround times for Passport Express renewal and first-time applications are being met despite the very significant increases in volumes of applications in recent months reflects the hard work and the professionalism of Passport Service staff. </p><p>Service improvements have also made a major contribution to the effective management of the exceptionally high volumes.  As the Deputy will be aware, the new Online Passport Application Service was launched at the end of March this year.  As take-up of the service increases, it will considerably enhance overall passport processing capacity and contribute to reducing turnaround times for all channels.  Since the launch over 38,000 passport applications were received through this channel which is well ahead of target.  The target turnaround for the service is ten working days plus postage and in the majority of cases this is exceeded comfortably.  I therefore urge all Deputies to encourage adults who are renewing their passports to do so online. </p><p>It is very important that applicants choose the most appropriate application channel for their individual circumstances.

The Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor General also addressed this issue as part of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services in 2014 (No. 9 Development of Prison Accommodation in Dublin) and, again, the PAC subsequently examined this issue in November 2015.</p><p>The Thornton Hall site comprises 156 acres and was purchased for a proposed prison development to replace Mountjoy Prison campus.  Selection of the site began with advertisements in the national newspapers and over 30 potential sites were evaluated by a selection committee.  Thornton was selected as the least costly of the sites which met the relevant criteria.  Full details of the assessment process have been made public and are detailed in the above mentioned C&amp;amp;AG's Annual Report 2005.</p><p>For reasons which are outlined in detail in the reports cited above, the Thornton project did not proceed.  The initial purchase price of the land at Thornton was &euro;29,900,000 in 2005 which was offset by the sale of surplus prison lands at Shanganagh Castle for &euro;29.6 million.  For accounting purposes, the value of the 150 acre site at Thornton continues to be recorded at the cost of &euro;29.9 million, plus investment in infrastructure and services, pending a review of its potential value and benefit to the State.</p><p>In January 2015, a Working Group was established by the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality to examine options for the future use of the Thornton Hall site.  This group, comprising of officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Office of Public Works and the Irish Prison Service, was asked to review potential options for the lands and house at Thornton and make recommendations on how best to maximise the value to the State.  The Working Group has been in contact with other state bodies to explore potential uses for the site, and that work is ongoing.</p><p>Regarding the market valuation of the site, it was felt that the most prudent and transparent way of reflecting the value of Thornton was to continue to incorporate the historic cost in the Statement of Capital Assets.  It is clear that the site has a potential medium or long term strategic value and it is not proposed to speculate on the current resale value of the site pending the outcome of the review.  The findings of the Working Group will be taken into account in determining the value of the asset in the Appropriation Account. </p><p>There were no security costs for the past three years, or to date in 2017.  The following table outlines the costs in respect of ongoing maintenance, repairs &amp;amp; utilities for the past three years and up to 15 June this year.</p><p><b>Ongoing Maintenance, Repairs &amp;amp; Utilities </b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Amount</th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro; 248,190</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro; 117,930</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>&euro; 62,001</td></tr><tr><td>2017 (to 15 June)</td><td>&euro; 51,514</td></tr></table></p></reply>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has installed a new specific data recording IT upgrade on the Garda PULSE system, which requires personnel to record the serial number of the device used for each breath test plus the meter reading before and after the checkpoint was concluded.  Data from the device are now used to verify the total number of breath tests conducted at each checkpoint.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that in addition to outlining the breath test discrepancies, how they came to light, and the remedial steps taken so far, the Commissioner announced the creation of a dedicated team under Assistant Commissioner Michael O&rsquo;Sullivan to investigate in detail the MATs issue, including with a view to identifying and holding responsible for their actions any Garda members, whether at junior, supervisory or management level, who acted improperly, and committed to forwarding the report of this investigation to the Policing Authority and my Department, when completed.  An interim report was forwarded by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Policing Authority in advance of the Authority's recent public meeting on roads policing, which took place on 27 April 2017 and there is ongoing engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Policing Authority in relation to this matter.

This report is to include an  examination of all aspects of the matter, addressing to the extent possible the reasons why issues have arisen, the incidence and scale of the issues and the solutions implemented to ensure there is no recurrence.  I understand that there is ongoing dialogue between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Policing Authority in relation to the preparation of their respective reports into this issue.  The Deputy will appreciate that the ongoing Garda investigation into these matters will no doubt be considered by the Authority in the context of the report it is preparing and that it is right that I await the conclusion of the Authority's work in this area before commenting in more detail on this matter.</p></reply>

However, I am informed that a case has recently concluded; it is not possible at this time to make the outcome of the case public, pending the possibility of an appeal.  All decisions by the Workplace Relations Commission are confidential to the parties involved until published by the Workplace Relations Commission.</p>  <p>  Clear statutory provisions are in place to address the issue of racist abuse.  The Irish Prison Service can and does address alleged racial abuse by prisoners within a statutory environment and having regard to the unique nature of the prison environment and the legal status of prisoners sent by the Courts.  Statutory Instrument 252 of 2007, Prison Rules 2007, identifies racist abuse as a serious breach of prison discipline and also makes provision for complaints about racist abuse.  "A prisoner shall be guilty of a breach of prison discipline if he or she - treats with disrespect, through the use of any abusive, insolent, racist or threatening behaviour or language, the governor, any prison officer, any prisoner, any visitor to the prison or any other person" [Paragraph 3  Schedule 1  Prison Rules 2007] &ldquo;displays, attaches, or draws on any part of a prison, or on any other property, threatening, abusive or insulting racist words, drawings, symbols or other material.&rdquo;  [Paragraph 31 Schedule 1 of the  Prison Rules 2007].  Racism is placed on the same level as threatening behaviour.</p>  <p>  As I am sure the Deputy will agree, a prison is a unique environment.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) in May 2015 acknowledged the special difficulties that a prison environment presented and noted: &ldquo;The Commission understands the difficulties that may arise in the context of eliminating racial harassment, or indeed any form of discriminatory harassment within the Prison system where the alleged perpetrator is a prisoner. In this regard, it is noted that disciplinary procedures are governed by primary legislation and statute.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The Prison Rules 2007 inform both staff and prisoners alike that engaging in racial abuse constitutes a significant breach of prison discipline which will merit severe sanction.  Any victim of racial abuse is made fully aware of the mechanisms available to him or her under the provisions, whereby they can seek redress by way of complaint for any racial abuse suffered.  Sanctions which can be imposed on prisoners for breaching prison discipline are contained in the Prisons Act 2007.</p>  <p>  In 2014 the Irish Prison Service conducted a survey of its staff on Experiences of Equality and Diversity within the Irish Prison Service.  The staff responses in the survey did not identify racism as  a significant issue within the service, however the Irish Prison Service remains firmly committed to raising racial awareness as well as highlighting other forms of discrimination and has initiated measures such as &ldquo;Show Racism the Red Card&rdquo; to promote racial awareness within the prison.</p>  <p>  A new prisoner complaints procedure was introduced  from 1 November 2012.  This allows for all complaints made by prisoners alleging serious ill treatment, use of excessive force, serious intimidation/discrimination or threats by a member or staff of the Irish Prison Service to be investigated by an independent investigator.  The Inspector of Prisons Office has oversight of all investigations, has access to any material relevant to any such investigation and may investigate any aspects that is considered relevant.</p>  <p>  Complaints from prison staff regarding alleged harassment by other prison staff on any of the following nine grounds - gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race or membership of the Travelling community are dealt with under the Civil Service Dignity at Work policy which outlines procedures for dealing with such complaints.  All complaints or queries raised in relation to bullying, harassment or sexual harassment are treated seriously, fairly and in the strictest of confidence.  The Dignity at Work policy promotes respect, dignity, safety and equality in the workplace.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter.  I am informed that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, on 13 June 2017 the Government agreed in principle to the reopening of Stepaside Garda station on a pilot basis as soon as any necessary preparatory works have been completed.  This is a matter to be progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p>  <p>  This plan is progressing  apace.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 1,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division.</p></reply>

However, I can inform the Deputy that it is through the work of the Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau and the dedicated Drug Units operating across the jurisdiction that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na target those involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.  The specific strategies put in place by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na include the operation of targeted intelligence led initiatives.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware on 8 and 10 June, 2017 two similar packages, of similar appearance, were found at Achill, Co. Mayo and Ballyconneely, Co. Galway.  Both packages, following analysis, were found to contain Cocaine with an estimated street value of approximately &euro;160,000.  Follow-up searches were conducted by Mayo and Galway Divisional search teams with other Garda personnel from Westport and Clifden Garda Districts, supported by the Garda Water Unit.  These searches proved negative.</p>  <p>  A large portion of the Garda Western Region comprises of the exposed Atlantic coastline with Coast Watch Schemes, similar to Neighbourhood Watch Schemes, established in three Garda Divisions in the Region.  Divisional Drugs Units, established within the Region, are specifically tasked with enforcing the Misuse of Drugs Acts and related legislation, including the importation and sale/supply of illicit drugs.  An Inspector in each Division is designated with responsibility for each Coast Watch Scheme and liaises with resident, community, business and local fishermen to ensure that any suspicious activity is reported, through local Garda personnel and Community Policing Units to the Divisional Drug Units.</p>  <p>  The Divisional Drug Units liaise closely with the Garda National Drugs &amp;amp; Organised Crime Bureau, the Revenue Commissioners and the Defence Forces (Navy).  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also work in partnership with other  Law Enforcement Agencies at home and abroad, including the Revenue Commissioners (Customs Service), the Health Products Regulatory Authority, Police Service of Northern Ireland, the National Crime Agency (UK), Europol, Interpol and the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre &ndash; Narcotics (MAOC-N).</p>  <p>  More broadly, work is well under way in regards to a comprehensive and integrated new National Drugs Strategy for the period post 2016 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains resolute in its determination to act against those within society who pose a significant threat to the welfare and well-being of our citizens and the communities we serve.  The continued disruption of the supply of all illicit drugs remains a priority for all agencies tasked with responsibilities in this regard.</p></reply>

In the case of four of the NGOs both men and women benefitted from DAF projects (Sexual Violence Centre Cork, Doras Luimn&iacute;, MRCI and ICI) however the Ruhama initiative funded under this Scheme focused solely on female participants. </p><p>A full breakdown of all funding provided is captured in Table 4.</p><p><b>Table 4</b><table><tr><th>Type of Funding</th><th>Organisation</th><th>Amount - &euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Mainstream Funding*</td><td>Ruhama</td><td>275,000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MRCI</td><td>41,428</td></tr><tr><td>Dormant Accounts Funding*</td><td>Ruhama</td><td>40,000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MRCI</td><td>40,000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Doras Luimn&iacute;</td><td>40,000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Sexual Violence Centre Cork</td><td>40,000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Immigrant Council of Ireland</td><td>40,000</td></tr></table></p><p>Lastly, the Probation Service works in partnership with a range of community based organisations and provides funding to enable them to develop and deliver services in communities which enhance the work of the Probation Service in changing offending behaviour.</p><p>In 2016, the Probation Service provided just under &euro;10.7 million directly to community based organisations working with adults.  Most of these organisations deal with both male and female offenders.  However, a number of organisations deal solely with female offenders including T&uacute;s Nua, SAOL and WRENS.  T&uacute;s Nua, for example, is a specialised service established specifically to support women, who are either homeless upon their release from prison or women with an offending background and who are homeless in the community.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p>  <p>  This plan is progressing apace.  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that just under 1,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division.</p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p>  <p>  The Special Detective Unit (SDU) is responsible for the investigation of threats to the state security and the monitoring of persons who pose a threat to the security of the State on both national and international fronts.  The Unit also provides security for visiting VIPs, cash in transit movements and armed response and is the operational wing of the Witness Security Programme.  The highly trained and equipped specialist intervention unit, the Emergency Response Unit, is also part of SDU.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioner that for security and operational reasons the strength of the SDU cannot be provided.</p></reply>

This was in addition to a sum of &euro;550,000 which transferred to my Department from the Department of Social Protection (for 7 Special Initiative for Travellers projects) on 1 January 2015.  My Department provided funding of &euro;273,800 in 2014, &euro;864,188 in 2015 and &euro;2,103,830 in 2016 for Traveller specific initiatives.  Details of the funding allocation in the years in question are set out in the following Table.</p><p>As in previous years, my Department has made funding available to Traveller Interagency Groups and Community Groups for activities around Traveller Pride Week in 2017.  Funding, averaging about &euro;2,000 for each approved project, is available for suitable projects which celebrate Traveller Culture in local communities.  The flagship event of Traveller Pride Week, the Traveller Pride Awards, is also sponsored by my Department.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has led a comprehensive consultation process to develop the new National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy, which I launched on 13 June 2017, to improve the situation for Travellers and Roma in Ireland.  I have been successful in gaining sanction for &euro;1 million in additional funding in 2017 for Traveller and Roma initiatives related to the new Inclusion Strategy.  This is a  positive step forward and demonstrates both the Government&rsquo;s and my Department's commitment to supporting the Traveller community nationwide.</p><p>My Department has an advisory group in place.  The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy Steering Group was set up in 2015 after a review of existing Traveller and Roma consultation structures by my Department to monitor and assess the implementation of the Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy and is in line with the EU Framework for the Implementation of Roma Integration Strategies.<table><tr><th>-</th><th></th><th>2014</th><th></th><th>2015</th><th></th><th>2016</th><th></th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Cost</td><td>Agency</td><td>Cost</td><td>Agency</td><td>Cost</td><td>Agency</td><td>Cost</td><td>Agency</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>&euro;2,000</td><td>Carlow Traveller Interagency Group</td><td>&euro;2,000</td><td>St. Catherines Community Services Centre</td><td>&euro;2,000</td><td>Carlow Traveller Interagency Group</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>&euro;2,000</td><td>Cavan Traveller Interagency Group</td><td>&euro;2,090</td><td>Cavan Traveller Interagency Group</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>&euro;2,000</td><td>Clare Traveller Interagency Group</td><td>&euro;38,071</td><td>Congress  Info. &amp;amp; Opportunity Centre, Clare</td><td>&euro;26,962</td><td>Congress  Info. &amp;amp; Opportunity Centre, Clare</td><td>&euro;27,758</td><td>Congress  Info. &amp;amp; Opportunity Centre, Clare</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>&euro;8,000</td><td>Ennis CDP</td><td>&euro;12,000</td><td>Ennis CDP</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>&euro;2,000</td><td>Clare Traveller Interagency Group</td><td>&euro;11,055</td><td>Minceirs Whiden</td><td>&euro;35,132</td><td>Minceirs Whiden</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>&euro;3,000</td><td>Clare Traveller Interagency Group</td><td>&euro;2,000</td><td>Clare Traveller Interagency Group</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>&euro;4,700</td><td>Traveller Interagency Group</td><td>&euro;44,453</td><td>First EmployAbility Services Cork</td><td>&euro;33,735</td><td>First EmployAbility Services Cork</td><td>&euro;23,505</td><td>First EmployAbility Services Cork</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>&euro;4,237</td><td>Cork City Traveller Interagency Group</td><td>&euro;4,000</td><td>Cork City Traveller Interagency Group</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>&euro;1,460</td><td>Cork County Traveller Interagency Group</td><td>&euro;1,850</td><td>Cork County Traveller Interagency Group</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>&euro;2,000</td><td>Donegal Local Devlopment Co</td><td>&euro;46,757</td><td>Donegal Local Devlopment Co</td><td>&euro;51,390</td><td>Donegal Local Devlopment Co</td><td>&euro;12,909</td><td>Donegal Local Devlopment Co</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>&euro;2,000</td><td>Donegal Local Devlopment Co</td><td>&euro;88,460</td><td>Donegal Travellers Project</td><td>&euro;43,230</td><td>Donegal Travellers Project</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>&euro;89,486</td><td>Pavee Point</td><td>&euro;8,000</td><td>Traveller Counselling Service</td><td>&euro;46,650</td><td>Traveller Counselling Service</td><td></td><td>Traveller Counselling Service</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;360</td><td>Fingal Travellers Development Group</td><td>&euro;28,664</td><td>Pavee Point</td><td>&euro;104,514</td><td>Pavee Point</td><td>&euro;56,282</td><td>Pavee Point</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;4,000</td><td>Sth.

One of the key measures in the legislation provides for Preliminary Drug Testing, which enables Garda&iacute; to test motorists at the roadside, whom they suspect of driving under the influence of drugs, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can now establish roadside checkpoints, known as Mandatory Impairment Checkpoints (MITs), to test drivers for the presence of both alcohol and drugs. </p>  <p>  The new drug testing devices (Dr&auml;ger DrugTest 5000) involve testing a sample of a driver&rsquo;s oral fluid (saliva) for the presence of cannabis, cocaine, opiates (e.g. heroin, morphine) and benzodiazepines (e.g. valium).  The new devices will also be available in Garda stations.  The MBRS has found that of the 3,020 specimens of blood and urine that it received in 2016, 24% confirmed positive for drugs other than alcohol.  Of these, 91% were specimens from male drivers, most of whom were in the 17-44 year age range. Cannabis was the most prevalent drug detected, followed by benzodiazepines.</p>  <p>  At the recent meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Road Safety in May this year, the MBRS informed the committee that a tender for new preliminary breath testing equipment is now live and it is hoped that all stages of the process will be completed by early 2018.  New equipment, which is available in the market place, has the capacity to record the time, GPS location and number of persons breath-tested, and has the capacity to download the information automatically, reducing the chances of errors occurring in the data.</p>  <p>  To support the introduction of Preliminary Drug Testing, I am advised that the Road Safety Authority is running a comprehensive online media campaign, targeting the use of illicit drugs in the 18 to 34 year old age bracket, to raise awareness of the new Garda drug-testing powers.  This campaign will primarily feature videos which demonstrate how the drug tests will be administered on the road side and the consequences should a driver be detected driving under the influence of drugs.  This awareness campaign will run on social media, radio and digital platforms.  The Road Safety Authority is also running a parallel campaign, aimed at allaying the concerns of those taking medicines and driving (over the counter and prescription drugs).  Specifically, the Road Safety Authority is putting information leaflets into pharmacies and doctors&rsquo; surgeries nationwide.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that drug driving is a factor in approximately one in ten fatal crashers.  Drug driving not only puts the driver at risk but also passengers and other road users.  The introduction of Preliminary Drug Testing strengthens the ability of Garda&iacute; to tackle drug driving and I welcome this important statutory enforcement provision.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>Coolock, Raheny, Clontarf and Howth Garda stations form part of the DMR North Division.  I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the DMR North  Division on 30 April 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 661.  There are also<b></b>49 Garda Reserves and 42 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. </p><p>This plan is progressing  apace.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that almost 1,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 75 of whom have been assigned to the DMR North Division.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.

This work is further supported by other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau, in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.  This approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide.  Multi-disciplinary approaches are also utilised to ensure that those involved in illicit activity are effectively targeted including through the use of the proceeds of crime legislation, money laundering legislation and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na District and Station Rationalisation Programme gave rise to the closure of some 139 Garda stations, in 2012 and 2013, following the completion by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of a comprehensive review of its district and station network.  That review was undertaken with the objective of identifying opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation.  I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the closures have allowed front-line Garda to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to targeted police operations. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  Revisiting the decisions made to close Garda stations is also part of that commitment. </p>  <p>  In this context, the Government on 24 June 2016 authorised the then Minister to request the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions, to identify 6 stations for reopening on a pilot basis to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.  The Commissioner's second interim report was considered by Government on 13 June 2017 when it agreed in principle to the reopening of Stepaside Garda station on a pilot basis as soon as any necessary preparatory works have been completed.  The Government also agreed that a decision in relation to the proposed reopening of  Rush, Leighlinbridge and Donard stations will be taken when a final report is received from the Commissioner. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p>  <p>  This plan is progressing apace.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide-ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that almost 1,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of garda&iacute; across every Garda Division.</p></reply>

The Strategy is a cross-Government approach that brings together actions by different Departments and State agencies in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities.  In tandem with that, it seeks to ensure there will be joined-up services and supports at local level to support individuals on their journey into and in employment.</p>  <p>  The Strategy is monitored and overseen by the Comprehensive Employment Strategy Implementation Group under an independent chair.  The key issue in relation to the implementation of the Strategy is the co-ordination of departmental efforts in this area, and therefore, while individual actions in the Strategy may have additional cost implications which will require to be included in the Votes of the relevant Departments, taken as a whole, the focus in the Strategy is on better co-ordination and use of existing resources, rather than on additional funding allocations.</p></reply>

The remaining &euro;30 million is available for schemes which will be delivered at a national level.  The allocated funding was not distributed to County Councils; rather it has been allocated to 28 LEADER sub-regional areas in Ireland, and will be delivered by the Local Action Groups (LAGs) selected in each respective area. </p><p>The sub-regional areas are, in the main, aligned with the county boundaries.  However, Co. Cork is divided into 3 sub-regional areas.  The allocation for each sub-regional area is provided for the duration of the Programme rather than on an annual basis.  This provides greater flexibility to the LAGs in managing their resources.  </p><p>Table 1 details the allocations to LAGs in each county and the expenditure incurred in each county each year to date under the LEADER 2014-2020 Programme.  This expenditure commenced in 2015 and relates to preparatory support payments for the preparation of Local Development Strategies in each area and to the administration and animation costs incurred by the LAGs in the delivery of the Programme.  </p><p>No project expenditure has yet been incurred under the LEADER 2014-2020 programme.  However, the LAGs are currently concluding calls for proposals and are working with potential applicants to develop and finalise project applications in each LEADER sub-regional area.

The programme provides funding for small scale infrastructural projects in disadvantaged rural areas that have experienced significant levels of depopulation.  Funding for the 2017 CL&Aacute;R programme was available this year under four separate Measures:</p><p>Measure 1:  Support for School and Community Safety Measures </p><p>Measure 2:  Play Areas </p><p>Measure 3:  Targeted Community Infrastructure </p><p>Measure 4:  First Responder Supports </p><p>Over 500 applications were received across the four Measures to the value of &euro;15 million.  In recent weeks, 231 successful projects were announced, with a total of just under &euro;7 million allocated across the four Measures. </p><p>The following table outlines the number of projects received, approved and unsuccessful for each county.  The full list of approved projects including their funding allocation, by county, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i></i>.</p><p>Funding to support projects under CL&Aacute;R this year was limited and it was not possible to fund all applications.

The Local Development Strategies and Local Action Groups were selected by an Independent Selection Committee.  That process is now concluded, with Funding Agreements signed with 29 LEADER Local Action Groups for the duration of the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme.  </p>  <p>  Following on from that selection process, two separate models have emerged for the delivery of the LEADER 2014-2020 Programme in Ireland.  The first of these models mirrors the approach used in the 2007-2013 programme where some Local Development Companies were successful in being selected as the LEADER Local Action Group.  The second model is where the Local Community Development Committees were selected as the Local Action Group, with the Local Development Companies from the 2007-2013 programme administering much of the programme on their behalf.  In both models, the Local Development Companies continue to be the primary point of engagement for potential applicants under the LEADER programme. </p>  <p>  I do not have the authority, under EU rules, to unilaterally remove one of the delivery models and appoint new Local Action Groups.  In any event, the merits of one model over the other was not an issue raised by stakeholders at the LEADER forum which I hosted on 17th May last.  The forum was held with participants from all of the Local Action Groups and the Local Development Companies delivering LEADER, to explore the issues of concern to them and to identify potential solutions aimed at streamlining the current administrative and application procedures under the programme.  </p>  <p>  The forum, which was attended by more than 70 people, was very productive and participants identified a number of areas where they felt procedures could be streamlined and where the burden on project applicants could be reduced.</p>  <p>  My officials have reviewed all of the contributions made at the forum and have identified a list of 31 Action Points which I am committed to implementing in order to improve administrative procedures, in partnership with the Local Action Groups and Local Development Companies in many instances.  I have written to all of the Local Action Groups and Local Development Companies, outlining these improvements.  </p>  <p>  The changes being introduced will improve the administrative processes associated with the delivery of the LEADER programme to the benefit of rural communities throughout the country, and I expect to see a substantial increase in project approvals throughout the rest of the year.   </p></reply>

Much of this guidance and the recommendations for patients, which was issued in July 2012, is equally relevant to those patients considering laser refractive surgery and cosmetic procedures.  The guidance is available on the Department's website.</p>  <p>  More broadly, as the Deputy may be aware, my Department is currently advancing a number of initiatives aimed at improving the quality and safety of both public and private health services in Ireland.  This includes the Patient Safety Licensing Bill, which will for the first time introduce a regulatory regime for all hospitals in the State, public and private, as well as certain designated high risk activities which take place outside a hospital setting.  I hope to be able to refer this new Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny in the autumn.  In advance of that, the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill, which has recently undergone pre-legislative scrutiny with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health, will allow for the extension of the Health Information and Quality Authority's remit to private hospitals.  In addition, legislative provisions in relation to the open disclosure of patient safety incidents, contained within the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill 2017, are currently making their way through the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  I would also note that, beyond these coming changes to the regulatory environment, it is also the case that clinicians remain subject to the requirements of their professional regulatory bodies.</p></reply>

The 2013 Act specifies the criteria to be applied in the making of decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p><p>Part 4 of the 2013 Act provides, inter alia, for the establishment and maintenance of a &quot;Reimbursement List&quot; for the purposes of section 59 of the Health Act 1970.</p><p>Section 18 of the 2013 Act allows a supplier of an item to apply to the HSE requesting the HSE to add the item to the Reimbursement List.</p><p>In considering an application, the HSE will also have regard to Part 1 and Part 3 of Schedule 3 of the 2013 Act.</p><p>Section 19(4) of the 2013 Act prohibits the HSE from making a relevant decision under section 18 &quot;except in accordance with the criteria specified in Schedule 3&quot;.  Schedule 3 sets out nine general criteria, of which one is the resources available to the Executive.</p><p>Under the 2016 Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines, in a situation where the HSE wishes to reimburse a medicine but cannot do so from within existing resources, it may inform my Department of its decision in this respect.  The Minister for Health may, as he deems appropriate, bring a Memorandum to Government in relation to the funding implications and requesting consideration of same.</p><p>In line with the Framework Agreement and since its introduction in July 2016, the HSE has referred four treatments to my Department for consideration: Orkambi (including Kalydeco), Eviredge, Entresto and Britellix.</p><p>Prior to the introduction of the Framework Agreement one treatment, Ibrutinib, was referred to my Department in 2016.</p><p>The reason each treatment was referred to my Department was because the HSE decided to support the reimbursement application but considered that this could not be funded from within its current budgetary envelope and also taking account of the cumulative costs over a 5 year period.</p><p>Following consideration by my Department and Government of the funding implications, the HSE decided, in line with the 2013 Act to reimburse Ibrutinib and Orkambi (including Kalydeco).</p><p>The remaining three treatments are currently under consideration by my Department.</p><p>In addition to this, the HSE has informed my Department on 21 June that there are 6 other medicines approved to date in 2017 which may have additional budgetary implications outside the 2017 Service Plan.  However, the HSE have stated that it would be difficult to predict precisely at this stage as to whether these medicines can be funded from within the existing HSE allocation.</p><p>It should be noted that the final decision in relation to the reimbursement of all medicines remains the statutory responsibility of the HSE.</p></reply>

These protocols ensure that all women eligible for the programme receive the highest quality mammography screening based on international evidence.</p>  <p>  At present, digital mammography platforms do not provide a quantifiable breast density measurement.  BreastCheck has always emphasised that any screening mammogram cannot detect all cancers and, therefore, a woman developing any symptom after a normal mammogram should contact their GP.</p>  <p>  Digital mammography was introduced by BreastCheck in 2007 following a successful pilot programme which demonstrated significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy, particularly for women with denser breast tissue, when compared to analogue or screen-film mammography.</p>  <p>  The digital format has resulted in enhancement of image quality, particularly associated with improved visualisation of dense breast tissue.

The Health Research Board published a report on the NDRDI in December 2016, which shows deaths up to 2014, the latest year for which data is available.</p>  <p>  According to the NDRDI, there were 592 drug-related deaths between 2012 and 2014 where any opiate(s) were implicated.  Some of these deaths involved synthetic opiates, either alone or with another opiate type drug.  Synthetic opiates (for the purposes of this analysis) include Methadone, Tramadol, Oxycodone and Fentanyl.  It is important to note that these figures are based on a multi-response analysis  which means that some deaths could have more than one type of synthetic opiate implicated and therefore could be counted more than once, for example in the methadone-related deaths and the Tramadol-related deaths.</p>  <p>  Methadone was the most common synthetic opiate implicated in drug-related deaths over the three years (279 deaths), followed by Tramadol (72 deaths), Oxycodone (37 deaths) and Fentanyl (8 deaths).  The source of the drug is not always known, so therefore it is not possible to confirm if they were prescribed.</p>  <p>  The NDRDI does not include poisoning deaths due to medical misadventure, where the death was due to an error of a health professional.</p></reply>

The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card.  Notwithstanding this, I am aware that in recent times some GPs have begun to charge GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances. </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position of Government and the Oireachtas that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit care patients.</p>  <p>  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient may make a complaint to the HSE Local Health Office, who will deal with the matter in accordance with the HSE's Complaints Policy.</p>  <p>  In order to achieve clarity on this issue, I have asked that any difference of perspective in relation to the provision of phlebotomy services be addressed in the GP contractual review process, which is currently underway.

It is important therefore that we upgrade our public bed stock and this is the aim of the 5 year Capital Investment Programme for Community Nursing Units which was announced last year.  This provides the framework to allow for an enhanced programme to replace, upgrade and refurbish these care facilities, as appropriate.  Significant work was undertaken to determine the most optimum scheduling of projects within the phased provision of funding to achieve compliance with National Standards.  By the end of 2016 I understand that 14 projects were operational and a further 12 are expected to be operational by the end of this year.  </p>  <p>  Under this Programme it is proposed to build a 100 bed community nursing unit in Cashel by the end of 2021, through a Public Private Partnership or alternative funding model, to replace St Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital. </p>  <p>  Operational responsibility for delivering the programme is a matter for the HSE.

An Order requiring the defendants to make Discovery was made in the High Court on 28 November 2016 in the most advanced case.  Discovery is a legal process which must be carried out in accordance with Orders made by the Courts and both the Department of Health and the HSE are working to comply with the Order made in this case.  However, the size and complexity of the Discovery means that this is not a trivial or quick process and, to date, the HSE has identified 300,000 records and the Department over 465,000 records, all which must be examined and scheduled by Counsel.  Consequently, I am currently not in a position to release all the information requested by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, it is important to remember the context in which vaccination against influenza type A (H1N1) was introduced.  On 11 June 2009, following consideration by its Emergency Committee, the WHO raised the Influenza type A (H1N1) alert to Pandemic level 6 which officially declares a pandemic.  My Department activated the National Plan for pandemic influenza and, based on the advices of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; groups were prioritised for vaccination.  Vaccination of children was prioritised as the rates of influenza were highest in those groups at that time.  The public pandemic vaccination campaign ended on 31 March 2010.  </p>  <p>  The first reports of a link between pandemic influenza vaccination and narcolepsy came in the second half of 2010.  In August 2010, the Swedish pharmacovigilance authority reported that it was investigating six cases of narcolepsy reported by health care professionals as a possible adverse event following the use of Pandemrix vaccine during the pandemic.  This was followed later that month by reports from the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare noting there had been a more than expected number of cases of narcolepsy in children and adolescents that year.  On 23 September 2010, the Committee on Human Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency concluded in its initial review of available data that the available evidence did not confirm a link but that more research was needed.  By the end of March 2011 the Irish Medicines Board, now the Health Products Regulatory Authority, had received reports of two confirmed cases of narcolepsy following vaccination with pandemic vaccines.  My Department and the HSE agreed that the Health Protection Surveillance Centre would work with the Irish Medicines Board and Irish clinical experts in narcolepsy to examine the Irish data and report back the findings.  The Final Report of National Narcolepsy Study Steering Committee was published on 19 April 2012.  It found a 13-fold higher risk of narcolepsy in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated individuals and the absolute increased risk associated with the vaccine was five narcolepsy cases per 100,000 vaccinated children and adolescents.</p>  <p>  Finally, since the 2010/2011 influenza season H1N1 has been incorporated in the seasonal flu vaccine used in Ireland.</p></reply>

Those hospitals/maternity units currently providing anomaly scans accept referrals from other maternity units, if requested.  This occurs where the medical team in the referring maternity unit consider that an anomaly scan is clinically indicated.</p>  <p>  The National Maternity Strategy is very clear that all women must have equal access to standardised ultrasound services.  The Strategy will be implemented on a phased basis and this work will be led by the HSE National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme.  Indeed, the issue of anomaly scanning is a priority issue for the Programme and, accordingly, it will develop clinical guidance regarding routine detailed scans at 20 weeks.  In the meantime, the Programme will continue to work with the six Hospital Groups to assist in increasing access to anomaly scans for those units with limited availability. </p>  <p>  One of the current challenges to increase access to anomaly scans is the recruitment of ultrasonographers.  In this context, it is expected that the establishment of Maternity Networks across Hospital Groups will assist in developing a sustainable model that ensures that all women within each Hospital Group can access anomaly scans.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware of the key recommendation of the <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility </i>that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  The Expert Panel Report also concluded that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  Therefore, medical card provision is based on financial assessment.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Accordingly, a patient suffering from either MS or MND will not have automatic eligibility for a medical card.</p><p>Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.  In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.  The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.</p><p>Within the application process, the HSE endeavours to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  The legislation allows the HSE, in certain circumstances, to exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses. </p><p>The HSE is required to undertake reviews of eligibility in order to ensure that a person continues to meet the qualifying criteria required to continue holding eligibility.  Where a medical card is due to expire, these cards are reviewed and a renewal notice is sent out to the medical card holder three months in advance of the expiry date.  It is important to note that the person under review maintains eligibility for the card while the review is being conducted, including any period where additional information is requested.</p><p>I have asked the HSE to examine the particular case to which the Deputy has drawn attention.  I have also asked the HSE to supply the data requested on medical card reviews and to reply to the Deputy on these matters as soon as possible.</p></reply>

As a general rule public transport should be used in all circumstances where it is an option.  This is in keeping with the principle of mainstreaming with a clear focus on ensuring persons with a disability have access to the normal range of services and participate in community life as far as possible.  It must be noted that in general, day service users are in receipt of disability allowance and are automatically entitled to the Free Travel Pass, so there should be no additional cost burden at an individual level.</p>  <p>  Funding is not provided for the transportation of young people to and from day services.  However when all other options are exhausted and a person cannot avail of a day service because they do not have transport to attend, the service provider is advised to use some of the service money to cover the transport costs &ndash; this usually results in the provision of a reduced quantum of service.</p>  <p>  Social Care Division have committed in its Operation Plan 2017 to establish a high level cross divisional working group to rationalise the provision of transport and to maximise equitable access and efficiencies and are liaising with the National Transport Authority (NTA) and voluntary providers to progress this issue.  The NTA have a total of 17 transport co-ordinating units called Local Link. Local link provides safe secure and reliable public transport services in local and rural areas of Ireland.  Local Link provides a combination of scheduled public transport services and door to door services.  The services are demand response (e.g. people call Local Link for transport to access a service such as their GP), the NTA have advised that additional funding has been provided for rural transport in 2017.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy's question relates to an individual case, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-27a.931.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062700081#WRR03000"><p>The 2005 strategy referred to by the deputy has largely been superseded by <i>A Healthy Weight for Ireland</i>- The National Obesity Policy and Action Plan (OPAP).  This was published last September.  It is one of the key developments arising from Healthy Ireland, the framework for improving health and wellbeing across the population. </p><p>The OPAP covers a ten year period up to 2025 and aims to reverse obesity trends, prevent health complications and reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system, and the wider society and economy. </p><p>I wish to emphasise that every sector of our society has a role in reducing the burden of obesity and the OPAP clearly acknowledges this. </p><p>The OPAP firstly prescribes 'Ten Steps Forward' to deal with obesity.  Step 7 is: Develop a service model for specialist care for children and adults.  There are a number of actions under this step including:</p><p>1. Plan for and support the development of specialist, consultant-led multidisciplinary care, based on the chosen model of care and the RCPI report, for adults on an equitable geographic basis (one within each hospital group) and one for children at national level;</p><p>2. develop and implement integrated clinical care models for adults and children with appropriate clinical care pathways for all patients;</p><p>3. develop standards, clinical guidelines and quality assurance programmes for obesity and weight management services in the health sector.</p><p>The appointment of a National Clinical Lead for Obesity in the HSE is among the priority actions recommended.  The National Clinical Lead will be responsible for providing among other things, a model of care for children and adults and overseeing its implementation.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the HSE is in the process of appointing a National clinical Lead for Obesity.</p><p>The OPAP includes a number of other priority actions including:</p><p>- Implementing a 'whole of school' approach to healthy lifestyle programmes which includes nutrition, physical activity and exercise, smoking, alcohol and mental wellbeing;</p><p>- agreeing food reformulation targets with the food industry;</p><p>- developing a code of practice for food and drinks promotion, marketing, sponsorship and product placement;</p><p>- developing a communications strategy to increase knowledge among the public of being a healthy weight and to stimulate health behaviour change;</p><p>- developing proposals for a National Nutrition Policy and Action Plan;</p><p>- developing legislation for calorie posting to support people in making healthy choices;</p><p>- implementing the National Physical Activity Plan;</p><p>- developing proposals on evidence-based fiscal measures such as a levy on sugar-sweetened drinks;</p><p>- developing research in the area.</p><p>I am pleased to advise the deputy that The Healthy Eating/Food Pyramid Guidelines have been revised and updated by a multi-stakeholder Working Group led by my Department.  These were launched in December 2016 as the Healthy Food for Life initiative.  A Food Reformulation Working Group is being established to reduce the sugar, fat and salt content of foods and beverages, in line with the EU Food Reformulation Project.  The development of legislation on calorie posting is also underway.  </p><p>A Working Group has been established to develop a voluntary Code of Practice on Food Advertising, Promotion and Marketing including retail product placement and sponsorship.  My Department has also worked with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) on the marketing of food and drink to children; this arises in the context of the revised Children&rsquo;s Code to restrict marketing of high fat, high salt and high sugar foods and drinks.  My Department will make a submission to the BAI in 2017 on the new code.</p><p>The HSE has advised that currently programmes for treatment of obesity include a Weight Management Service in St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital , Loughlinstown, Co. Dublin and a regional bariatric service for patients with severe and complicated obesity at the Saolta University Health Care Group.  There is also a  programme  for children carried  out in  Temple Street Hospital called W82GO.  It is a 12-month family-based obesity treatment programme for children and teenagers, which provides families with health, nutrition, self-esteem, family communication and activity guidance along with support in a safe environment so that families can achieve the healthiest lifestyle for them.  The treatment follows best practice and is multidisciplinary.  Before starting the programme, the child is reviewed by a paediatrician, paediatric dietician, paediatric physiotherapist and paediatric psychologist.

The process requires medical assessment to determine if the test set out in the Supreme Court judgment in the <i>X</i>case is met.</p><p>Medical procedures carried out under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 are subject to strict patient confidentiality, in line with guidance on confidentiality in medical practice as set out in the current Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics For Registered Medical Practitioners.  While section 20 of the Act requires that the Minister for Health be notified of each termination of pregnancy no later than 28 days after it has taken place, reports under the Act are anonymised so as to protect women who have had terminations and their medical practitioners.  </p><p>An annual report on notifications under the Act must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas each year.  Two such annual reports have been published to date and are available on the Department of Health website.  The Annual Report for 2014 shows that twenty-six medical procedures were carried out under the Act, and the second Annual Report shows that twenty-six medical procedures were also carried out in 2015 under the Act.  The third Annual Report, covering the period 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016, will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on or before 30 June this year.  The data it covers will not be available before that time.</p><p>In addition, the HSE publishes an annual report on the formal review process provided for under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, which covers situations in which a woman has been refused a termination or where she has been unable to obtain an opinion.  The formal review pathway is in addition to, and not in substitution for, the option of the woman seeking a second medical opinion as with normal medical practice.  </p><p>The Annual Report for 2014 showed that one application for review was received, one review was carried out and the review committee found that the application did not meet the criteria for lawful termination of pregnancy under the Act.  The Annual Report for 2015 showed that again one application was received by the HSE, one review was carried out and the review committee found that the application met the criteria for lawful termination of pregnancy.  As set out previously, figures for 2016 will be available after they have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on or before 30 June.</p></reply>

General practitioners are private contractors and are not covered by the proposed Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to continuing to develop and strengthen primary care services, including general practitioner services.  I recognise that it will, over time, be necessary to invest further in these services while at the same time ensuring best value for such additional spending.  The Deputy will be aware of the engagement in relation to GP contracts which is under way at present.

The first confirmed finding of the disease in Ireland was made on October 2012 at a forestry plantation site in Co. Leitrim which had been planted in 2009 with trees imported from continental Europe.</p><p>The Department introduced a Reconstitution Scheme (Chalara Ash Dieback) in 2013 to restore forests planted under the afforestation scheme which had suffered from or which were associated with plants affected by the disease.  The Department has continued to undertake systematic and targeted surveys annually for the disease.  In addition to the increase in findings in forest plantations, there is also an increasing diversity of sites where the disease is now being identified (i.e. in terms of provenance, age, area/extent, topography and species mix etc.).  Over half the recent findings in forest plantations are in ash trees of native Irish origin.</p><p>The Department has also received considerable feedback from affected landowners, Registered Forester/Forestry Companies, and other forest sector stakeholders, in relation to the increasing prevalence of the disease and aspects of the Reconstitution Scheme.</p><p>A comprehensive review of the overall policy objectives and options of the All-Ireland Chalara Control Strategy has been finalised.  As part of the review process the Department committed to revise certain aspects of its policies and procedures around the disease.  The outcome of this review does not include an increase in the grant rate for this scheme.  However, other changes to the scheme are as follows:</p><p>- The mechanisms and procedures by which infected ash plantations are reported, inspected, sampled, tested, and if confirmed positive progressed for clearance or other disease management works have been streamlined;</p><p>- The use of two different notification letters (one to the forest owner and the other to the Registered Forester on file) has been discontinued, with greater clarity given as to why the forest owners need to undertake the removal and destruction of infected ash trees or other disease control measures, as well as the financial supports available;</p><p>- The rules in relation to where a  second instalment afforestation grant is due for payment on a plantation where the disease has been confirmed have been clarified and made less burdensome for both the forest owner and his/her Registered Forester/Registered Forestry Company.</p><p>- The timeframe given in the notification letter, which currently requires a forest owner to remove and destroy the ash trees and undertake any related sanitation actions within 8 weeks of the date of the letter, has been revised to reflect the practicalities for both the forest owner and his/her Registered Forester/Registered Forestry Company.</p><p>A focused consultation with industry stakeholder representatives and other relevant bodies on proposed Scheme changes and related matters has been completed and the changes above have been incorporated into the scheme.</p></reply>

Having carefully considered the matter, I decided that, without prejudice, there is a case for a review of the policy on allocations between the RSW Pelagic segment and the polyvalent segment of the fleet, taking account of request by the IS&amp;WFO.  In that regard, I decided that I am restricting consideration to the increased quota for Ireland in 2017 over that in 2016.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that I have not made any decision at this time to change the allocations between the segments in respect of this part of the quota.  All relevant issues will be carefully evaluated and subject to a full consultation with stakeholders before I decide if any amendment to the policy is justified for the proper and effective management of the mackerel fishery.</p>  <p>  The public consultation process concluded on 28 February 2017 and 353 submissions were received.  All submissions are currently being evaluated.</p>  <p>  To support transparency in this process, all views received on the Consultation Document are now publicly available on my Department&rsquo;s website where consent for such publication was given by the parties in question.  Following the closure of the formal consultation process, any meeting that may be held with stakeholders will be open to all interested stakeholders that have engaged in the public consultation.</p></reply>

Access for beef to the US market was restored in 2015, with Ireland the first EU Member State to achieve such access.  Following this, ten Irish beef establishments have been approved over the past couple of years for the export of beef to the US.  Two of these establishments have also been approved for the export of BIFG (beef intended for grinding) which gives them access to the lucrative US market for ground beef.  In the case of pigmeat, three Irish pigmeat processors are approved for the production of pork for export to the US. </p>  <p>  At present no EU Member State has access for sheepmeat.  There are a number of steps to be undertaken before access can be achieved.  The next step is the publication by the US authorities of the "small ruminant rule" in relation to TSEs in sheep.  While access cannot be achieved before publication, my department has completed a significant amount of preparatory work to ensure we are well-positioned once the rule is published by the USDA.  The next key event is the USDA inspection visit to Ireland in September 2017, which will include inspection of some sheepmeat establishments.</p></reply>

Once access is secured, market forces determine how much is exported, and to where, in any given year.  This can vary depending on a number of factors such as currency fluctuations, global supply and demand dynamics, tariffs, quotas and the prices available in alternative markets.  Having access to a range of markets gives exporters different options.</p>  <p>  Access for beef to the US market was restored in 2015, with Ireland the first EU Member State to achieve such access.  In 2015, 912 tonnes of beef were exported. According to the USDA in 2016, approximately 2,400 tonnes of beef and as of the end of May 2017, approximately 700 tonnes were exported.  Value of exports is not currently available.  As exports of manufacturing beef only commenced in quarter 2 of 2017 it is too early to collate volumes exported. </p>  <p>  However, with ten Irish meat establishments now approved for the US market, two of whom are also approved for beef intended for grinding, I am satisfied that Irish meat exporters are well placed to exploit any opportunities which may arise.  I hope that the agreement reached last week as part of the Trade Mission to the USA on the Process verified programme for Irish beef, will increase sales of Irish beef in the USA.  Last week also saw the launch of Irish beef directly into US retail for the first time.</p></reply>

As I stated in my immediate reaction to the decision, we are all vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and we all have a responsibility to address climate change within our respective capabilities.  The withdrawal decision marks a regrettable shift away from the previously strong climate ambition shown by the United States, which played a major role in mobilising global ambition and achieving the agreement reached by 195 Parties in Paris in 2015.</p>  <p>  The Environment Council, which met on 19 June, was unanimous in its view that the Paris Agreement is fit for purpose and is not open to renegotiation.  This position was reaffirmed by the European Council at its meeting last week.  Heads of State and Government agreed that the EU remains fully committed to playing a strong role in implementing the Paris Agreement and to enhancing cooperation with its international partners under the Paris Agreement, in particular with the most vulnerable countries. </p>  <p>  The Government fully supports this stance.  We continue to play a strong role in meeting this objective through our on-going commitment, in particular through Irish Aid programmes, to supporting developing countries to integrate climate action in development plans, including in relation to social protection, disaster risk reduction, and strengthening agriculture and food systems. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to work closely with other EU Member States and international partners to ensure that the Paris Agreement becomes fully operational as soon as possible, giving the international community the means to take the action required to limit the impacts of climate change.</p></reply>

Neither I nor my Department have a statutory authority to direct telecommunications operators in this regard.</p><p>The Government's National Broadband Plan will provide high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that to date approximately 1.4m or 61% of the 2.3m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second and this footprint is expanding.</p><p>In April, eir signed a agreement with me committing them to follow through on their commercial plans to provide new high speed broadband infrastructure to 300,000 premises in rural areas.  Eir has committed to doing this work over a 90 week period with an average of 500 premises passed per day.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department's website .  The decision by eir to invest in infrastructure to deploy high speed broadband services to an additional 300,000 premises in rural Ireland was taken by eir on commercial grounds.  Neither I nor the Department have a statutory authority to direct eir in this regard. </p><p>Quarterly updates on progress of the eir 300k rollout will be published on the Departments website.  The Q1 figures have been verified by my Department and the eir rollout is in line with the Commitment Agreement.</p><p>In April I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at .  This map finalises the State Intervention Area for the procurement process and is an important milestone in the procurement process.  The Map shows the extent of  the State Intervention area and also the areas targeted for commercial services.</p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,  </p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process.</p><p>The map shows that 97% of the townland of Derreen (Ed Caher) Co Kerry, 13% of the townland of Ballydunlea Co Kerry  and the eircode referred to by the Deputy in the townland of Clonee Co Meath falls within an AMBER area and will be part of the State led Intervention under the NBP.  The remaining 3% of the townland of Derreen (Ed Caher) and 87% of the townland of Ballydunlea falls within eir&rsquo;s plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and end 2018 (Light BLUE on map).  Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at http://fibrerollout.ie/eircode-lookup/.  Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at </p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The finalisation of the State Intervention Area for the procurement process is an important milestone as it means that bidders can progress their business plans and the Department can move to the next stage of the procurement.  The  three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.</p><p>The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers.  The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP, once contracts are in place.</p><p>The procurement is progressing to the next stage.  This week, the Department wrote to the three bidders in the NBP procurement process inviting them to submit their &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; by 26 September 2017.  This is a significant milestone as the NBP procurement process moves to the next stage.  The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.</p><p>However, I am aware that the rate of demand for data services has increased exponentially in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for telecommunication operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.</p><p>The report of the Task Force was published in December and is available on both Departments' websites.  In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.</p><p>In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I, together with Minister Humphreys, established an Implementation Group.  This group is driving and monitoring the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions.  I published the first such quarterly progress report on 13th June 2017, which is available on my Department's website at and which shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017.  The work of the Task Force will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p><p>In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg recently announced the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which means an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas.  The Regulator has awarded 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band which will provide a degree of stability and create future investment certainty.  Spectrum was also awarded in lots covering 9 urban and rural regions across the country.</p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.</p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.</p></reply>

The scheme is delivered through a combination of SEAI appointed Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage.  The measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs, cavity wall insulation and energy advice. </p><p>The Better Energy Homes (BEH) scheme provides a financial incentive to private homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their homes.  Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying Building Energy Rating (BER).  Grants typically cover about a third of the overall cost to the homeowner.</p><p>In respect of the BEH scheme the total grant paid in each month was &euro;1.117m in March, &euro;1.449m in April and &euro;1.638m in May.

These partnerships can be between the public and private sectors, domestic and non-domestic sectors, commercial and not-for-profit organisations and energy suppliers.  The community and business supports leverage considerable additional private investment.  Projects are typically based across a number of counties so it is not possible to report on a county by county basis.  However a total of &euro;26m will be granted to these projects in 2017.</p><p>The Warmth and Wellbeing pilot scheme provides free energy efficiency upgrades to the homes of people in the pilot area who meet the eligibility criteria.  The scheme is designed to test the benefits that improved home energy efficiency can have on the health of people living with a chronic respiratory disease.  To date in 2017 there have been 124 homes upgraded in Dublin.  These upgrades have cost &euro;1.266m.</p><p>In addition to the above schemes, my Department also provided funding for the Landfill Remediation Grant Scheme.  This scheme was established in order to deal with the specific issue of the remediation of closed, licensed, local authority-operated landfills, and in recognition of the fact that local authorities would not have sufficient resources to fund the full cost of this remediation.  Details of the funding provided are set out in the following table.<table><tr><th colspan="4">Landfill Remediation Scheme</th></tr><tr><td>Name of Project </td><td>County</td><td>Amount of funding provided </td><td>2017 &ndash; Month funding provided</td></tr><tr><td>Kealine</td><td>Cork</td><td>&euro;200k</td><td>May</td></tr><tr><td>Newmarket</td><td>Cork</td><td>&euro;500k</td><td>May</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary Town</td><td>Tipperary</td><td>&euro;1.5m</td><td>May</td></tr><tr><td>Finisklin</td><td>Sligo</td><td>&euro;600k</td><td>May</td></tr><tr><td>Kerdiffstown</td><td>Kildare</td><td>&euro;4.5m</td><td>June</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The NCSC has at present no role in actively preventing attacks on private sector entities, not least because this would require active surveillance of network activity, something for which there is no legislative basis, and which would pose a number of data protection and other challenges.     </p>  <p>  The NCSC has become the national point of contact for cyber security matters, and receives notice of suspicious activity of networks in Ireland from similar bodies in other jurisdictions, and from the cyber security sector.  In cases where this activity involves private sector operators, and where possible, the NCSC contacts them directly and warns them of issues arising, and of steps that might be taken to mitigate risks to their systems or data.  If notice was received of activity around the networks of a political party, the same procedure would be followed.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  </p><p>Since 2012, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5 billion in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high-speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  As a result, there has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today approximately 1.4 million or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high-speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  This footprint is continuing to expand. </p><p>In April, eir signed an agreement with me, committing them to follow through on their commercial plans to provide new high-speed broadband infrastructure to 300,000 premises in rural areas.  Eir has committed to doing this work over a 90 week period, an average of 500 premises passed per day.  In line with the published Agreement there are regular Review Meetings, the purpose of which is to monitor this rollout and ensure that eir meets its obligations under the Agreement.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website, <i>www.dccae.gov.ie</i>. </p><p>Quarterly updates on progress of the eir 300k rollout will be published on the Department's website.  The Q1 figures have been verified by my Department and the eir rollout is in line with the Commitment Agreement.  My Department has informed me that in the period from 1 January to end March 2017 30,064 premises have been passed.  As at Q1, 40,114 premises have been passed since eir commenced work in late 2016.  To date, some 3,865 of those premises have been connected to high-speed broadband services under the terms of the Commitment Agreement.  Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at <i>.</i></p><p>In April I published an updated High-Speed Broadband Map which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.  This map finalises the State Intervention Area for the procurement process and is an important milestone in the procurement process.  The Map shows the extent of the State Intervention area and also the areas targeted for commercial services.</p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high-speed broadband services,  </p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High-Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>The map shows that 2% of the townland of Abbeylara, County Longford  and 100% of Knockaville, County Westmeath falls within an AMBER area and will be part of the State-led Intervention under the NBP.  The remaining 98% of the townland of Abbeylara falls within the BLUE area and will be served by commercial operators. </p><p>There are circa 89,000 premises in County Kildare, approximately 13,000 (14%) of which are located in the Amber area on the Map, and will benefit from the NBP&rsquo;s State Intervention.  The remaining circa 76,000 (75%) premises are located in the commercial BLUE area and will be served by commercial operators and includes approximately 9,000 (12%)  where eir is planning to deliver high-speed broadband by 2018.</p><p>Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High-Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie.</i></p><p>My Department monitors the rollout of services in the BLUE area.  I would encourage consumers who cannot access high-speed broadband services to contact my Department directly at <i>broadband@dccae.gov.ie</i>, quoting their address and Eircode, and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services.  This information will assist the Department in keeping track of progress in those areas and following up if necessary.</p><p>The Broadband Intervention strategy sets out a detailed service specification including a requirement that the State-funded network must: </p><p>- be capable of delivering high-quality, high speed broadband of at least 30 megabits per second download and 6 megabits per second upload to all citizens; </p><p>- be capable of providing for higher performance in the future so as to keep pace with consumer demand;</p><p>- ensure the availability of high quality wholesale services to allow retail competition to develop.</p><p>The Plan envisages public investment in the capital costs of building the necessary infrastructure to support high-quality affordable broadband services similar to those already available in cities and towns. </p><p>I am confident that the combination of existing commercial investment and the State intervention will make Ireland an exemplar in Europe and beyond, in terms of providing high-speed services to all citizens regardless of where they live or work. </p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high-speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland for at least 25 years.  The finalisation of the State Intervention Area for the procurement process is an important milestone as it means that bidders can progress their business plans and the Department can move to the next stage of the procurement.  The three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second. </p><p>The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers. </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3 to 5 year timeline to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP once contracts are in place. </p><p>The procurement is progressing to the next stage.  This week, the Department wrote to the three bidders in the NBP procurement process inviting them to submit their Detailed Solutions by 26 September 2017.  This is a significant milestone as the NBP procurement process moves to the next stage.  The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.</p><p>However, I am aware that the rate of demand for data services has increased exponentially in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for telecommunication operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. </p><p>The report of the Task Force was published in December and is available on both Departments' websites.  In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.</p><p>In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I, together with Minister Humphreys, established an Implementation Group.  This group is driving and monitoring the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions.  I published the first such quarterly progress report on 13th June 2017, which is available on my Department's website  at <i></i>and which shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017.  The work of the Task Force will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p><p>In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg recently announced the results of its auction for the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band, which means an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas.  The Regulator has awarded 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band which will provide a degree of stability and create future investment certainty.  Spectrum was also awarded in lots covering nine urban and rural regions across the country.</p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances. </p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.</p></reply>

I do not have a statutory authority to require commercial companies to roll out services to particular locations.  However, mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction in 2012.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.  However, as mobile services are a radio-based technology, services can be affected by topography, quality of handsets and the capacity of the network, as well as by proximity to mobile telephone antennas.</p><p>Any customer across Ireland who experiences service difficulties, including in Abbeylara, County Longford and Ballymore, County Westmeath, should raise the matter with the service provider in the first instance.  If this fails to resolve matters, customers can and should refer a complaint to ComReg, which will investigate the service provider's compliance with its contractual obligations.</p><p>Notwithstanding the statutory independence of ComReg, in recognition of the frustration currently being experienced across Ireland where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect, I specifically included in the programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016. I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.

The report contains 40 actions, each with their own timeframe for delivery, that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.</p><p>An Implementation Group is driving and monitoring the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.

A specific measure in the policy provides that the household waste collection sector will &ldquo;operate pricing structures designed to incentivise environmentally sustainable behaviours by households in terms of waste reduction and segregation&rdquo;.  Incentivised pricing should encourage us, as a community, to prevent and reduce the amount of waste that we produce and to utilise the value of our waste through reuse, recycling and recovery.  This will also enable Ireland to meet its legal obligations as well as current and future targets under EU waste legislation. </p>  <p>  The amount of waste being sent to landfill has increased in the last two years.  Last year, local authorities had to exercise emergency powers on two occasions to make additional landfill capacity available.  We must act to encourage further waste reduction in order to avert a return to an over dependence on landfill.  The introduction of an incentivised pricing structure for household waste collection will be an important measure in this regard.  The issue of disposing of medical incontinence wear in the context of an incentivised pricing system is under consideration.</p></reply>

Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter target also being legally binding.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has calculated that 25.3% of electricity, 6.5% of heat and 5.7% of transport energy requirements were met from renewable sources at end 2015.  Overall, SEAI analysis shows that 9.1% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements in 2015 were met from renewable sources. </p><p>The total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid is 3,174 MW approximately, of which 2,851 MW is wind generation.  It is estimated that a total of between 3,900 MW and 4,300 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target.  Given that we have 3,174 MW in place, we will need approximately a further 700 MW to 1,100 MW of additional renewable generation to meet our 2020 targets. </p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes in place  or under development designed to stimulate further progress in the domestic renewable energy sector.  These include the Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff (REFIT) schemes for the electricity sector and the Biofuel Obligation Scheme in the transport sector.  These schemes have proved successful at incentivising large-scale investment in the renewable industry in recent years. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">My Department is also currently developing a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme and a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) Scheme, designed to encourage further investment in the renewable electricity and heat sectors, respectively.  The introduction of any schemes - including the overall costs and technologies to be supported - are subject to Government approval and State Aid clearance from the European Commission. </font></p><p>In the transport sector, Ireland aims to meet its renewable target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a small contribution.  The Biofuels Obligation Scheme (BOS) was increased from 6% to 8% by volume from 1 January 2017.  A public consultation on future increases to the Biofuel Obligation Scheme, required to meet the 2020 renewable transport target will take place later this year.</p></reply>

One of the key requirements identified in the Energy White Paper is the need for appropriate energy infrastructure, including energy networks and interconnection with other countries&rsquo; energy systems.</p>  <p>  On 19 December 2016, An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission for the North-South Interconnector project in Ireland.  The planning process for the section of the project in Northern Ireland is underway.  This interconnector will help facilitate increased levels of renewable electricity and increase our energy independence by reducing our reliance on imported fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas.</p>  <p>  The East-West Interconnector (EWIC) is a 500MW electricity interconnector that connects Ireland and Great Britain.  It has been in operation since 2012 and allows the trading of electricity between the island of Ireland and British wholesale electricity markets.  EWIC helps to facilitate the growth in renewable electricity by providing access to a larger market. </p>  <p>  Two other interconnector projects are currently proposed.  The Celtic Interconnector proposes to link Ireland and France and the Greenlink interconnector proposes to link Ireland and Wales.  Both projects provide the opportunity for increased renewable electricity and the sale of electricity, generated from renewable sources in Ireland, to be traded internationally.</p></reply>

Prior to the advent of Corrib, over 95% of  the State's natural gas needs were imported, via the two gas interconnectors, from Great Britain.  In 2016, indigenous gas production met over 55% of the State&rsquo;s gas demand.  The introduction of Corrib was a key contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s total energy import dependence falling from 88% in 2015 to 70% in 2016.</p>  <p>  The direct financial return to the State from the Corrib gas field will be through the 25% tax on profits.  The level of profits from the Corrib gas field will depend on a combination of factors including, the volume of recoverable gas, the cost of developing and operating the infrastructure, the price of gas over the life of the field, together with the timing and profile of production.</p></reply>

This has mainly been undertaken by the private sector.  As a global industry, the level of exploration activity in Ireland reflects worldwide market trends, in particular prevailing metal prices.  Ireland is particularly dependent on the zinc market as this is the primary exploration target.  Whilst the main exploration focus is on zinc and lead, there is interest also in gold and other base metals.  My Department's strategy in this area aims to encourage further exploration, while maximising the value added to the economy.</p>  <p>  In respect of indigenous oil and gas resources, four commercial gas discoveries and no commercial oil discoveries have been made since exploration began in the Irish offshore.  The Irish Atlantic Margin remains substantively underexplored and its actual potential will not be known without a significant increase in the level of exploration.  Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon energy future will involve progressively moving to lower emission fuels, e.g. moving initially from peat and coal to natural gas, and ultimately towards an even greater reliance on renewable energy.  The 2015 White Paper on Energy recognises that oil and natural gas will remain significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply in the transition period.  Taking this into account my Department's efforts in this area have focussed on deepening scientific and technical knowledge of Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas potential, in particular through data acquisition and supporting key research projects; ensuring that the regulatory regime is fit for purpose; and offering innovative and attractive licensing opportunities.</p>  <p>  Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) has statutory responsibility for the conservation, protection and management of Ireland&rsquo;s inland fisheries resource, including sea angling.  The angling sector is estimated to contribute &euro;836 million to the Irish economy every year supporting 11,000 Irish jobs, often in rural and peripheral communities where fewer job opportunities are available.  The National Strategy for Angling Development (NSAD) is the first comprehensive national framework for the development of our angling resource.  The NSAD aims to increase economic contribution of angling to &euro;932 million per year and increase employment by over 1,800 jobs.  IFI is already investigating the full array of potential funding sources.  I announced approval for the first &euro;500,000 of investment for 50 community-based projects nationwide in December last.  I have also secured an additional &euro;1.5 million for NSAD investment for 2017 and further tranches of project funding will be announced.</p></reply>

Good progress has been made to date, but the target remains challenging, particularly in light of economic growth and a growing demand for energy.  Latest figures by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) for 2015 indicate that 9.1% of the overall 16% target was met by renewable sources.  Ireland has made considerable progress in the decarbonisation of our electricity sector in recent years, with over 27% of our electricity coming from renewable sources in 2016.  This progress, while welcome, will need to accelerate in pace in the coming years. </p>  <p>  The Government has adopted a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy.  The primary support mechanism is the Renewable Energy Feed-In-Tariff (REFIT) schemes, which currently support the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind.</p>  <p>  With regard to future policy initiatives, my Department is currently developing a proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS).  The design of the new scheme is underway, and includes an extensive independent economic appraisal of multiple renewable electricity technologies.  This economic appraisal involves comparing the cost of supporting solar, offshore wind, onshore wind, hydro, ocean energy (including wave) and a range of other commercial renewable technologies, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.  The assessment also includes analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.</p>  <p>  A public consultation on the new scheme is due to be published next month, and following this it will need to secure Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission.  Subject to this, it is expected that the new scheme will become operational in 2018.</p>  <p>  Ireland has one of the best offshore renewable energy resources in the world and offshore renewable energy will have an important role in Ireland&rsquo;s future renewable energy mix.  While offshore wind has had been developed successfully, globally, wave and tidal energy is still at the R&amp;D stage.  Notwithstanding the development of promising experimental devices, more research, development and trials are required to bring wave energy technology to commercial viability.</p></reply>

I am aware of only one case in Ireland of the type the Deputy has mentioned, tested in court, where the court has found that a claim for damages in a motor collision was not payable on the basis that the driver / their employer (as well as the plaintiff) were not negligent.  The details of that case were very specific and in my view extremely unusual.</p>  <p>  Given that the law in this area has generally operated well in Ireland, making changes to legislation or attempting to make the MIBI liable to deal with situations which may be extremely rare or close to hypothetical have not been a priority for my Department in the light of other priorities.  However, as stated by my predecessor as Minister, Paschal Donohoe TD, in his letter of 12 August 2015 to the Deputy, if the Deputy has any information to the contrary, and wishes to set out a specific case, I would be happy to examine same.</p></reply>

Whilst there was strong growth from the North American market, up by over 25%, visitors from Britain were down 10.7% year on year.  It is clear that the Sterling depreciation following the Brexit referendum has made Ireland, and every other Eurozone country, more expensive for British travellers than was the case previously.  This has led some British holidaymakers to holiday at home this year.</p>  <p>  In 2016, Irish hotels performed well with the number of bednights up 6.6%. Recent CSO data indicates that hotel bednights in the first quarter of 2017 were in line with 2016. Whilst the number of visitors from Britain staying in hotels is down, this has been offset by increases from other areas.  I am conscious that certain regions may feel a greater impact from the drop in British visitors.</p>  <p>  The tourism agencies are engaged in the operational aspects of preparing for Brexit.  Tourism Ireland is responsible for marketing Ireland as a tourism destination overseas. In broad terms, its strategy involves two main elements.  Firstly, it has taken steps to revise its marketing effort in Britain to make it more relevant in a Brexit environment.  As well as this, it is implementing a market diversification strategy.  This aims to attract more visitors from markets which deliver longer stays and, therefore, higher revenue returns.  The significant increase in visitors from North America in early 2017 is evidence of this. </p>  <p>  For its part, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is also working on a number of fronts to assist the diversification and development of our tourism industry and the attractiveness of our tourism product offering.  Ongoing work to develop the main experience brands and enhance visitor experiences is aimed at boosting our appeal to key target markets and priority consumer segments.  With regard to training and business supports, F&aacute;ilte Ireland offers a suite of supports to enhance the competitiveness, enterprise capability and sustainability of the tourism sector.  In addition, it is creating a new Brexit Response Programme that will focus on delivering a Capability Building programme for Industry.</p></reply>

The Government has been clear that its approach is aimed at minimising the impact of Brexit on our trade and economy and an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  The Government recognises that there is a desire to have clarity and certainty on every detail of the future EU-UK relationship as quickly as possible.  However, we also need to be realistic about the process we are heading into, and the time it will take to reach a full conclusion.</p><p>It is too early in the Brexit process to speculate in any detail on the possible impacts or outcomes in areas such as the Single Aviation Market.

The Department of Justice and Equality has recently finalised a new National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy containing actions to bring about improvements in the quality of life of Travellers and Roma, including children. </p><p><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>, the<i></i>national policy framework in relation to children and young people, contains a range of commitments to Traveller and Roma children, addressing issues such as health, education, and social inclusion.  The State of the Nation&rsquo;s Children Report (2016), includes a specific section on the population of children in the Traveller Community; along with a number of findings related to Traveller children, in areas including nutrition, self-esteem, drug and alcohol use, family relationships and feelings of safeness within the community.  The <i>National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-making</i>(2015-2020) contains specific actions to strengthen participation in decision-making by Traveller children and young people.</p><p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has a statutory responsibility to ensure each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.  Tusla's education welfare service, comprising the statutory Education Welfare Service, the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison scheme, are key supports for children who are vulnerable to early school-leaving and educational disadvantage, including Traveller children. </p><p>Children and families from the Traveller Community who require additional support or are identified as vulnerable, also avail of other mainstream services within Tusla.  Tusla works in partnership with local authorities, the Health Service Executive and schools to ensure an integrated response to the needs of children and families from the Traveller community, including public health nursing, disability services, and other relevant services.  Tusla is operating and supporting a number of integrated and inclusive Traveller specific projects, and provides counselling grants to organisations serving the Traveller community.  I have referred the question to Tusla and asked them to provide the information on these matters directly to the Deputy.</p><p>The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  These schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme under which funding is provided to support 30 national and major regional youth organisations.  Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drugs Task Force Projects and certain other programmes including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres.  In 2017, current funding of &euro;57 million has been provided to my Department for these schemes which are open to all young people.</p><p>The Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund  (Rounds 1 and 2) and the Local Drug Task Forces LDTFs operate several youth work initiatives that are specifically aimed at young Travellers, such as the initiatives operated by Involve, Exchange House Traveller Youth Service and Travact.  In general, these youth work initiatives entail consultation with the local Traveller community, the involvement of members of that community in the management of the project and liaison with other voluntary and statutory agencies operating in the youth service sphere.  Other projects funded other than these schemes may include services and activities for young travellers but they are not exclusive to young travellers. The following table sets out allocation to traveller youth projects for the period 2015-2017:<table><tr><th>-</th><th>2017 Grant</th><th>2016 Grant</th><th>2015 Grant</th></tr><tr><td>Exchange House Traveller Youth Service (which includes Exchange House: Labre Park and, St. Margaret&rsquo;s Ballymun)</td><td>&euro;267,722</td><td>254,973</td><td>&euro;248,754</td></tr><tr><td>Travact</td><td>&euro;79,854</td><td>76,051</td><td>&euro;74,196</td></tr><tr><td>Services to Young Travellers, Tallaght</td><td>&euro;80,343</td><td>76,517</td><td>&euro;74,651</td></tr><tr><td>Southside Travellers Action Group, Dublin</td><td>&euro;44,486</td><td>42,367</td><td>&euro;41,334</td></tr><tr><td>Tallaght Traveller&rsquo;s Youth Service</td><td>&euro;45,359</td><td>43,199</td><td>&euro;42,145</td></tr><tr><td>Traveller Youth  Project, Priorswood, Dublin 17</td><td>&euro;36,269</td><td>34,542</td><td>&euro;33,699</td></tr><tr><td>Exchange House TYS, St. Margaret&rsquo;s, Dublin</td><td>&euro;59,339</td><td>56,513</td><td>&euro;55,135</td></tr><tr><td>Southside Travellers Action Group, Dublin</td><td>&euro;76,274</td><td>72,642</td><td>&euro;70,870</td></tr><tr><td>Clondalkin Travellers Development Group, Dublin</td><td>34,749</td><td>33,094</td><td>&euro;32,287</td></tr><tr><td>Ballybane Educational and Social Project for Young Travellers, Galway</td><td>&euro;12,408</td><td>11,817</td><td>&euro;11,529</td></tr><tr><td>Ballybane Traveller Youth  and Integration Project, Galway</td><td>&euro;110,052</td><td>104,811</td><td>&euro;102,255</td></tr><tr><td>Involve projects, Galway</td><td>&euro;22,043</td><td>20,994</td><td>&euro;20,482</td></tr><tr><td>Rathkeale Youth Project , Limerick</td><td>&euro;80,343</td><td>76,517</td><td>&euro;74,651</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick Youth Service Young Traveller Programme</td><td>&euro;17,868</td><td>17,017</td><td>&euro;16,602</td></tr><tr><td>Traveller Youth Project, Waterford</td><td>&euro;59,597</td><td>56,759</td><td>&euro;55,375</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly Traveller Movement Project</td><td>&euro;45,470</td><td>43,305</td><td>&euro;42,248</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>Involve local Projects</th><th>2017</th><th>2016</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow Youth Project</td><td>&euro;14,138</td><td>&euro;13,464.40</td><td>&euro;13,136.00</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal Youth Project</td><td>&euro;35,601</td><td>&euro;33,906.18</td><td>&euro;33,079.00</td></tr><tr><td>Tallaght Youth Service</td><td></td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;2,165.60</td></tr><tr><td>Ballinasloe Community Youth Project</td><td>&euro;41,347</td><td>&euro;39,378.00</td><td>&euro;36,425.81</td></tr><tr><td>Ballybane Social and Education Project (subsequently Galway Hillside Traveller Youth Group)</td><td></td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;1,992.40</td></tr><tr><td>Salthill Youth Project</td><td>&euro;20,076</td><td>&euro;19,119.58</td><td>&euro;18,653.00</td></tr><tr><td>Step Up Youth Project Loughrea</td><td>&euro;22,301</td><td>&euro;21,238.72</td><td>&euro;20,720.70</td></tr><tr><td>Western Traveller Development Youth Project, Tuam</td><td>&euro;33,563</td><td>&euro;31,964.63</td><td>&euro;31,185.00</td></tr><tr><td>Athy Traveller Youth Project, Kildare</td><td>&euro;1,398</td><td>&euro;1,331.86</td><td>&euro;1,299.00</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim Development Company</td><td>&euro;15,103</td><td>&euro;14,384.08</td><td>&euro;14,033.20</td></tr><tr><td>Longford Youth Service</td><td>&euro;13,052</td><td>&euro;12,430.69</td><td>&euro;12,127.50</td></tr><tr><td>Meath Youth Project (Navan)</td><td>&euro;45,946</td><td>&euro;43,758.00</td><td>&euro;40,525.00</td></tr><tr><td>Ballina Youth Project</td><td>&euro;73,811</td><td>&euro;70,296.55</td><td>&euro;68,582.00</td></tr><tr><td>Midland Regional Youth Service, Offaly</td><td>&euro;15,197</td><td>&euro;14,472.87</td><td>&euro;14,120.00</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary Regional Youth Service</td><td>&euro;17,854</td><td>&euro;17,003.40</td><td>&euro;16,589.00</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford Development Company</td><td>&euro;22,282</td><td>&euro;21,220.96</td><td>&euro;20,703.40</td></tr><tr><td>Bray Travellers Project, Wicklow</td><td>&euro;2,144</td><td>&euro;2,042.18</td><td>&euro;1,992.00</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow Traveller Development Group Ltd</td><td>&euro;792</td><td>&euro;754.72</td><td>&euro;736.30</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Agency is obliged to provide care for these children for as long as their welfare requires it.  There is always an underlying reason for a child to be homeless without their parent/guardian.  Tusla carry out an assessment and will usually receive a child in such circumstances, into care.  Their care plan will address the underlying causes.  In a small number of cases they may provide accommodation and support to a 17 year old.</p>  <p>  All children received into care are the subject of an assessment.  While there is no specific plan for LGBT or migrant children received into care, the reasons for their homelessness forms an integral part of their assessment and care plan, through which appropriate services and supports will be identified.  When they leave care at 18 years of age, young people are offered a wide range of services from different sectors including income supports, health supports, accommodation and education.  While the provision of housing is a function of the housing or local authorities, Tusla co-operates with the housing authorities as part of aftercare planning.</p>  <p>  In cases where an unaccompanied minor arrives into the country, an assessment is undertaken and the child is either taken into care or provided with accommodation under Section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991.  My Department  has no role in housing for young migrants over the age  of 18, or for members of the LGBT community over the age of 18, unless they qualify as having been previously in care.</p>  <p>  At a national level, the Programme for Government committed to developing a LGBT Youth Strategy, and work has already commenced in my Department in this regard.  This is a key commitment for my Department which will a contribution towards the Government&rsquo;s broader commitment to continue to strive for full inclusion of LGBTI+ people in Ireland.  A specific focus on LGBTI+ Youth will aim to ensure that appropriate measures are taken so that young people identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender are not in any way prevented from achieving their full potential. </p>  <p>  I also understand that the Department of Justice and Equality will shortly commence work on a national LGBT Inclusion Strategy, a process which will include identifying specific areas of Irish society and policy in which difficulties are still seen as presenting for LGBT people.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work involving approximately 1,400 youth work staff working in youth services and communities throughout the country. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to confirm that I have allocated an extra &euro;5.5 million in current funding to support the provision of youth services in 2017.  This will bring the total youth funding by my Department to &euro;57.4 million, an increase of 10% over last year's allocation.  The additional funding is being used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services. </p>  <p>  The Local Youth Club Grant Scheme supports youth work activities at a local level.  These grants are made available to all youth clubs and groups through the local Education and Training Boards.  The scheme is open is open to new entrants and is advertised locally.  Applications for funding are invited by the Education and Training Boards from local groups in their respective areas.  Each year, more than 600 local youth clubs benefit from the scheme.  In 2016, &euro;1.065 million was allocated to this scheme.  In 2017, I have provided an additional 10% in funding to the scheme, bringing the total allocation to &euro;1.1715. </p>  <p>  After a period of consultation with key stakeholders it was agreed that in line with the National Youth Strategy 2015&ndash;2020 it would be a condition of the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme that at least 75% of the club/group membership should be between the ages of 10 and 21.</p>  <p>  This grant scheme was designed to provide volunteer-led youth activities for young people aged between 10 and 21.  The clarification will ensure that the Scheme will have the maximum impact on the targeted cohort of young people while having the benefit of a built-in flexibility of 25% for those not in that age bracket.</p></reply>

The Committee had an advisory and consultative role to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in matters to do with youth work, including the coordination of youth work programmes and services.  In line with these provisions, a new National Youth Work Advisory Committee was appointed by the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with a term of office of one year with effect from 28 January 2013.  The Committee continued to work with my Department and assisted with the development of the new National Youth Strategy, in particular in identifying in what ways the youth work sector can contribute to shared policy objectives for young people. </p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy 2015-2020 was published in, 2015.  The implementation structures established by my Department under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures (BOBF), the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People will oversee the roll out of the National Youth Strategy.  There is no doubt that the youth work services have a significant contribution to make to realise the goals of the National Youth Strategy as part of a cross sectoral, whole of society approach to supporting young people in their everyday lives.  For this reason, the key youth sector interests are represented on the structures established by my Department to support the implementation of Better Outcomes Brighter Futures.  At national level, representatives of the voluntary youth services have been appointed to the Advisory Council of BOBF.  At local level, youth sector representatives participate in the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Services Committees.  Key Government departments and agencies that have an interest in children and young people and that had served on the National Youth Work Advisory Committee are represented on the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Consortium and on the Sponsors Group that have been established under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures to drive the effective implementation of the policy framework. </p>  <p>  There have been other significant policy and legislative developments that are relevant to the provision of youth services and the role of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee since the 2001 Act was passed.  These include the introduction of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 which, inter alia, provides for a statutory function for Education and Training Boards in supporting the provision and assessment of youth work services at local level.  The National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-making 2015-2020, which was published by my Department in June, 2015 is particularly relevant.  I am deeply committed to ensuring that young people are involved in the preparation, planning and implementation of policies that impact on their lives. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is fully committed to the reform of the many youth funding schemes. The Deputy will be aware that a number of targeted funding schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review in 2014.  The review made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead. Work on the development of a new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department and consultations with youth services are continuing with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the review.  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department has commenced a review of the Youth Service Grant Scheme. This review is intended to enhance its accountability, transparency and outcome measurement.  It is also seeking to determine how best to meet the ever evolving needs of young people. </p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the youth work sector, the voluntary youth services, the Education and Training Boards, other government departments and agencies and consults with young people themselves in the development and delivery of policies and services for children and young people. </p>  <p>  For the above reasons, it is not my intention to reconvene the National Youth Work Advisory Committee while the reform process is ongoing. Given the seismic changes which have occurred over the past sixteen years, my Department may wish to revisit the Youth Work Act, 2001 on the conclusion of the reform process, to ensure that it fully articulates the needs of young people in Ireland. </p></reply>

As I have stated previously, this is an extremely complex and ambitious project because of all that is involved &ndash; legislation, new business processes, data protection and building a new IT system.  We will need to integrate data from the Department of Social Protection and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners so that the system can calculate every family&rsquo;s net income and ACS subsidy.  We are all keen to see the new system introduced as soon as possible, but the sheer complexity of the project means that it will take some time.  I do not want to introduce the new scheme before all elements &ndash; legislation, IT and business systems &ndash; are fully in place and fully tested.</p>  <p>  However, I do not want to delay the benefit of higher childcare subsidies for families.  For that reason, major improvements in childcare subsidies will come into effect this September, within the framework of the existing childcare schemes, pending the introduction of the ACS.  The improvements this September will include increases of up to 50% in targeted childcare subsidy rates.  In addition, the new universal childcare subsidy for children aged between 6 months and 36 months will be available from September, in line with the announcement I made following the Government&rsquo;s Budget decision in October 2016.  The &euro;19 million additional funding provided in Budget 2017 is being directed towards these changes that are being introduced in September, and which will mean significant reductions in childcare bills for tens of thousands of families.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the new measures commencing this September will honour the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering more affordable childcare to families.  Back-payments will not be made.  The level of universal subsidy available this September is the same as that proposed for the ACS subsidy, i.e. a maximum subsidy of &euro;20 per week for full-time childcare, with the subsidy for part-time childcare reduced pro rata.  The levels of targeted subsidy available this September, while not identical to the subsidy-rates that are proposed for the ACS, will be broadly similar to those rates, with some families receiving slightly more and some slightly less than they will receive when the ACS is introduced.  These differences are inevitable given the structure of the existing childcare schemes, which involve only a limited number of subsidy-bands, whereas the ACS will allow a smooth taper to be applied to subsidy-rates.  A further difference in the schemes lies in the basis of eligibility.  Whereas the subsidy-rate awarded under the ACS will be based directly on a family&rsquo;s income-level, the subsidy under the existing schemes is based on family income indirectly, e.g. via eligibility for a Medical Card or GP Visit Card.</p></reply>

A value for money review of child income supports, published by the Department of Social Protection in 2010, found that the participation pattern of children in education supports the current age limit for Child Benefit. </p><p>Families on low incomes can avail of a number of provisions to social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including: </p><p>- qualified child increases (IQCs) with primary social welfare payments; </p><p>- family income supplement (FIS) for low-paid employees with children; </p><p>- the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for low income families (paid at the full-time second level education rate). </p><p>These schemes provide targeted assistance that is directly linked with household income and thereby supports low-income families with older children participating in full-time education. </p><p>Given the universality of Child Benefit, making it payable in respect of children who are 18 years of age and over and still in secondary school would not be a targeted approach. The adoption of such a proposal would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

Community Employment schemes provide part-time work experience and training opportunities in local communities as a stepping stone back to employment for people on a range of Social Welfare payments including those on long term unemployment payments </p>  <p>  JobPath is an up to 52 week programme which allows the service providers&rsquo; sufficient time to work with the participants in order to develop their skills and competencies to pursue suitable job opportunities which may result in sustainable employment. In order to ensure that the best use is made of the available places on JobPath, Jobseekers who are already participating with the JobPath service will not be referred to Community Employment Schemes as they can only participate with one activation scheme or service at a time.  </p>  <p>  However, customers who on the date of their referral to JobPath have a written offer with a start date within four weeks for CE or T&Uacute;S will be facilitated to take up the placement.  </p>  <p>  Those jobseekers that have completed their 52 week engagement with JobPath without finding suitable and sustainable employment are being referred back to their Intreo centres for an assessment by one of my Department&rsquo;s case officers.  They may then apply for other activation supports such as CE, thus ensuring ongoing availability to all schemes.  </p>  <p>  Recently the Government approved the implementation of a number of changes to the terms and conditions of participation on CE.  The main purpose of these changes is to broaden the availability of CE to a greater number of people on the live register and to standardise other conditions around the length of time a person can participate on the programme.</p>  <p>  If there is a CE scheme experiencing particular difficulties in recruitment, they should contact their local DSP office so that the matter can be reviewed.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

To be eligible to participate on the scheme, the employee is required to work between 21 and 39 hours per week. </p>  <p>  WSS applicants who are in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s assistance (JA) can qualify to participate on the WSS if he or she has a disability.  In cases where the applicant is not in receipt of a Department of Social Protection disability payment, a completed confidential Medical Report form and supporting medical evidence is required so as to confirm that the applicant has a disability and that this disability is causing or could cause him/her to have a shortfall in productivity, compared to a colleague without a disability.</p>  <p>  One of the conditions for eligibility of a JA payment is that the recipient is available for and genuinely seeking work on a full-time basis and this is not consistent with the main condition for receipt by the employer of WSS.  Accordingly, the WSS guidelines were revised to clarify this. </p>  <p>  In circumstance where a WSS applicant requires additional income supports, then they can apply for a range of in-work supports such as the family income supplement, the back to work family dividend or the part-time job incentive scheme. </p></reply>

The scheme was discontinued to new entrants from 1st January 2014.  Customers availing of this support prior to 1st January 2014 have been able to retain entitlement to the scheme up to 1st January 2018.  There are currently approximately 1,700 people in receipt of the scheme, for which Government has provided over &euro;4 million in 2017.  </p>  <p>  The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported is through on-going engagement with their lender to explore sustainable solutions.  The payment of this supplement on an indefinite basis does not address the longer term issues for people in serious mortgage arrears.  It is expected that the customers in receipt of this support will continue to exit the scheme through sustainable solutions being put in place with their lenders; securing employment; or exit strategies such as the Mortgage to Rent Scheme.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems, in particular those on low incomes or living on social welfare payments.  As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears.  </p>  <p>  The role of MABS was expanded in 2015 with the establishment of a Dedicated Mortgage Arrears MABS service (DMA MABS) across the MABS network, to help people specifically with home mortgage arrears.  There are 32 specialist DMA advisors working across 27 locations countrywide, assisting borrowers to assess the options available to them and, where required, negotiating with lenders on their behalf.  To date, the DMA service has helped almost 3,870 such borrowers.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, MABS provides a national network of court mentors who attend each listed repossession Court hearing countrywide.  The mentors provide support to distressed borrowers who are facing the loss of their home and signpost them to the appropriate services.  To date, over 1,400 borrowers have been referred onward to MABS advisors through the court mentor service.  </p>  <p>  In 2016, a further initiative was announced by Government, known as Abhaile.  This scheme further extends the free services already available to borrowers through the DMA MABS service and the court mentor service.  The new voucher based scheme, for which MABS is the gateway, provides access for people, who are insolvent and in home mortgage arrears, to access independent expert financial and/or legal advice and assistance, free of charge.  To date, approximately 7,670 vouchers for services have been issued, in respect of over 4,500 principle private residences.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

It is possible, however, to collect some non-identifying data on overall usage where the integrated ticketing system (ITS) is enabled by participating transport operators and customers are using the new Public Services Card Free Travel (PSC-FT) variant rather than the old form of paper free travel pass.  </p>  <p>  The rollout of the ITS by the National Transport Authority to travel operators is ongoing.  In parallel with that programme, my Department continues to replace the old paper pass with the new PSC-FT variant.  The new pass has been issued already to over 80% of customers who have a free travel entitlement.  The completion of these programmes will allow for more comprehensive data to be collected on usage of free travel.</p>  <p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

At present it is taking up to 18 weeks on average to finalise an application.  There are a number of factors that have contributed to the extended time required to process claims.  </p>  <p>  First, there is a significant increase in the volume of applications being received.  The numbers applying for DCA have doubled since 2010, when the Department took over administration of the scheme from the HSE.  The increase in volume over recent years has been consistently in the 15-20% range year on year.</p>  <p>  Second, following a High Court ruling in 2016, there is now a need for the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors to provide the deciding officer with a more detailed opinion on the child&rsquo;s eligibility for the scheme and for the deciding officer in turn to provide more detailed reasons for their decision when communicating this to the customer.  These factors have resulted in the time taken to finalise applications increasing significantly and as a result the numbers being processed have reduced and the timescale to finalise each application has increased.</p>  <p>  In response to the current situation, additional deciding officers are being assigned to the scheme and will take up their positions shortly.  Once these extra resources are in situ and operational, the extra processing capacity should allow for an improvement in processing times.  The position is being monitored closely.</p></reply>

Proposals for individual solar farm developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, in the same manner as other proposed developments. Planning applications are made to the relevant local planning authority with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development Act, each planning authority's development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned.  Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, inter alia, objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including energy facilities, and many local authorities have developed renewable energy strategies for their areas in this context.</p>  <p>  In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the local development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any relevant guidelines issued by my Department.  Planning authorities must then make their own decisions based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the planning code is sufficiently robust to facilitate the assessment of individual planning permission applications for solar farm developments.  However, the matter will be kept under review, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, and his Department - which leads on renewable energy policy - in the context of the Government's White Paper on Energy Policy, published in December 2015, the development of a Renewable Electricity Policy and Development Framework, as well as the finalisation of a new support scheme for renewable electricity by that Department, expected in late 2017.</p></reply>

A copy of the announcement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: ttp://www.housing.gov.ie/planning/guidelines/wind-energy/coveney-and-naughten-announce-key-development-review-wind-energy-development-guidelines.</p><p>The &ldquo;preferred draft approach&rdquo; has been developed to address a number of key aspects of the targeted review which include: Sound/Noise, Visual Amenity and Setback Distances, Shadow Flicker, Consultation Obligations on Developers, Community Dividend and Grid Connections.</p><p>As part of the overall review, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) will be undertaken on the &quot;proposed draft approach&quot; to the revised Guidelines before they come into effect.  This is in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, the SEA Directive.  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process. </p><p>It is envisaged that the SEA process will take approximately 9 months.  In light of the SEA requirements, it is expected that the Guidelines will  be finalised and come into effect in Q1 2018.  In the meantime, the current Guidelines remain in force.</p><p>When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.</p><p>I am aware of a number of newspaper articles reporting a recent court case relating to wind turbine noise.  However, as this is a legal matter between the operators of a particular wind farm and a number of households living in close proximity to it, it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment on the matter.</p></reply>

The Place Finder service has been operating in the Dublin local authorities since 2015 also, and more recently in the Cork City Council area.  The focus of the scheme is to transition qualified households from emergency accommodation, including hotels, into private rented tenancies. </p>  <p>  While eligible homeless households may source accommodation for themselves, a dedicated placement team, the Place Finder Service assists homeless households in areas where there is a high demand for properties but low levels of supply which makes the rental market very challenging, and where the provision of such a service is justified.  </p>  <p>  The Place Finder service seeks out potential properties suitable for households currently identified as homeless.  The service liaises with individual households to establish their specific needs and to ensure that any additional supports which may be needed are put in place; it establishes relationships with local property agents and landlords and it assists the household in securing the tenancy. </p>  <p>  Additional discretion of up to 50% above HAP rent limits is available to the Dublin local authorities to assist in housing homeless households in the Dublin area.  The Place Finder Service can also pay a deposit and two months rent in advance on behalf of the tenant, meaning that homeless households are provided with the best chance of finding a new home with the security that HAP provides.</p>  <p>  The Place Finder Service is a particularly important service for households currently residing in emergency accommodation in the Dublin region and has been utilised very successfully with more than 1,500 households currently being supported by the Homeless HAP scheme.  The DRHE are providing HAP support to an average of 32 households a week through the homeless HAP scheme in 2017.  This includes homeless families exiting emergency accommodation into sustainable tenancies, as well as supporting households who are at immediate risk of homelessness.</p></reply>

The &ldquo;net monetary value&rdquo; here is defined as the market value less the existing use value.</p>  <p>  As stated in the Guidelines on Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 issued  in January 2017 under section 28 of the Act, the net monetary value will normally be achieved where the planning authority acquire 10% of the units, in cases where the units are approximately of equal size.  The Guidelines also state that where the net monetary value would not be achieved by the local authority by taking 10% of units of the preferred kind (e.g. 2- bedroom units), the balance should be achieved through an increased discount being given by the developer on those units and that the developer should not be required to transfer more than 10% of the units via a Part V agreement where he/she does not wish to do so.  While the implementation of Part V is a matter for the local authorities, they are required to have regard to these section 28 Guidelines when carrying out their Part V functions.</p>  <p>  The type of units to be sought is a matter for the individual local authority itself in accordance with its social housing needs and its Housing Strategy.  Section 94 of the Act provides that a planning authority must include a housing strategy in its development plan for the purpose of ensuring that the proper planning and sustainable development of the area provides for the housing of the existing and future population of the area in the manner set out in the strategy.</p>  <p>  In preparing a housing strategy, a planning authority must have regard to the most recent summary of social housing assessments prepared under section 21(a) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 that relate to the area of the development plan, and must include an estimate of the amount of social housing that will be required during the period of the development plan.</p>  <p>  A housing strategy must also take into account -</p>  <p>  (a) the existing need and the likely future need for social housing,</p>  <p>  (b) the need to ensure that housing is available for persons who have different levels of income,</p>  <p>  (c) the need to ensure that a mixture of house types and sizes is developed to reasonably match the requirements of the different categories of households, as may be determined by the planning authority, and including the special requirements of elderly persons and persons with disabilities, and</p>  <p>  (d) the need to counteract undue segregation in housing between persons of different social backgrounds.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines referred to above emphasise the importance of consulting with each developer at the earliest stage in the formulation of the development proposal so that the developer is informed of the social housing requirements for the site and this can be  taken into account in the design of the development.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-27a.1518.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062700092#WRCC04500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 595, 605 and 606 together.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises the housing affordability pressures in certain areas and is determined to see increases in the supply of high quality social and affordable homes, to buy or rent, as quickly as possible, particularly in the major urban areas where demand is greatest.  This is one of the issues I will be considering in the context of the recently announced review of Rebuilding Ireland, one year on from its publication, with an emphasis on building on the progress made, strengthening the measures already in place and identifying new initiatives that add value and raise ambition. </p>  <p>  As part of the review process, my Department will focus in particular on the broad issue of housing affordability, building on the measures already being advanced, for example through initiatives to use State lands to deliver mixed-tenure housing.  In this context, my Department intends to consult with local authorities and other key stakeholders in the coming weeks, as part of the broader review process.</p>  <p>  At a strategic level, under the new 20-year National Planning Framework, there will be an emphasis on managing and utilising State lands to deliver housing and to ensure an active and healthy market for development land.  In this regard, an important policy intervention in the delivery of new housing supply under Pillar 3 of Rebuilding Ireland is the development of State-owned lands for mixed-tenure housing, particularly in the major urban areas, where demand is greatest.  On 27 April 2017, details of some 2,000 hectares of land in public ownership were published, with the potential to deliver up to 50,000 homes nationally.  In practical terms, the development of sites such as these will mean accelerating social housing delivery and securing more homes for sale and rent at lower and more affordable price points.</p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland also commits to the introduction of an affordable rental scheme to enhance the provision of affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.  As set out in the Strategy for the Rental Sector, this commitment is now to be progressed through kick-starting supply in rent pressure zones.  Lands held by local authorities in such zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent, and in particular targeting middle-income households, in mixed-tenure developments.</p>  <p>  In relation to cost rental, a range of measures to improve the supply of rental accommodation that meets the needs of ordinary households are being progressed under the Strategy for the Rental Sector including:</p>  <p>  -  build to rent models;</p>  <p>  -  use of State-owned lands to deliver affordable rental in areas of high demand;</p>  <p>  -  measures to increase the supply of dedicated student accommodation to free-up units in the general rental market;</p>  <p>  -  supports to bring vacant stock into use;</p>  <p>  -  consideration of tax and fiscal incentives to encourage additional supply.</p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, the Strategy for the Rental Sector noted that the Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to develop a "cost rental" option, taking account of work already completed in this area, including by NESC and others.</p>  <p>  In line with this commitment, Action 12 of the Strategy for the Rental Sector provides that my Department will lead an expert group to develop a cost rental model for the Irish rental sector, addressing issues such as funding mechanisms, the need to grow the necessary institutional capacity, particularly within the AHB and not for profit sector (whether through mergers, new entrants or strategic partnerships), the households to be targeted and the appropriate regulation mechanisms.  The expert group will assess the benefits that a larger and more developed not-for-profit segment would bring to the rental sector and the housing system, and examine the feasibility and effectiveness of different approaches to achieve the desired change.  A proposal to establish the Expert Group - including membership and terms of reference - is currently being prepared in my Department.</p>  <p>  There are currently two house purchase loan offerings available to lower income first-time buyers from local authorities.  The first is a standard annuity mortgage available from all local authorities. A first-time buyer unable to get adequate loan from a building society or a bank, may be eligible for a mortgage from the local authority concerned to purchase a new or second hand property or build their own home in cases where the gross income (before tax) is &euro;50,000 or less for a single income household or &euro;75,000 or less in the case of a double income household.  The loan can be up to 97% of the price of the house subject to a maximum loan of &euro;200,000.  </p>  <p>  The second option for first-time buyers unable to secure adequate loan finance from a bank or building society to purchase a new or second-hand property or build their own home is the Home Choice Loan.  Home Choice Loan provides up to 92% of the market value of a property purchased, subject to a maximum loan amount of &euro;285,000. </p></reply>

These public infrastructure projects will be key to the early delivery of 23,000 housing units over the next four years.  There is further potential for approximately 46,000 additional homes on these 34 sites in the longer term, bringing the projected yield up to 69,000 homes once sites are fully built out.  LIHAF will facilitate additional social housing of 2,300 housing units in the short term through the 10% Part V social housing dividend, with a further potential of 4,600 housing units in the longer term.  Furthermore, a number of the projects, such as those which include lands in local authority ownership, will deliver more than the mandatory levels of social housing under Part V.</p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of the affordability requirements for developments in receipt of LIHAF funding, it is important to note that the funding under LIHAF goes to the local authorities rather than to individual developers, to enable them to deliver infrastructure, through a normal public procurement process, on sites that were not being developed due to lack of key public infrastructure.  The early delivery of the infrastructure will in turn enhance the ability of the developer to build on the site as the infrastructural blockage has been removed and the developer's viability is improved, particularly where multiple land owners are involved. </p>  <p>  In return, the State receives a dividend in the form of accelerated housing supply, land for the infrastructure, and much needed social housing under Part V.  In addition, developers are required to provide increased affordability on site for purchasers of private housing.  On the seven sites where State lands are involved, the local authorities are going to provide additional dividends in the form of either additional social housing, affordable rental housing or housing for the disabled or elderly, depending on the requirements in that particular local authority area.</p>  <p>  In seeking to secure improved affordability for the purchaser of private housing, it was initially proposed that a capped price point would be set on a percentage of the housing.  However setting a cap in 2016 for housing that would be developed up to 2021 is problematic and it could adversely impact the viability of the development of some sites, potentially stalling development, with consequential negative impacts on supply, including the Part V social housing element. </p>  <p>  Therefore, a more proportionate way  to recognise the contribution of LIHAF that will encourage housing supply and also deliver an affordability  dividend has been put in place.  Essentially, two options are available to local authorities in seeking to reach agreements with developers, one which sets a minimum number of houses to be offered at 10% below market cost, including under &euro;300,000 in Dublin, and a second option where a reduction in cost related to the relative contribution of LIHAF to the project could be spread over the housing development as a whole.  The second option means a smaller reduction in price over a greater number of houses, giving more purchasers a potential saving but not affecting the viability of the development and more accurately reflecting the contribution of LIHAF.  </p>  <p>  My Department has included the requirement for the local authorities to have secured the requisite affordability agreements in a grant agreement and the local authorities which were successful in receiving approval in principle for LIHAF funding in March 2017 are now putting local agreements in place with developers so they can sign up to that grant agreement.  No drawdown of funding can occur until those grant agreements have been signed and it is expected that all the agreements involved will be finalised by the end of July 2017. </p></reply>

Under Section 10 of the NAMA Act, NAMA is mandated to act in a commercial manner to obtain the best financial return for the State.  As such, NAMA's dealings with its debtors, as well as the management, funding and sale of assets are all commercial decisions taken with consideration to NAMA's commercial obligations.  It should be noted that NAMA acquired loans, not property, and control over the property securing its loans rests with its debtors and receivers.  NAMA does not have powers to transfer assets belonging to its debtors and receivers to other parties.  All transactions must be on a commercial and arm&rsquo;s length basis.</p>  <p>  Following proactive engagement between NAMA, the Housing Agency and my Department, a process was established to ascertain whether residential properties controlled by NAMA borrowers and receivers are suitable for social housing. </p>  <p>  The properties under consideration are part of the security for loans that NAMA has acquired.  In the majority of cases, properties remain in the ownership of the original borrowers.  The remaining properties are controlled by receivers appointed by NAMA.  Once a demand has been identified, NAMA makes contact with the relevant property owner/receiver to determine if the properties are still available and to discuss how these properties can be best utilised. </p>  <p>  Properties that are deemed suitable may be leased or purchased by local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (housing associations and co-operatives) through engagement with the property owners or, on their behalf, appointed insolvency practitioners, facilitated by NAMA.  This is a continuous process and additional properties have been added and offered as they become available over the last number of years.  To end March 2017, 2,390 properties have been secured for social housing under this initiative.  A further 390 properties are at Terms Agreed/Active Negotiation/Pre-Appraisal stages.  While NAMA is consistently mindful of identifying properties which may be suitable for social housing, the pool of such properties is reducing in line with the reduction in the NAMA loan portfolio and at this stage it is unlikely that significant numbers of additional properties will be identified.  However, the Steering Group remains active and will continue to work through any potential units that may become available.</p>  <p>  In addition to this Social Housing initiative, NAMA is making a very substantial contribution, on a commercial basis, to the increased supply of new homes through its residential delivery programme.  Against the background of major supply shortage in urban areas, NAMA has undertaken to fund, if commercially viable, the delivery of up to 20,000 residential units by 2020.  Residential developments funded by NAMA are subject to the same planning and regulatory requirements as all other developments.  This includes policies relating to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and as such, it is expected that a minimum of 10% of the anticipated output of this investment by NAMA, or about 2,000 units, will become available for social housing through this statutory mechanism over this period.</p></reply>

This total is a considerable reduction on the 871 such families recorded at the end of March.  Based on figures provided to my Department by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, over 830 families have exited hotel and B&amp;B arrangements since Rebuilding Ireland was published last July, while over 400 families were prevented from entering hotels by securing new tenancies under the homeless pilot of the Housing Assistance Payment scheme before they had to enter homeless emergency accommodation.  </p>  <p>  Given the number of exits being achieved by the Dublin housing authorities on an ongoing basis and also the significant volume of new family-oriented supported temporary accommodation coming on stream in the coming weeks, I expect the overall figure for homeless families accommodated in hotel and B&amp;B arrangements to further reduce over the coming period.  I have requested that the four Dublin housing authorities continue to treat this as a key priority and while the emphasis must be on exiting as many homeless families as possible, I have requested that any remaining families, other than in exceptional circumstances, are notified by end June of the pathway out of hotels envisaged for them over the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  Last week, I announced my intention to make available &euro;10 million for further new family-oriented supported temporary accommodation facilities.  Currently, fifteen such facilities are being developed at a total estimated cost of &euro;25 million to provide accommodation for upwards of 600 families.  The additional funding will add accommodation for at least another 200 families. </p></reply>

Under sections 48 and 49 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, planning authorities may levy development contributions in respect of public infrastructure and facilities benefiting development in the area that is provided by, or intended to be provided, by or on behalf of the local authority.  Examples of such infrastructure and facilities include roads, footpaths, public lighting, open spaces etc. </p>  <p>  The basis for the determination of a development contribution is set out in a development contribution scheme adopted by the elected members of a local authority, and planning authorities may make one or more schemes in respect of different parts of its functional area.  In addition to the terms of the scheme, planning authorities may require the payment of a special contribution in respect of a particular development where specific exceptional costs not covered by a scheme are incurred by any local authority in respect of public infrastructure and facilities which benefit the proposed development.  The adoption of these schemes is a reserved function of the locally elected members of each planning authority, and it is a matter for the members to determine - (i) the level of contribution and the types of development to which they will apply, and (ii) the expenditure of the contributions received within the confines of the scheme conditions.</p>  <p>  Development contributions can only be levied in respect of capital funding for public infrastructure and facilities and as such cannot be used to cover current expenditure costs.  Any development contributions accruing to the local authority under the provisions must be accounted for separately in the Capital account of the local authority.  Income from development contributions must be ring-fenced to pay for public infrastructure and facilities servicing new development and it is a matter for each local authority to determine the allocation of those incomes, having regard to the provisions of sections 48 and 49 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.</p>  <p>  My Department is responsible for monitoring the local government sector&rsquo;s compliance with fiscal rules set out as part of the management of the Stability and Growth Pact.  These include the contribution of the local government sector to the General Government Balance (GGB) and also controls to be exercised under the Expenditure Benchmark requirements.  Arising from the Government&rsquo;s effort to meet commitments in relation to the General Government Deficit limit, local authorities have been directed that, similar to the revenue account activity, capital expenditure should not exceed capital income within the reporting year.  The precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed in order to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities themselves.  However, within these overall limits, there is additional capacity for the expenditure of built-up capital balances and own resources funded by development contributions on hand by local authorities, which must be sanctioned by my Department.  In reviewing requests for sanction, consideration is given to ensuring that priority infrastructural investment can proceed, that contractual commitments and on-going projects can proceed and that development contributions already collected and aligned to specific capital projects can be utilised efficiently. </p></reply>

A first-time buyer unable to get adequate loan from a building society or a bank, may be eligible for a mortgage from the local authority concerned to purchase a new or second hand property or build their own home in cases where the gross income (before tax) is &euro;50,000 or less for a single income household or &euro;75,000 or less in the case of a double income household.  The loan can be up to 97% of the price of the house subject to a maximum loan of &euro;200,000.  The second option for first-time buyers unable to secure adequate loan finance from a bank or building society to purchase a new or second-hand property or build their own home is the Home Choice Loan.  Home Choice Loan provides up to 92% of the market value of a property purchased, subject to a maximum loan amount of &euro;285,000.  </p><p>Information on the number of local authority loans approved and issued from 2013 to end Q3 2016 is available on my Department's website at .  </p><p>I am currently examining the Home Choice Loan Scheme and am also considering how local authority mortgages can be better publicised to ensure that credit worthy households who may be unable to source adequate loan finance from commercial lenders but could be eligible for one of the local authority mortgages, are made aware of the opportunity.</p></reply>

I can only provide information in relation to such acquisitions, as were assisted by my Department.  There are two such schemes: the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) provides funding in respect of the costs of purchasing accommodation to meet special housing needs and 112 units were acquired by AHBs under this scheme in 2015. The Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF), which assists AHBs with the financing of  the acquisition of units that will be provided for social housing use, is a loan facility that supports up to 30% of the eligible capital cost of the project, where the units will be provided under payment and availability arrangements to local authorities for social housing use.  The balance of funding requirements is sourced by the AHB, predominantly from low cost borrowings from the Housing Finance Agency. In 2015 AHBs were provided with funding to support the acquisition of an additional 442 units under the CALF scheme.</p><p>In addition to the acquisitions outlined above, AHBs also constructed 270 new units using CAS funding and 31 new units using CALF support.

Under section 11(3) of the Electoral Act 1992, a person shall be deemed not to have given up ordinary residence if they intend to resume residence within eighteen months after giving it up and a written statement by a person that he intends to resume residence within eighteen months after giving it up shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be accepted as a correct statement.</p>  <p>  Local authorities have a range of powers of investigation when compiling the register of electors for their areas.  For example, Rule 5(1) of the Second Schedule to the Electoral Act 1992 provides that a local authority shall make a house to house or other sufficient enquiry in their registration area when preparing the register. </p>  <p>  Under Rule 5(3) of the Schedule they may require a person to give any information they have which may be needed in compiling the register.  Where a local authority is of the view that someone on the register may no longer be resident at a particular address, they can initiate a process for removing the person from the register.  Section 133 of the Electoral Act 1992 provides that any person who refuses to give a local authority the information it seeks in order to carry out its registration functions or who knowingly gives false information to the authority shall be guilty of an offence.</p>  <p>  Rule 5(6) of the Second Schedule to the Electoral Act 1992 requires the local authority to publish the draft register on or before 1 November annually.  This provides an opportunity for members of the public to advise their local authorities about people they consider to be wrongly included in the register. </p>  <p>  In addition, there is a responsibility on each individual who votes to ensure that they are entitled to do so.  Under section 149 of the Electoral Act 1992 (as applied to referendums under section 6 of the Referendum Act 1994), a person who is included in a register of electors that is currently in force but who is not entitled to be included in the register shall be guilty of an offence if they vote.</p>  <p>  A person presenting at a polling station has a right under section 111(3) of the Electoral Act 1992 (as applied to referendums under section 32 of the Referendum Act 1994) to vote if they are included in the register of electors.  However, section 111(4) of the 1992 Act provides that the right to vote under section 111(3) does not entitle any person to vote who is not entitled to do so and does not relieve that person from any penalties for which they may be liable. </p>  <p>  Enforcement of electoral law is a matter for the Garda and anyone suspecting that fraud or other electoral offences have been committed in the conduct of a referendum may bring these matters to their attention.  In addition, provision is made in Part IV of the Referendum Act 1994 for the submission of a referendum petition to the High Court in circumstances where there are grounds for believing that the result of a referendum was affected materially by the commission of an offence referred to in Part XXII of the Electoral Act 1992.</p>  <p>  Suggestions made in the correspondence about implementation of provisions relating to voters who are temporarily absent from the State would require amendments to the law.  Government recently agreed that work should commence on modernisation of the electoral register, in the context of facilitating the registration of voters resident outside the State, in the event of an extension of the franchise at Presidential elections being approved by the people in a referendum.  All aspects of voter registration, including the legal provisions, will be reviewed as part of this project.</p></reply>

It was a key tool of Government in providing supports for the harder to reach in the most disadvantaged areas and communities.  It was delivered at a local level by the nationwide network of Local Development Companies and by a number of other organisations including the National Traveller Partnership (NTP), Pavee Point and the National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum.  </p><p>The NTP co-ordinated the delivery of the LCDP in partnership with 14 Traveller Community Development projects by means of a community development approach, promotion of human rights and a clear recognition of Travellers&rsquo; specific identity.  The 14 Traveller projects are listed below:-</p><p>-  Ballyfermot Travellers Action Project</p><p>-  Blanchardstown Traveller Support Group</p><p>-  Bray Travellers Community Development Group Ltd</p><p>-  Clondalkin Travellers Development Group</p><p>-  Donegal Travellers Project</p><p>-  Galway Traveller Movement Ltd</p><p>-  Navan Travellers Workshop</p><p>-  St. Margaret's Travellers Community Association Ltd</p><p>-  Tallaght Travellers Community Development Project</p><p>-  Tipperary Rural Travellers' Project Ltd</p><p>-  TravAct -Northside Travellers Support Group</p><p>-  Tullamore Traveller Movement</p><p>-  Waterford Travellers Community Development Project</p><p>-  Wicklow Travellers Group</p><p>Following the SICAP procurement process, discussions took place between the then Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (DECLG) and the Department of Justice and Equality (DJE) regarding the introduction of a revised support scheme for Travellers.  An agreement was reached in March 2015, which resulted in the responsibility for support to Travellers and Roma groups becoming a key function of the DJE through the permanent transfer of some &euro;1.375 million to that Department.  </p><p>My Department also supports a number of Traveller projects under the Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO).  This funding scheme, which supports national organisations in the community and voluntary sector, aims to provide multi-annual funding to national organisations towards core costs associated with the provision of services.</p><p>The following table lists the LCDP, SSNO and transferred DJE funding supports provided.<table><tr><th>Organisation</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>National Traveller Partnership</td><td>&euro;1,171,800</td><td>&euro;1,148,364</td><td>&euro;1,375,356 permanently transferred to DJE</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Pavee Point</td><td>&euro;119,200</td><td>&euro;128,844.00</td><td>as above: &euro;1,375,356 permanently transferred to DJE</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum</td><td>&euro;93,895.00</td><td>&euro;89,699</td><td>as above: &euro;1,375,356 permanently transferred to DJE</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Traveller Movement</td><td>&euro;31,281</td><td>&euro;72,990</td><td>&euro;18,780 (and included in the above transfer to DJE)</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Carrickmines Fire Tragedy supports</td><td></td><td>&euro;53,173.76</td><td>&euro;22,791.00</td><td>Nil</td></tr></table>The SICAP programme, which commenced in April 2015, succeeded the LCDP.  SICAP is the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State and is delivered locally by 46 Programme Implementers.  Its aim is to tackle poverty, social exclusion and long-term unemployment through local engagement and partnership between disadvantaged individuals, community organisations, public sector agencies and other stakeholders. The principles, approaches and mechanisms of the programme aim to offer local areas significant ability to tackle a very wide range of issues.  The SICAP target groups account for those most vulnerable in our communities and include Travellers.  </p><p>The SICAP funding allocations for front-line delivery for 2015, 2016 and 2017 nationally were &euro;28m, &euro;37.5m and &euro;37.5m, respectively.  Travellers are a specified target group of SICAP and benefit from a range of activities and supports under the programme.  SICAP Programme Implementers are required to report financial information at action level under each of the 3 programme goals.  As actions relate to work with more than one target group, it is not possible to provide a financial breakdown for a specific target group. </p><p>SICAP Programme Implementers ensure that Traveller participants availing of SICAP supports are made aware of the opportunities for local self-employment (which may include social entrepreneurship) and, where appropriate, receive training to enhance their skills to take up these opportunities.  The number of Travellers receiving support from SICAP are set out in the following table. </p><p>Travellers receiving support under SICAP<table><tr><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017 YTD</th></tr><tr><td>660</td><td>900</td><td>385</td></tr></table>My Department is fully committed to ensuring that the delivery of the range of supports required for Travellers nationwide is maintained through the SICAP Programme and will be providing progress reports  to the Department of Justice and Equality on the implementation of relevant actions listed in the National Traveller and Roma inclusion Strategy 2017 - 2021.</p></reply>

Inspection and enforcement and the maintenance of relevant registers are a matter for  local authorities who, under the relevant legislation, are designated as Building Control and Fire Authorities in their respective functional areas and have extensive statutory powers of inspection and enforcement.  Section 8(4) of the Building Control Act 1990 provides that a Building Control Authority may serve an Enforcement Notice requiring that such steps as are necessary to ensure compliance with the Building Regulations, including Part B &ndash; Fire Safety, be taken within a specified period.  An Enforcement Notice may be served at any time up to five years from the completion of the Building Works.  Under the Building Control Regulations, Building Control Authorities are required to maintain a register of any enforcement notices served by them, including brief particulars of the contents of the notice, which must be made available for public inspection.</p>  <p>  Under the Fire Services Acts of 1981 and 2003 local authorities are designated as fire authorities in their respective functional areas and have extensive statutory powers of inspection and enforcement.  Section 20 of the Act provides that the appropriate fire authority may serve a Fire Safety Notice on the owner or occupier of any building which appears to the authority to be a potentially dangerous building.  Section 20 of the Act provides that a Fire Safety Notice in relation to a building may prohibit the use of the building, or a specified part of the building, unless or until specified precautions are taken to the satisfaction of the fire authority.</p>  <p>  In response to the tragic fire in Grenfell Tower, the immediate focus of attention has been on life safety issues.  In that context, I requested that each local authority, as a matter of urgency, review their multi-storey social housing units to ensure that all early warning systems, including alarm and detection systems and means of escape including corridors, stairways and emergency exits are in place and fully functional.</p>  <p>  In order to raise awareness amongst private landlords, including landlords of households in receipt of social housing supports and rental assistance, the Residential Tenancies Board has been asked to remind all landlords of their statutory responsibilities and obligations as landlords to ensure that their properties fully comply with fire safety requirements.  The RTB placed a notice to this effect on its website and will be writing  individually to all registered landlords providing detailed information in the coming days.</p>  <p>  A Building Control Management System (BCMS) alert was issued to all registered users of the BCMS to remind those involved in works to existing or new buildings of the need to remain vigilant in relation to compliance with the Building Regulations and in particular to Part B Fire Safety.  It was issued to 57,000 registered users including builders, assigned certifiers, designers and owners.</p>  <p>  I also met with Dublin&rsquo;s Chief Fire Officer to discuss fire safety and life safety issues in light of the London tragedy.  I also requested that the management board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) convene and assess the readiness of the fire authorities to respond to emergencies.  In response to this request, the NDFEM Board has confirmed to me that the recent report of the Directorate&rsquo;s External Validation group found that the public are well served by the developed arrangements in place for fire services in Ireland, and concluded that the available evidence provides for confidence regarding the capability of fire services to respond to emergencies.  A further meeting with all of the national Chief Fire Officers will be convened shortly.</p>  <p>  Part D of the Building Regulations set out the requirements for the use of proper products and materials.  For claddings, such as may have been used in Grenfell Tower, third party certification, for example Agr&eacute;ment Certification is a means of demonstrating how they can meet the requirements of the Building Regulations.  These certificates provide guidance on the installation, suitability for use and the fire performance of the cladding, among other issues.</p>  <p>  While we  await the report and conclusions of the promised statutory public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire, the United Kingdom Department of Communities and Local Government has confirmed that cladding using a composite aluminium panel with a polyethylene core would be non-compliant with current Building Regulations guidance as this material should not be used as cladding on buildings over 18m in height.  I can confirm that the same restrictions apply under Irish Building Regulations.</p>  <p>  I have  tasked the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management with co-ordinating a high-level Task Force to lead Ireland&rsquo;s re-appraisal of fire safety in the wake of the  Grenfell Tower fire.  The  further issues to be considered, in addition to those outlined above, include: </p>  <p> - The preliminary survey of the use of cladding products on residential buildings over 18m (6 storeys) being undertaken by fire services in Dublin is to be extended to the rest of the country and to cover buildings in all categories over 18m in height.  The results to be reported to my Department by 19 July.</p>  <p> - My Department is to meet with the local authority Chief Fire Officers in the coming weeks to review current activities and to plan for further fire safety initiatives in prioritised areas of action.</p>  <p> - Responsibility for fire safety in buildings of all kinds (other than dwellings) is placed by Section 18 (2) of the Fire Services Act 1981 on the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; of each building.  In order to assist those in both the public and private sector who hold this responsibility, consideration is being given to the publication of a guide on  undertaking Fire Safety Assessments as provided for in Section 18 (6)(a) of the Act.  This will facilitate persons having control of buildings to demonstrate that they are complying with their statutory responsibilities.</p>  <p> - I will be updating my  Cabinet colleagues on the post Grenfell Tower fire situation and highlighting the implications of fire safety responsibilities in buildings across all sectors, both public and private.</p>  <p> - A renewed focus is to be placed on the preparations of local authorities, working with the Principal Response Agencies and others, for large scale evacuation and operation of rest centres under the aegis of the Framework for Major Emergency Management.</p>  <p>- I will consider all issues emerging, including regulatory arrangements, in line with developments.</p></reply>

Section 20(2)(a) of the Act provides that a Fire Safety Notice in relation to a building may prohibit the use of a building or part of a building for any of the purposes specified in the notice.  Section 20(2)(b) of the Act provides that a Fire Safety Notice in relation to a building may prohibit the use of the building, or a specified part of the building, for any of the purposes specified in the notice unless or until specified precautions are taken to the satisfaction of the fire authority; whether by the provision in the building of specified appliances or fittings or by the execution of specified structural alterations or additions to the building, or by the removal from the building of furniture, furnishings, fittings or any other material or thing, or by the doing in relation to the building or its contents of any other thing whatsoever.</p>  <p>  Section 20(6) of the Act provides that a Fire Safety Notice may specify a time-frame under which remedial actions, such as those set out above, must be completed.  Failure to comply with the requirements of a Fire Safety Notice is an offence under the Act and any person found guilty may be subject to a range of penalties as set out in the Act.</p>  <p>  Section 20(8) of the Act provides that each fire authority shall keep at its offices a register of Fire Safety Notices served by it and the register shall be open to inspection by any person at all reasonable times.  Information on the details of Fire Safety Notices served by local authorities are not held by my Department but may be obtained directly from the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  In an immediate response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy, I have requested that a number of specific measures be taken that have implications for tenants and building owners;</p>  <p> - I have requested that all local authorities review their multi-storey social housing units to ensure that all early warning systems, including alarm and detection systems, emergency lighting and means of escape including corridors, stairways and emergency exits are fully functional and in place.  Life safety must be our first concern.</p>  <p> - In terms of raising awareness across landlords, including landlords of households in receipt of social housing supports and rental assistance, I have asked the Residential Tenancies Board to notify all landlords of their responsibilities and obligations as landlords in terms of ensuring that their properties fully comply with fire safety requirements.</p>  <p> - A Business Control Management System (BCMS) alert was issued to all registered users of the BCMS to remind those involved in works to existing or new buildings of the need to remain vigilant in relation to compliance with the Building Regulations and in particular to Part B Fire Safety.  This was issued to 57,000 registered users including builders, assigned certifiers, designers and owners.</p></reply>

All first-time new entrants to pensionable public service employment on or after that date are members of the Single Scheme.</p><p>The new Single Scheme was one of the key structural reform commitments agreed by Government with the EU/IMF under the programme of financial support for Ireland.  In the context of the Government&rsquo;s decision to introduce the Single Scheme, a stated primary objective is to help significantly reduce the cost of public service pensions in the longer-term through far-reaching transformation of the public service pension system.  With that in mind, the terms and rules of the Single Scheme are fundamentally different to the superannuation arrangements of all public servants recruited before 1 January 2013.  The terms/rules of the Single Scheme, which are set down in the 2012 Act, make no provision for the concept or award of supplementary pensions for any new entrants joining any public service group on or after 1 January 2013.  This position has been confirmed to the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations. </p><p>Under the 2012 Act, overall statutory responsibility for the formulation of the Single Scheme pension terms/rules rests with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. </p></reply>

There are three anti-malarial drugs in use by the Irish Defence Forces, namely Lariam (mefloquine), Malarone and Doxycycline.  The choice of medication for overseas deployment, including the use of Lariam, is a medical decision made by Medical Officers in the Defence Forces, having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Irish Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  Significant precautions are taken by Irish Defence Forces Medical Officers in assessing the medical suitability of members of our Defence Forces to take any of the anti-malarial medications.  It is the policy of the Irish Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability. </p>  <p>  The health and welfare of the Defence Forces are a priority for me.  Anti-malarial medications, including Lariam, remain in the formulary of medications prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risks posed by Malaria. </p></reply>
