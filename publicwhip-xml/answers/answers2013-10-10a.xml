The Report is a valuable contribution to the consideration of social protection for persons who are self-employed. It estimates that cover for Jobseekers Benefit would require a 1% increase in the self-employed contribution to be cost neutral, and cover for Invalidity Pension would require a 1.5% increase in contribution. It also showed that among those self-employed who do apply for the means-tested Jobseekers Assistance, the approval rate is high at 85% though it recognised that it is difficult to quantify the extent to which needs are being addressed. It pointed to a number of features of the system that may make it more difficult for self-employed persons to access entitlements in this area, ranging from lack of awareness to individual features of the means test. The Group also recommended compulsory cover for Invalidity Pension but was not persuaded of the extension of Jobseekers Benefit.</p><p>  In the present climate, Government must be careful of any measures that increase the costs of establishing and operating a business. </p><p>  On the positive side, entrepreneurs would be provided with an additional &lsquo;safety net&rsquo;.  However, it is relevant that the responses received to the public consultation undertaken by the Advisory Group did not identify a lack of entitlement to the Invalidity Pension as a concern. The Group&rsquo;s proposals for simplification of the methodology for assessing means for the self-employed are welcome. </p><p>  However, in accordance with the Groups Terms of Reference, the group did not undertake a cost-benefit analysis regarding the economic merits of extending social insurance cover to the self-employed, and these require further consideration.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-10-10a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013101000047#WRA00800"><p>On the 1<sup>st</sup>  of October last, I published the Report of the Labour Court's Review of the Joint Labour Committee (JLC) system. The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 provides that reviews of each JLC be carried out by the Labour Court, as soon as practicable after the commencement of the Act, and at least once every 5 years thereafter. The review assisted the Labour Court's  deliberations as to whether any JLC should be abolished, maintained in its current form, amalgamated with another JLC or its establishment order amended and the Labour Court is required to make recommendations to me to this effect.</p><p>  I have accepted the recommendations contained in the Report.   When I published the Report I indicated my intention to abolish the Dublin Hotels, and the Law Clerks' JLCs, to narrow the scope of the Agricultural, Hairdressing, Retail Grocery, Hotels (outside Dublin), Contract Cleaning and Security JLCs, while amending the administration of the two Catering JLCs pending their amalgamation following amended legislation. In the latter context, I also stated my intention to look at applying the Hairdressing JLC country-wide once the necessary legislation is passed.</p><p>  In publishing the Report and outlining the legal steps necessary for implementation of the Labour Court's recommendations, I have been particularly mindful of issues arising as a result of the recent Supreme Court ruling in relation to Registered Employment Agreements (the <i>McGowan </i>  case).</p><p>  With the exception of the Agriculture JLC, implementation of the recommendations regarding the scope of the other nine JLCs will be given effect by way of Ministerial Order. As the Agricultural Workers JLC was established under primary legislation (the Industrial Relations Act 1976), an amendment to the Establishment Order requires amending primary legislation. I anticipate that the Establishment Orders necessary to give effect to the recommendations regarding the other nine JLCs will be made over the coming weeks.</p><p>  At the conclusion of this process there will be eight JLCs remaining - and this will drop to seven when the legislation required to implement the recommendation relating to the Catering JLCs is enacted - leaving slightly over half the number that operated at the beginning of the reform process which I pursued on coming to Office. This latest development sits squarely within the context of the change required to improve Ireland's competitiveness by enhancing wage flexibility while also ensuring protection for vulnerable workers.</p></reply>

The contract, which is confidential between IDA Ireland and the company, includes conditions and milestones with which the company is required to comply before any financial assistance is paid.  All IDA clients enter into formal Grant Agreements in full knowledge that the penalty for non-performance is a pro-rata repayment of grants.</p><p>  Employment Grants for approved job creation projects are only paid following investment incurred by IDA approved clients and the creation of actual jobs.  Where a shortfall in job numbers arises, IDA will review the case and seek recovery of grant where appropriate.</p><p>  IDA monitors job creation in individual client companies on an on-going basis.  In addition the Annual Employment Survey, which is carried out by Forfas, is utilised by IDA as a further tool of verification of job numbers in IDA sponsored companies. In addition, at the time of a grant claim, IDA also seeks formal verification of job numbers, prior to payment of the grant.</p><p>  I am informed by IDA that during 2012 the Agency received employment grant refunds totalling &euro;2.8m from 8 client companies.  Approximately 30% of the amount refunded related to company closures with the loss of approximately 220 jobs in total. The balance of funds recouped related to existing IDA Ireland client companies who are still operating in Ireland, but who did not fully comply with all the terms of the grant agreements.  This could be, for example, because a particular product or service that formed part of the business case for the grant has ceased production/provision for market reasons.</p><p>  IDA Ireland continues to work closely with these companies in order to win new forms of business and to encourage them to transform their operations in Ireland to ensure that they remain viable, competitive and embedded in the economy.</p></reply>

Currently my Department is considering the contents of this report, and assessing the merits and practicality of its recommendations.  Some of the suggested actions relate to matters which come within the remit of other Government Departments or bodies and some of the recommendations could have significant financial implications, which would be a challenge in the current financial climate.</p><p>  This report builds on the comprehensive Forf&aacute;s South East Action Plan which I commissioned at the time of the <i>Talk Talk</i>   closure.  Work is on-going on the implementation of those Action Plan recommendations, with agencies and stakeholders working together to maximise benefits for the region.  I have also established a South East Forum of the key stakeholders within the region.  Hopefully this new report will complement and reinforce the objectives of the current Action Plan. </p><p>  All the key State players have been actively pursuing initiatives to facilitate development and job creation in the region, and I look forward to continued co-operation and collaboration with real benefits for the South East. </p><p>  I will be asking the South East forum to let me have their considered views on the Joint Committee report. I will, in due course, also be happy to discuss its findings with the committee, in the context of our ongoing constructive dialogue.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-10-10a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013101000047#WRA01400"><p>The Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) began operations on 24th October 2012. By its nature the Scheme is demand driven. As at 4th  October there were 69 live CGS facilities resulting in &euro;9.7m being sanctioned through the Scheme by the participating lenders resulting in 433 new jobs being created and 139 jobs maintained. There are 3 banks participating: Bank of Ireland, AIB and Ulster Bank.   Such an initiative has never been implemented in Ireland before, despite many calls for such a scheme to be introduced. </p><p>  The key challenge in relation to this Scheme is to ensure that in the first instance the banks, and in particular, the relevant local level bank officials are aware that there is support for SMEs, who because of a lack of collateral (Pillar 1) and/or because of an inadequacy of understanding of the novelty of a business model, market, sector or technology, face difficulties in accessing traditional bank credit (Pillar 2). It is crucial that these bank officials see the Credit Guarantee Scheme as a key tool they have access to in order to facilitate lending to SMEs. Therefore, the banks need to integrate the Scheme into their credit function and to up-skill credit underwriters in relation to the Scheme. Any application for credit that is declined because of Pillar 1 and/or 2 should then be considered by the bank for inclusion under the Scheme. I have been assured by the banks of their support for the operation of the Scheme and that it is being promoted appropriately within the bank structures. </p><p>  The second main challenge is around raising awareness amongst SMEs and their advisers. Awareness amongst these groups should increase the number of enquiries to banks for the Scheme, and this increase in demand should feed into the number of Credit Guarantee Facilities provided. </p><p>  Given these challenges and because take-up continued to be slow, the Scheme was recently independently reviewed with a view to identifying the reasons for this and recommending changes to the Scheme design. The Review included detailed consultations with all key stakeholders. A Steering Group, chaired by my Department, is currently assessing the expert Review and will shortly report back to me outlining what action needs to be taken to amend the Scheme.  I intend to publish the Review once this assessment is complete. </p><p>  I will then take whatever action is necessary to maximise the take-up of the Scheme. This may include amending the Credit Guarantee Act 2012, making a new Credit Guarantee Scheme and re-launching the Scheme with a marketing campaign and communications strategy supported by all interested parties. </p><p>  I recognise that there is a greater challenge around SMEs&rsquo; awareness of and understanding of the full suite of Government financial supports. The Government is working through the SME State Bodies Group, chaired by the Department of Finance, to develop a Communications Strategy in relation to all supports, financial and advisory, to business through the use of on-line and other resources and a Credit and Lending Newsletter for SMEs. This work is ongoing.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-10-10a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013101000047#WRA01600"><p>The focus of our Action Plan for Jobs is to promote job growth in the enterprise sectors. This is the most effective way to deal with the emigration and in particular the emigration of those with high skills. As the Deputy knows, data from the CSO has confirmed that the Enterprise sector has created 39,000 additional jobs in the past twelve months. The break down by nationality estimates that over 90% of these jobs went to Irish nationals.</p><p>  One of the policy issues which we are focussing upon is the skills mismatch between job opportunities arising and the skills of persons entering the labour market.</p><p>  The level of net emigration in the past few years has been 33/34,000. Within this number there has been a significant rise in the number of Irish nationals leaving. There are currently no statistics available on the skills profile of recent Irish emigrants. The impact of migration on the labour market and available skills depends on a range of factors including, for example, the age at which people migrate, whether they are of working age and their occupational skillset.</p><p>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, which reports to both myself and the Minister for Education and Skills, plays a key role in advising on future enterprise skills needs and emerging gaps.  The work of the expert group informs the selection of new targeted programmes designed to provide interventions to tackle the skills shortages in particular sectors of the economy, e.g. Springboard, Momentum and the ICT skills conversion initiative, which was introduced as part of the ICT Action Plan.In 2013, there will be continued targeted investment in over 430,000 part-time and<i></i>full-time places across the further and higher education and training sectors, all of which are open to unemployed people including young people and the long-term unemployed.  This investment includes the provision of the Skillnets Training Networks Programme, which is enterprise-led by nature, where the development of training is led by representatives of industry to ensure that training provision meets the identified needs of the network stakeholders and companies.</p><p>  The aim of the <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i> is to support the creation of 100,000 net new jobs by 2016, while the objective of <i>Pathways to Work</i>   is to provide those who are unemployed with the appropriate training and skills to avail of the job opportunities which will arise as the economy recovers. </p><p>  Even with continued job losses in more traditional sectors such as Construction, and Financial, Insurance and Administrative activities, we have seen an increase in employment in sectors targeted by the Action Plan for Jobs, for example Tourism Agri-food, ICT and Digital Gaming. These developments demonstrate the transformation which is taking place in the economy which had become too dependent on the Construction sector and domestic demand to support economic growth.</p><p>  By continuing the process of transforming our economy step by step through the <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i>  , we aim to provide opportunities for those who wish to continue to live and work in Ireland.</p></reply>

Enterprise Agency supported companies account for more than 80% of Ireland's total exports.</p><p>  CSO figures show that our strong export performance is continuing. Total exports in 2012 by companies based in Ireland amounted to &euro;182.155bn - an increase of 5.48% over the figure of &euro;172.696bn for 2011.  </p><p>  In 2012, Enterprise Ireland had a record year for exports by their client companies of &euro;16.2bn, which were up by &euro;1bn, or 6%. </p><p>  IDA supported companies also saw an increase in exports to &euro;122bn in 2011, (the latest figures available) which were up by 8%, from &euro;110bn in 2010.</p><p>  2012, was also a particularly good year for job creation in companies supported by these Agencies, with IDA client companies creating a total of 12,722 gross new jobs.  Clients of Enterprise Ireland created 12,861 gross new jobs.  In total, agency assisted companies accounted for direct employment of 285,000 in 2011 and 294,000 in 2012, and are indirectly responsible for a similar number of jobs in ancillary and support services.</p><p>  The latest Central Statistics Office release shows that employment increased by 33,800 in the year to Quarter 2 2013, net of a reduction of 5,400 in public sector numbers.  This was the third consecutive Quarter where an increase in employment was recorded.</p><p>  We have now moved from a situation where the private sector was losing over 7,000 jobs per month before this Government came to office, to the present situation where it is creating close to 3,000 jobs per month.  </p><p>  I am determined, through the implementation of the Government's annual Action Plan for Jobs process, to continue the transition to a sustainable economy, through growing our exports, and creating the jobs we need.</p><p><font color="#212100">Central to the Action Plan is ensuring greater access for Irish companies to real opportunities to break into new markets, grow their exports and create much needed jobs for this economy. </font></p><p>  I am currently preparing the 2014 Action Plan on behalf of the Government and we will continue, through that process, to build on the success of the actions we have taken over the last two years.</p></reply>

Part-time work is recorded as self-reported by individuals.</p><p>  The estimated number of part-time underemployed persons in the second quarter of 2013<i></i>was<i></i>149,400. This represents a decrease over the past year, and is down 7,300 or -4.6% on the position in the second quarter of 2012. This is the first annual decline in part-time underemployment recorded since the third quarter of 2010. Part-time underemployment represented 33.0% of total part-time employment in Q2 2013, down from 34.3%  in Q2 of 2012.</p><p>  Opportunities to access full-time jobs and up-skilling and further career development are essential to overcome involuntary part-time work and to provide individuals with the necessary means to maintain their employability and make transitions work.</p><p>  Employment is now increasing across many sectors and occupations, both in full-time and in part-time employments. The latest information from the Quarterly National Household Survey shows an annual increase in employment of 1.8% or 33,800 in the year to the second quarter of 2013, bringing total employment to 1,869,900. The QNHS data shows that the increase in total employment of 33,800 in the year to Q2 2013 was represented by an increase in full-time employment of 21,600 (+1.5%) and an increase in part-time employment of 12,100 (+2.8%).  <font color="#FF0000"> </font></p><p>  It will be through transitioning the economy onto a competitive and sustainable path that greater employment opportunities will be created for those that are currently underemployed. The policies to address underemployment align with wider employment strategy. Assisting companies to win new markets, to innovate and grow are essential to overcome underemployment. The Action Plan for Jobs concentrates on implementing changes to help promote entrepreneurship, improve access to finance, the capacity of our companies and educational institutions to innovate and build new sectors of opportunity.</p></reply>

Any decisions concerning PRSI measures for 2014 will be a matter for the Minister for Finance in the context of next week&rsquo;s Budget.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to support job creation since the Jobs Initiative has been the Action Plan for Jobs.   The Action Plan has introduced a wide range of additional measures to support job creation in 2012 and 2013.  For example, arising from a commitment in the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs, the Government launched JobsPlus last July.  This is a new incentive that offers employers a grant of &euro;7,500 for recruiting a jobseeker between 12 and 24 months unemployed, and &euro;10,000 for recruiting a jobseeker over two years unemployed  .</p><p>  The latest CSO employment figures show that there were 33,800 more people in employment in Quarter 2 of this year than there were in the same period last year.  Unemployment fell by 22,200 in the same period.  We have now moved from a situation where the private sector was losing over 7,000 jobs per month before this Government came to office, to the present situation where it is creating close to 3,000 jobs per month.  </p><p>  The Government will continue to build on this progress through the Action Plan for Jobs in 2014, as we transform the economy from one based on unsustainable debt to one based on enterprise, innovation and exports.</p></reply>

There is usually a time lag of between three to five years between an announcement of an investment and the jobs coming on stream, though this is not always the case. During 2012 there were 88 investments announcements by IDA Ireland client companies, with the potential to create in the region of 8,000 jobs. It should be noted that not all jobs announced in a given year actually materialise in that calendar year for a variety of reasons, including delays with projects.  Even so, the number of new jobs created in IDA Ireland client companies in any one year usually exceeds the number of jobs announced because existing IDA client companies often add to their workforce. The Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment survey shows that a total of 12,722 new jobs were created in IDA client companies during 2012.  In the first 6 months of 2013, 70 investment projects, with the potential to create in the region of 7,000 jobs have been announced by IDA Ireland client companies. </p><p>  Among the companies who announced job creation plans in the first half of 2013 were Ebay, EMC, McAfee, Pfizer, Sanofi, Symantec, Zurich, Huawei, Yahoo, Facebook, Vistakon, Guidewire, Squarespace, Groupon, Qualcomm, Novartis, Nypro, AOL and FireEye.</p></reply>

Obviously, the more of these jobs that can be filled on a full-time basis, the better it is for those in the labour force.  It is important to remember, however, that part-time work is an important choice for some people due to their personal circumstances, and many people benefit from this type of flexible working arrangement.</p><p>  The latest employment figures published by the CSO show that employment in the economy increased by 33,800 year-on-year to the end of Quarter 2 2013, net of a reduction of 5,400 in public sector employment.  The figures also indicate that the number of people in full-time employment increased by 21,600 over the year.  Part-time employment increased by 12,100.  This was in sharp contrast to the previous Quarter, when full-time employment fell by 3,700 year-on-year and part-time employment increased by 24,200.  </p><p>  While it is too early to draw definitive conclusions from these figures, they suggest that, as signs of economic recovery take hold, businesses are showing a greater willingness to offer full-time jobs.</p><p>  One of the key initiatives under the Action Plan this year has been the introduction of the JobsPlus scheme, which provides financial support to employers who provide full-time employment to people who have been on the Live Register for 12 months or longer.  Details of this initiative, which is administered by the Department of Social Protection, are available at .</p></reply>

However, CSO data also indicates that significant numbers of Irish migrants have been returning to the country since 2008.  For example, 20,600 Irish people returned to Ireland in the year up to April 2012, and a further 15,700 returned up to April 2013.  Many of them are coming home having gained skills and expertise abroad that we can now capture to strengthen the operation and management of companies based here.  Some have also set up their own businesses and therefore help to support the objectives of the Action Plan for Jobs.  </p><p>  Lack of employment opportunities during the recession has, no doubt, contributed to emigration in recent years.  However, even during the so-called &ldquo;Celtic Tiger&rdquo; years, Irish people chose to emigrate for career or personal reasons.  </p><p>  A recent survey by UCC showed that 47% of Irish emigrants had full time jobs when they emigrated, while just under 40% wanted to travel and experience other cultures.  Others will have moved within their company to postings in other countries as part of a career development or global mobility plan.  Many of these emigrants will gain important skills and insights from working overseas, but may well return to Ireland in the future.  </p><p>  We are also more engaged with those who have emigrated, through the Global Irish Network.  The Government has put in place a mechanism, through the Global Irish Network, to take advantage of the knowledge and expertise of the diaspora, as well as using their personal networks to communicate to others the recovery that is happening in our economy.</p><p>  The diaspora are also active in attracting new companies to Ireland.  Last week, along with the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste, I announced that four companies are establishing new operations in Cork and Dublin under the &ldquo;Succeed in Ireland&rdquo; scheme which harnesses the power of the Irish Diaspora to attract foreign companies that are expanding internationally.  The companies involved in last week&rsquo;s announcement will create a total of 83 new jobs in the economy.  &ldquo;Succeed in Ireland&rdquo;, which is an Action Plan for Jobs initiative, is a practical example of how Irish emigrants are supporting our objective of generating more employment for all who wish to live and work in Ireland.</p></reply>

There is no data available on a month to month basis for each of these sectors.</p><p>  In relation to the Manufacturing sector, the total number of jobs lost in 2012 was 7,987; the number of jobs gained in 2012 was 10,704.  Therefore the total <i>net new full-time jobs</i> created in manufacturing for 2012 is 2,717.</p><p>  The<i> Action Plan for Jobs 2012</i>  included a series of actions to address the Manufacturing Sector, in order to exploit the advances in manufacturing technology, and to build and maintain a strong base of manufacturing activity.  This developed as a result of the challenges facing the sector and of the imperative of supporting the employment levels in that sector.   t is our ambition to create an additional 20,000 jobs by 2016.</p><p>  It is important to retain focus on sustaining what we have, currently there are now 205,700 people directly employed in manufacturing (both full-time and part-time), and a similar number of people employed indirectly: the total supported within the sector is therefore just over 400,000.</p><p>  The Services sector accounts for two thirds of total employment within Ireland. While the majority of service firms are not supported by the State, in respect of agency supported companies, the total number of jobs lost in 2012 was 6,950; the number of jobs gained in 2012 was 13,229.  Therefore the total <i>net new full-time jobs</i> created in the agency supported service industry for 2012 is 6,279.<blockquote>The <i>2013 Action Plan for Jobs</i> outlines a range of sectoral initiatives to facilitate new and established companies grow in the Services sector with particular focus on International Financial Services, Business Process Outsourcing/Shared Services, Education Services, Retail and Wholesale, Tourism, Construction Services and ICT Services.</blockquote>By concentrating on where our competitive advantages lie, in both manufacturing and services, and building on last year's <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i> and the new Jobs plan to be announced in the near future, I am confident that further growth in employment will be achieved.</p></reply>

In Europe, wholesale gas prices have been on an upward curve since 2009. This is driven by events in the Middle East, North Africa, Japan and by the significant growth in demand from China and India. This feeds directly through to retail electricity prices, as most of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity is produced at gas-fired stations.</p><p>  The trend of increasing gas prices in European wholesale markets underlines the need to maintain the focus on continuing to address controllable costs factors, to increase the penetration of indigenous renewables into the Irish energy system and to take action on improving energy efficiency in businesses.  There are supports available to companies from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Environmental Protection Agency and Enterprise Ireland to help enterprises improve their resource efficiency, including energy efficiency.</p><p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, Forf&aacute;s undertook a study to identify changes in the operation of sectoral regulators that would enhance cost competitiveness. The sectors examined in the report are energy, telecommunications, transport, waste and water. The report, which was published in April, also assesses Ireland&rsquo;s cost performance in these sectors relative to our key competitor countries and the drivers of costs, in particular those that are within and outside our control in each of the sectors studied. </p><p>  The study finds that in many cases, policy actions have a more significant impact on cost competitiveness than regulatory changes. The report suggests that there are a number of areas where changes to the operation of sectoral regulators could have a real and positive impact on cost competitiveness. These changes relate to the focus of regulatory mandates, the level and adequacy of resources, enforcement powers and sanctions available to the regulators, and the efficiency of the appeal process.</p><p>  On foot of the Forf&aacute;s report, the Government published a new Policy Statement on Sectoral Economic Regulation on 22nd  July last. Included in this Policy Statement is a commitment that the forthcoming White Paper on Energy will include a regulatory mandate review, with a view to introducing legislation in 2015 for mandate reviews and hierarchy of objectives.  The introduction of a hierarchy of objectives across all regulators will allow for the inclusion of competitiveness objectives, as well as taking account of both business and household consumer issues and competition objectives.</p></reply>

The Report owes its genesis to Section 41A of Industrial Relations Act 1946 (inserted by Section 11 of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012) which provides that reviews of each JLC be carried out by the Labour Court, as soon as practicable after the commencement of the Act, and at least once every 5 years thereafter. The review assisted the Labour Court's  deliberations as to whether any JLC should be abolished, maintained in its current form, amalgamated with another JLC or its establishment order amended and the Labour Court is required to make recommendations to me to this effect.  </p><p>  I have accepted the recommendations contained in the Report.</p><p>  In publishing the Report and outlining the legal steps necessary for implementation of the Labour Court's recommendations, I have been particularly mindful of issues arising as a result of the recent Supreme Court ruling in relation to Registered Employment Agreements (the <i>McGowan </i> case).</p><p>  With the exception of the Agriculture JLC, implementation of the recommendations regarding the scope of the other nine JLCs will be given effect by way of Ministerial Order. As the Agricultural Workers JLC was established under primary legislation (the Industrial Relations Act 1976), an amendment to the Establishment Order requires amending primary legislation. I anticipate that the Establishment Orders necessary to give effect to the recommendations regarding the other nine JLCs will be made over the coming weeks.</p><p>  At the conclusion of this process there will be eight JLCs remaining - and this will drop to seven when the legislation required to implement the recommendation relating to the Catering JLCs is enacted - leaving slightly over half the number that operated at the beginning of the reform process which I pursued on coming to Office. This latest development sits squarely within the context of the change required to improve Ireland's competitiveness by enhancing wage flexibility while also ensuring protection for vulnerable workers.</p><p>  The Industrial Relations Acts provide the legislative framework within which JLCs are established and function, including provisions in relation to the formulation and confirmation of Employment Regulation Orders. While I would urge all parties to engage constructively in the reformed JLC system, in accordance with the voluntarist nature of our industrial relations system in Ireland, I have no powers to compel employers or trade union representatives to participate on any committee or to compel either side to reach agreement.</p></reply>

It is my view that the current system of enforcement of employment rights awards is cumbersome, expensive and, accordingly, not &quot;fit for purpose&quot;.  For this reason, I am proposing to make provision in the Workplace Relations Bill for a range of enhanced compliance measures, including the use of Compliance Notices, Fixed Charge Notices and a new mechanism for enforcing awards of the WRC Adjudicators and Labour Court Determinations.  I am confident that the introduction of these measures will provide for more proportionate, efficient and effective enforcement of employment law.</p><p>The Government is committed to reform of the State&rsquo;s Workplace Relations Services. The system that developed over the last sixty years had become unwieldy and complex; it lacked consistency, involved long delays and in some cases proved expensive for users. I propose to establish a two-tier Workplace Relations structure.  That will involve two statutorily independent bodies replacing the current five. We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court.</p><p>The WRC will replace the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and undertake the first instance functions of the EAT and the Labour Court. The Labour Court will take on the appellate functions of the EAT.  These four bodies, including the EAT, will then be dis-established following the transfer of their functions to the WRC.</p><p>Significant progress has been made to date and I am happy to report that a number of priority actions have been successfully delivered within the target timescale. These include;</p><p>- a new single contact portal called &ldquo;Workplace Relations Customer Services&rdquo; has replaced the five separate entry points resulting in complaints being acknowledged and employers notified of complaints in a much speedier fashion,</p><p>- a Single Complaint Form that deals with over 100 first instance complaints has replaced the 30 forms previously in use,</p><p>- an Early Resolution Service is now seeking to resolve disputes at an early stage without the need for adjudication,</p><p>- responsibility for the Equality Tribunal (but not including the policy functions of the Minister for Justice and Equality concerning equality) was transferred from the Minister for Justice and Equality to me with effect from 1 January, 2013, and</p><p>- the final workplace relations website, which replaces the interim website and the websites of the existing five workplace relation bodies, was launched on 30 September, 2013. A new determinations database and e-complaint facility were also launched on 30 September, 2013.</p><p>While considerable progress has been achieved to date on an administrative basis, completing the proposed reform requires the enactment of detailed legislation. In this regard, significant amount of work has been completed on the preparation of the Workplace Relations Bill to provide the statutory basis for the new structures and processes envisaged.</p><p>Enactment of the Bill will necessitate amendments to 22 primary Acts, 12 specified parts or sections of Acts and 71 statutory instruments.  The Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill has been approved for priority drafting by the Cabinet and was included on the 'A' list for the Government's Autumn Legislative Programme 2013. Engagement is on-going with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and I am committed to the publications and enactment of the legislation at an early stage with a view to having the proposed new structures in place during 2014.</p><p>In the meantime, I intend to continue to progress the reform and bring about further enhancements of the services offered, on an administrative basis in the coming months.</p></reply>

The zero hour protection applies to all employees whose contract operates to require them to be available whether they work on a casual basis or not.  </p><p>  This feature of the legislation covers situations where, for example, an employee is sent home if things are quiet or is requested to be available for work and is not, on the day, asked to work.  Where an employee suffers a loss by not working hours he/she was requested to work or be available to work, the zero hours provisions of the Act ensure that he/she is compensated for 25% of the time which he/she is required to be available or 15 hours whichever is the lesser.  The level of compensation may be impacted if the employee got some work.  An expectation of work does not, however, entitle an employee to compensation.</p><p>  The zero hours provision does not apply to lay-offs, short-time, emergency or exceptional circumstances, employee illness, employee on-call or where the employee is paid wages for making him/herself available for work.</p><p>  Section 17 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 sets out the requirements regarding notification to the employee of the times at which he/she will be required to work during the week. Generally, an employee is entitled to 24 hours' notice of his/her roster for the week, although section 17(4) allows for changes as a result of unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>  Section 19 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 sets out an employee's entitlement to paid annual leave equal to 4 working weeks in a leave year in which he or she works at least 1,365 hours (unless it is a leave year in which he or she changes employment) or one-third of a working week for each month in the leave year in which he or she works at least 117 hours or 8 per cent of the hours he or she works in a leave year (but subject to a maximum of 4 working weeks).</p><p>Zero hour contracts are covered by contract law.  A zero hour contract must be entered into freely between the employer and the employee - it cannot be forced upon an employee.  Zero hour contracts are, normally found in sectors such as retail, healthcare and hospitality. I am very conscious that in<font color="#FF0000"> </font>certain circumstances, they may be of great benefit to<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  both employers and employees.  They allow greater flexibility for both, reducing the employer's pay costs, while workers can decide when and if they want to work.  Such contracts may be preferred by employees who require flexibility to facilitate educational or other personal requirements and banning such contracts could do a disservice to these workers. However this is an area I will keep under review.  </p><p>  The deputy may have noted that recent recommendation of the Labour Court concerning home helps employed by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  This recommendation has been accepted by both sides as a binding recommendation of the Court. The HSE is proceeding to give effect to the recommendation, which will result in the region of 10,000 home helps receiving annualised hours contracts from the HSE.</p></reply>

The latest information from the Quarterly National Household Survey shows an annual increase in employment of 1.8% or 33,800 in the year to the second quarter of 2013, bringing total employment to 1,869,900. This compares with a decrease of 1.3% in the year to Q2 2012. The QNHS data shows that the increase in total employment of 33,800 in the year to Q2 2013 was represented by an increase in full-time employment of 21,600 (+1.5%) and an increase in part-time employment of 12,100 (+2.8%).</p><p>  The signs of recovery in employment - and especially in the creation of more full-time jobs - are supported by the job creation figures of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland for their client companies in 2012. Ireland's enterprise development agency client companies cumulatively created nearly 9,000 net jobs in 2012. Total permanent full-time employment in agency-assisted companies operating in all sectors amounted to 294,785 in 2012, a net increase of 8,975 jobs (+3.1 per cent) on employment levels in 2011 and continues the trend of positive growth in employment following three consecutive years of employment losses between 2007 and 2010. </p><p>  Total full-time employment among Irish-owned companies amounted to 144,964 in 2012, an increase of 3,228 jobs (+2.3 per cent) on the previous year. Among foreign-owned companies, total full-time employment amounted to 149,821 in 2012, an increase of 5,747 (+4 per cent) on the previous year. Foreign-owned part-time employment also increased, by almost 600 jobs (+3.4 per cent) in 2012, whilst Irish-owned part-time employment levels increased marginally.</p><p>  The data from the enterprise agencies confirm that the vast majority of the additional jobs in grant-assisted companies were full-time jobs. We are seeing a pattern as we come out of the recession where initially the first signs of recovery were reflected in an increase exclusively in part time employment. Although job losses continue to be experienced in declining sectors such as construction, the positive results from the enterprise development agencies in 2012 underscores the merits of the Government's focus on innovation and export-driven sectors under the Action Plan for Jobs to create employment.</p><p>  In 2012, the total net full time jobs created in CEB assisted companies was 256 while the total net part time jobs created in CEB assisted companies was 769. </p><p>The Government incentives which we are putting in place are very much geared towards creating full-time employment rather than part-time employment.    is a new employer incentive which encourages and rewards employers who recruit jobseekers on the Live Register to fill full-time positions. The Action Plan for Jobs identifies a number of key targeted sectors in the Manufacturing and Services areas with the potential to create significant sustainable employment. The Action Plan identifies the challenges facing each sector and sets out the measures required to ensure these sectors achieve their potential. Ensuring that all of the measures in the 2013 Action Plan - and in the Action Plans for subsequent years - are implemented will provide the best means of ensuring that employment opportunities are maximised in each sector.</p></reply>

My Department and its agencies are focused on the development and support of internationally trading manufacturing and services firms in Ireland, and have a clear and steady focus on the potential and opportunities that exist and can be created by prioritising innovation and technology as a key driver of success. Enterprise development agencies, Enterprise Ireland (EI), IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, provide a spectrum of innovation and science/ technology development programmes that deliver financial, technical and experiential support to help companies become more innovative, encourage and support competitiveness, and help them grow their sales and exports in order to create a climate in which sustainable employment will grow and expand. </p><p>  The importance of innovation to Ireland has been well recognised by the Government as being crucial to growth in both our indigenous and FDI sectors. It was most encouraging to see that the European Commission's Innovation Union Scoreboard, published in spring 2013, shows Ireland retaining its position among those EU Member States with above average performance in their research and innovation systems. Moreover, the European Commission 'Indicator of Innovation Output', announced in September 2013, shows Ireland, along with Sweden, Germany and Luxembourg as EU Member States getting the most out of innovation.</p><p>  IBM's Global Location Trends Report of 2012 places Ireland: </p><p>- 1<sup>st</sup>   in the world for inward investment by quality and value. </p><p>- 1<sup>st</sup>   in Europe for jobs created in Research and Development. </p><p>- 1<sup>st</sup>   in Europe for investment in the pharmaceutical sector. </p><p>- 2<sup>nd</sup> in Europe and 4<sup>th</sup>   globally for the number of investment jobs per capita. </p><p>  In addition, improvements have taken place in Ireland's cost competitiveness, reflected in the fact that, in 2013, Ireland's international competitiveness ranking improved 3 places from 20<sup>th</sup> in 2011, to 17<sup>th</sup> in the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook for 2013, published past May. Ireland is 6<sup>th</sup>  out of the 25 EU countries featured. </p><p>  These indicators correspond well with the stated ambition of our Taoiseach to make Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business by 2016. </p><p>  The Government's strategy has been to put in place a range of initiatives with the overarching aim of accelerating both the economic and societal return on our public investment in Science, Technology and Innovation. In this way, implementation of Research Prioritisation, underway since March 2012, will see the majority of public research funding aligned with 14 priority areas where we are most likely to get economic and societal returns, particularly in the form of jobs. Another key initiative is the adoption of an Intellectual Property Protocol, which outlines a clear, robust and industry friendly policy for the commercialisation of IP arising from state funded research. As result of this, the central Technology Transfer Office ('cTTO') is currently being established. The aim of the cTTO is to encourage the commercialisation of IP arising from State funded research, with a view to achieving more job creation from our investment in this area. Furthermore, the remit of Science Foundation Ireland has been expanded to cover applied research, aligned with the 14 priority areas to further support the development of research findings into commercial opportunities, further enhancing our job creation potential. </p></reply>

The quality of transitions will determine the quality of a worker's career and the smooth functioning of the labour market. </p><p>  Ireland has a comprehensive body of employment rights legislation which has among its objectives the protection of employees and the quality of transitions between different contractual arrangements. Specific areas covered by employment protection legislation include: </p><p>  - Protection of part-time work</p><p>  - Protection of fixed-term work </p><p>  - Protection of temporary work</p><p>  - Protection of persons engaged by temporary work agencies. </p><p>  - Working time;</p><p>  - Payment of Wages;</p><p>  - Holidays;</p><p>  - National Minimum Wage;</p><p>  - Unfair Dismissal;</p><p>  - Redundancy Payments;</p><p>  - Protection of Young Persons;</p><p>  - Transfer of Undertakings.</p><p>  In general, Irish legislation mirrors the broader EU social protection framework in this area.  </p><p>  The Central Statistics Office (CSO) Live Register Data indicates that in the year to September 2013 the number of casual and part-time workers decreased by 2,795 (3.28%). There was an estimated 82,985 casual and part-time workers on the Live Register in September 2013. This compares with 85,090 casual and part-time workers on the Live Register one year earlier. </p><p>  Opportunities for up-skilling and further career development are essential to advance the inclusive growth objective and can provide individuals who are in part-time work with poor career prospects with the necessary means to maintain their employability and make progress in their career options. </p></reply>

This developed as a result of the challenges facing the sector and of the imperative of supporting the employment levels in that sector. </p><p>  These actions derive from the Forf&aacute;s Strategy for the Manufacturing sector in Ireland, entitled; <i>Making it in Ireland: Manufacturing 2020</i>.  While employment levels have fallen, in common with every other industrialised country in Europe, we still have 205,000 directly employed in manufacturing here and, when account is taken of indirect employment, that means about 400,000 depend on manufacturing for a livelihood.  This impressive statistic highlighted the need for action.  A comprehensive set of actions to develop the sector was therefore set out in this Strategy, with the key items incorporated into the <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2013</i>  . </p><p>Hence the initiation by me of two research projects -  Forfas  <i>&#8220;Making it happen Manufacturing 2020</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>The Future Skills Needs of the Manufacturing Sector to 2020</i>  &#8221; published by the Expert Group on Future Skills.  Both of these reports complement each other and will assist Government in reaching the target of creating an additional 20,000 jobs in manufacturing by 2016.   </p><p>  Forfas produce an Annual Employment Survey which includes yearly figures for jobs created in the manufacturing sector in Agency supported companies. These are not available on a monthly basis. According to the survey, in 2011 there was a total net increase of jobs of 4,439 and in 2012 the increase of new jobs was 2,717.</p><p>  The number of objectives to be delivered under the Strategy by Quarter 3 of 2013 is 13 in total. There were eight up to Quarter 2 all of which have been implemented. The outcome for Quarter 3 is currently being collated and I am confident that the 5 Manufacturing Actions for this Quarter, some of which are the responsibility of other bodies, will also be on target. Several other Actions which are on-going in nature, and not time bound to a specific quarter, are also very satisfactorily in hand. </p><p>  My Department continues to be committed to the delivery of all the Manufacturing Actions in this report.</p></reply>

It operates Business Networks for the Software and Polymer &amp;amp; Plastics sectors and Business Angel Networks. In addition, ITI hold linkage events, for example last month's 'Polymer Connections - A Bridging Borders Event' aimed at organisations in the polymer business or those who use polymers in the manufacture of their end-product, with the aim of finding collaborative business or research partners. This particular event also had a particular focus on the development of clusters in the sector.</p><p>  In this way, I believe that <i>InterTradeIreland</i>, with its all-island trade and business development remit,<i></i>  is well placed to continue to develop networks on the island in key industrial sectors.</p><p>  The<i> Action Plan for Jobs </i>  represents the Government's response to methodically reconfigure our economy so that long-term sustainable jobs are created and we can move to a new economic model and build a sustainable future. </p><p>  The Manufacturing Sector is one of the sectors embraced by the <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i>   and a series of actions to address Manufacturing in order to build and maintain a strong base of manufacturing activity have been included in the Plan for both 2012 and 2013.   This developed as a result of the challenges facing the sector and of the imperative of supporting employment levels. </p><p>  Following my establishment of the <i>Manufacturing Development Forum </i>  in June 2012, the Forum was fully engaged and contributed a range of ideas and suggested priorities to research I commissioned from Forfas.  This has resulted in a very comprehensive analysis, with a new Manufacturing Strategy finalised by Forfas and published earlier this year. </p><p>  The <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i>   process has been shared with relevant parties in Northern Ireland.  In addition, I am glad to say that there is positive on-going engagement between my Department's enterprise agencies and their Northern Ireland counterparts.  Both sets of agencies are aware of each other's offerings and they collaborate closely, where appropriate, on schemes and programmes that will result in job creation and growth.</p><p>  From my own perspective, in relation to North South cooperation, I attend meetings in the Trade and Business development sectoral format of the North South Ministerial Council and, also, of the North South Plenary, which are hosted by either the Taoiseach or the First and Deputy First Ministers. At these meetings there is full engagement with Northern Ministers, and particularly at the sectoral meetings, where I have direct discussions with my NI counterpart, Ms Arlene Foster MLA, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, on a wide range of business issues of mutual interest including job creation generally and specifically in manufacturing.</p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland (EI) is the agency responsible for the development and promotion of the Irish business sector and its focus is on the growth of world-class Irish companies to achieve strong positions in global markets.  On the other hand, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s focus is on attracting foreign direct investment that is value added, requires high skill levels and a sophisticated business environment to maximize their business potential.</p><p>  Job creation and retention is central to all activities undertaken by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  In this context, of course, it is the case that the agencies share similar objectives in the development of the enterprise base and the business-environment in Ireland.  This includes joint work on the growth of new and existing business sectors in Ireland, the support of collaborative R&amp;D among and between Irish-owned companies and multinationals based here, the facilitation of networks and clusters which enhance enterprises&rsquo; ability to innovate, partner and source with each other, and a range of other on-going activities.</p><p>  It is my belief that an increased level of collaboration between the agencies can assist Irish owned business grow, while developing and deepening the impact of foreign direct investment and under the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, I established an Enterprise Ireland/IDA Ireland Senior Management Team, comprising representatives from both organisations, to drive effective collaboration in these areas </p><p>  Among the key initiatives being jointly undertaken by EI and IDA are:</p><p>  - Undertaking a Global Sourcing Initiative targeted at maximising the procurement opportunities for Irish business with foreign owned companies based in Ireland. This undertaking involved an in-depth strategic assessment of the opportunities presented by Global Sourcing, and the development of a joint agency strategy to outline the core actions required by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to advance this agenda. This Strategy has now been agreed and identified opportunities progressed by both agencies.</p><p>  - Collaborating on the Technology Centres initiative which sees Irish and foreign owned companies work together on agreed research programmes. Developing of a joint-agency sectoral approach for the support of selected growth sectors in Ireland (including the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and the MedTech Sectors). </p><p>  - Driving effective collaboration between respective teams in Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland working on the overseas entrepreneurs and emerging businesses agenda.</p><p>  - In addition, both agencies co-operate in the running of joint Trade and Investment Missions abroad and a majority of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s and IDA Ireland&rsquo;s overseas offices are co-located.</p><p>  I am satisfied with the level of co-operation between both agencies and there are no plans to merge the two agencies.</p></reply>

In this respect, the Government is focused on delivering on a practical programme of actions that can achieve positive improvements in the overall operating environment for SMEs and improving access to credit is of course a priority for the Government.</p><p>  Last year I introduced two targeted schemes to support an additional flow of credit into the economy, namely the Microenterprise Loan Fund and the Credit Guarantee Scheme to positively impact on job creation, retention and sustainability.  </p><p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund improves access to credit for microenterprises and facilitates the growth and expansion of viable businesses with less than 10 employees from all industry sectors across the country, which have been refused access to credit from the banks. Support is in the form of  loans for up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises, with viable business propositions, that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks after one full year in operation. </p><p>  The SME Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) supports SMEs who, because of lack of collateral or because of the sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing traditional bank credit. Commercially viable, well performing micro, small and medium enterprises that have a solid business plan and a defined market for their products or services, and can demonstrate their ability to repay the loan are the target of this scheme.  The CGS is currently being independently reviewed to help improve the Scheme for all businesses.   I intend taking appropriate action as a result of the review to ensure use of the Scheme is maximised and a report will be published shortly.</p><p>  In addition to my Department&rsquo;s work in this area, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has set the pillar banks&rsquo; lending targets so that they rise incrementally with expected demand, with targets of &euro;4bn in 2013, increased from &euro;3.5bn in 2012.  The Department of Finance also continues to conduct bi-annual surveys of SMEs to assess credit demand and loan approval rates.</p><p>  I will of course, with my Government colleagues, be keeping the requirements of SMEs at the centre of the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs and the 2014 Budget.</p></reply>

This work was undertaken by Forf&aacute;s and the report, entitled <i>Ireland's Construction Sector: Outlook and Strategic Plan to 2015</i> was published in July 2013 along with the Government response to the report announcing measures to be undertaken.  One such measure was the establishment of a new Construction Sector Consultation and Coordination Group.  This Group will be chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and will provide a forum for engagement with industry, involving relevant Departments and agencies and focusing on key issues for the sector.</p><p>  The Government recognises the need for strong and clear responsibility for the Construction Sector across Government and it has been agreed that regular ministerial level oversight is warranted. To this end, once a quarter the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Jobs will focus specifically on issues relating to the Construction and Property sectors.  Within my own Department Enterprise Ireland plays a role in developing the export potential of the construction sector.  While the UK continues to be the key export market for construction sector clients, Enterprise Ireland are also focusing on a number of key target markets &amp;amp; regions for future growth such as near European markets, Central Gulf States in the Middle East, Australia and Western Canada.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland has in place a range of direct supports to assist established client companies, including those in the construction sector, to enable them to develop and grow their business outside of Ireland.  In addition to working with companies already exporting, Enterprise Ireland is now working with a broader range of companies than heretofore.  The objective is to stimulate greater activity amongst pre-international companies including construction companies and to reorient those demonstrating real growth potential from the domestic to the international market place.</p></reply>

This commitment was expressed and enhanced  by the publication earlier this year of our new Policy on International Development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo; which clearly sets out our vision for a sustainable and just world, and our goals and areas of focus for the coming years.  It also reaffirms the centrality of the aid programme to our foreign policy.  The new policy states clearly our commitment to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA) when economic circumstances permit.</p><p>  Over the past two years, the Government has broadly stabilised the budget for development assistance &ndash; allocating &euro;629 million on ODA in 2012 and &euro;622 million in 2013.  These very significant allocations of public funds clearly demonstrate that we have consolidated the development assistance budget - a major achievement in light of the very difficult fiscal conditions facing the Government.  Equally importantly, in terms of quality, our aid programme remains one of the best in the world and our leadership on the hunger and nutrition agendas continues to be acknowledged internationally.  The Estimates process for Budget 2014 is now in its final stages and is being framed in the context of the Government&rsquo;s overall fiscal consolidation strategy. The Departmental budget allocations for 2014 are a matter for Government decision and will be announced in the Budget Statement next week.</p></reply>

The passport combines the latest security technology with selected<font color="#004080"> </font>imagery in order to produce a passport which represents Ireland, our culture, our history, and our people.  The book includes original artwork and photographs which were commissioned solely for use on the Irish passport.  For security design reasons images were selected which could be printed across consecutive pages.  These include images such as the Cliffs of Moher, the Rock of Cashel and the Samuel Beckett bridge, poetry in Irish, English and Ulster-Scots and representations of Irish sports - Gaelic games, horse-racing and fishing.  The security features also have a uniquely Irish flavour. For instance on the inside cover a highly secure feature used is &#8220;spark&#8221;.  Its iteration on the passport book uses the Br&uacute; na Boinne stone as inspiration and has a moving image emerging when the view-angle is changed on the Newgrange stone.  Another security feature used throughout the book in the form of ogham characters is thermochromic ink, which shifts colour when heat is applied to it.  Each ogham letter also represents a tree and on each page the corresponding leaf to the Ogham on that page can be seen under ultra violet light.  Immigration authorities worldwide have been notified of the new features on the passport through our Embassy network and an information pack detailing over 50 security features on the book has also been distributed to border agencies.</p></reply>

Generally speaking the PPS numbers concerned are those that were historically assigned to a female spouse on marriage by adding the letter 'W' to her husband's PPS number, and<b></b>  were not actively in use for tax purposes.  The issue does not affect 'W' numbers that were active for tax purposes.</p><p>  The deduction at source payment method for Local Property Tax (LPT), which commenced in July 2013, operates by Revenue advising the Department of Social Protection of the individual deductions via electronic file transfer.  The individual case data is transferred between the Revenue and DSP computer systems and is downloaded exactly as provided by the taxpayer.  Revenue cannot validate the accuracy of the information provided, including the status of the PPS number quoted, in advance of the electronic file transfer.  A problem is identified only when a transaction fails, in which case the Department of Social Protection notifies Revenue, which in turn makes contact with the taxpayer. </p><p>  I note the Deputy's suggestion that Revenue should make reference on the LPT Return to the possibility of old style PPS numbers being invalid.  While this is not possible for 2013 and 2014, Revenue will consider it in the future, having regard to the scale of the problem.  In the meantime the LPT Frequently Asked Questions will be updated on the Revenue website with information and clarification on the issue. </p><p>  On the specific case outlined by the Deputy in Question No. [42927], I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the person in question selected a number of different payment options when completing the LPT Return.  This delayed the initial processing of the Return while the LPT team attempted to clarify with her which option she preferred.  Unfortunately, Revenue was not aware that the person's spouse was recently deceased and arranged deduction at source from a Department of Social Protection pension, using the PPS number quoted, leading to the problem outlined above.  In the intervening period, and prior to Revenue making contact with the person, a family member contacted LPT Branch and indicated that the person wanted to change her payment method to a service provider. The LPT team member immediately set up the new payment method as requested.</p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, notwithstanding the delays in setting up a satisfactory payment option, the onus is still on the person to ensure the full LPT liability for 2013 is paid by 31 December 2013.  However, I note the Deputy's comments in regard to her ability to pay the outstanding liability.  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for a system of deferral and partial deferral arrangements for owner-occupiers where there is an inability to pay the tax.  I am advised by Revenue that the person in question, on the basis of the information supplied, appears to qualify for both deferral and partial deferral and Revenue will contact her shortly to establish whether she wishes to avail of either option.</p><p>  I offer my sympathy to the person concerned on her recent bereavement.</p></reply>

As has been previously described, NAMA has adopted a very thorough approach in line with international best practice for the sale of loans, central to which is the open marketing of the loans so as to ensure competitiveness and transparency. </p><p>  For this purpose, panels of loan sale advisors have been selected through a public procurement process for each of the US and Europe.  Where there are indications that a potential loan sale could be a feasible commercial option for NAMA relative to alternative options, an advisor from the relevant panel is selected by mini tender to conduct the loan sale process, which includes the public marketing of the loans.</p><p>  The adviser&rsquo;s role includes the preparation of a data room and the circulation of outline information to potential qualifying interested parties so as to generate as much competition as possible.  The advisor assembles all relevant data relating to the loans, which is made available at the appropriate stage to credible potential purchasers who complete the necessary confidentiality agreements.  The sale process is conducted on the basis of all parties having equal access to the necessary information at the same time so as to make fully informed bids and NAMA will only approve a sale where it is satisfied that the price obtainable represents the best possible return for taxpayers.  </p><p>  As part of the formal sales process, potential purchasers are required to provide an undertaking that they will not engage with the debtor or other obligors at any stage during the sales process without NAMA&rsquo;s pre approval. Both debtors and potential purchasers are aware that the infringement of agreed protocols or undertakings may have an impact on NAMA&rsquo;s decisions as to whether and to whom it sells a particularly portfolio. Furthermore, where NAMA approves the sale of any loan or approves the sale of any secured property by a debtor, it requires a confirmation that the purchaser is not connected to the debtor or other obligors.  </p></reply>

In line with this, NAMA does not engage in fire sales, which is the sale of a loan or asset at below its intrinsic value.   Rather, loans and properties are made available for sale in line with the absorption capacity of the relevant market.</p><p>  Through this approach, NAMA&rsquo;s has, to date, generated &euro;14bn in cash, including &euro;9.4bn from asset and loans sales.  This includes the sale of over 2,000 individual property assets in Ireland and there are currently &euro;1.5bn worth of Irish commercial and residential properties on the market for sale through NAMA debtors and receivers.  The Deputy will also be aware that NAMA will be bringing two portfolios, comprising prime residential and commercial property, with an estimated value of &euro;350-&euro;400m, to the market over the coming weeks, which follows the recent sale by the Agency of an &euro;800m loan portfolio secured almost entirely on Irish property.

NAMA has approved &euro;800 million in advances for projects in Ireland, over &euro;500 million of which has been drawn down.  This is part of NAMA&rsquo;s capital funding plan to advance at least &euro;2 billion for the projects in Ireland over the period to the end of 2016.</p><p>  The types of projects being supported include residential, commercial and retail projects around the country for example The Grange, Stillorgan, Co Dublin which is a mixed residential and commercial development, the Oranmore Town Centre, Co Galway which involves the completion of a commercial development consisting of retail and office space and Phase 2 of Scotch Hall, Drogheda, Co Louth to comprise of additional retails units and leisure facilities. NAMA also plans to advance significant new developments, for example, the development of substantial commercial and residential development in the Dublin Docklands to accommodate the continued expansion of the IFSC and the creation of new business and technology hubs linked to existing companies such as Google and Facebook.  </p></reply>

It is an employer demand-driven programme aimed at developing the skills of the apprentice to meet the needs of industry and the labour market.</p><p>  In recent years, the impact of the economic downturn has led to a collapse in demand for apprentices from employers, particularly in construction related trades.  Significant numbers of apprentices have also been made redundant before completion of their training.   </p><p>  While demand for a number of apprenticeship trades is not expected to recover to pre- recession levels, employment opportunities may emerge in other sectors of the economy not currently covered by the current apprenticeship scheme. </p><p>  Under the Government's Action Plan for Jobs my Department is committed to carrying out a review of the apprenticeship system in 2013.</p><p>  This review is being carried out in order to provide a modern 21st century, realistic and flexible Irish Apprenticeship System, reflective of the relevant skills requirements of industry both in the public and private sectors and potential apprentices including young unemployed jobseekers. </p><p>  The review of the Apprenticeship System is being undertaken in two phases, the first being the preparation of a background issues paper, and the second a public consultation process - which is being managed by an independent group appointed in May 2013. This phase of the review is currently under way.</p><p>  Following the consultation process, the review group shall recommend options recognising the broad spectrum of vocational training available, for the development of the apprentice formation system, and other work based education/training systems, including, as necessary: legislative changes; model of delivery/curriculum/ range of  crafts/ occupations; funding and finance mechanisms; provision changes; staffing and resource implications; governance changes; transition actions resulting from recommendations.</p><p>  It is expected that initial recommendations will be received by end 2013.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department. </p><p>  All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013/14 school year by 15 March, 2013. </p><p>The NCSE published details of all of their allocations for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013/2014 school year in June. These details are now available on the NCSE website, www.ncse.ie, and detail the allocations made for each school on a per county basis.</p><p>  The NCSE subsequently requested all schools to submit outstanding applications for resource teaching and SNA support to the NCSE by 20 September, 2013. These applications are being processed by the NCSE.  </p><p>  Schools can contact the NCSE if they have enrolled children who were not considered at the time that the SNA allocations were made to schools, or where they are seeking a revision to the quantum of SNA support which has been allocated to them. In general, a revision to SNA allocations will only be made in circumstances where schools have enrolled new pupils, or where schools can demonstrate that they do not have sufficient SNA posts to cater for the care needs of all of the qualifying children in their school.</p><p>  As the Deputy's question refers to an individual SNA allocation and to a proposed review of a schools SNA allocation by the NCSE, I have arranged for the Deputy's question to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The aspiration of any examining body, including the SEC, is to preside over a system that is completely error free.  However, it is recognised, across the examination sector, that this will always be an aspiration rather than a completely achievable goal.  In the 2013 State certificate examinations, a  number of mathematics examination papers contained undetected errors which had not come to light before the examination and which  had the potential to impact on candidate answering.  The SEC has accepted that level of error in the 2013 examination papers was unacceptably high and has apologised to the candidates affected.   Specific measures were implemented in the marking process by the SEC so that candidates were not disadvantaged as a result of these errors. </p><p>  In addition to its current quality assurance measures, the SEC will, in future, take the following additional steps to minimise the risk of error.  It will:   - adopt a more formalised approach to strategic work-force planning; review the personnel structures and protocols for paper preparation in each subject; analyse all post print errors with a view to identifying patterns and underlying causes.</p><p>  Regarding the request that the time allocation on the paper be specific, I am advised by the SEC that the time allocation for the examination is printed on the front of the examination paper and also on the published timetable for the certificate examinations and does not change annually.  Each Leaving Certificate Mathematics paper is of two and a half hours' duration and there are no plans to change this.  All examinations are designed so as to be readily answerable by candidates in the allotted time.</p></reply>

This provision remains at 10,575 posts, which means that the same number of SNA posts are being made available this year as has been made available in recent years.</p><p>  In relation to the allocation of resource teaching support for schools, I wish to clarify that in June of this year I authorised the NCSE to maintain the level of resource teaching allocations to be provided for students with special educational needs for the current school year to the 2012/13 levels. There will therefore not be a reduction in resource teaching time for these pupils over the amount of support provided last year. </p><p>  Details of the SNA and resource teaching allocations which have been made to schools by the NCSE to date for the 2013/2014 school year are available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie, which provides details of the SNA and resource teaching allocations for each school on a school by school and per county basis.</p><p>  In order to meet any late demand for resource teaching support which may have arisen between 15th March, 2013 and the start of the school year, the NCSE requested all schools to submit outstanding applications for resource teaching support to the NCSE by 20th September, 2013. A small number of applications have also been received after 20th September, which are still under consideration. The NCSE intend to notify schools of revised resource teaching allocations in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The annual decreases in employment recorded were in the 20-24 (-2,100 or -1.7%) and the 25-34 (-11,900 or -2.3%) age groups. </p><p>  While a decrease in employment is always a cause for concern, the results for these two age cohorts have to be viewed in the light of three critical factors. First, the increased rate of young persons staying on longer in education; secondly, increased emigration; and thirdly, the overall demographic decline for these two cohorts.  It may also be noted that while  the numbers employed in these two cohorts declined over the twelve month period, both age groups experienced small increases in the numbers employed between quarter 1 and quarter 2 of 2013 (by 3.2% and 0.4% respectively).  </p><p>The Government's approach to tackling the issue of jobs growth and unemployment is through the twin strategies deriving from the <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i> and <i>Pathways to Work</i>  .  The primary strategy to tackle all forms of unemployment, including youth unemployment, is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery. In addition to this economic growth and competitiveness strategy there are a number of programmes and services to assist unemployed persons and keep jobseekers close to the labour market. With limited exceptions, these approaches are not age-specific - they are available to all unemployed people on the same basis.</p><p>The 2013 <i>Action Plan for Jobs </i>  contains a total of 333 actions for delivery across all Government Departments and 46 State agencies. Among the measures being delivered are:</p><p><i>- JobsPlus</i>  , a scheme to provide regular cash payments to employers to offset wage costs where they employ people who have been on the Live Register for over 12 months;</p><p>  - the roll-out of 31 Local Enterprise Offices across the country, a network of first-stop shops to deliver world-class services to start-ups and micro-businesses in every county in the country;</p><p>  - a new &euro;175 million Seed and Venture Capital Scheme, aimed at leveraging private sector funds to provide a total of &euro;700million in funding to high-growth Irish companies with the potential to grow employment, as well as mentoring and networks;</p><p>  - a National Step Change Initiative for manufacturing businesses, as part of the Government's plan to supply 20,000 additional jobs in the sector.</p><p><i>Pathways to Work 2013</i>  , the Government's 50-point action plan to fight long-term unemployment builds on the progress made over the past year by the Government to tackle the unemployment challenge.  Increasingly, the Department of Social Protection's referrals  for  job-search assistance and guidance is based on profiling people at the beginning of a spell of unemployment, so as to focus resources on those most in need at an early stage.  </p><p>During our recent EU Presidency, Ireland succeeded in achieving agreement among  Member States on the introduction of a Youth Guarantee. This agreement provides that Member States <i>&#8220;should</i><i>ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.&#8221;</i>   The Department of Social Protection has primary responsibility for implementing the Youth Guarantee in Ireland. An interdepartmental Group chaired by the Department of Social Protection has been established and includes representation from my Department. The group will co-ordinate the production of an implementation plan for the Youth Guarantee which will be submitted to Government in December 2013.  A number of pilot projects will be run across the EU ahead of full implementation of the Guarantee, and a pilot project will be implemented in the Ballymun area in Dublin.</p><p>  Official employment figures recently published by the CSO indicate that the Government's twin strategy approach is making progress. Figures show that the private sector has been adding an average of more than 2,000 jobs per month since the Government published and commenced implementing the Action Plan for Jobs in early 2012.</p></reply>

That Report, in 2001, concluded that, because of high costs and limited potential industrial development returns, membership should not be a priority.  Since then, of course, the severely depleted resources which this Government inherited has meant that there is an even greater imperative to ensure that publicly funded research and development will yield the maximum benefits for the country - most particularly in terms of downstream jobs.<br /><br />  As you are no doubt aware, the Government's priority in the area of science, technology and innovation is to implement the recommendations of the National Research Prioritisation Exercise which will see the majority of public research funding aligned with 14 priority areas where we are most likely to get economic and social returns, particularly in the form of jobs.  The Steering Group which undertook the exercise included representatives of the enterprise sector and its terms of reference specifically required that it take account of complementary developments at EU level and other international initiatives.  Research in the area of particle physics was not identified as a priority nor was there any recommendation that Ireland should join CERN. <br /><br />  The costs of full membership of CERN are understood to be over &euro;10 million per annum.  In addition to substantial fees for any type of membership, it is important to note that significant extra amounts of expenditure would be necessitated in order to ensure that Ireland benefits fully from membership. While other associate membership options may be available involving lesser amounts, the issue remains that a decision about joining CERN must take into consideration the opportunity costs involved, as payment of any fees would mean that less funding is available for our existing research priorities.  <br /><br />  Should budgetary circumstances change over the next few years, the question of membership of CERN could be reviewed again but only if there is a compelling business case from a cost/benefit viewpoint.  Also, the selected national research priority areas will be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure their continued relevance and to also ensure that new opportunities are identified.</blockquote></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-10-10a.266.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013101000056#WRK01900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95, 96 and 101 to 103, inclusive, together.</p><p>The most up to date figures available for job creation in the manufacturing and services sector are included in the Forf&aacute;s Employment Survey 2012.  There is no data available on a month to month or county basis for each of these sectors in the survey.</p><p>Please see the following table setting out the breakdown of Job gains and losses as requested.</p><p>While manufacturing has been an important sector in Ireland since the 1960&rsquo;s, there has been a noticeable decline in numbers employed in this sector. This is not necessarily surprising, and it echoes what has been happening in most developed economies. A similar trend has also been experienced in other industrialised countries such as Germany, UK, USA, Netherlands and Korea. We still have 205,000 directly employed in manufacturing here and, when account is taken of indirect employment that means about 400,000 depend on manufacturing for a livelihood.  This impressive statistic highlighted the need for action.</p><p>Hence the initiation by me of two research projects -  Forf&aacute;s's <i>&quot;Making it happen Manufacturing 2020</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>The Future Skills Needs of the Manufacturing Sector to 2020</i> &quot; published by the Expert Group on Future Skills.  Both of these reports complement each other and will assist Government in reaching the target of creating an additional 20,000 jobs in manufacturing by 2016.</p><p>The <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2012</i>   also included a series of actions for the Manufacturing Sector and noted that Ireland is well positioned to exploit the advances in manufacturing technology, and to build and maintain a strong base of manufacturing activity. Ireland currently has a very diverse range of manufacturing businesses with many exciting and innovative companies in high-technology and emerging sectors.  We are well placed to take advantage of our current position to build on this expertise in both the FDI and indigenous companies.</p><p>The <i>2013 Action Plan for Jobs </i>also<i> </i>outlines a range of sectoral initiatives to facilitate new and established companies grow in the Services sector with particular focus on International Financial Services, Business Process Outsourcing/Shared Services, Education Services, Retail and Wholesale, Tourism, Construction Services and ICT Services.</p><p>In respect of the contribution of innovation and technology to job creation in these sectors, my Department, and the relevant State Agencies under its remit, have a clear and steady focus on the potential and opportunities that exist and can be created by prioritising innovation as a key driver of success. Enterprise development agencies, Enterprise Ireland, IDA and Science Foundation Ireland, provide a spectrum of innovation and technology development programmes that deliver financial, technical and experiential support to help companies become more innovative, encourage and support competitiveness, and help them grow their sales and exports in order to create a climate in which sustainable employment will grow and expand.  It is not possible to separate out the precise contribution of innovation and technology elements from other factors.</p><p>All of our businesses face similar Competitiveness issues including the manufacturing and services sector.  It is clear that, arising from greater globalisation, reduction of tariff barriers and the ease of transporting goods, the nature of industry and the location of specialisations will be changing.  There will be an inevitable movement of production of lower cost, less specialised goods towards cheaper labour economies, e.g. in Asia.  This is part of a wider global pattern.</p><p>Last year, I requested Forf&aacute;s to undertake research into a number of factors impacting on Ireland's international competitiveness, to benchmark these factors and to develop proposals to systematically reduce excessive key business costs or delays.</p><p>That wider Forf&aacute;s research indicates that in the period between January 2000 and April 2008, Ireland suffered a 22.5% loss in competitiveness.  However, in the period from April 2008 to July 2012, Irish cost competitiveness improved by 19% as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices. Prices have now fallen back to levels last seen in 2002. The research benchmarks Ireland&rsquo;s performance against a number of our key trading partners, as well as the OECD and Euro area averages.  Positive trends are emerging in relation to some key cost factors, including Labour costs, where our labour cost competitiveness continues to improve; Construction and new rental costs, which have fallen significantly since the collapse of the property bubble; and the cost of most business services, which have fallen to, or below, 2006 levels.</p><p>The numbers employed in manufacturing have stabilised over the last two years.  It is noteworthy that exports of manufactured goods are continuing to rise despite a difficult environment.  Even more heartening is the fact that exports by the Services sector are going from strength to strength, with an 11% increase in the first nine months of 2012. In addition the contribution of manufacturing to GDP has risen significantly over the last decade.</p><p>Despite the considerable challenges in an internationally competitive environment, there is considerable potential for the manufacturing sector in Ireland, as we are strongly placed to create opportunities and employment in many higher- value sub sectors, for example chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and food, amongst others.</p><p>The provision of adequate and appropriate finance for both the manufacturing and services sectors is crucial, but as you will appreciate, EU grant aid is a less significant factor now than in former years. Obviously all potential sources of grant aid are pursued.</p><p>I am confident that all these measures, combined with other Government initiatives, including those to improve Competitiveness generally, will provide strong practical support to these important areas resulting in job creation.</p><p>The total number of jobs lost and gained, and the total of <i>net</i> new full-time jobs created in agency supported <i>manufacturing</i>   companies, for the period 2006-2011 is set out as follows.</p><p><table><tr><th>-</th><th>2006</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th></tr><tr><td>Job Gains </td><td>34,497</td><td>28,888</td><td> 23,664 </td><td>  13,962 </td><td> 20,388 </td><td> 21,038 </td><td>10,704</td></tr><tr><td>Job Losses</td><td>-21,369</td><td>-24,099</td><td> -30,351 </td><td> -47,325 </td><td> -25,802 </td><td> -16,599 </td><td>-7,987</td></tr><tr><td>Net Change</td><td><br />13,128</td><td>4,789</td><td> -6,687 </td><td> -33,363 </td><td> -5,414 </td><td> 4,439 </td><td>2,717</td></tr></table></p><p>The following provides details of gains and losses in the <i>services</i> sector in agency supported companies.</p><p><table><tr><th>-</th><th>2006</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th></tr><tr><td>Job Gains</td><td>11,527</td><td>10,254</td><td>9,078</td><td>5,162</td><td>9,025</td><td>8,723</td><td>16,949</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th>-</th><th>2006</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th></tr><tr><td>Job Losses</td><td>-5,663</td><td>-7,356</td><td>-7,267</td><td>-12,973</td><td>-7,511</td><td>4,970</td><td>10,161</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Foreign owned firms contribute substantially to Ireland's exports, jobs, expenditure in the Irish economy and to Exchequer funds.  FDI plays a key role in stimulating the development of new sectors in Ireland, in enhancing our research, development and innovation performance, in contributing to balanced regional development and in accelerating the achievement of critical mass within sectors.</p><p>  At the end of 2012, there were 152,785 people employed in over 1,000 IDA Ireland client companies.  This, in turn, results in another 100,000 spin off jobs in the Irish economy.  The net effect is that 1 in 7 Jobs in the Irish economy is accounted for by FDI.</p><p>  There are a number of factors which are considered by potential investors before deciding to locate here. These include:</p><p>- A pro-business and technologically advanced environment;</p><p>- An attractive corporate tax rate;</p><p>- An educated and talented workforce;</p><p>- A blend of appropriate skill sets;</p><p>- Access to world class infrastructure - road access to key cities, ports and international airports;</p><p>- a range of affordable, state-of-the-art property solutions;</p><p>- a track record of success coupled with the right attitude and ambition of its people.</p><p>  In seeking to win FDI, IDA Ireland constantly promotes the availability of these factors to potential investors.  Indeed, Ireland's performance in attracting FDI has been recognised internationally and these international comparisons are impressive.  The 2012 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook and IBM's Global Location Trends Report for 2012<b></b> have classified some of Ireland's strengths, with Ireland ranked:</p><p>- 1<sup>st</sup> in the world for availability of skilled labour, flexibility of workforce, investment incentives and attitudes towards globalisation;</p><p>- 1<sup>st</sup> in the world for inward investment by quality and value;</p><p>- 1<sup>st</sup> in Europe for jobs created in Research and Development;</p><p>- 1st in Europe for investment in the pharmaceutical sector;</p><p>- 2<sup>nd</sup> in Europe and 4<sup>th</sup> globally for the number of investment jobs per capita; and</p><p>- 4th for corporate tax rates.  </p><p>  Amid significant economic challenges globally and locally, IDA Ireland achieved a strong FDI performance in 2012.  There were 145 individual investments, with over 40% from companies coming to Ireland for the first time. 12,722 gross job gains were generated with 6,570 net new jobs gains across a broad range of sectors.  Helping FDI clients to transform their operations within Ireland has also led to a significant reduction in employment losses, producing a strong year overall.</p><p>  Despite this success, Ireland faces a highly competitive landscape, with notable strong competition for FDI arising from the UK, the Netherlands and Switzerland, in particular.  Nevertheless, IDA Ireland's performance in the first 6 months of 2013 has been solid with 70 FDI investments, with potential to create in the region of 7,000 jobs being secured.</p></reply>

It operates as a significant conduit for discourse between representatives of education, enterprise and policy makers, on behalf of Government.  The Group is composed of representatives of business, employees, education, training (F&Aacute;S, Skillnets), Government Departments (Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Department of Education and Skills and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform) and State agencies (IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland).</p><p>  In addition to the regular meetings of the EGFSN, the group takes part in dialogue with education and training providers on an on-going basis as follows:</p><p>- specific steering group are set up for each report the Group releases, which include representatives from education outside of the EGFSN membership appropriate to the work and wider consultation with relevant stakeholders from education also take place in that context;</p><p><i>- the High Level ICT Skills - Action Plan</i>  was developed in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science, the Irish Software Association, Enterprise Ireland, IDA and Forf&aacute;s following the EGFSN analysis of the recruitment challenges in 2012 with recommendations included measures to double the output of honours level graduates from the third level sector by 2018 and, in conjunction with industry, provide conversion courses (760 places in 2012 and 770 places in 2013) to fast-track into ICT, honours level graduates from other disciplines;</p><p>- the EGFSN has written the guidelines that accompany the Springboard call each year in 2011, 2012 and 2013 to ensure that those tendering to provide high level education places for jobseekers are focused on the areas of current and future skills needs as identified by employers in the EGFSN research;</p><p><i>- Guidelines for the Alignment of Further Education Programmes with Skills Needs of Enterprise</i>   - Forf&aacute;s undertook this research with a view to improving how the Further Education sector can better respond to current and future skills needs.  Based on the work of the EGFSN, the report identifies the skills requirements of enterprise relevant to the Further Education sector across NFQ levels 1-6.  This includes sectoral and occupational skills needs, in addition to generic skills requirements for those sectors/occupations and highlights recommendations (e.g. new/improved programmes; programmes designed directly with enterprises; wider availability of work placements; skills for employability) made to address these gaps.</p><p>  There was an emphasis on ICT in the EGFSN/Forf&aacute;s <i>Guidelines for Higher Education Providers on Current and Future Skills Needs of Enterprise</i> for the Springboard 2013 Call.  Research work is currently underway by the EGFSN, in consultation with businesses, to quantify the high level ICT skills demand to 2018 and propose recommendations to bridge any identified gaps.</p><p>  In April this year, I launched, jointly with my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, the Forf&aacute;s/EGFSN <i>Future Skills Requirements of the Manufacturing Sector to 2020</i>   in parallel with the Government's Manufacturing Strategy.  These studies were in response to the Government's focus on addressing challenges facing the manufacturing sector in Ireland and targeting specific actions in support of the sector.  The EGFSN assessed the skills and competencies needed by the sector in the report.  A further expansion of the Springboard initiative this year includes a focus on programmes for jobseekers in skills areas in manufacturing -for example, engineers in validation, polymer, supply chain and automation, and polymer and plastics technicians.  F&Aacute;S in conjunction with the third level education sector is developing a range of initiatives which are designed to meet the skills identified at pre-craft, craft and technician levels.  Currently, these initiatives are focused on the North-West region which contains a strong cluster of precision engineering companies, but the initiative will be extended to other regions as appropriate.</p><p>  Skillnets have incorporated engineering skills into its new call for Networks and will address the scope and scale of training for the manufacturing sector and more specifically the area of supervisory development needs identified by companies.  In addition, the Manufacturing report has been circulated to all VECs and higher education institutions for their response to those recommendations that are focused on amendments to their existing or future provision.</p><p>  In addition to the work undertaken by the EGFSN, Forf&aacute;s represents my Department on a number of education and training groups concerned with aligning education with the requirements of the workplace including the Project Maths Implementation Group and the Strategic Review of Further Education and Training of the Unemployed.</p></reply>

The unemployment rate for young people fell from 33% to 29.6% over the same period.  This downward movement in youth unemployment in Ireland differs from the trend in the EU as a whole, where youth unemployment has continued to rise.  However, youth unemployment continues to present a major challenge for Ireland as it does for most other EU Member States. </p><p>  The latest CSO figures also indicate that the long term unemployment rate is also showing some signs of improvement, having decreased from 9.2% to 8.1% over the year to Q2 2013, a drop of 24,500 people.  Long term unemployment now accounts for 58.2% of total unemployment, compared with 61.8% a year ago.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity through the Action Plan for Jobs.  In addition, the Government recognises the need for measures to support the unemployed and keep jobseekers close to the labour market.  In this context, the major elements of the Government&rsquo;s response are set out in Pathways to Work, which is aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of the job vacancies that are created as the economy recovers are filled by people from the Live Register - with a particular focus on those who are long-term unemployed or at risk of long-term unemployment.  </p><p>  Pathways to Work has a target of moving 75,000 people into employment by the end of 2015 through programmes such as JobBridge, Springboard, Momentum and the ICT Action Plan, which are delivered by the Departments of Social Protection and Education and Skills.  The JobsPlus initiative, which encourages employers to recruit people who have been unemployed for 12 months or more, was also launched on 8th July last.  </p><p>  The Department of Social Protection is also working with relevant Departments, including my own, to produce a concrete plan for implementation of the Youth Guarantee in Ireland, for consideration by the Government before being transmitted to the European Commission by the end of the year.  </p><p>  My Department is also keen to support young entrepreneurs and, in this context, initiatives such as Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Competitive Start Fund and New Frontiers Programme, along with the Microenterprise Loan Fund, will all contribute to supporting young entrepreneurs.  The Government will also publish a Policy Statement on Entrepreneurship, including youth entrepreneurship, this year.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s aim is that, by continuing the process of transforming our economy through the Action Plan for Jobs, we can increase employment opportunities for all those who are seeking work.</p></reply>

Innovation and technology are elements of a series of inputs which are requisite for a job to be sustained in commercial enterprise &ndash; companies need to identify markets to sell their goods and services, they need to have finance in order to invest in capital and human resources, they need to put in place the delivery and production capacity which meets their customers&rsquo; needs and they need to focus on the development of new and improved products, processes and services which can ably compete in international markets.  </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s enterprises must be able to competitively differentiate themselves in global markets so that they can win sales and create sustainable employment.  A critical element of the Government&rsquo;s strategy is to provide supports to help companies to grow global sales and local employment through the most important economic differentiator; innovation.  My Department and the State Agencies under its remit are focused on the development and support of internationally trading manufacturing and services firms in Ireland in this regard.  The Action Plan for Jobs emphasises the significance of innovation and the use of technology as critical drivers of job creation in Ireland while seeking to maximise their impact in the coming years. Substantial ongoing investment has been made in Ireland&rsquo;s national innovation ecosystem and in the supports that build the innovative capability in Irish enterprise.  In tandem with this approach it is recognised that substantial international expertise and important sources of non-exchequer funding are available via EU research initiatives. </p><p>  The Seventh EU Framework Programme for Research and Development (FP7), with a budget of &euro;55 billion for the period 2007 to 2013, is the EU&rsquo;s main instrument for funding research and development in Europe. FP7 offers Ireland's SMEs, multinationals, and research institutions valuable opportunities to participate in high-calibre research collaborations with our European counterparts. Enterprise Ireland is the Irish agency responsible for helping Irish companies and third level researchers to participate in FP7.  </p><p>  The most recent statistics available from the European Commission show that the total amount of funding received from FP7 to date by Irish research organisations and companies is &euro;572 million.  We are therefore well on track to achieve the target amount of funding from FP7 of &euro;600 million. This funding has provided a considerable increase in the innovative capability of Irish academics and industry over and above existing exchequer investments in this area.  </p><p>  The innovation, technology and financial support from the European Commission to Irish research organisations, including companies, ultimately results in more sustainable jobs and leads to business expansion and increased job creation over the long term.  I am confident that our research organisations and companies have the capability to continue this trend under FP7&rsquo;s successor EU Research and Innovation programme  -  Horizon 2020, covering the years 2014 &ndash; 2020.</p></reply>

This decision to reform State pension was taken in the context of changing demographics and increasing longevity.  In 2014, State pension transition will cease and the State pension age will be standardised at 66.  This will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that significant numbers of people are on social welfare schemes well in advance of State pension age.  For example, in 2012, 11,130 people were awarded SPT and of these, 12.5% (1,390) came from employment with 50% (5,635) coming from another social welfare payment including illness related schemes, indicating that quite a number of number of people are already in the social welfare system in advance of State pension age.</p><p>  In relation to those who are already retired through early retirement schemes or through redundancy  in advance of State pension age, social welfare schemes are payable up to State pension age.  Each application for any social welfare scheme is assessed on its own merit in terms of qualifying criteria and contribution history.  Where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, the means tested assistance payment may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions including a means test.</p><p>  The main social welfare payments available to those who leave employment before pension age are jobseekers benefit and job seekers allowance.  Persons who qualify for a job seekers payment who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).  With the changes to State pension, social welfare support will continue to be available and targeted at those most in need.</p></reply>

The Department is currently examining the operation of all its services in the context of the Pathways to Work commitments and the development of Intreo services nationally.  The Pathways to Work Programme represents a significant reform in the social welfare system and highlighted the need for the Department to focus its resources on the provision of opportunities, supports and assistance to unemployed people.  The Department is intensifying its level of engagement with the unemployed, in particular, those who are, or become, long-term unemployed.   The new Intreo service offers practical, tailored employment services and supports for jobseekers, a model which is currently being rolled out across the country.  It is expected that three hundred staff will be redeployed to activation work from within the Department&rsquo;s existing resources by the end of the year.</p><p>  Overall, this is resulting in a rebalancing of resources across the Department&rsquo;s range of activities including the relocation of some staff to main centres, primarily Intreo offices, which will provide a full range of services,  including the CWS and these will,  in general, be available in one location.  While there has been no closure of local or branch offices in the last two years, some 300 CWS clinics across the country have been re-structured during 2012 and 2013 as well as a small number of former F&Aacute;S offices.  This included offices where limited weekly CWS public clinics were held, in some cases for only one to two hours per week.</p><p>  Where the community welfare service has been re-structured, alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with on-going access to the supports provided by the service.  In general, this means that the frequency of available public clinics will be increased.  The staffing needs for all areas within the Department are continuously reviewed, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department and that the services provided are reconstituted, where necessary, to meet the changing needs of Irish society.</p></reply>

My Department has been in constant contact with the organisation since its establishment.  As a result of discussions with my Department, ESG was restructured in 2007 and my Department has sanctioned over &euro;780,000 in grant aid to the organisation since then.  Towards the end of 2011, my Department became aware that discussions were ongoing between ESG and Gaelscoileanna with regard to amalgamating the two organisations.  The funding that my Department sanctioned for ESG in 2012 and 2013 was conditional on this amalgamation taking place. My understanding of the current position is that the amalgamation has not as yet occurred and that ESG is considering disbanding the organisation.</p><p>  In the current economic climate, it is more essential than ever to achieve efficiencies from Exchequer funding.  In this context, it is worth noting the decision of the North South Ministerial Council on 10 July when it approved the new funding arrangements, to replace Foras na Gaeilge's existing core funding model, with the delivery by 6 lead organisations operating on an all-island basis of various strategic priorities, including Irish-medium education.  It is envisaged that the lead organisation which will deliver this strategic priority will serve all Irish-medium schools, both inside and outside the Gaeltacht.  Any organisation may apply under Foras na Gaeilge's selection procedures which are to be published in due course.</p></reply>

My Department has issued guidance to registration authorities to assist them in managing the registration process.   </p><p>  For the purpose of preparing the register, each registration authority is required to make house to house or other sufficient inquiry in their registration area. As part of this process, they may require individuals to give any information in their possession which the authority needs and they may require individuals to produce documentary evidence, including a birth certificate or a certificate of naturalisation, or to make a statutory declaration regarding their age or citizenship.   </p><p>  The publication of the draft register in November each year in preparation for the coming into effect of the register on 15 February following allows for corrections to be made.  The public is invited to check the draft during this period so that people can make sure that they are correctly registered.  Any errors or omissions in the draft should be brought immediately to the attention of the registration authority.  Claims for the addition or deletion of names are ruled on by the county registrar who is a legally qualified court officer.  The ruling is made in public and any person may attend and give evidence. </p><p>  Also, if a person is not included in the register of electors currently in force but considers that he or she qualifies for registration - for example if they have come of age to register or if they have changed address - the person may apply for entry in the supplement to the register which is open year round subject to certain practical limits in the weeks before a polling day.</p></reply>

The position is that, following on from the successful restructuring of my Department&rsquo;s local office network, which reduced the number of local offices from 58 to 16, my Department has decided to centralise the administrative support currently provided in the local offices into two offices, Cavan and Portlaoise. </p><p>  The decision to centralise the administrative support is based on a review by the Department of the business processes and procedures and, in particular, the administrative support requirements, in its remaining Local Offices. Arising from this review, the Department introduced a number of significant changes earlier this year to the procedures in relation to the implementation of controls in the context of the TB eradication programme. These changes and, in particular, the decision not to take up passports from restricted herds and to abolish the movement permit requirement for clear cattle in restricted herds, combined with the eradication of Brucellosis and a substantial reduction in the incidence of TB in the country, has significantly reduced the administrative staffing requirement in the local offices. In light of these developments, the review concluded that further significant efficiencies in terms of the number of administrative staff required will accrue from the centralisation of administrative support in one or more centralised office(s).</p><p>  My Department is in the process of implementing this recommendation and has already transferred the administrative functions out of a number of local offices, including Clonakilty, Limerick and Tipperary.  The transfer of the administrative functions out of other regional offices, including Roscommon, will be considered in light of the availability of opportunities to redeploy the staff concerned to support other critical public services.</p><p>  Centralising administrative procedures will enable my Department to reduce the number of administrative staff it requires to support Veterinary Office operations and, accordingly, the cost of providing its services. This is in line with Government policy. In addition, the centralisation of administrative functions will facilitate the re-deployment of staff from the regional offices to other State agencies and, thereby, enable the Government to provide services through these agencies more efficiently. </p><p>  I would like to emphasise that the centralisation of the administrative functions of the local offices should not negatively impact upon local access and services for local customers and experience to-date indicates that there has been no negative impact on the services provided by these offices. The Department vets, inspectors and technical officers will remain in place at these offices to service our clients across all of the schemes that are provided from our Regional Offices.  In view of this, I am satisfied that frontline services will be fully maintained and public access for all of the Departments stakeholders will continue to be available at the 16 regional offices, including Roscommon. </p></reply>

My Department is bound, under EU Regulations, to maintain the accuracy the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), which underpins the processing of applications under these Schemes as well as REPS and AEOS.</p><p>  At the start of each year, my Department issues colour maps of all land parcels declared by farmers in the previous year together with a covering letter.  In that letter, farmers are reminded to examine each map carefully and to identify and exclude from their application all ineligible features such as buildings, farmyards, scrub, roadways, forests, lakes etc. included in the land parcels.  There is, therefore, an onus on all farmers to ensure that the area of land declared by them as eligible for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes is accurate.  These requirements are also made clear in the Terms and Conditions of the Schemes, which accompanies the pre-printed application form issued to all farmers at the commencement of the application period each year.  In view of the size and structure of farm enterprises in Ireland, farmers are fully aware of all of the non-eligible areas of their holdings.</p><p>  In addition to any changes submitted by farmers, in order to insure the integrity of the LPIS, and in line with the EU conditions governing the payment of funds, my Department continuously reviews the eligibility of lands claimed by farmers for the Single Payment Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes.</p><p>  In line with this position, all lands claimed under Direct Payment Schemes in respect of the 2009 &ndash; 2012 scheme years are currently subject to ongoing review for eligibility purposes.  As this work is ongoing, it is not possible to give a county by country breakdown at the present time.  As a result of this phase of this review, payments made to farmers in respect of claimed areas, which were found to be ineligible, must be reimbursed. In such circumstances, farmers are advised that they can either refund the over-payment directly to my Department, or, alternatively, the overpayment can be recouped from their next payment(s) due from my Department.  Such reviews can only be undertaken when up-to-date imagery becomes available to my Department.  During the cross-checks undertaken it is necessary to verify that the ineligible feature (e.g. a house) was in existence in the years when over-claims of eligible areas are established.  Where ineligible features are identified, farmers are issued with maps of the re-digitised land parcel and are advised of the right of appeal. </p><p>  Applicants will be entitled to have their case reviewed by submitting their appeal on the form provided by my Department.  If they are not satisfied with the outcome of the review, they can appeal their case to the independent chaired Land Eligibility Appeals Committee.  This Committee will consist of an independent Chairman and Appeals Officers from the Agriculture Appeals Office.</p></reply>

Budget 2013 saw the extension of key reliefs that were already in place for young new entrants (such as the 100% relief from Stamp Duty and the 100% stock relief for Young Trained Farmers).  The Deputy will also be aware that changes were made to retirement relief in Budget 2012 to encourage inter-generational land transfers.  It should also be noted that there has been no change to the very important 90% agricultural relief on Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT).  This means that farms worth up to &euro;2.25 million will continue to be fully exempt from CAT with regard to transfers to a child.</p><p>In addition, a new restructuring relief was announced in the 2013 budget.  Re-structuring is essential for us to meet the Food Harvest 2020 targets.  We need to use land more productively and encourage more young farmers to make the best use of the land.  An EU Commission study found that &lsquo;<i>younger [farm] managers tend to perform better than the EU average, with 46% more area and 57% more economic potential for 21% more labour force.&rsquo; </i>.  The new restructuring relief on Capital Gains Tax will give young farmers an opportunity to consolidate their holdings and increase efficiency.</p><p>Measures to provide targeted support to young farmers are included the final CAP reform agreement.  I strongly support the proposal for a top-up for young farmers under Pillar 1 of the CAP, and indeed Ireland was one of the first countries to suggest this measure in the negotiations.</p><p>I am delighted that the number of applicants for Teagasc courses has greatly increased over the last two years.  Teagasc has responded well to this demand and have introduced new courses to cater for a variety of needs.  For example Teagasc launched a new Professional Diploma in Dairy Farm Management (Level 7) in association with University College Dublin (UCD).  Teagasc have also developed recently a new Level 6 Specific Purpose Certificate in Farm Administration course to help meet the training requirements for full-time or part-time farmers.</p><p>I am hopeful therefore that the measures that I have introduced will encourage more young people into farming and address the age profile imbalance in Irish farming.</p></reply>

They impede the operational functioning of a hospital and expose patients concerned, predominantly older persons, to the inappropriate risks of longer acute hospital stays e.g. hospital acquired infections.  Higher numbers of delayed discharges can also be associated with extended waits in the Emergency Department.   </p><p>  My Department and the HSE remain seriously concerned regarding the situation in relation to delayed discharges and consider it essential that this issue is successfully addressed. A number of actions have been initiated in this regard.  These include the establishment by me of a Ministerial task force to deliver substantial improvements in delayed discharges, including a review of the operational arrangements associated with the &lsquo;Fair Deal&rsquo; scheme.  Senior personnel have been tasked with improving cross hospital-community process issues, focusing first on the &lsquo;longest waiting&rsquo; delayed discharges (&amp;gt;100 days).  The aim is to remove all local barriers to discharge and identify those matters which require action at a national level.  The management teams have been making good progress with respect to these tasks and it is intended to quickly roll-out this structure to all areas.  </p><p>  The HSE increased allocations of Fair Deal approvals, temporarily prioritised Fair Deal referrals for patients in acute hospitals, including referrals to  long stay facilities from acute hospitals for older persons with complex needs and also targeted appropriate homecare packages for older persons in acute hospitals experiencing significant delayed discharges.  New reporting systems and processes have also been introduced.  A HSE web-based database that allows tracking at patient level (on an anonymous basis) is in the implementation phase in a number of hospital sites.  In addition, the categorisation of reasons for delay has been reviewed.  The data captured through the web-based system will facilitate revised metrics for each hospital.  There will be a greater emphasis on reducing the bed days lost to delayed discharges, with targets established on a site-by-site basis.  </p><p>  As the issues raised regarding the number of delayed discharges and the reasons for these delayed discharges from Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown are operational matters for the HSE, I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to this.</p></reply>

I am confident that all necessary steps are being taken to deliver the new funding model in line with this target date.  </p><p>  Progress has been made on a number of areas in this regard including completion of a &ldquo;State of Readiness&rdquo; review by an internationally recognised expert in MFTP.  The purpose of this review was to assess the health system&rsquo;s capacity to roll out MFTP in public hospitals.  I am happy to report that the assessment concludes that the Irish health system exhibits the key components required for a MFTP funding system and is in a strong position to begin phased implementation of MFTP in line with the target date of 2014.  </p><p>  The Department and HSE have also been working towards the establishment of a National Pricing Office from January 2014.  This Office will be comprised of staff working in the HSE Casemix Programme and the ESRI Health Information and Research Division.  Its main functions will be to set the national Diagnosis Related Group prices, on which the MFTP system is based, and manage the HIPE dataset.  </p><p>  Preparations are now being made for the commencement, in November, of a shadow funding exercise in a selection of hospitals from across the hospital groups.  This exercise will involve hospitals continuing to receive their existing base budgets.  However, a process will be put in place to: (i) compare on a systematic basis, actual hospital activity against baseline activity targets; and (ii) inform hospitals of what the financial implications of any variance from the targets would be in a &ldquo;live&rdquo; system, without changing budgets during the shadow period.  This will be a valuable learning exercise for the hospitals concerned.</p><p>  I regard MFTP as a key building block in the move to Universal Health Insurance and I am committed to supporting MFTP fully as it develops.</p></reply>

It is important to remember that the requirement for such a test has been the case since 1989.</p></reply>

I do not have any plans at this time to provide for the use of such devices in legislation. On the more general issue of speed limiters, the European Commission recently conducted a study on the implementation of the Directive on speed limitation devices and its possible extension to light goods vehicles and cars. Ireland took the position, expressed through the Road Safety Authority, that there is currently no justification for extending the scope of the Directive to other categories of vehicle. </p><p>  As regards alcohol interlocks, Action 121 of the Road Safety Strategy 2013 to 2020 provides for undertaking a cost benefit analysis for the use of alcohol interlocks as a sanction for repeat offenders.  The lead agency responsible for the implementation of the Action is the Road Safety Authority and the completion date for the Action is the first quarter of 2014.</p></reply>
