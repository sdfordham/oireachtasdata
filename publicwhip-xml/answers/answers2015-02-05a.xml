Looking at individual schemes, I am pleased to confirm for the Deputy that:    </p>  <p>- The number of participants on the rural social scheme (RSS) is expected to remain at around 2,600 in 2015 at a cost of some &euro;45 million;   </p>  <p>  - The projections for T&uacute;s &ndash; the community work placement initiative &ndash; are that at least 7,500 jobseekers will be maintained on the scheme during 2015 at a cost of some &euro;113 million; and  </p>  <p>  - The community services programme (CSP) has an allocation of over &euro;45 million in 2015 which will enable employment levels to be maintained at around 2,800, as was the case in recent years.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy should also note that it is planned to engage 25,300 jobseekers in community employment (CE) in 2015, with a budget of &euro;373m.  This includes the additional 2,000 places approved in 2014.  In addition, it is expected that Gateway &ndash; the work placement initiative with county and city councils - will reach the 3,000 level towards the middle of this year.  Finally, the number of places available to support employers under the JobsPlus initiative is doubled to 6,000 jobs. </p>  <p>  An important initiative &ndash; the back to work family dividend - was announced in Budget 2015.  It is designed to incentivise jobseekers, lone parents and employment programme participants who have children to take up full time employment or self-employment.  If a person qualifies for the scheme they will get a weekly payment for up to 2 years - the equivalent of any Increases for Qualified Children that were being paid (up to a maximum of 4 children) for the first year in employment.  Half that amount will be paid weekly for the second year.</p>  <p>  The allocation for 2015 ensures that new initiatives, like back to work family dividend, can be introduced while fully maintaining schemes such as the RSS, T&uacute;s, the CSP and CE.</p></reply>

When introducing the OFP scheme age change reforms in 2012, a special provision was included for recipients who are claiming the domiciliary care allowance (DCA) payment for a disabled child aged under 16 years.  This special provision ensures that lone parents who care for a disabled child will continue to receive support until that child reaches the age of 16 years and can apply for the disability allowance (DA) in their own right.   As a result of this provision 1,650 lone parents will not be affected by the next phase of the OFP age reforms, which is due to take effect in July. </p>  <p>  It is expected that on foot of the final phase of OFP age reforms, another cohort of OFP recipients who are in receipt of the half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance, as they are caring for another person (i.e. an adult or a child aged 16 years or over), may be affected by the July changes. </p>  <p>  I am therefore working with my officials in examining the position of these lone parents and the potential impact of the July change.  I hope to conclude our deliberations on this aspect of the change in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, Deputies will recall that before Christmas, I reviewed the reduction to the income disregard for lone parents due to be introduced last January and in January 2016.  In order to maintain the existing incentive for employment, I brought forward provisions to maintain the level of disregard at 2014 levels.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-05a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015020500049#WRA00900"><p>The Department will spend approximately &euro;227 million this year on the household benefits package for approximately 415,000 customers.  It will also spend more than &euro;195 million on the fuel allowance. The fuel allowance of &euro;20 is paid for 26 weeks from October to April.  There have been no reductions in the fuel allowance since 2012.   The electricity and gas allowance is currently &euro;35 per month.  There have been no reductions to the electricity and gas allowance in recent budgets.  In 2013, I aligned the electricity and gas allowance with the cheapest available market rate for 1,800 units of electricity.  Previously the rate had been based on the price of one supplier.  This provided a saving to the Department but allowed customers to obtain savings by switching to cheaper companies.  Customers can now switch companies without the loss of any credit that may have built up, which wasn&rsquo;t possible under the old system.</p>  <p>  The overall concern of the Government in Budget 2015 and previous Budgets has been to protect the primary social welfare rates.  Expenditure on pensions is the largest block of expenditure in the Department, representing about a third of overall expenditure.  Because of demographic changes the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.  The savings generated in recent years by reductions in secondary benefits were essential to maintain core weekly payments.  I have no plans at this time to increase the household benefits package.  Any decision to increase the package would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.  As the Deputy is aware, in Budget 2015, we partially restored the Christmas Bonus and increased the Living Alone Allowance.</p></reply>

A number of changes have been made to the Pensions Act to help both the employers and the trustees of defined benefit pension schemes respond to funding difficulties. These changes provide for the sharing of the risk of scheme underfunding across all scheme members. The issue of how these changes might be applied is a matter for the trustees of a scheme.   I hope that these measures will help in resolving the funding difficulties in the Tara Mines schemes. You  will appreciate it that it would not be appropriate for me to engage with or comment on developments relating to a particular pension schemes as these are a matter for the management of the company and the trustees of the pension schemes.  </p>  <p>  The trustees of a defined benefit pension scheme are required under trust law to act in the best interests of all scheme members.  I do not plan to bring forward amendments to this section of the Pensions Act at this time but I will continue to monitor the application of this section on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-05a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015020500049#WRA01300"><p>The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.   Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.  This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last 2 years.  This increase has not been in &ldquo;precarious&rdquo; or temporary jobs.  While the proportion of Irish workers who are on temporary contracts rose slightly during the recession, reaching 10.5% in 2011, it has since fallen back to the pre-recession level of 9.5%, and remains significantly below the EU average of 14.4%.Within this framework, the Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed.   The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for.   Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training.  Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment.    Both the job-search assistance, and the range of programmes I have just mentioned, are the subject of favourable comment by SIPTU in the report quoted by the Deputy, which is largely positive about Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of the Youth Guarantee. </p>  <p>  None of these programmes involve offers of employment on &ldquo;unsatisfactory&rdquo; contracts.  Finally, the Youth Developmental Internship, First Steps, is an additional measure to provide youth with work experience.  This will offer young jobseekers aged between 18 and 25 the opportunity to gain valuable work experience and training with the help of dedicated assistance from Department of Social Protection case officers.  The target is to provide up to 1,500 work experience placements of six or nine months&rsquo; duration for young jobseekers during 2015.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, I launched a call seeking expressions of interest from organisations right across the private, public, voluntary and community sectors inviting them to participate as a sponsor in the First Steps programme.  The objective is to provide participants with an opportunity to learn and develop basic work and social skills while on a placement in a real work situation in organisations in the private, public, voluntary and community sectors.  </p>  <p>  Each placement will last for six or nine months during which time the participants will spend four days per week with a host employer and will be expected to use the fifth day of each week to undertake other activities related to job-search.  </p>  <p>  Youth unemployment here has fallen from a crisis peak of 31% to about 23% now, and the number of young people who are long-term unemployed has fallen from 36,000 to circa 17,000. </p></reply>

This will support some 400 contracts that are in place with service providers nationally.  The CSP is designed to address locally identified gaps in the provision of services to communities and to utilise the potential of community assets and resources that are already in place to support of delivery of services and to improve community well-being.  Funding is provided to support the employment of staff to deliver the service.  Unlike a number of other schemes and initiatives operated by the Department, there is no direct relationship with the employees of the contractors or service providers.  Contractors must also demonstrate an ability to generate and maintain income from the services delivered.   The objective of the Programme is to promote social and economic development through harnessing voluntary commitment and using the potential of community assets.  The benefits derive from services that are considered necessary and which would not otherwise be provided and which support the provision of real and positive employment opportunities.  </p>  <p>  Some 2,800 people are directly supported in employment through the CSP across the various not-for-profit organisations nationally, with an estimated 300-500 additional people supported indirectly from other activities of contractors funded from their own resources and income generation.</p></reply>

Rather, adjusted rates for younger jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients were first introduced in 2009.  Budget 2014 further extended the adjusted rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to recipients under 26 years of age.  This is a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency.  It aims to incentivise young jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.  There are no plans to change provision in this area.In the case of the person concerned the rate of payment of his jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance has been calculated correctly.  Given his difficult personal circumstances, the request to backdate his claim has been approved.  The arrears due to him are included in his payment dated 3<sup>rd</sup>February 2015. In order to assist him in his efforts to seek employment, Departmental officers have liaised with both the person concerned himself and a local community activist who has been heavily involved in supporting him.

The rural social scheme (RSS), T&uacute;s and community employment (CE) continue to play an important role in this regard and the  Department is continuing to work with implementing and sponsor bodies to improve the delivery of the schemes.  These improvements include:<br/><br/>- Ensuring that eligibility criteria across activation and other schemes is complementary and is in line with the policy objectives set out in Pathways to Work;<br/><br/>- Streamlining the way in which jobseekers can access schemes, including referrals from case officers where a work placements is deemed to be beneficial to a jobseeker in getting back to work or accessing training; and <br/><br/>- Allowing transfer between schemes to better meet the needs of particular jobseekers.  <br/><br/>The delivery cost of RSS will be of the order of &euro;2.3 m in implementing body costs and &euro;4.7m in supervision and monitoring costs.

Discontinuation of entitlement to the mortgage interest supplement scheme came into effect for all new applicants from 1 January 2014.  Customers availing of this support prior to 1st January 2014 have been able to retain entitlement to the scheme up to 1st January 2018.  There are currently approximately 5,880 recipients.<br/><br/>It is expected that during the four year period, the existing customers will no longer require this support through sustainable solutions being put in place with their lenders, securing employment or exit strategies sponsored by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. I am satisfied that the most appropriate way in which customers experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported is through engagement with their lender.</p></reply>

It assists those families with cost associated with raising children.  It is paid to almost 1.2 million children in over 600,000 families.  The estimated expenditure in 2014 was &euro;1.9 billion. I am aware that in its Concluding Statement of the 2015 Article IV Mission the IMF suggests that further means-testing of benefits, or taxation of universal benefits, could generate significant savings while ensuring those on lower incomes are protected.   Child Benefit is of crucial importance to families, particularly middle-income families who would stand to lose money if a means tested or taxable system were introduced.  Furthermore, means testing or taxing child benefit could raise significant legislative, operational, IT and incentive issues.</p>  <p>  A crucial element of a strong and sustainable welfare system is the principle that everybody contributes, and that the system is there in turn to support those contributors at key stages in their lives.  Child Benefit is one of the few universal payments in the welfare system in that regard, and its universality has an important role to play in maintaining the sustainability of the system. </p>  <p>  We are committed to delivering a new deal on living standards to ensure that economic recovery is felt by low and middle income working families.  Thus, Budget 2015 increased child benefit by &euro;5 per month, at a cost of &euro;72 million.  Other measures supporting families include the introduction of the Back to Work Family Dividend and increased expenditure on school meals.</p></reply>

On the other hand, the at-risk-of-poverty for children decreased from 18.8 per cent in 2012 to 17.9 per cent in 2013. A key driver in reducing income poverty among children is social transfers, which reduce the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children from 45.5% to 17.9%, thereby lifting a quarter of all children out of poverty. This equates to a poverty reduction effect of 60.7% in 2013, an increase on the 2012, when the poverty reduction effect was 50.1 per cent. Ireland is amongst the best performing member states in the EU in this regard.In Budget 2015, the Government committed a further &euro;96 million for children, including an increase of &euro;5 per month in child benefit.  &euro;72 million extra will be spent on child benefit in 2015 with &euro;22 million provided for expenditure on the new Back to Work Family Dividend and an additional &euro;2 million on the School Meals Programme. <br/><br/>Government policy around tackling poverty for children and families has recently been articulated in <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i><i>The national policy framework for children &amp;amp; young people 2014-2020, </i>which adopted a child-specific social target for poverty reduction aiming to lift 70,000 children out of poverty by 2020, equivalent to a reduction of two-thirds on the 2011 rate.  To achieve this target the Government is implementing a multidimensional approach to tackling child poverty, building on the lifecycle approach in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion, 2007-2016 and informed by the European Commission&rsquo;s Recommendation on &lsquo;Investing in children: Breaking the cycle of disadvantage&rsquo;.<br/><br/>A key way to tackle child poverty is to get parents back to work. Through <i>Pathways to Work</i>and the <i>Action Plan on Jobs</i>, the Government is putting people into real jobs. The Family Income Supplement and new Back to Work Family Dividend will support parents, especially those furthest from the labour market, to take up and remain in employment. </p></reply>

The combination of the introduction of the Back to Work Family Dividend and the retention of the OFP earnings disregard at &euro;90 per week are both positive and welcome as they improve the financial incentive for lone parents to avail of employment opportunities. </p></reply>

In addition, Departmental records show that all of these interns who completed an internship subsequently entered into paid employment.  Accordingly the internships appear to have met their purpose in providing a bridge between unemployment and paid employment.  Their use was therefore an appropriate activation intervention and is to be welcomed rather than criticised.</p></reply>

This year, the Department of Social Protection will spend an estimated &euro;6.675 billion on pensions &ndash; 34.4% of all welfare expenditure and an increase of &euro;168 million over 2014.  The overall concern of the Government in recent budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates where possible. Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.  The Government has no plans to change this policy, and I have not been presented with proposals from any Minister to reduce the basic rate of the State pension. In fact, the Government increased payments for certain pensioners by increasing the rate of the Living Alone Allowance in Budget 2015 to &euro;9.00.  This increases the maximum personal rate of the State non-contributory pension for a qualified person living alone to &euro;228 per week, and the maximum rate for the State contributory pension to &euro;239.30, when both the basic pension and the allowance are taken into account.  In addition I was pleased to restore a partial Christmas bonus last month, benefitting over 575,000 pensioners and 1.23 million welfare recipients in total.    In relation to supplementary retirement income, the development of a system to progressively achieve universal supplementary pension coverage has been a stated goal of Irish pension policy for a number of years.  The programme for Government and the recent 2014-2016 Statement of Priorities affirmed this commitment.  In this regard, the Government has recently made a decision to proceed with work to develop a roadmap and timeline for the introduction of a new supplementary workplace retirement saving scheme.  Development of this roadmap will be progressed by the establishment of a high level Universal Retirement Savings Group (URSG).  The URSG will consist of senior official representatives from key Government departments and those public bodies with a particular responsibility in the area.  The group will engage with the various sectoral interests including those from the pensions industry, representatives of small, large and multinational employers, trade unions and consumer/interest group representatives. The broad role of the group will be to consider the constituent factors involved in constructing an efficient and effective universal retirement savings system. A recommendation will be brought to Government for consideration in the form of a roadmap and estimated timeline for introduction.</p></reply>

I am acutely aware of the difficulties people are experiencing in maintaining affordable rented accommodation in areas of high demand in the current market, including those in receipt of rent supplement.  The Department is finalising a review of the maximum rent limits and raising rent limits may not be the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and could impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers and students. I am keeping the matter under close review.The Department has put measures in place to ensure that the housing needs of rent supplement customers throughout the country are addressed by providing for increased flexibility within the administration of the rent supplement scheme. Notices circulated to Community Welfare Service staff reminding them of their discretionary power to award, on a case by case basis, a supplement for rental purposes in July and December 2014. A National Framework has also been developed to ensure that appropriate supports continue to be provided under the rent supplement scheme throughout the country in a consistent manner. The Interim Tenancy Sustainment Protocol introduced in the Dublin region during 2014 has recently been extended to Cork city.<br/><br/>Under the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from this Department to housing authorities.

The purpose of the phased OFP scheme age change reforms that were introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012, is to reduce long-term social welfare dependency and poverty among lone parents and to ensure that they have improved access to the Department&rsquo;s range of education, training, and employment support programmes in order to assist them in securing employment.   The final phase of the OFP scheme age change reforms will take place on 2 July, 2015, when the maximum age limit of the youngest child at which an OFP recipient&rsquo;s payment ceases will be reduced to 7 years for all recipients.  It is anticipated that approximately 30,200 OFP recipients will transition out of the OFP scheme on that day.  These customers will be supported by my Department to transition to an alternative income support payment &ndash; as appropriate.</p>  <p>  The introduction of the Back to Work Family Dividend as announced in Budget 2015 provides a further incentive for jobseekers and OFP recipients to avail of employment opportunities by allowing them to retain their increase for a qualified child when they leave welfare for employment or self-employment.

They determine entitlement in accordance with the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005 (as amended) and regulations.  DOs/DPs will assist customers in making their applications but, as a matter of law, the burden of providing evidence to support a claim rests with customers. It is worth pointing out that the Department makes decisions on over two million claims across a range of schemes each year and DOs/DPs are very conscious of their obligations to customers and every effort is made to ensure people receive the entitlements due to them.  </p>  <p>  A customer who is not happy with the initial decision is entitled to seek either an internal review or to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO) and are advised of this. </p>  <p>  Of the 38,421 appeals finalised by the SWAO in 2013, 55% (21,139) had a favourable outcome for the appellant in that the appeals were either allowed in full or in part or resolved by way of a revised decision by a Deciding Officer in favour of the appellant.   However, this does not necessarily mean that the initial decision was incorrect.    It is important to note that it is often the case that when customers appeal a decision, they submit new information, or new information comes to light at the oral appeal hearing.     In particular, where a scheme involves illness, disability or caring conditions, there is often a second medical assessment submitted. These new facts often allow the Department to make a more favourable decision.       In fact, 21% (8,062) of the appeals finalised by the SWAO in 2013 were finalised as a result of revised decisions being made by DOs or DPs in the Department and those cases then did not fall to be heard by an Appeals Officer.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s Fraud and Error surveys show a low level of departmental error most recently 0.04% and 0.01% in Widows and Jobseeker's Allowance scheme surveys. There were no errors identified in the Child Benefit survey.</p>  <p>  Measures to minimise incorrect decisions in the first place include management checks at local level and ongoing improvement to guidelines and advice.    The Department has begun a process of examining decision files, identifying common errors, and issuing staff bulletins to advise staff of best practice. </p>  <p>  A major new training programme for DOs, DPs and others is also expected to lead to ongoing improvements in decision making.</p>  <p>  There are regular meetings between the SWAO and officials of the Department to identify and resolve issues that give rise to appeals,  in order to have more consistent application of the legislation and guidelines between the DWAO and the Department&rsquo;s DOs and DPs. </p></reply>

It draws heavily on 35 case studies as its main source of information.  It is important to be clear at the outset that these 35 cases are not a random sample of social welfare customers, but were drawn only from a selection of people who sought help from outside agencies.The 35 cases, while important individually, also need to be seen in the context that the Department pays about 1.45 million customers each week and nearly 88.5 million payments were made last year  . The Department is proud to have a long history of superb customer service and has been considered a leader in this area in the public service.  In that context, regardless of how small or unrepresentative the number of sample cases is, it is unacceptable that <i><i>any </i></i>customer of the Department of Social Protection should feel that they have been subjected to inappropriate behaviour and/or language, or left in a situation where they feel they cannot access their entitlements.  If the relevant groups are willing to send details of these cases to the Department, the specific allegations will be investigated.  Unfortunately, without specific details, it is not possible to take action in relation to the individual cases.The Department provides many services to assist customers (including migrants) in their dealings with the Department.  These include:  <br/><br/><b><i>- Translations: </i></b>Translation services are provided to and from all languages, on request.  The majority of translations paid  for by the Department relate to supporting documentation required for processing customer claims such as birth, marriage or death certificates, medical reports and statements relating to customers&rsquo; circumstances.  In 2014 almost 4,000 documents were translated to / from over 50 languages.<br/><br/><b><i>- Interpretations: </i></b>Interpretation services are provided on request, where necessary to facilitate customers in their engagement with the Department, where English is not the customer&rsquo;s first language.  The service is provided by way of either a 3-way phone conversation, or a face-to-face service, where an interpreter attends in person to facilitate customer/staff interaction.<br/><br/><b><i>- Training: </i></b>The Staff Development Unit of the Department provides a range of staff training courses which focus on the delivery of quality customer service.  This training includes the raising of awareness of disability, mental health and diversity issues relevant to staff and customers. <br/><br/>In addition, operational guidelines and other support and materials are available to staff to assist them in their interactions with customers. </p></reply>

This requirement will afford the representative group an opportunity to make a submission to the Pensions Authority in relation to such proposals.  The Regulations also give the representative group the right to appeal such a direction by the Pensions Authority to the High Court on a point of law.   I also approved an amendment to guidance issued by the Pensions Authority on this matter.

In the case of private rented accommodation, tenancy arrangements involve a contract between the landlord and the tenant.  The Department has no contractual relationship with the landlord and tenant behaviour is a matter for the landlord in the first instance.  There are a number of avenues open to landlords in such cases, including the mediation service for landlords and tenants operated by the Private Residential Tenancies Board and/or recourse to the Garda Sioch&aacute;na and/or the Courts in relation to the enforcement of the law in dealing with anti-social or criminal behaviour.     Under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 tenants are obliged not to behave within a dwelling, or in the vicinity of it, in a way that is anti-social.  Landlords are obliged to enforce the tenant&rsquo;s obligations, and may seek termination of a tenancy due to a tenant&rsquo;s antisocial behaviour.  </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 provides the Department with the authority to refuse, suspend or terminate payment of a rent supplement in the case of a person who has been required to deliver up possession of a dwelling provided by a housing authority or an approved body where the reasons for that requirement include anti-social behaviour or the interests of good estate management.   </p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic position is to transfer responsibility of long term rent supplement tenancies from this Department to the housing authorities which will be delivered through the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).

While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.

All recipients of farm assist have benefitted from the Christmas Bonus paid last month and all recipients with children will also benefit from the increase in child benefit I announced in the Budget.

The number of long-term unemployed at that time was 139,000, down by over 60,000, or almost one third, from the level seen in 2012.  The long term unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 9.5% in 2012 to 6.4% in late 2014.<br/><br/>The <i>Pathways to Work</i>Strategy sets out a comprehensive reform of the State&rsquo;s approach to helping unemployed jobseekers return to work.  Since its inception in 2012, there have been a number of reforms including the new one-stop model of Intreo; increasing initial one-to-one guidance interviews with jobseekers (with the number of such interviews, at 169,000 in 2014, up 8% on 2013); and making 57,000 FET places available to the long-term unemployed.<br/><br/>In addition to on-going measures, <i>Pathways to Work</i>2015 includes additional actions.  First, from early 2015, a structured process of engagement with the existing long-term unemployed will commence.  This will see at least 8,300 long-term unemployed people being referred to the activation process (Group Engagement followed by regular one-to-one case officer contact) each month in early 2015.<br/><br/>Second, a new employment services model, JobPath, will be rolled out in 2015.  It is a payment by results contract model with third party providers of employment services specifically targeted at long-term unemployed jobseekers.  JobPath aims to provide additional capacity to the Public Employment Service in order to enable it engage more systematically with long-term unemployed jobseekers. <br/><br/>In support of these enhanced engagement processes, 57,000 FET places will continue to be reserved for the long-term unemployed in 2015.  A minimum of 16,000 places for the long-term unemployed will also be provided through key public employment programmes.  This includes an expansion of the JobsPlus initiative, an employment subsidy that incentivises employers to recruit the long-term unemployed.<br/><br/>There are definite signs that, in tandem with the recovery in economic demand, reforms undertaken to date are having some impact in improving the employment prospects of people who are unemployed.  I am satisfied these measures together with reforms planned for 2015 will help to bring about continuing falls in unemployment and especially long-term unemployment.</p></reply>

Since publication, a range of measures have been taken to deliver on the report&rsquo;s recommendations and work is ongoing in this regard.  For example, in line with the recommendation that the implementation of the Consumer Protection Code should be monitored, the Central Bank has undertaken a number of themed reviews aimed at ensuring this is the case.  This includes a recently published review of annual pension statements which found the vast majority of firms were in compliance with the code. Where the Bank identified a small number of firms where the format of annual statements were not as required, those concerned were required to submit implementation timelines for full compliance.</p>  <p>  In parallel, my Department is involved in complementary EU negotiations on a review of the IORPs (Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision) Directive which lays down basic requirements for occupational pensions. It is anticipated that final provisions will result in improvements in the areas of transparency, trustee competencies and scheme governance and which will promote competitiveness in charging structures.</p>  <p>  Under the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 the Pensions Board was restructured into the Pensions Authority and the Pensions Council. The Pensions Council was established to provide advice on pensions and also to give consumers a greater input into pension policy.  The Pensions Council will ensure that the system has a far stronger consumer focus.  I have previously highlighted that there a number of specific areas which I want the Council to focus on which includes pension charges.  Progress on the issue of charges will also be supported by the restructuring of the Pensions Authority to strengthen governance and regulation of schemes.</p></reply>

In preparing this report the Department&rsquo;s internal auditor raised a query in relation to the appropriateness or otherwise of one Job Club hosting a small number of interns in a role of Job Club instructor.  It is important to note in this regard that the Department funds the operation of some fifty Job Clubs located around the State.  These Job Clubs are operated by 46 separate contractors who are, in the main, Local Development/Partnership Companies (LDCs).  The Job Club in question is a community based, not for profit, social enterprise. Department records show that it is one of two Job Clubs which have hosted JobBridge interns.</p>  <p>  All Job Club providers are private limited companies and therefore, for the purpose of the JobBridge scheme, are treated like any other employer providing internship opportunities in line with criteria attaching to the scheme.  With regard to the appropriateness of JobBridge interns working in Job Clubs the question of the suitability of any individual intern to operate as a Job Club administrator/instructor is a matter to be assessed, on a case by case basis, by Job Club management.  I note that in this case the internship posts advertised required applicants to have FETAC level 6 qualifications in delivery of training programmes and that Departmental records show that all of the interns who completed an internship with the Job Club concerned subsequently entered into paid employment.  Accordingly the internships appear to have met their purpose in providing a bridge between unemployment and paid employment.  Their use by the Job Club in this case appears therefore to have been an appropriate activation intervention and is to be welcomed rather than criticised.</p>  <p>  In the past JobBridge has been criticised by some people on the grounds that some of the opportunities offered were so called low level jobs.  In this instance the appropriateness of the internships is being questioned on the basis that the roles required &lsquo;higher level&rsquo; qualifications.  In fact what this case shows is that JobBridge offers a broad range of internships to respond to the needs and aspirations of the complete spectrum of jobseekers, including those targeting very specific sectors but lacking critical real workplace experience in their chosen field.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied therefore that no question arises in respect to JobBridge arising out of this case.</p>  <p>  To ensure that both the host organisation and intern are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme, the Department undertakes ongoing monitoring of internships.  This involves the regular review of monthly compliance reports and random site visits to facilitate discussions with both parties to the internship.  The Department has conducted over 9,000 monitoring visits to-date, and 97% of these visits have been of a satisfactory nature.</p></reply>

Over 400 recruitment agencies have used the service since its establishment in 2000.<br/><br/>The Department is engaged in a programme to modernise its services. This modernisation programme is fundamental to the Department&rsquo;s objectives of delivering a comprehensive service to people, positioning the Department to better adapt to political priorities and changing customer needs, while delivering on internal effectiveness and efficiency goals.<br/><br/>As part of the modernisation programme and in order to improve the job/candidate matching capability of Jobs Ireland, a tender process is currently under way for a new job matching system. Subject to the outcome of the tender process it is anticipated that the new system will go live during 2015.  Improving the job/candidate matching capability of this service will incentivise employers and recruitment agencies to use the service to provide more jobs for those who are unemployed.<br/><br/>In line with the Government&rsquo;s programme of change, the Department established a dedicated employer engagement Unit in 2012 with a focus on building relationships with employers and recruitment agencies to raise awareness and take- up of employment services and supports, including availing of the Jobs Ireland service.  This work will continue during 2015.</p></reply>

The increase on deprivation in particular affected children, the unemployed, households with no one at work, and lone parent households.  Overall, the rise in basic deprivation has affected all income groups and reflects the legacy of the economic crisis since 2008 on many low and middle income households.</p>  <p>  The key measure of poverty from a policy perspective is consistent poverty, which is the combination of at-risk-of-poverty and basic deprivation.  The rate of consistent poverty in 2013 was 8.2 per cent, a slight though not statistically significant increase on 2012.  The Government remains committed to meeting the national social target for poverty reduction, which is to reduce consistent poverty to 4 per cent by 2016 and 2 per cent or less by 2020.</p>  <p>  At-risk-of-poverty rate fell from 16.5 per cent in 2012 to 15.2 per cent in 2013.  A key reason for this fall is the enhanced impact of social transfers in reducing income poverty.  In 2013, welfare payments and other social transfers (including pensions) lifted a third of the population out of the at-risk-of poverty, thereby reducing the rate from 49.8 per cent to 15.2 per cent.  This is equivalent to a poverty reduction effect of 69.5 per cent, as compared to 67.2 per cent in 2012.</p>  <p>  It is clear that since 2012-2013, the period reported in this survey, there has been a recovery in economic growth and employment, with the unemployment rate falling from 14.7% in 2012 to 13.1% in 2013 and to 11.3% in 2014.  Also indicators like the long-term unemployment rate show an improvement.</p>  <p>  We are committed to delivering a new deal on living standards to ensure that economic recovery is felt by low and middle income working families.  Thus, Budget 2015 increases support for families raising children, assists unemployed families with children to return to work and improves the financial position of vulnerable welfare recipients, including those living alone. I&rsquo;m confident that these measures will be reflected in future poverty statistics.</p></reply>

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.  This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last 2 years.<br/><br/>Within this framework, the Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed.  The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for. Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training.  Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment.<br/><br/>Overall, the Youth Guarantee provides for over 28,000 programme opportunities for unemployed young people in 2014, as set out in the table below.  This figure excludes some 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships.  These PLC and apprenticeship places, together with the wide range of vocational third-level courses provided for the young, although not reserved for unemployed jobseekers, nevertheless contribute to the spirit of the guarantee.<br/><br/>It is important to note that some of the initiatives planned under the guarantee required primary legislation to allow positive discrimination on age grounds in the provision of employment services and supports.  Two employment schemes in particular, the Youth Guarantee developmental internship programme and the JobsPlus variant for young people, were launched in November 2014 after the required legislation was passed in June 2014.  The legislation also permits the introduction of earlier and more intensive engagement by INTREO with the young unemployed.<br/><br/>Models for the engagement of young people through Intreo have been agreed and will form the basis of the national roll-out of the Youth Guarantee in 2015.  Potential refinement of these models may be considered on the basis of outcomes and learning from the Ballymun Youth Guarantee Pilot Project.<br/><br/><b>Youth Guarantee Progress YTD: End December 2014</b><table><tr><th><b>Programme</b></th><th><div><b>Expected full-year intake</b></div></th><th><div><b>2014 YTD</b></div></th><th><b>Note</b></th></tr><tr><td>Youthreach/CTC</td><td><div>3,300</div></td><td><div>3553</div></td><td>CTC starters  end Dec -- including Youthreach 1800 persons</td></tr><tr><td>JobBridge (including developmental internship)</td><td><div>5,000</div></td><td><div>3,138</div></td><td>As of end December 2014</td></tr><tr><td>T&uacute;s</td><td><div>1,000</div></td><td><div>1,410</div></td><td>As of  30<sup>th</sup>November 3014</td></tr><tr><td>JobsPlus</td><td><div>1,500</div></td><td><div>410</div></td><td>As of  end Dec 14- U25 estimated as 14.6% of total starters in 2014 (2806)</td></tr><tr><td>Momentum</td><td><div>2,000</div></td><td><div>631</div></td><td>As of December 12<sup>th</sup>2014</td></tr><tr><td>BTEA (excl Momentum)</td><td><div>3,300</div></td><td><div>2319</div></td><td>As of 14<sup>th </sup>October </td></tr><tr><td>BTWEA</td><td><div>200</div></td><td><div>139</div></td><td>Including 5 persons on STEA</td></tr><tr><td>VTOS</td><td><div>500</div></td><td><div>672 </div></td><td>Estimated unemployed entrants </td></tr><tr><td>FAS/Solas</td><td><div>9500</div></td><td><div>8,027</div></td><td>Based on SST, Traineeship, Bridging &amp;amp; LTI starters YTD (end December)</td></tr><tr><td>CEB youth Entrepreneurship <br /><br />Training and Mentoring supports</td><td><div>700</div></td><td><div>0 </div></td><td>Not yet commenced</td></tr><tr><td>CEB/MFI micro-loans for young people</td><td><div>150</div></td><td><div>10</div></td><td>23<sup>rd</sup>December 2014</td></tr><tr><td>International Work Experience and Training</td><td><div>250</div></td><td><div>0 </div></td><td>Not yet commenced</td></tr><tr><td>Gateway</td><td><div>450</div></td><td><div>192</div></td><td>30<sup>th</sup>November 2014</td></tr><tr><td>Community Employment</td><td><div>500</div></td><td><div>600</div></td><td>End December 2014</td></tr><tr><td><b>Total </b></td><td><div><b>28,350</b></div></td><td><div><b>21,101</b></div></td><td>Excluding where figures are not available</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The trustees of such pension schemes have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of all scheme members.Section 50 of the Pensions Act makes provision for the restructuring of a defined benefit pension scheme where the scheme fails to comply with the Funding Standard.  The Pensions Authority can either unilaterally or on an application from the trustees of the scheme issue a direction to the trustees of a scheme to restructure scheme benefits. Such a direction by the Pensions Authority only facilitates a restructuring of benefits which is designed to enable the scheme satisfy the Funding Standard.  All directions issued by the Pensions Authority to date have been as a result of an application to the Authority by the trustees of a scheme. Before the trustees make such an application, they must consult with the employer, with the scheme members, with any person receiving benefits from the scheme and with the authorised trade union representing scheme members in advance of an application to the Pensions Authority.  The Pensions Authority has discretion as to whether or not to issue a direction following an application by the trustees of a scheme.</p>  <p>  The changes made to section 50 of the Pensions Act in recent years essentially provide for the sharing of the risk of scheme underfunding across all scheme members. The issue of how these changes might be applied is a matter for the trustees of a scheme who are required under trust law to act in the best interests of all scheme beneficiaries.</p>  <p>  At the end of 2013, the Annual Report of the Pensions Authority indicated that there were 933 defined benefit pension schemes subject to the Funding Standard.  The Pensions Authority has issued a section 50 direction in respect of 11% of these schemes. In the majority of applications, the restructuring of scheme benefits related to an adjustment of future increases in benefit.</p>  <p>  While I do not plan to bring forward amendments to section 50 of the Pensions Act at this time, I will continue to monitor its application.</p></reply>

There are approximately 71,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;298 million for 2015. Rent supplement recipients by county from 2010 to 2014 are provided in the attached tabular statement.<br/><br/>I am acutely aware of the difficulties people are experiencing in maintaining affordable rented accommodation in areas of high demand in the current market, including areas of North Kildare. The Department has put measures in place to ensure that the housing needs of rent supplement customers throughout the country who are at risk of homelessness are addressed by providing for increased flexibility within the administration of the rent supplement scheme. Notices were circulated to all Community Welfare Service staff reminding them of their discretionary power to award, on a case by case basis, a supplement for rental purposes in such circumstances in July and December 2014. A National Framework has also been developed to ensure that appropriate supports continue to be provided throughout the country in a consistent manner. The Department continues to monitor the measures in place to ensure that the appropriate supports are in place for rent supplement recipients including the Interim Tenancy Sustainment Protocol operating in Dublin, which was extended to Cork city within the last week.<br/><br/>The Department is aware that some leading property websites ask potential landlords to indicate whether they will accept rent supplement tenancies. It is the Department&rsquo;s expressed position that this practice should cease and the matter was raised with the leading websites. The Department is also engaging with the Department of Justice and Equality regarding this matter.<br/><br/>It open to any person who has been refused a private tenancy and who feels discriminated against on the basis of his or her gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Travelling community to refer a discrimination complaint to the Equality Tribunal under the Equal Status Acts.<br/><br/><b>Tabular Statement &ndash; Rent Supplement Recipients by County End of 2010 - 2014</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>33,818</td><td>34,423</td><td>32,584</td><td>29,541</td><td>26,453</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>10,988</td><td>10,732</td><td>9,878</td><td>9,020</td><td>8,273</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>4,409</td><td>4,447</td><td>4,338</td><td>4,135</td><td>3,698</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>4,829</td><td>4,615</td><td>4,134</td><td>3,983</td><td>3,591</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>4,055</td><td>4,102</td><td>3,700</td><td>3,179</td><td>2,700</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>3,896</td><td>3,833</td><td>3,323</td><td>2,984</td><td>2,461</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>2,563</td><td>2,734</td><td>2,549</td><td>2,422</td><td>2,211</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>2,613</td><td>2,719</td><td>2,495</td><td>2,381</td><td>2,130</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>2,680</td><td>2,609</td><td>2,199</td><td>2,094</td><td>1,961</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>3,194</td><td>2,977</td><td>2,411</td><td>2,047</td><td>1,812</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>2,552</td><td>2,723</td><td>2,143</td><td>1,941</td><td>1,726</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>2,339</td><td>2,278</td><td>2,037</td><td>1,888</td><td>1,736</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>3,012</td><td>2,928</td><td>2,435</td><td>1,900</td><td>1,619</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>1,623</td><td>1,671</td><td>1,592</td><td>1,588</td><td>1,533</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>2,332</td><td>2,098</td><td>1,773</td><td>1,556</td><td>1,443</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>1,937</td><td>1,961</td><td>1,722</td><td>1,547</td><td>1,336</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>1,577</td><td>1,619</td><td>1,365</td><td>1,210</td><td>1,011</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>1,484</td><td>1,440</td><td>1,239</td><td>1,108</td><td>1,086</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>1,273</td><td>1,349</td><td>1,240</td><td>1,124</td><td>1,041</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>1,151</td><td>1,178</td><td>1,097</td><td>1,085</td><td>1,008</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>1,276</td><td>1,275</td><td>997</td><td>802</td><td>687</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>715</td><td>623</td><td>511</td><td>507</td><td>476</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>787</td><td>698</td><td>591</td><td>542</td><td>451</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>1,029</td><td>843</td><td>519</td><td>455</td><td>414</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>598</td><td>488</td><td>438</td><td>395</td><td>352</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>530</td><td>440</td><td>374</td><td>354</td><td>324</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>97,260</td><td>96,803</td><td>87,684</td><td>79,788</td><td>71,533</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Discontinuation of entitlement to the mortgage interest supplement scheme came into effect for all new applicants from 1 January 2014. Customers availing of this support prior to 1st January 2014 have been able to retain entitlement to the scheme up to 1st January 2018. There are currently approximately 5,880 mortgage interest supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;11.9 million for in 2015. Statistics on the reasons customers are refused mortgage interest supplement are not available.<br/><br/>I have no plans to revise the conditionality of the scheme at this time which could only be considered in a budgetary context. I am satisfied that the most appropriate way in which customers experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported is through on-going engagement with their lender.</p></reply>

It is generally agreed that the best route out of poverty is through employment. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the reforms to the OFP scheme is to reduce long-term social welfare dependency and associated poverty among lone parents by ending the expectation that they will remain outside of the workforce indefinitely.  The reforms aim to provide the necessary supports to lone parents to help them to access the Department&rsquo;s range of education, training, and employment programmes, and to secure employment.</p>  <p>  In order to take account of the specific caring responsibilities of lone parents with young children, the Department has introduced the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) transitional arrangement in 2013. This exempts former OFP recipients whose youngest child is aged under 14 years from having to satisfy the jobseeker conditions of being available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time employment. The JA transitional arrangement allows lone parents with children aged under 14 years to balance their caring responsibilities and, also, significantly reduces their requirement for child care. It allows these customers to work part-time, e.g. mornings only, while receiving an income support payment.</p>  <p>  Budget 2015 brought in an increase of &euro;5 in the Child Benefit rate, from &euro;130 to &euro;135 per child per week, which will benefit over 611,000 households with children, including lone parent households. In addition, Budget 2015 saw the partial restoration of the Christmas Bonus to 1.1 million income support recipients, including to all recipients of the OFP payment and the JA transitional payment.</p>  <p>  Budget 2015 also introduced the Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD). The introduction of the BTWFD provides a further incentive for jobseekers and OFP recipients to avail of employment opportunities by allowing them to retain their increase for a qualified child when they leave welfare for employment or self-employment. It is estimated that approximately 9,600 lone parents who transition off their OFP payment will transfer to the Family Income Supplement and as such will qualify for the BTWFD.</p>  <p>  My officials and I are currently examining the position of lone parents who are in receipt of a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance in conjunction with their one parent family payment and the potential impact of that the July changes may have on this cohort. I hope to conclude our deliberations on this aspect of the change in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  As a result of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act, 2014, the OFP scheme income disregard is being maintained at its current level of &euro;90 per week. This measure will benefit approximately 28,000 working OFP recipients in 2015 and retains the existing financial incentive to take up employment.</p></reply>

Under the social welfare system, homeless people have entitlements to the full range of social welfare schemes, including supplementary welfare allowance (SWA), subject to the normal qualifying conditions. </p>  <p>  Where a person is residing in homeless accommodation, such as a bed and breakfast or long term hostel, steps are taken to verify their address in order to facilitate continued payment of a social welfare payment such as job seekers allowance. Where a person is homeless and has no fixed abode or has night by night accommodation then he/she is referred to the Community Welfare Service for support under the SWA scheme. </p>  <p>  The SWA scheme is considered the "safety net" within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants. The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. </p>  <p>  Under the SWA scheme, the Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. Assistance through ENPs may be provided towards rent deposits. This form of assistance is very important to those on low incomes who are at risk of, or who are homeless, or who rely on the private rented market to meet their housing needs. In 2014, the Department made over 2,990 payments of rent deposits/rent in advance at a cost of &euro;1.48 million throughout the country.   </p>  <p>  The Department has put measures in place to ensure that the housing needs of rent supplement customers throughout the country who were a risk of homelessness are addressed by providing for increased flexibility within the administration of the rent supplement scheme. Notices circulated to all Community Welfare Service staff reminding them of their discretionary power to award, on a case by case basis, a supplement for rental purposes in such circumstances in July and December 2014.

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last 2 years. <br/><br/>The long-term unemployment rate peaked at 9.5% in Q1 2012 before falling to 6.4% in Q3 2014. At the latter date, the long-term unemployed accounted for 57% of all those unemployed, down from almost 65% in early 2012. Despite these improvements, the level of long-term unemployment, and in particular the situation of those who are very long-term unemployed (more than two years), continue to be of concern. <br/><br/>The <i>Pathways to Work </i>Strategy provides for enhanced engagement services and additional activation measures to jobseekers while the recovery takes hold. In addition to ongoing reforms, the 2015 iteration of the strategy prioritises additional measures to enhance engagement with the long-term unemployed. This includes a structured process of engagement with the existing long-term unemployed that will see at least 8,300 long-term unemployed people being referred to the activation process (Group Engagement followed by regular one-to-one case officer contact) each month in early 2015. Second, a new employment services model for the long-term unemployed, JobPath, will be rolled out in 2015. It is a payment by results contract model with third party providers of employment services that will provide additional capacity in order to engage more systematically with long-term unemployed jobseekers. Referrals to JobPath providers are expected to commence early in the second half of 2015.<br/><br/>In support of these enhanced engagement processes, 57,000 FET places will continue to be reserved for the long-term unemployed in 2015. A minimum of 16,000 places for the long-term unemployed will also be provided through key public employment programmes. This includes an expansion of the JobsPlus initiative, an employment subsidy that incentivises employers to recruit the long-term unemployed.</p></reply>

This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last two years. <br/><br/>Reflecting the improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall (with a rate of 21.6% in December 2014 estimated by Eurostat,  as compared to 25.8% in December 2013). However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s <i>Pathways to Work</i>strategy and the Youth Guarantee.<br/><br/>The Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed.The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for.Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training.  Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment. <br/><br/>The rollout of the Youth Guarantee will be assisted by the Labour Market Council. The Council recently launched the Employer and Youth Activation Charter which is an example of increased focus on employer engagement. The Charter commits signatories to interview at least 50 per cent of their job candidates from the PES.<br/><br/><i>Pathways to Work </i>2014 targets with respect to the Youth Guarantee have largely been achieved. In addition it is expected the following targets in <i>Pathways to Work</i>2015 will be met:<br/><br/>- Roll out the First Steps developmental internships programme for 1500 &ndash; 2000 young people.<br/><br/>- Allocate 1,000 places on the T&uacute;s scheme to young people.  <br/><br/>- Introduce a pilot programme to support young unemployed people to take up opportunities under schemes such as Your First EURES Job.  <br/><br/>- Ring-fence a minimum of 2,000 training places for under-25s by the Department of Education and Skills, under a follow-up to the Momentum programme.</p></reply>

In 2012 the average processing time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks and the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  Further improvements were achieved in 2013, when the average appeal processing time reduced to 33.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.8 weeks for a summary decision.  As at end January 2015 the average time taken to process an appeal requiring an oral hearing has reduced to 27.9 weeks and for a summary decision to 18.0 weeks.  <br/><br/>The reduction in processing time reflects the significant resources which have been invested in the Social Welfare Appeals Office over the last number of years.<br/><br/>In addition to the improvement in processing times, these measures have also led to a significant reduction in the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 9,501 at 31<sup>st</sup>January 2015.<br/><br/>Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system. By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.<br/><br/>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<div><b>Table 1: Appeals processing times by scheme 2015</b><br/><br/><b>January 2015</b></div><table><tr><th><b>Scheme</b></th><th><b>SWAO</b><br /><br

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.  This strategy is working. Employment has risen by about 80,000 in the last two years. The Government&rsquo;s <i>Pathways to Work</i>strategy for 2015 prioritises enhanced engagement services for young jobseekers and for the long-term unemployed, as well as providing additional activation measures, to ensure that these groups are able to benefit from the economic recovery.<br/><br/>Therefore the Department of Social Protection keeps a detailed breakdown of the profiles of jobseekers. Data on each client&rsquo;s age, past occupation, and his/her education, is collected at the point of registration for job-seekers&rsquo; payment; these and other relevant data are processed and the probability of exiting the live register is calculated (PEX). This is essentially a predictor of whether or not someone will become long-term unemployed.  The roll-out of the profiling system at the Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; Intreo offices implicitly involves age profiling of the long-term unemployed, as age is one of the main determining variables in predicting if someone will become long-term unemployed. In other words, if someone is in an age category that is more likely to experience especially long-term unemployment, s/he will, all other things being equal, receive more targeted assistance.  <br/><br/>In addition, the Youth Guarantee initiative is specifically aimed at those under 25 who are unemployed with specific targeting of those who are either long-term unemployed or are most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.<br/><br/>Summary statistical information on the clients&rsquo; age, duration of unemployment, and last held occupation together with other demographic and regional information is published each month on the Central Statistics Office website.  </p></reply>

Since 1997, public service organisations have been producing Customer Action Plans to assist them in improving the way in which services are delivered to their customers.  In 2003, as part of a continuing drive to further promote Quality Customer Service, public service organisations additionally began to adopt Customer Charters.  <br/><br/>It is generally accepted that there is a broad public understanding of the term &lsquo;customer services&rsquo;.  It is not confined to specific genres of business that members of the public may from time to time engage in or require.  It is entirely appropriate therefore to use such terminology when referencing the delivery of high quality public services to members of the public.  Such services include the provision of information, financial and other support services, including more recently employers support, delivered on a daily basis by the Department of Social Protection to almost 1.5 million people, in a way that ensures they get the help and support they need, when they need it.  <br/><br/>The Department&rsquo;s Customer Charter, which is displayed in all public offices, sets out the standards of service that people can expect in their dealings with the Department.  The Customer Action Plan 2013 &ndash; 2015, which is available on , outlines a range of commitments and actions to help deliver a high quality service during the lifetime of the Plan. <br/><br/>In achieving its overall aim of providing people with the timely and customer-friendly information, financial and other support services they require, the Department is committed to ensuring that a customer service ethos is embedded in everything it does and is embraced by everyone in the organisation.</p></reply>

The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008 provided for the transfer of responsibility for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) to the Citizens Information Board (CIB), under the aegis of the Department of Social Protection. </p>  <p>  CIB delivers on its remit to provide services to the public by supporting a network of delivery partners which includes 42 local Citizens Information Services (CIS) and 51 local Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS).  </p>  <p>  In 2015, the CIB will receive a budget allocation of &euro;46m from the Department of Social Protection, of which &euro;17.94m will be allocated to MABS.  </p>  <p>  Among the strategic priorities set out in CIB&rsquo;s Strategic Plan 2012-2015, is the development and implementation of an integrated service delivery model that puts the citizen at the centre. </p>  <p>  In 2014, following a public procurement exercise, CIB commissioned a feasibility study to identify options for organisational integration by its delivery partners.  The aim was to develop clearer and more effective pathways to the provision of information, advice and advocacy services and thereby achieve better outcomes for citizens, and make optimum use of the state resources available to CIB.  The work was carried out by a company called Pathfinder, at a cost of &euro;78,000 excluding VAT, and was overseen by a Steering Group, comprising national representatives from Citizens Information Services staff and Boards, MABS staff and Boards and staff from the Citizens Information Board.  </p>  <p>  The work carried out by Pathfinder included extensive and comprehensive consultation with all stakeholders, including representatives of CIB&rsquo;s delivery partner services (CIS and MABS) at local level.   The study, which presents a number of options, was considered by the Board of CIB, which agreed to the establishment of a Design Group tasked with outlining and recommending possible new structural models.  The Design Group includes members of the voluntary boards and staff of a number of the CIS and MABS, together with representation from CIB management.  CIB has invited submissions from the representative of Boards and staff of CIS and MABS, to inform the deliberations of the Design Group.  This engagement with stakeholders will continue while the work of the Design Group is underway, before reporting back to the Board of CIB in due course.</p></reply>

Details of those detections, by year and by the counties in which they occurred, are set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Cavan</th><th>Donegal</th><th>Dublin</th><th>Laois</th><th>Louth</th><th>Meath</th><th>Monaghan</th><th>Offaly</th><th>Waterford</th><th>Totals</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>7</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Totals</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>11</td><td>2</td><td>16</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>35</td></tr></table>The Deputy will appreciate that it is inherently difficult to estimate the scale of any illegal activity, the capacity of fuel laundries and the impact of the criminal activity on the Exchequer. The Revenue Commissioners advise me that, while there is no reliable estimate of the extent of illegal activity in the fuel sector, they recognise that fuel fraud, including the laundering of markers from rebated fuel, is a significant threat to Exchequer revenues. Action against this illegal activity continues, therefore, to be a priority for Revenue, which is implementing a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem. Key elements of this strategy include the following:<br/><br/>- The licensing regime for auto fuel traders was strengthened with effect from September 2011 to limit the ability of fuel criminals to place laundered fuel on the market.<br/><br/>- A new licensing regime was introduced for marked fuel traders in October 2012, designed to limit the ability of criminals to source marked fuel for laundering.<br/><br/>- New requirements in relation to fuel traders' records of stock movements and fuel deliveries were introduced to ensure that data would be available to support supply chain analysis.<br/><br/>- Following a significant investment in the required IT systems, new supply chain controls were introduced from January 2013. These controls require all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, to make monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions. These data are being used to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution that will support follow-up enforcement action where necessary.<br/><br/>Following a joint process, Revenue and HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs in the UK have identified a new and more effective product to mark rebated fuels. The marker will be produced by Dow Chemical Company and will be introduced in the State and in the UK from the end of March 2015, providing a significant boost in the fight against illegal fuel laundering in both jurisdictions.<br/><br/>In addition, I have introduced a range of legislative measures in recent years to support Revenue's work in combatting fuel fraud, including reckless trading provisions that ensure a mineral oil trader is liable for the mineral oil tax evaded where that trader knew, or was reckless as to whether or not, in making the supply or delivery, he or she was participating in a transaction or series of transactions connected to the evasion of Mineral Oil Tax.  In the Finance Act 2014, I introduced measures to further strengthen Revenue's ability to refuse or revoke a mineral oil trader's licence where the trader does not comply with excise law, does not maintain adequate stock management systems and records, or provides false or misleading information. <br/><br/>I am advised also that the Revenue Commissioners co-operate closely with other enforcement authorities, in this jurisdiction and in Northern Ireland, in combatting the all-island problem of fuel fraud. The Cross Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group, which includes representatives of the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other relevant organisations, was established to facilitate this co-operation. I am assured that it has proven effective in supporting the identification and targeting of the organised crime gangs, many with links to paramilitaries and former paramilitaries, that are responsible for the bulk of fuel fraud. All of the enforcement authorities engaged in tackling fuel fraud and those responsible for it are committed to working closely together on an ongoing basis in this important work.<br/><br/>Revenue's strategy has already yielded significant results. Since mid-2011, 134 filling stations were closed for breaches of licensing conditions, over three million litres of fuel have been seized and 31 oil laundries were detected and closed down.  Industry sources indicate a much-reduced incidence of laundered fuel on the market and increased road diesel consumption and tax revenues are up 13% compared with a couple of years ago. Obviously, other economic factors have contributed to this growth but reduced fraud is an important factor.  <br/><br/>Details of closures, by county, for those years are set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Region</th><th>County</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Dublin</td><td>8</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Border Midlands West</td><td>Cavan</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Donegal</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Galway</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Longford</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Louth</td><td>13</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Mayo</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Monaghan</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Roscommon</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>- </td><td>Sligo</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Westmeath</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>East South East</td><td>Kildare</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Kilkenny</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Laois</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Meath</td><td>2</td><td>9</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Tipperary</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>- </td><td>Waterford</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Wexford</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>South West</td><td>Cork</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>- </td><td>Limerick</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>-</td><td>57</td><td>30</td><td>15</td></tr></table><br/><br/>The County breakdown for 2011 is not readily available.<br/><br/>It has been suggested on a number of occasions that the current system of marking lower taxed fuels should be replaced by one based on repayments to the users.  However, a change of this nature would impact on a wide range of users, would be costly to implement and would, itself, be at risk from fraud.  Marked gas oil has a wide variety of uses, including the propulsion of trains, in agricultural, construction and industrial machinery, for commercial sea-navigation (including fishing) and commercial and home heating purposes.  A change to a rebate system would involve the establishment of an expensive and wide-ranging repayments system and would place a new administrative burden on oil traders, on the large number of users and the Revenue Commissioners. It would also impose significant cash-flow costs on those currently using marked gas oil. <br/><br/>Repayment schemes are vulnerable to abuse and the introduction of a wide-ranging repayment scheme would not offer greater security against fraud than the current arrangements.  Fuel in respect of which a repayment of duty was made could be easily diverted to on-road use.  <br/><br/>For these reasons, and in light of the progress made by Revenue in tackling the problem, I am satisfied that the strategy being implemented by Revenue is the best course of action. I am also confident that the introduction of the new marker here and in the United Kingdom from the end of March will reinforce the measures already implemented.  <br/><br/>The penalties for offences relating to fuel smuggling and laundering are laid down in section 119 of the Finance Act 2001 and section 102 of the Finance Act 1999. On conviction following summary prosecution under these provisions, a court may impose a fine of &euro;5,000, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both. Where a person is convicted for an indictable offence, the court may impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or a fine not exceeding &euro;126,970, or both. In addition, where a person who is licensed to retail hydrocarbon oils is convicted of the offence of dealing in illicit fuel, a court may make an order for a temporary prohibition of trade. This order prevents the person convicted from selling or supplying any mineral oil for a period of up to 7 days for a first offence and up to 30 days for a second or subsequent offence.<br/><br/>The fines that may be imposed on conviction were increased in the Finance Act 2010 to an amount significantly higher than that which had applied previously. For example, the fine on conviction for an indictable offence was increased from &euro;12,695 to an amount not exceeding &euro;126,970.<br/><br/>The Courts decide on the level of fine to be applied in any particular case and, in practice, they do not apply fines up to the existing limits.  I have no plans at present to increase the penalties available to the Courts. However, the position is kept under review, taking account, among other considerations, of the practical experience of the application of penalties under the current provisions.</p></reply>

In addition the report stated that from their research they found significant positive results from training, with a trained farmer having on average 12% higher levels of output compared with an untrained farmer. </p>  <p>  Given that the purpose of the relief is to encourage the transfer of land to young trained farmers and as no compelling arguments have been put forward to justify increasing the age, I have no plans to increase the qualifying age from 35 years of age to 40 years.</p></reply>

NAMA expects that the other units for which demand has been confirmed will be delivered in 2015 on the basis that local authorities and approved housing bodies contract to purchase or lease the properties.<br/><br/>Once demand has been confirmed for units and contracts signed there is no impediment to the early delivery of properties by NAMA's debtors and receivers or directly through NAMA's social housing SPV, NARPS.In the case of NARPS, once demand has been confirmed by local authorities NAMA acquires the related properties from its debtors and receivers for onward leasing under long-term leasing arrangements to AHBs.The establishment of NARPS is one example of the initiatives that NAMA has taken, in conjunction with the other key stakeholders in this process, to streamline the delivery of properties for social housing.  NAMA has also introduced standardised leasing terms.  <br/><br/>The Deputy will note that, in the vast majority of cases, the properties for which demand has been confirmed require substantial completion or remediation work and the resolution of compliance issues in relation to planning conditions, and regulatory standards, title issues and Multi-Unit Development Act compliance including transfer of common areas and insolvent management companies.  It is NAMA's policy and practice that all properties are completed to a high standard, in compliance with all relevant planning and building regulations.In this context, NAMA has to date provided over &euro;20m for completion works to facilitate the delivery of properties for social housing. All properties contractually accepted by the AHBs and Local Authorities by end 2014 should be occupied by mid-2015 following the completion of remaining work.<br/><br/>Further detail on this initiative can be found at <br/><br/>The table below provides a detailed breakdown by local authority functional area of the properties identified by NAMA and the take up by local authorities.<br/><br/><b>Table 1: Social Housing Delivery by Local Authority</b><table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>Identified by NAMA</th><th>Demand Confirmed by Local authorities </th><th>Delivered </th></tr><tr><td>Carlow Co.

The number of posts to be filled will depend on critical vacancies arising, projected business needs and the number of posts that can be filled through redeployment and from internal promotion panels. Overall Revenue expects to fill around 400 posts from open competitions advertised in 2014 and 2015. All Revenue's open competitions will be advertised nationally and on the PAS website. </p>  <p>  In my Budget Statement I signalled an increase in Revenue resources as one of the elements of the Corporate Tax Reform Road Map to reflect  its role as 'competent authority' and in recognition of the many changes taking place globally in corporate tax. I fully support Revenue's proactive approach in sourcing the skilled professional and technical expertise required to allow it to deliver on its challenging role.  </p></reply>

The PPI Review included the sales by 11 credit institutions since July 2007 and resulted in a refund figure of &euro;67.4 million (including &euro;4.9 million in interest) to consumers.  353,806 policies were within the scope of the PPI Review.</p>  <p>  Credit institutions included in the PPI Review were required to demonstrate that their PPI sales were in compliance with the Consumer Protection Code.

The scheme was extended in the recent Budget to include repairs, renovations and improvements carried out on rental properties, where the relevant owners are liable to income tax.  Only works carried out by a tax compliant contractor qualify under the Incentive.  It is clear from the figures available that the Incentive has been very successful in boosting activity in the legitimate construction sector and ancillary services.<br/><br/>The electronic facility to allow homeowners claim their tax credit has been available since 13<sup>th</sup>January 2015.  To date, 1,970 claims have been processed, representing total tax credits of &euro;4.3 million.  The approach of linking activity to tax compliance is proving to be a successful means of levelling the playing pitch when legitimate traders are competing with those still operating in the shadow economy.

Accordingly, the law firm Matheson was engaged by the NTMA to:</p>  <p>  (i) advise on market norms in the private sector in terms of notice periods and post-termination restrictions;</p>  <p>  (ii) assess the adequacy of the protections in the current NTMA employment contracts/codes of conduct where employees leave the NTMA to join a commercial entity in the private sector that might gain an unfair advantage by employing them; and</p>  <p>  (iii) recommend changes that could be made in this area by the NTMA.</p>  <p>  This review applied across all the NTMA's business areas, including NAMA.  All NAMA staff are employees of the NTMA and under Section 42 of the National Asset Management Agency Act, 2009 the NTMA assigns staff to NAMA.  Other than a small number of staff reassigned from other functions within the NTMA, NAMA staff are employed on the basis of specified purpose contracts their employment lasts for as long as NAMA requires their particular function - or fixed term contracts. </p>  <p>  Matheson's principal recommendations were as follows:</p>  <p>  -  longer notice periods (3 to 6 months) to be introduced for middle and senior NTMA management employees.</p>  <p>  -  garden leave provisions to be included in all NTMA employment contracts.</p>  <p>  -  post-termination of employment restrictions (including cooling-off periods and non-solicitation of employees) to be considered on a case-by-case basis in respect of senior NTMA management employees in particular.</p>  <p>  However, Matheson stressed that the imposition of such restrictions would need to be balanced against the NTMA's need to recruit good candidates for whom such restrictions may act as a significant disincentive to taking up employment with the NTMA.  Furthermore, to maximise the prospects of enforceability, Matheson advised that any such restrictions would need to be drafted as narrowly as possible.</p>  <p>  It was proposed by Matheson that any required changes resulting from these recommendations would be introduced for new NTMA employees and for existing NTMA employees on promotion.  The NTMA accepted the Matheson proposals and is implementing them on this basis.</p>  <p>  With regard to staff assigned to NAMA, it should be noted that the 3 month notice period and garden leave provision were already in operation since the first employees were assigned to NAMA at the start of 2010.  A provision prohibiting certain activities in an employee's subsequent employment for a defined period of time has also been introduced on a case by case basis for new employees, in cases where employees have moved from fixed to specified purpose contracts, and on promotion.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of S202 provisions in the NAMA Act which are lifelong provisions with respect to confidentiality for all current and former staff assigned to NAMA and to members of the NAMA Board.</p></reply>

This means the ISIF has the dual objectives of investment return and economic impact.  There is little precedent for sovereign funds investing with such a mandate, although a number of such funds are beginning to emerge. <br/><br/>The ISIF Investment Strategy will be approved in due course by the NTMA, following consultation as specified in legislation with the Minister for Finance and with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<br/><br/>In recent months the NTMA, following consultation with the Department of Finance and a number of other Government Departments and Agencies in 2014, has been developing a new Economic Impact Framework which will be a key element of the ISIF Investment Strategy.  The Economic Impact Framework will seek to identify target areas for investment which have higher potential economic and employment impact, and will also facilitate the identification of categories of investment that would be expected to assist and accelerate normalisation of capital markets in Ireland following the financial crisis. <br/><br/>The ISIF has committed to a number of investments in Ireland including infrastructure, water, long-term financing for SMEs (both credit and equity) and venture capital.A detailed table of the commitments to Irish investments at 31 December 2014 is set out as follows:<table><tr><th>31/12/14</th><th>ISIF Commitment Capital (&euro;m)</th><th>3rd Party Capital (&euro;m)</th><th>Total Project size in Ireland (&euro;m)</th></tr><tr><td>SME Equity Fund- Carlyle Cardinal</td><td>125</td><td>167</td><td>292</td></tr><tr><td>SME Credit FundBlueBay</td><td>200</td><td>250</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>West Summit &quot;China Ireland&quot; Funds</td><td>72</td><td>36</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>Innovation Fund Ireland</td><td>125</td><td>125</td><td>250</td></tr><tr><td>Local Venture Capital Funds</td><td>116</td><td>460</td><td>576</td></tr><tr><td>Silicon Valley Bank</td><td>36</td><td>72</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Water</td><td>300</td><td>-</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Infrastructure Fund</td><td>250</td><td>67</td><td>317</td></tr><tr><td>Forestry</td><td>30</td><td>187</td><td>217</td></tr><tr><td>PPP Schools Bundle 3</td><td>14</td><td>121</td><td>121</td></tr><tr><td>PPP N11</td><td>18</td><td>165</td><td>165</td></tr><tr><td>Covanta project</td><td>44</td><td>456</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>WLR Cardinal CRE Mezz</td><td>75</td><td>195</td><td>270</td></tr><tr><td>Committed to Date</td><td>1,406</td><td>2,301</td><td>3,602</td></tr></table>Because of uncertainty regarding the nature of investment opportunities satisfying the Fund's commercial return and economic impact objectives that may emerge or can be developed, it is not feasible at this stage to estimate in advance what the economic activity and employment impacts of the ISIF may be.<br/><br/>In the interim, the NTMA is developing its capabilities for collating and analysing data to measure and report on economic impact of ISIF investments on an ex-post basis (i.e. after the investment has been made). This will require a completely new data set to be sought and reported on by funds and the underlying companies in which funds have invested and by companies or project sponsors in which the ISIF has invested directly. While it is standard practice that companies report financial information to their investors, the ISIF mandate will also require metrics that can be used to help assess economic impact to be reported. The NTMA expects to be able to publish a preliminary assessment of the economic impact of the investments made to date in Ireland by the ISIF during the second quarter of this year.</p></reply>

This is calculated as a percentage determined by the Central Bank, not exceeding 2 per cent, of the aggregate of the gross premiums paid to the insurer or insurer authorised in another EEA Member State in respect of policies issued in respect of risks in Ireland.  Currently, the levy is set at 2 per cent.<br/><br/>The Central Bank wrote to me in January after carrying out its annual analysis and I am currently examining the Central Bank's recommendations in respect of 2015.  <br/><br/>Tabular breakdown of Insurance Compensation Fund receipts in calendar year 2014 - Figures provided by the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice 2nd February, 2015<table><tr><th>Date</th><th>Details</th><th>Amount Received &euro;</th></tr><tr><td>10/1/2014</td><td>December 2013 collection from Revenue</td><td>76,399.41</td></tr><tr><td>12/2/2014</td><td>January 2014 collection from Revenue</td><td>9,599,334.22</td></tr><tr><td>13/3/2014</td><td>February 2014 collection from Revenue</td><td>5,398,132.15</td></tr><tr><td>15/4/2014</td><td>March 2014 collection from Revenue</td><td>25,397.53</td></tr><tr><td>15/5/2014</td><td>April 2014 collection from Revenue</td><td>4,027,112.60</td></tr><tr><td>12/6/2014</td><td>May 2014 collection from Revenue</td><td>13,433,972.71</td></tr><tr><td>10/7/2014</td><td>June 2014 collection from Revenue</td><td>18,247.00</td></tr><tr><td>14/8/2014</td><td>July 2014 collection from Revenue</td><td>14,497,444.32</td></tr><tr><td>17/9/2014</td><td>August 2014 collection from Revenue</td><td>2,736,346.44</td></tr><tr><td>13/10/2014</td><td>September 2014 collection from Revenue</td><td>29,010.87</td></tr><tr><td>12/11/2014</td><td>October 2014 collection from Revenue</td><td>13,506,928.12</td></tr><tr><td>15/12/2014</td><td>November 2014 collection from Revenue</td><td>2,321,297.98</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>&euro;65,669,623.35</td></tr></table>It should be noted that the above figures are net receipts less the cost and expenses of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners so the actual amount raised by the levy is higher than this.</p></reply>

The data matching exercise produced a list of properties in respect of which the HHC did not appear to be paid. </p>  <p>  Once the 'unpaid' cases were identified Revenue announced a compliance campaign, including a six week window (to 31 March 2014), to allow people get both their HHC and LPT affairs in order. In regard to HHC, the six week window was necessary because Revenue could not be certain that the 'unpaid' list was fully accurate due to the format of the information held on the LGMA database, for example capturing the details of the person that physically paid the bill rather than the liable person and not capturing data in respect of exemptions/waivers. </p>  <p>  In mid April 2014, Revenue wrote to the owners of approximately 274,000 properties who did not bring their HHC affairs up to date during the six week window. The notices clearly warned of the consequences of continued non-compliance and outlined the steps that needed to be taken to avoid debt collection/ enforcement sanctions, including making immediate payment or updating the HHC record where either exemptions or waivers applied. </p>  <p>  Revenue has informed me that since assuming responsibility for HHC it has collected in excess of &euro;40m in respect of approximately 253,000 properties, the vast majority of which has been collected since the compliance campaign started. Revenue has also informed me that there are still ongoing discussions in a significant number of cases where the accuracy of the liability is being challenged. Further payments are being received on a daily basis as these cases are finalised and phased payment arrangements are being accepted when requested in the same manner as applies to LPT.</p>  <p>  In regard to the Deputy's specific questions, Revenue has confirmed that to date it has issued mandatory instructions to employers/pension providers to deduct HHC in almost 45,000 cases and has offset over 19,000 payments to HHC from pending tax refunds. Revenue has also referred over 800 cases (combined HHC/LPT) to the Sheriff for collection and refused tax clearance certification in over 13,000 cases (combined HHC/LPT).</p>  <p>  Revenue has also confirmed that neither interest on late payment charges or surcharges on Income Tax, Corporation Tax and Capital Gains Tax returns have been applied in respect of HHC and no cases have yet been referred for either solicitor action through the Courts or Attachment.    </p></reply>

These operators include road haulage operators and bus/coach operators. The total amount repaid in 2013 and 2014 was &euro;0.7m and &euro;21.1m respectively. </p>  <p>  In order to facilitate broad access to the scheme and to enable effective validation of claims, the scheme is fully automated through the Revenue Online Service (ROS) and certain conditions apply to fuel purchases.  These controls are necessary as repayment systems are vulnerable to abuse and it is essential that they are tightly controlled whilst not impacting negatively on legitimate business.</p>  <p>  Purchases in bulk must be made from a licensed mineral oil trader, and delivered, in a quantity exceeding 2,000 litres, to a premises or place that is under the control of that qualifying road transport operator.  Purchases by means of a fuel card, approved by Revenue for that purpose, also qualify for repayment and there is no minimum requirement on purchases made in this way.  A fuel card will be approved where Revenue is satisfied that the fuel card provider will supply it with the information required about purchases of auto-diesel by means of that card.  Fuel cards are widely available and are usable across the road network and there are a number of fuel card providers who can supply suitable fuel cards to road transport operators and fuel retailers.  </p>  <p>  The conditions governing the scheme and the level of automation enable Revenue to validate claims and ensure prompt processing of repayments. These anti-fraud safeguards are designed to protect the scheme from abuse and restrict its application to legitimate operators. I am satisfied that the current arrangements represent an appropriate balance between the efficient processing of claims and controlling the risk of fraud effectively and I have no plans to change them. </p></reply>

Once the revised interpretation of Section 8 was confirmed, Revenue carried out a review of properties purchased during 2013 and wrote to individuals who may have been eligible for the relief advising them of their possible entitlement (which depending on the purchase date of the property could apply up to and including 2016).  Revenue also outlined how to apply for the relief and for refund of any LPT already paid.  </p>  <p>  In total, Revenue reviewed 12,191 potential 'Section 8' cases to establish entitlement to the relief.  Exemptions were granted in 4,305 cases (some commencing in 2014/2015 rather than 2013 depending on date of purchase) and refunds issued where the LPT was already paid.  Less than 600 cases have yet to respond to Revenue with the necessary clarifications.  </p>  <p>  Revenue has assured me that these outstanding cases will be dealt with as a priority as soon as the required clarifications are received.</p></reply>

However, funding was not provided and, consequently, this project has not been advanced.<br/><br/>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine consider it a priority that staff are consolidated in order to re-integrate and co-locate different business areas that have cross-over functions.  The OPW has been working with the Department with this consolidation in mind and in 2014, three leases in Gandon Court were surrendered and additional centralised space was leased in Portlaoise town.  In addition to the consolidation of staff, a rental saving of approximately &euro;100,000 per annum was achieved.  I order to achieve further consolidation, it is proposed to commence a space audit of the State owned Government Offices on the Abbeyleix Road.  This will establish the potential for consolidation of staff through re-configuration of the space with a more modern open plan layout and furniture.  The provision of the extension will be reviewed following completion of the space audit.<br/><br/>For commercial reasons, the Commissioners of Public Works do not release lease expiry dates.  The Commissioners advise that they would be happy to discuss this issue with the Deputy.</p></reply>

Where a person&rsquo;s former employer was a limited company and the company is in liquidation or receivership, the person may claim for payment of an award under the insolvency payments scheme. The purpose of the insolvency payments scheme, which operates under the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act, 1984, is to protect certain outstanding pay-related entitlements due to employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer. These entitlements include wages, holiday pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of minimum notice due under the Minimum Notice &amp;amp; Terms of Employment Acts, 1973-2001, and certain pension contributions.  Various other statutory awards made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal, Rights Commissioners, etc., are also covered by the scheme. There are statutory limitations on the amount payable.

In the four year period from 2011 to 2014 employment in IDA Ireland client companies in county Louth has doubled.  The latest Annual Employment Survey shows that there are 23 IDA Ireland client companies in County Louth employing 3,029 people in full and part time employment while the corresponding figure for 2011 showed that there were 1,511 employed in IDA Ireland supported companies.  In the same four-year period there were a total of 52 IDA Ireland-sponsored site visits by potential investors to the county.</p>  <p>  County Louth has strong clusters in international business services, with companies in the region such as eBay, Coca-Cola, National Pen and International Fund Services; and in manufacturing with companies such as Cargotec and Becton Dickinson. These international brands are an attraction for additional companies to potentially locate to the North East region. In 2014 alone Becton Dickson announced a &euro;16m investment and expansion of its headquarters in Drogheda while PayPal announced the expansion of its facility in Dundalk with creation of a further 400 jobs.</p>  <p>  County Louth also has a strong base of indigenous industry across a wide range of sectors.  In fact as recently as this morning, I was happy to be in Dundalk for the opening of a brand new, state-of-the-art Customer Engagement Centre established by SalesSense, Ireland&rsquo;s leading sales solution provider, which will lead to the creation of 100 jobs during the year.   There were 4,797 people employed in Enterprise Ireland assisted companies in County Louth in 2014.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s core focus is supporting the internationalisation of indigenous companies and the Agency does not arrange site visits of a type similar to IDA Ireland.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland recently launched a number of initiatives in the North East region (which includes County Louth) including the Competitive Feasibility Fund for the North East Region, which was launched in October 2014.  An Enterprise Start event was held last week on 27th January in the Dundalk office with 12 participants. Over &euro;5.4m in funding to companies was approved in 2014.</p>  <p>  In terms of infrastructure, Enterprise Ireland has supported five Enterprise Centres in County Louth, which include the Science Services Centre at Finnabair Business Park, the Creative Spark Enterprise Centre on the Inner relief road at Muirhevnamor and more recently The Mill Enterprise Hub in Drogheda.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Action Plan for Jobs 2015 was launched on Thursday last, 29th January.

The areas to be covered by the Regional Enterprise Strategies correspond to the eight NUTS III level regions at which data is collected by the CSO.

My objective is that six Regional Enterprise Strategies, including those for the Border and West regions, will be launched by July, with the two remaining Strategies in development. It is not intended that specific job creation targets will be set for each county in the Regional Enterprise Strategies, but, rather, that the Strategies will identify measures that can be taken to enable each region as a whole to realise its economic potential and create jobs, building on its existing competitive strengths.</p></reply>

There were no visits to County Longford during this period.  The number of visits to Co. Westmeath in each of the years 2011 to 2014 are set out in the following tabular statement (A).  For reasons of commercial sensitivity and client confidentiality information in relation to site visits is given on a county by county basis only.  While IDA Ireland does seek to influence, decisions as to where to visit and where to locate is ultimately a matter for the investor.<br/><br/>IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have a strong presence in Counties Longford and Westmeath.  Counties Longford and Westmeath are home to 22 IDA Ireland client companies employing 3,055 people.  As well as the FDI sector, there are 5,796 people employed in 149 Enterprise Ireland-supported jobs in Westmeath and Longford.  The Annual Employment Survey shows that since 2011, there were a total of 2,537 jobs created in IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland companies in Westmeath and Longford in the period 2011 to 2014, 780 of which were created in IDA Ireland client companies with 1,757 being created in Enterprise Ireland supported companies.  The breakdown of employment in respect of the years 2011 to 2014 in Co. Westmeath and Co. Longford and by agency is outlined in the following tabular statements (B).<br/><br/>Information for the Annual Survey is gathered on an annual basis and aggregated at county level.  Data is supplied by individual companies on a confidential basis for statistical purposes only so it is not possible to provide information in respect of individual locations.  Counties Longford and Westmeath are part of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s Midlands Region, along with the counties of Roscommon, Laois and Offaly.  The Region has a strong cluster in Medical Technology and Life Sciences and is home to key IDA Ireland clients such as Ark Consulting in Longford and Abbott, Covidien, Integra, GeneMedix elsewhere in the region generally.  In addition, the region is home to International Business Services companies such as Teleflex, AXA, NPD Group and PPD.  All of these companies are an attraction for potential IDA Ireland clients to locate in the Midlands and to provide employment opportunities for people living in both Westmeath and Longford.<br/><br/>The IDA Mullingar Business and Technology Park is an essential infrastructure to provide for FDI clients and also for indigenous companies interested in developing their business in the Midlands. For example, Patterson Pumps acquired a 1.62 hectare site from IDA under leasehold title in the Mullingar Business and Technology Park and are currently on site.<br/><br/>Growing both Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and indigenous enterprise is key to Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery. I am glad to inform the Deputy that 2014 was a record year for both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in terms of investment wins and job creation, with 7,131 net new jobs being created in IDA Ireland client companies and 8,476 net new jobs being created in Enterprise Ireland client companies.<br/><br/>As the Deputy is aware, the Action Plan for Jobs 2015 was launched on Thursday last, 29th January.  This is the fourth annual plan in a multi-year process, which started in 2012.  When the First Action Plan for Jobs was launched, unemployment stood at 15.1%.

Following the Reform of the CAP, changes were made to the payments under the Single Payment Scheme. Under the 2013 Scheme, payments were subjected to a 10% Modulation deduction with the first &euro;5,000 paid to all farmers exempt from the deduction. The monies deducted under Modulation were made available to Member State for funding Pillar II Schemes. From 2014 , the Modulation deduction no longer applied but the total amount of funding was deducted from the National Ceiling and permanently transferred to Pillar II. As the National Ceilings of Member States were reduced, the EU Regulations provided for a reduction in the value of payment entitlements to ensure compliance with the Ceilings. The discretionary provision in the Regulations to exempt any farmer, who was paid &euro;5,000 or less in 2013, was applied in Ireland in order to protect smaller-scale farmers. The rate of reduction in Ireland on all other farmers in order that the adjusted Ceiling would be respected was 10.49%. </p></reply>

This reflects the importance of the market to Ireland given that nearly a quarter of all European pigmeat was exported to Russia before trade was restricted and that in 2013, Ireland exported 20,165 tonnes of pork and pigmeat to Russia with a value &euro;55m. This was up from 15,057 tonnes (&euro;39m) in 2012. </p>  <p>  A high-level team from my Department visited Moscow on 18 December last for discussions with the Russian authorities on a range of agri-food matters which included the ban on pig products. This was followed by a second meeting on 10 January. The meetings were organised on foot of bilateral discussions which I had with the Ambassador of the Russian Federation to Ireland.  At those meetings the Russian authorities confirmed that they continue to view the ban as an EU-wide issue. Notwithstanding some media reports that certain EU MS are making particular progress on having parts of the ban lifted my understanding is that all MS are still restricted in full by the ban.</p>  <p>  At EU level the Commission has referred the matter to the WTO for resolution and the issue has also been on the agenda at the Council of Ministers. At recent Council meetings I have joined with other European Ministers in requesting the European Commission to continue to monitor developments on markets, and have called for the introduction of remedial measures such as private storage aid. The Commission have acknowledged the significant decline in pig prices and will keep the situation under review. They have also committed to actively working with Member States to remove SPS barriers to trade and open new markets, and agreed to provide an additional &euro;30m in funding under the EU Scheme for Promotion of Agricultural Products to support market developments in third country markets. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to report that overall Irish pigmeat exports in 2014 increased by 10%, to a value of &euro;570m. Exports to Asia alone are estimated to have risen by 20% to China, 210% to Japan and 650% to South Korea. International trade is expected to improve in 2015, reflecting the ongoing increase in demand in response to growing per capita wealth in China, and the redirection of pigmeat usually directed towards the Russian market to different locations such as South Korea and the Philippines.  I am pleased to report also that we have secured major market access successes in the second half of last year including Vietnam and the Philippines which are already proving to be valuable outlets for Irish pigmeat. </p>  <p>  I am of course aware of the current price difficulties for Irish pig farmers and have met with farm organisations and with processors on a number of occasions to discuss possible solutions to alleviate these difficulties. I am also continuing in my efforts to secure new third country markets, which has been a priority of mine since assuming office. I will continue to work closely with like-minded Ministers in the EU to persuade the European Commission to come forward with market response measures in response to current price difficulties. In addition my Department will continue to engage with the Russian authorities and with a view to lifting the pigmeat restriction as a priority. </p></reply>

However, funding was not provided and, consequently, this project has not been advanced.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine consider it a priority that staff are consolidated in order to reintegrate and co-locate different business areas that have cross-over functions. The OPW has been working with the Department with this consolidation in mind and in 2014, three leases in Gandon Court, Portlaoise were surrendered. </p>  <p>  OPW proposes to commence a space audit of the State owned Government Offices on the Abbeyleix Road, Portlaoise in the coming weeks.

The factory emissions were investigated by the EPA and no evidence was found to indicate that factory emissions were the cause of the individual&rsquo;s difficulties.

My Department has at all times sought to assist in every way possible the person concerned, most particularly through the extensive investigations undertaken on his behalf.  At a meeting of the Petitions Committee of the EU in March 2012, the Committee were advised that a remedy available to them in regard to trying to understand conflicting views of the significance of complex data was to ask the EU Commission and specifically DG Sanco to refer the report in question to one or other of the expert bodies available to the Commission such as the Joint Research Council or the European Food Safety Authority for an independent expert opinion.

His pension is liable to income tax and the universal social charge on the same basis as applies generally.  These are statutory deductions from his pension based on specific instructions as issued periodically to my Department by the Revenue Commissioners.  If the person concerned has any queries in that regard he is advised to contact his regional Revenue office directly, the address of which is shown on his Tax Credit Certificate or on any correspondence received from Revenue.  His pension is also subject to the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) measure.  This came into effect on 1 January 2011 in accordance with the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2010, as amended, as part of the programme of measures to urgently address the serious state of the public finances.  Under that legislation, the public service pensions of retired public servants such as the person concerned are liable to the PSPR reduction; however, the first &euro;12,000 of their gross pension is exempt. The PSPR is a tiered reduction, which is progressively more for those with higher rates of pension.  The amount of the PSPR decrease depends essentially on the person&rsquo;s date of retirement and their gross annual rate of pension.  In this person&rsquo;s specific case, the amount of his gross annual pension above the &euro;12,000 exemption threshold is liable to a PSPR reduction of 6%, which works out at an actual reduction of &euro;7.12 a month.  Income tax and USC are only then applied, as appropriate, to his pension after the PSPR deduction.  Details of the various deductions are shown on the monthly pension payslip of the person in question. </p></reply>

The Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel among the Garda Regions, Divisions, and Districts. Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources. <br/><br/>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of Tallaght Garda Station on 31 December 2014, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 170. There are also 12 Garda Reserves and 12 Civilians attached to Tallaght Garda Station. <br/><br/>As the Deputy will be aware, 100 new recruits entered training at the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014, the first intake of Garda recruits since 2009.  This was followed by an intake of a further 100 new recruits in December.  A further intake of 100 is due to enter training in the next few days. This will bring to 300 the number of recruits in the Garda College since last September and is a measure of this Government's commitment to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The first intake of recruits will attest as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in May of this year and will be assigned to Garda Stations by the Garda Commissioner.  The Garda Commissioner, will of course, continue to keep the needs of Tallaght Garda Station under review within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.<br/><br/>In relation to vehicles the provision and allocation of Garda transport is a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the light of her identified operational requirements and the availability of resources.  Responsibility for the efficient deployment of Garda vehicles in each Division is assigned to the Divisional Officer, who may allocate vehicles between stations, as required by operational circumstances. <br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that I recently secured an additional &euro;10 million for investment in the Garda fleet, &euro;7 million of which was made available in 2014, with the remaining &euro;3 million being provided in 2015. The additional investment of &euro;7 million enabled An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  to purchase 370 new vehicles towards the end of last year.  These vehicles will be allocated to Garda Divisions in line with the Garda Commissioner's operational requirements.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that the needs of the area referred to by the Deputy will be fully considered when these vehicles are being allocated.  <b><font color="#000080"></font></b></p></reply>

There are three grade levels for the PASO, starting at Grade 3 and progressing to Grade 1.  The circulars used to fill PASO posts made it clear that the PASO grades were posts in the Prison Service.

Regulation 3 provides that:<br/><br/>(1) The selection of members for promotion in competitions held under these Regulations shall be based on merit and the readiness and suitability for promotion of the candidates.<br/><br/>(2) Competitions shall be conducted in a manner which is -<br/><br/>(a) fair, impartial and objective,<br/><br/>(b) in line with best practice,<br/><br/>(c) consistent throughout, and<br/><br/>(d) open, accountable and transparent.<br/><br/>Prior to the interview stage, reports on candidates for promotion to all ranks from Sergeant to Chief Superintendent are completed by the candidate&rsquo;s supervisor appropriate to the rank being applied for.  In relation to ongoing investigations, the integrity of any internal Garda disciplinary inquiries or investigations by GSOC, and any related proceedings, must of course be respected. Where any findings are made against a member due process must be followed.  The Garda Code also provides for the reporting of concerns in relation to the conduct of any member who is on a promotion list, but again due process must be observed in the investigation of any such concern.<br/><br/>On completion of the interview process, a list of successful candidates is provided to the Garda Commissioner who then publishes the final list by way of bulletin throughout the organisation.<br/><br/>Appointments to positions at the rank of Sergeant and Inspector are made by the Commissioner and appointments to the ranks of Superintendent, Chief Superintendent and Assistant Commissioner are made by the Government (by way of Government memorandum brought by the Minister). In both cases appointments are made from the list in strict order of their position on the list.<br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that the of the post of Garda Commissioner was recently filled through open competition and that the vacant posts of Deputy Commissioner will be filled in the same manner.<br/><br/>Insofar as the management of the Fixed Charge Processing Office (FCPO) is concerned, the Garda authorities introduced a new policy, with effect from 16 June 2014, to give affect to the recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate Report on the operation of the Fixed Charge Processing System (FCPS).  The recent report of the Garda Professional Standards Unit recognised the significant improvements that have been made on foot of the new policy. <br/><br/>It is the case, however, that the report identified areas which require further attention and made a series of recommendations to address these.  A number of these recommendations relate to Garda operations and procedures and have been accepted by the Commissioner.  <br/><br/>The report also makes a number of recommendations with respect to legislative and related cross-cutting aspects of the FCPS, and I have referred these to the Criminal Justice (FCPS) Working Group for further examination. <br/><br/>I have also decided, again in the interests of maintaining public confidence in the system, to put in place a further assurance and oversight mechanism.  In particular, I have appointed Judge Matthew Deery, former President of the Circuit Court, to act as Independent Oversight authority for the FCPS cancellation process.</p></reply>

The ISI releases its statistics on a quarterly basis and the most up to date figures reflecting Quarter 4 of 2014 were published recently to their website .  2014 was the ISI&rsquo;s first full year of operation and during that time almost 1000<font color="#FF0000"> </font>debt solutions were approved, comprising 547 alternatives to bankruptcy and 448 bankruptcy cases.<br/><br/>85% of proposals for Debt Settlement Arrangements (DSAs) were successful and 71% of proposals for Personal Insolvency Arrangements (PIAs) were successful. Overall, 75% of proposals for DSAs and PIAs were successful. It is encouraging that three out of four proposals are being supported by creditors.  While this demonstrates that many financial institutions are constructively engaging in the process, clearly, some are not.<br/><br/>Last week, the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and I met with representatives of the Insolvency Service and a selection of Personal Insolvency Practitioners (PIPs) in order to hear first-hand the PIPs' experience of putting arrangements in place between people struggling with debt and their creditors. <br/><br/>A number of suggestions were made by the PIPs with a view to improving engagement by creditors in the process.  I will be considering these suggestions, and proposals received from a range of stakeholders, in the context of the review of the operation of the insolvency legislation, as committed to in the Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016, to ensure that the ISI has the powers necessary to support families willing to work their way through their debt problems.</p></reply>

There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail because, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.<br/><br/>Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that the accused person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses or evidence.  Section 2 of the Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, permits the courts to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where refusal of bail is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  A &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; is an offence listed in the Schedule to the Bail Act that is punishable by at least five years imprisonment.<br/><br/>In exercising its jurisdiction under section 2 of the Bail Act, a court is required to take into account the following matters:<blockquote>(a) the nature and degree of seriousness of the offence with which the accused person is charged and the sentence likely to be imposed on conviction,<br /><br />(b) the nature and degree of seriousness of the offence apprehended and the sentence likely to be imposed on conviction,<br /><br />(c) the nature and strength of evidence in support of the charge,<br /><br />(d) any conviction of the accused person for an offence committed while he or she was on bail,<br /><br />(e) any previous convictions of the accused person,<br /><br />(f) any other offence in respect of which the accused person is charged and is awaiting trial.</blockquote>If one or more of the foregoing matters is taken into account, the court may also take into account the fact that the accused person is addicted to a controlled drug within the meaning of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.<br/><br/>As regards reform of the bail laws, I can inform the Deputy that the preparation of the General Scheme of a Bail Bill to modernise the law on bail is at a very advanced stage and I intend to bring proposals to Government on the matter in the coming weeks.<br/><br/>While the primary aim of the proposed Bail Bill is to consolidate and update bail law, I wish to take the opportunity to seek, as far as is possible, within the constraints of the Constitution and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, to focus the legislation on the protection of the individual and of the public.  The intention is that the new provisions will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.  The new Bill will seek to improve the operation of the bail system and make the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against the commission of offences by persons on bail.</p></reply>

The report presents a penal policy which aims to make Ireland a safer and fairer place.  The rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders resulting in their desistance from crime is seen as the key to making Ireland safer.   The report sets out the adoption of a penal policy with the dual purposes of punishment and rehabilitation both in the imposition and management of criminal sanctions.  It also sets out a road map for the strategic development of penal reform into the future which will help modernise and shape how, we as a society, deal with some of the most complex issues involved in criminal justice and penal reform policy.</p>  <p>  Some of the report's recommendations can be implemented in the short to medium term, while others will require a more long term approach.  As an initial step, the Government agreed, in principle, to proceed immediately with the implementation of a number of key recommendations including the bringing forward of legislative proposals to establish the Parole Board on an independent statutory basis: preparing proposals and options for an open prison for female offenders.  Work is currently underway to implement these recommendations.</p>  <p>  The Strategy Statement 2015 - 2018 will set out how the Irish Prison Service, along with other statutory, community and voluntary sector partners, will implement the Report's recommendations to help reduce offending, improve opportunities for reintegration, improve outcomes more generally and to commit to treating each other fairly, with courtesy, respecting personal dignity, regardless of their role and background, as part of the prison community.  These principles will be at the heart of what we set out to achieve as we continue to build and harmonise policy and service delivery.</p>  <p>  The Strategy Statement 2015 - 2018 will build on the current Strategy which set out a challenging range of commitments in respect of our mission to provide safe and secure custody, dignity of care and rehabilitation to prisoners for safer communities.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that some key targets have already been met, most notably overcrowding has been eliminated in Mountjoy Prison and priority has been given to reducing overcrowding in Cork, Limerick and the Dochas Centre.  On 12 December 2014 the numbers in custody was 3,725.  This compares to 4,244 on 12th December 2012.</p>  <p>  In conjunction with the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service has continued the national roll out of the Community Return Programme, an incentivised scheme for earned temporary release under which carefully selected offenders can be granted structured temporary release in return for supervised community service.  This co-operative approach is a direct result of the Joint Strategy published with the Probation Service which aims to deliver more effective offender management.  This enhanced integration between both services is the realisation of the commitment in the Programme for Government to ensure better coordination in order to create an integrated offender management programme.  1,216 prisoners have taken part in the Community Return Programme since October 2011, and 909 have completed the programme.  In addition to Community Return, the Community Support Schemes have been set up in Cork Prison, Mountjoy Campus, West Dublin Campus and Limerick Prisons, the aim of which is to reduce recidivism rates by arranging for additional support structures and provide for a more structured form of temporary release.  At present there are 70 persons on temporary release with over 220 prisoners released onto this Scheme having successfully completed their sentences.</p>  <p>  I am proud that these positive initiatives are being taken during my time as Minister for Justice and Equality.  Over the lifetime of the proposed Strategy for 2015 - 2018, the Irish Prison Service will continue to build on progress it has made and will continue to promote respect for human rights, dignity and respect.</p>  <p>  I intend to launch the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service Strategy Statements in May 2015.</p></reply>

Details in respect of the Commission are available on my Department&rsquo;s website including a number of explanatory documents.  My Department is currently advancing arrangements with Judge Yvonne Murphy to establish the Commission as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The Commission is tasked with thoroughly examining the experience of mothers and children who were resident in 14 named Mother and Baby Homes and a sample of County Homes.  The Commission is required to address seven distinct questions related to the practices and procedures regarding the care, welfare, entry arrangements and exit pathways for residents of these institutions.  In accordance with the Terms of Reference approved by Government, the investigation will cover the period 1922-1998 &ndash; over three quarters of a century.  It is important to appreciate the scale of this investigation which will potentially involve tens of thousands of mothers and children who resided in these homes during the period.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the independent Commission has sufficient scope to examine a broad range of concerns, and to make a determination on their relevance to the central issues in question, and where appropriate to make any recommendations to me which the Commission deems necessary.  In this regard, I hope that this will reassure those who feel that the process to date may not have fully uncovered information relevant to their specific circumstances.</p></reply>

These programmes are, of course,  in addition to the support provided to all parents in the form of the Children's Allowance, which is a key Government support to help  families with ongoing costs.<br/><br/>The support programmes implemented by my Department include the free pre-school year provided under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) which provides support to low income and disadvantaged families, the Childcare Education and Training Programme (CETS) providing support to Solas and Education Training Board students and trainees, the Community Employment Childcare that supports Community Employment workers and the Afterschool Childcare Programme (ASCC) which provide childcare supports to eligible parents returning to work. <br/><br/>The above programmes represents an annual investment of approximately &euro;260 million and provides support each year to more that 100,000 children.

The funding schemes support the delivery of a range of universal and targeted youth work programmes and services for young people throughout the country, including those from disadvantaged communities.  Three of these targeted funding schemes, the Special Projects for Youth scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, and the Local Drug Task Force projects scheme, were the subject of a recently completed <i>Value for Money and Policy Review.</i>The review covered the period 2010 to 2012.  In 2012, expenditure on the schemes amounted to &euro;39.7m.<br/><br/>The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of a complex area to do with the impact youth service provision has in young people&rsquo;s lives.  Overall, the review found that the youth programmes can provide a significant contribution to improving outcomes for young people, and should be considered for ongoing public funding. <br/><br/>The review encountered problems with the availability of accessible data and administrative information deriving from the complexity of the historical development of the schemes and the governance arrangements under which they had been operated.  It noted that it was not possible to secure robust evidence of improvement in young people&rsquo;s lives, especially as these changes are subtle and can be hard to measure and-or to attribute to one intervention.<br/><br/>The review makes a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead.  It recommends that the three existing schemes be replaced with a single, targeted, evidence-based and outcomes-focused scheme designed to secure the optimal outcomes for young people and their communities. <br/><br/>The findings and recommendations of the review are being discussed by stakeholders in the consultations, which are under way at present, on the new proposed new National Youth Strategy.  I intend that the reforms recommended in the review will be progressed in the context of the new Strategy.  This work has been prioritised by my Department together with the development of the data management systems that will support good performance oversight of the youth programmes and provide assurance about efficiency and effectiveness in the provision of services for young people.  A project team, comprising youth service providers, funding administrators and other youth experts is being established in my Department to oversee the development and introduction of the new scheme over 2015 and 2016.</p></reply>

Its accountability lies in the main to the Minister for Health.  Having regard to the relevant sections of the Act, there is a certain amount of accountability to the Houses of the Oireachtas but in the most part the Minister for Health has the greater role in this regard. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Health can require the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (the NMBI) to provide him with information in relation to the performance of its functions. He can give general policy directions in writing to the NMBI in relation to the performance of the NMBI's functions and it shall comply with such directions.  The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) under the direction of the NMBI shall keep on a continuous basis proper books of accounts of all income and expenditure of the NMBI and of the sources of such income and the subject matter of such expenditure, and of the property, assets and liabilities of the NMBI.  The CEO shall keep, and account to the Board for, all such special accounts as the Minister or the Board, with the consent of the Minister, may from time to time direct should be kept. The NMBI has recently published Annual Reports for 2012 and 2013, including the accounts that have been signed off by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>  <p>  The NMBI has a statutory responsibility to ensure that it discharges its legal obligations within the financial resources available while also maximising efficiencies and income generation, in keeping with best practice in financial governance. </p>  <p>  I, with the Chief Nursing Officer, met with the President, Vice-President and Chief Executive of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland on 29th January 2015 to discuss the current dispute over the increased registration fee.  I again requested that the NMBI re-engage in discussions with the staff associations, as a matter of urgency.  I expressed my concern regarding the potential implications for the health service and patient safety should the current impasse over the annual retention fee increase continue.  I appreciate the registration fee is set by the NMBI which is a self-funding organisation.  It is facing considerable costs arising from changes to the way the laws regulating the professions operate, and also from handling fitness to practice complaints. </p>  <p>  I encouraged the NMBI to find an outcome which secures the Board&rsquo;s minimum financial operating requirements but avoids a potential scenario where nurses and midwives may be removed from the Register for non-payment of fees with potential consequences for service availability.  Taking nurses off the register in a few months time would create huge problems for hospitals and community facilities which need nurses to function, and for nurses themselves who would not be able to work or get paid if they were not registered.  Since that meeting the Board has agreed to engage in discussions with the staff associations, facilitated by a third party, on the means by which the board and staff associations might come to an agreement on the fee structure for the future. </p>  <p>  I will continue to monitor the situation closely in the interests of patient safety and continuity of care. </p></reply>

Irish citizens travelling to, or resident in, Taiwan can register their details on the Citizens&rsquo; Registration facility on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.dfa.ie. The Citizen&rsquo;s Registration service is a voluntary service which encourages Irish citizens travelling or living overseas to register their contact details with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  This means that in the event of an unforeseen crisis such as a natural disaster or civil unrest, the Department can proactively contact the citizen, ensure they are safe, keep them informed of any evacuation plans and provide assistance where necessary.</p>  <p>  Citizens resident in Taiwan are advised to submit their passport applications through the Irish Embassy in Beijing.  The turnaround time averages about 4-6 weeks which is the equivalent turnaround time for citizens resident in the UK.  Additionally, citizens requiring passport information may also contact the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin on +353 (0) 1 408 2000.</p>  <p>  If Irish citizens are in difficulty in Taiwan and require Consular Assistance, they can call our Consular Assistance Unit in Dublin on +353 (0) 1 408 2000.

The overarching aim of the Programme was to increase the number of Irish qualifying graduates with top quality international experience in their chosen discipline, thereby enhancing the capability of Ireland to trade internationally.<br/><br/>Officials in the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment carried out a review of the programme in early 2010. At that time, the core remit of F&Aacute;S was to focus its training and employment programmes on those cohorts who were most likely to remain unemployed. Following the review, it was decided that this programme did not fit with that core remit and that it would be inappropriate for F&Aacute;S to retain responsibility for its management and the programme was closed down. <br/><br/>At that time Enterprise Ireland managed a comparable overseas programme, aimed at graduates in almost identical disciplines. The overarching objective of the Enterprise Ireland's International Graduate Programme is the provision of in-depth international marketing experience to graduates to ensure that they can contribute to the success of emerging Irish companies in rapidly changing international business environments. I understand that this programme is still being managed by Enterprise Ireland.</p></reply>

The 2012 Act does not include provisions for the winding-up of the body.  While it is envisaged that it will be dissolved when the moneys at its disposal are expended, the precise timing cannot be predicted and accordingly it was deemed preferable to introduce amending primary legislation to dissolve the body in due course and not anticipate in advance how long it will have to do its work.</p></reply>

Primary legislation gives effect to this right and includes the Education Act 1998 and the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>  <p>  This Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area.  Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  Existing equality legislation, which outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values.  The Equality legislation provides that any school that has this objective may, where it has more applicants than places available, admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students.  The legislation also provides that a school whose objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values can refuse to admit a student who is not of that religion only where the school proves that this refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.</p>  <p>  It is my firm view that all schools should be inclusive.  It is with this spirit of inclusiveness that the proposed Admission to Schools Bill is designed.  Drafting of the Bill is currently at an advanced stage and the Bill is on the Government legislative programme for publication early in the Spring/Summer session.</p>  <p>  The draft Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation. The draft Bill, while including provision for single sex schools and denominational schools to reflect in their admission policy the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation, will provide for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion.  The draft Bill will also provide for schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.</p>  <p>  The Bill and its associated regulations should see improved access to schools for all pupils and ensure there is consistency, fairness and transparency in the admissions policies of schools and in the service they provide to parents.</p></reply>

This was intended to support communities by restoring roads, coastal protection, amenities/ facilities and other public infrastructure which had been damaged. It was agreed that the funding would be made available via the Votes of the appropriate Departments, viz Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport; Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine; the Office of Public Works and my own Department.

For the 2<sup>nd</sup>phase of severe weather, from 27 January to 17 February 2014, local authorities originally estimated current costs of &euro;3.5 million and &euro;8.5 million in capital costs.  By year end &euro;7.859 million was in fact disbursed by my Department to local authorities in respect of current costs and &euro;5.994 million in respect of capital costs in 2014.  Provision has been made in my Department&rsquo;s Vote for a further &euro;10 million in respect of capital costs to be incurred by local authorities in 2015 on repair and remediation projects.  No funding has been drawn down from my Department by the local authorities to date in 2015.

These guidelines retained the previous caps on store size in less populated and smaller towns, and were aimed at striking the right balance to ensure that local monopolies are not created in smaller towns which would be detrimental to competition;<br /><br />- the publication of 2 new Planning and Development Bills which include a provision for a vacant site levy as an integral part of the development planning process to incentivise the bringing into beneficial use of under-utilised urban land, vacant sites and buildings, thereby facilitating sustainable urban development and an efficient return on state investment in enabling infrastructure.</blockquote>In terms of Government action other than by my Department in providing assistance to retail businesses and stimulating economic activity in local communities, a number of measures have been introduced since 2011, including:<blockquote>- the introduction of the 9% rate of VAT oncertain goods and services;<br /><br />- the halving of the lower rate of employers&rsquo; PRSI;<br /><br />- the introduction of the Microenterprise Loan Scheme and Credit Guarantee Scheme, both of which schemes have had take-up from the retail sector; and<br /><br />- the extension of seed capital and the employment and investment incentive scheme to the retail sector.</blockquote>My Department remains committed to working with other Government Departments, with local government and with other community development and enterprise stakeholders with a view to providing a clear framework for addressing urban centre decline and its impacts on the retail sector, and will continue to explore appropriate options for further action in this regard.  </p></reply>

The current Programme officially finished at the end of 2013 having operated for four years with funding of &euro;281 million over that period.  It is being implemented on a transitional basis until March 2015, pending the roll out of the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) in April 2015  .  </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Public Spending Code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of services to clients, SICAP is subject to a public procurement process, which is currently underway.</p>  <p>  The public procurement process is a competitive process that is open to Local Development Companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new Programme.  In Stage one, joint applications were encouraged and organisations of varying sizes (for example smaller organisations working in consortia with larger organisations) were invited to submit joint applications.    That said, I understand that some small groups, such as the groups under the remit of the National Collective of Community Based Networks (NCCWN) faced a number of challenges in competing in the Stage one process.  The results of Stage one were released on 24 September 2014 and I can confirm that none of the NCCWN groups expressed an interest either as lead applicants or as part of a consortium.  I am now considering the implications of that for NCCWN and my Department is liaising with other relevant Departments to find a workable solution.  My Department will be meeting the NCCWN shortly. </p>  <p>  I should say that all groups who received LCDP funding in 2014 are being funded through LCDP interim arrangements until 31 March 2015, pending the outcome of the SICAP competitive process.  I can confirm that interim LCDP funding, based on a small budgetary reduction in the order of 6.5%, on 2014 levels, is being provided to NCCWN up to end March 2015.  In addition, my Department also supports a number of Women&rsquo;s Projects under the Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO).  This funding scheme, which supports national organisations in the community and voluntary sector, aims to provide multi-annual funding towards core costs associated with the provision of services.

The <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020: Support, Supply and Reform</i>builds on the provisions contained in Budget 2015 and sets out clear, measureable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list.  The total targeted provision of over 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme, will address the needs of the 90,000 households on the housing waiting list, with flexibility to meet potential future demand.  In committing to provide these 35,000 new social housing units, at a projected cost of &euro;3.8 billion, the Strategy marks a fresh start for social housing in Ireland.<br/><br/>Actions 1 and 4 of the Strategy require the agreement of national targets for delivery of social housing across local authorities in 2015 and in subsequent years.  The Project Board responsible for oversight of the delivery of actions and targets under the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>, has agreed a process on setting social housing delivery targets and consultation with individual local authorities in this regard is currently taking place.  As always, the specific plans and locations under which social housing provision will be made in County Louth will be a matter for Louth County Council as the housing authority for the area. Each local authority has responsibility for identifying their area&rsquo;s social housing need and responding as required, including planning and undertaking new social housing developments to meet this need.  </p></reply>

As was the agreed procedure for such meetings, minutes were not taken with the agreed outcome being communicated to the relevant parties by the Chair of the Irish Water Consultative Group, Mr Kevin Foley. This approach is adopted generally to meetings facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission.  The agreed framework for SLAs is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at the following link<font color="#0000FF"> </font><br/><br/>On the management side, my Department was represented along with the Local Government Management Agency, Local Authority Management, Irish Water and the Water Services Transition Office.  The staff side was represented by ICTU and member unions.<br/><br/>The concept of a service level agreement (SLA) was an essential ingredient of the transition plan proposed by the <i>Independent Assessment</i>conducted by PWC in 2011 on the question of establishing Irish Water.  PWC recommended this approach over a &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; transfer of all staff and functions, taking account of relevant labour laws, as this would allow Irish Water to implement a fit for purpose organisation structure without the constraints of the existing local authority system.  The Service Level Agreement would ensure continuity of service based on the local authority knowledge of assets and operations and would be most likely to deliver efficiencies earlier, reduce the risk of failure and maintain security of supply during the transition.<br/><br/>The unwinding of these interim arrangements were, in PWC&rsquo;s view, a matter to be determined by Irish Water in consultation with my Department and local authorities.  While they recommended that the SLA would conclude by the end of 2017, they acknowledged that Irish Water might wish to enter into longer term agreements with local authorities for specific purposes.<br/><br/>Following public consultation on this report, the Government agreed and published the <i>implementation strategy for the water sector reform programme</i>.  This implementation strategy acknowledged the potential scope for local authorities to continue to act as agents of Irish Water beyond 2017.  The strategy identified the need for engagement with staff on the reform programme, given its scale and complexity, and the implications for the staff concerned.<br/><br/>All discussions at the Irish Water Consultative Group were set in this context and were reflected in the positions adopted by the management side.  The management side would not have agreed to the framework, unless the management side was satisfied that it would provide an appropriate mechanism to meet the Government&rsquo;s objectives in reforming thewater sector by improving its efficiency and effectiveness and increasing capital investment would be achieved. <br/><br/>The final proposition of a 12 year SLA was considered important in delivering on these aims and was balanced with providing greater certainty to local authority staff.  The SLA term, within a broader framework, was an important backdrop to local authorities embracing the change required and investing time and effort in underpinning an enduring relationship with the new utility, whilst ensuring that accompanying measures provide for the establishment of a high performing water utility on a timely basis with benefits accruing to the customer.  The SLA provides for the agreement of annual service plans which deal with issues such as transformational change and headcount.  The number of staff employed under the SLA has decreased by 10% in the first year of operation of Irish Water.  </p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it.  The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.  Any business connected to a public water supply is liable for charges as a non-domestic customer.  If the premises is also used for domestic purposes, such as a bed and breakfast, it is termed a mixed - use customer.  Mixed -   use customers will be billed separately for their domestic and non-domestic water services and will have a separate account number for each. Mixed-use customers will be charged for the domestic component of their usage based on occupancy.  For the domestic component, single adult households will pay a maximum of &euro;160 per year; multi-adult households will pay a maximum of &euro;260 a year.  Mixed-use dwellings that register with Irish Water will be eligible for the &euro;100 water conservation grant.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the existing arrangements for all non-domestic customers are remaining in place with no changes for the time being.  On this basis, the local authorities will continue to bill for non-domestic water services as agents of Irish Water and the non-domestic component of their consumption will continue to be charged according to the current non-domestic tariff arrangement.  In the case of a metered customer, the volume to be charged at the non-domestic rate will continue to be the metered volume in excess of the current local authority domestic allowance.  As part of the water pricing policy which provided for non-domestic water charges, local authorities were required to provide mixed-use customers with an allowance in respect of their domestic consumption.</p>  <p>  The CER will be reviewing all aspects of non-domestic water tariffs under a series of public consultations and will publish the time-line for this process in the next few months.</p></reply>

This is reflected in the fact that local authority numbers started to reduce from June 2008.  The number employed across all local authorities at the end of June 2008 was 37,243; by end December 2014, this had fallen to 26,735 representing a reduction of 10,508 or 28%.</p>  <p>  Since the implementation of the moratorium, and the large staff reductions, local authorities have undertaken work force planning to identify how the remaining staff can be optimally deployed and where there are real vacancies that need to be filled.  This process in turn informs the sanctioning process. Local authorities have re-deployed staff and re-allocated work to fill the gaps.  Where the gaps can&rsquo;t be filled, local authorities apply to my   Department seeking sanction to recruit.</p>  <p>  The Department has carefully operated its delegated sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to facilitate the targeted replacement of staff in key service areas where specific exemptions are available subject to appropriate applications being made.  In this regard, over 7,200 local authority staff sanction requests have been approved by my Department since the moratorium was introduced in 2009.</p>  <p>  As announced in the recent Budget, it is proposed that with effect from 2015, the moratorium and the Employment Control Framework for the Public Service will be lifted but recruitment/promotion will be subject to adherence to binding three year pay ceilings.  Staffing resources must be managed within these overall ceilings.  Detailed arrangements in terms of the local authority sector are currently being worked out between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

These draft revisions proposed:<br/><br/>- The setting of a more stringent day and night noise limit of 40 decibels for future wind energy developments;<br/><br/>- A mandatory minimum setback of 500 metres between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations: and<br/><br/>- The complete elimination of shadow flicker between wind turbines and neighbouring dwellings.<br/><br/>A public consultation process was initiated on these proposed draft revisions to the Guidelines, which ran until February 21 2014.  My Department received submissions from 7,500 organisations and members of the public during this period. It is intended that the revisions to the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines will be finalised as soon as possible.  In this regard, account has to be taken of the extensive response to the public consultation in framing the final guidelines.  Further work is also advancing to develop technical appendices to assist planning authorities with the practical application of the noise measurement aspects of the Wind Guidelines.<br/><br/>  The revisions to the Wind Energy Development Guidelines 2006, when finalised, will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  In the interim, the 2006 Guidelines continue to apply to existing planning applications.  Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions under the Planning Acts.</p></reply>

The increased capacity resulting from the new structures will increase the scope for developing and enhancing services to the public, providing a broader range of services to the same high standard across the country.<br/><br/>In this context, a central management team with an enhanced management structure will be established for Cavan and Monaghan.  The new management structure will be led by one county librarian and will be based in a single library headquarters, the location of which will be a matter for local decision between the respective local authorities.  The new management structure will facilitate a more efficient allocation of functions across senior management, will enable greater strategic planning and ensure a better focus on, and delivery of, an increased range of services to the public.<br/><br/>There will be no decrease in the number of library services or library branches.  The role of each local authority and their public representatives will be safeguarded and there will be no erosion of either local authority&rsquo;s responsibilities.  The provision of a library service will continue to be a core local authority function and each library service and library branch will continue to be locally branded and identified with the individual local authority.  Each local authority will also continue to be responsible for policies, priorities and budgets for their library services to reflect local needs, priorities and resources.  The county librarian for the new structures will be responsible to and available to each county council.</p></reply>

My Department assists local authorities in carrying out their role as competent authorities under waste legislation, which is to take the necessary measures, on behalf of the State, to ensure that any waste generated and left abandoned by diesel launderers is disposed of without endangering human health and without harming the environment.<br/><br/>Approximately 1,200 incidents of diesel laundering waste dumping have been dealt with by local authorities to date and my Department has up to now reimbursed the costs associated with such disposal on a case by case basis.  The majority of the clean-up operations have taken place in Louth and Monaghan with 596 and 509 sites, respectively.  Similar clean-up operations have also been carried out in Counties Cavan, Donegal, Offaly, Meath and Waterford.<br/><br/>Details of the significant amount s provided by my Department from the Environment Fund since 2008 on a per county basis are set out in the table. <table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Louth County Council </th><th>Monaghan County Council </th><th>Offaly County Council </th><th>Cavan County Council </th><th>Donegal County Council </th><th><br /><br />Total </th></tr><tr><td>2008 </td><td>&euro;448,460 </td><td>&euro;109,615 </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>&euro;558,075 </td></tr><tr><td>2009 </td><td>&euro;314,678 </td><td>&euro;45,632 </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>&euro;360,310 </td></tr><tr><td>2010 </td><td>&euro;246,211 </td><td>&euro;28,414 </td><td>&euro;29,270 </td><td></td><td></td><td>&euro;303,895 </td></tr><tr><td>2011 </td><td>&euro;939,315 </td><td>&euro;89,588 </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>&euro;1,028,903 </td></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>&euro;1,452,267 </td><td>&euro;347,350 </td><td></td><td>&euro;23,458 </td><td></td><td>&euro;1,823,075 </td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>&euro;693,048 </td><td>&euro;150,946 </td><td></td><td></td><td>&euro;40,753 </td><td>&euro;884,747 </td></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td>&euro; 706,159 </td><td>&euro; 601,244 </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>&euro;1,307,403 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>&euro; 4,800,138 </td><td>&euro; 1,372,789 </td><td>&euro;29,270 </td><td>&euro;23,458 </td><td>&euro;40,753 </td><td>&euro; 6,266,408 </td></tr></table><br/><br/>There is strong and active co-operation on this and other waste management issues between the relevant enforcement authorities on both sides of the Border, involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other enforcement agencies.  My own Department, as part of on-going cooperation on repatriation of illegally deposited waste in Northern Ireland, has held discussions with the Northern Ireland authorities on the need to develop a mechanism for dealing with waste from cross-border diesel washings which would be factored into the overall discussions on waste repatriation.  These discussions are on-going.<br/><br/>As indicated previously, I have written to my counterpart in the Northern Ireland Executive, Minister Mark Durkan, to highlight again the problems being faced by border counties exposed to the consequences of environmental crime and I have signalled to him that this is an issue that I will be raising at the next meeting of the North South Ministerial Council in May.  The Council meets in the Environment Sector in order to make decisions on common policies and approaches in a cross-border context in areas such as environmental protection, pollution, water quality management and waste management and this is, I believe, the most appropriate forum to address this serious issue from a waste and water quality perspective.<br/><br/>The illegal deposition of waste material arising from diesel laundering activities presents the local authorities with major difficulties as the task of cleaning up the material needs to be dealt with to avoid threats to the environment.  The laundering process requires the use of chemicals such as sulphuric acid and bleaching agents and results in a waste by-product, a tar-like chemical compound or sludge, with significant potential for environmental pollution, particularly in relation to watercourses.<br/><br/>I believe that a complete solution to this problem must necessarily involve effective and co-ordinated enforcement of the law from both a revenue and waste management perspective.  In that context, my Department continues to liaise with representatives of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the local authorities concerned and the EPA&rsquo;s Office of Environmental Enforcement to seek to identify more effective enforcement solutions and these engagements will continue.</p></reply>

This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>It is fully recognised that people with mortgages borrowed from local authorities have been affected by issues such as unemployment and possible negative equity over the last number of years.  The scale of the mortgage arrears problem amongst Local Authority borrowers necessitated introduction of a Local Authority Mortgage to Rent scheme in February 2014 in line with the MTR Scheme introduced nationally in June 2012.<br/><br/>The Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) scheme, which was rolled out nationally in February 2014, allows local authorities to offer the mortgage to rent scheme to local authority mortgage holders with unsustainable mortgages.  This enables families to stay in their home and their established community.  Surrendering the ownership equity in a home is a very difficult decision for a family; however, the mortgage to rent option does provide families with stability and continuity, after an often long period of financial turmoil.  Ownership of the home transfers to the local authority and the family pays a differential rent.<br/><br/>LAMTR is just one of a range of short term and long term solutions available to local authority mortgage holders in arrears.  The Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, already in place in respect of commercial mortgages, is now being implemented across all local authorities.  In cases of acute mortgage distress, homeowners also have the option of seeking to avail of the legal process now also in place to deal with personal insolvency.  The most important step any family in arrears can take is to engage early with the Arrears Support Unit of the local authority. Solutions are available and advice should be sought as early as possible.<br/><br/>My Department publishes a wide range of housing statistics, including the number and value of local authority mortgages with a breakdown of those in arrears for more than 90 days.  The most recent statistics in respect of Q2 2014 are displayed on my Department&rsquo;s website &ndash;- by clicking &ldquo;Mortgage Data/Arrears in Local Authorities&rdquo; under the Housing Loans contents.</p></reply>

Where a structural guarantee is in place , there may be obligations on the guarantee provider if the defects fall within scope of the structural guarantee.  There may also be a role for the Management Company where structural defects arise in an apartment complex.

The remediation of defects is a matter between the contracting parties, i.e. the homeowner, the builder /developer and/or their respective insurers. Where a structural guarantee is in place , there may be obligations on the guarantee provider if the defects fall within scope of the structural guarantee. In the event that the contracting parties cannot reach a settlement by negotiation the option of seeking redress in the Courts can be considered.   </p>  <p>  The Building Control Acts 1990 to 2007 set out a clear statutory framework for construction activity based on: </p>  <p>-  clear legal standards as set out in the Building Regulations;     </p>  <p>-  detailed Technical Guidance Documents to outline how these standards can be achieved in practice; </p>  <p>-  the burden and responsibility for compliance resting first and foremost with developers/builders; </p>  <p>-  a statutory responsibility for professionals who are engaged by developers to ensure that construction at least meets the legal minimum standards; and </p>  <p>-  the responsibility for enforcing compliance with the Building Regulations resting with the 3 1 local building control authorities.   </p>  <p>In addition, the Building Control Amendment Regulations 2014 , which came into effect on 1 March 2014, now require greater accountability for demonstrating compliance with the Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates. I am satisfied that these measures are appropriate and will ensure a greater emphasis on competence, professionalism and quality in our construction industry into the future thereby ensuring that homeowners and construction clients can rely on getting the high quality homes and buildings they expect and deserve. </p>  <p>  The online Building Control Management System (BCMS), which was developed by local authorities , also came into operation on 1 March 2014 in line with the commencement of the new regulations in order to provide a common platform for clear and consistent administration of building control matters across the local authority sector. The system will facilitate a risk analysis of all projects for which commencement notices are received , which will inform each building control authority&rsquo;s own inspection arrangements thus ensuring that available inspection resources are used to optimum effect.</p>  <p>  The enhanced professionalism and accountability arising from the arrangements under the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014   will lead to improved quality and reduce risk within the construction sector. This will, in turn, lead to market conditions more conducive to insurers and a wider availability and use of latent defects insurance.  Nevertheless , my Department has also undertaken to explore the potential for latent defects insurance on construction projects as a potential means of consumer redress as part of the wider reform of building control arrangements.   </p></reply>

Contrary to the assertion in the Deputy's Question, neither I nor the Government decided to cut or terminate the NBS.<br/><br/>In accordance with the EU State Aid clearance for the Scheme, the NBS contract was for a 68 month period and it expired in August 2014. The expiry of the NBS contract has not resulted in any switch-off of services and there are now commercial options, in terms of access to basic broadband, available to consumers in NBS areas. <br/><br/>The Government is now focused on the provision of high-speed broadband services in rural parts of the country where commercial operators are unlikely to invest due to poor commercial returns. The National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service. <br/><br/>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades. Approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.<br/><br/>On 24 November last, a public consultation on a national high speed coverage map 2016 was launched. This consultation will close on the 12th February next. The map can be accessed at . The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016. The AMBER areas show the target areas for the State intervention.<br/><br/>The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises or home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. It also provides detailed information on over 50,000 townlands throughout the entire country.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will be also delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.<br/><br/>In tandem with the mapping consultation, intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy. The strategy will address a range of issues in relation to the intervention including the optimum procurement model, ownership model for the infrastructure, intervention cost and likely market impact. <br/><br/>Following the public consultation, towards the end of this year a detailed procurement process will be undertaken in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders. The Department will design a tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost of the network build as low as possible. I anticipate that the first homes and businesses will be connected in 2016 and connections will continue thereafter, with the intention of having all premises connected within a 5 year period. <br/><br/>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government. It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland.</p></reply>

I understand discussions were positive.</p>  <p>  Phase 1 of the Great Eastern Greenway is a 5.6km off road greenway running from Carlingford to Omeath. This section was completed by LCC in 2014  with funding provided by my Department under the National Cycle Network (NCN) 2012-2013 programme, with additional funding from the Loughs Agency and LCC.</p>  <p>  Separately, LCC submitted two applications for funding under the current NCN 2014-2016 funding programme for Phases 2 and 3 of this greenway but was unsuccessful.  LCC applied for funding in respect of two short extensions at both ends of the current greenway, which would add, subject to funding, more value to the project and result in a continuous greenway of approx. 16km.</p>  <p>  All current funding available to my Department for the delivery of greenways is  fully committed to end 2016.  However, given the success of greenways already delivered, I feel optimistic that funding may become available from other sources over the coming years.  The EU Structural Funds Programme 2014-2020 is currently being finalised and there may be significant opportunities for cycle infrastructure development under Interreg and the Rural Development Programme.  I understand that LCC is positioning itself to benefit from any possible opportunities that may arise.</p>  <p>  Projects of the scale of the proposed Great Eastern Greenway are important to the development of the NCN given that while they cater for all levels of cyclists they present a real challenge to the more experienced cyclists both from home and abroad so adding to the valuable tourism product which cycling (and walking) routes have become.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure you that my Department officials are monitoring the ongoing developments in relation to this project.</p></reply>

The local contribution for these schemes is 20% of the total cost of the project.  Furthermore, it is open to local authorities to supplement the percentage of their Discretionary Grant that they can use for the LIS with their own resources.<br/><br/>Some local authorities want a ring-fenced LIS allocation for private roads while others prefer to put the funding into public roads. I think this decision is best made at a local level.</p></reply>

This may be a source of funding for progressing the initial stages of this project.<br/><br/>Finally, I  always recommend that Community Groups work closely with the relevant local authority to continue to progress plans for suitable projects so that when funding does become available they are in a position to apply for that funding.</p></reply>

My Department is now implementing this revised model in accordance with the <i>Guidelines on Appointments to State Boards</i>issued by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, last November. The guidelines provide that:<i>&quot;At the time of the appointment of new members of State Boards, information shall be published by the relevant Department, for example in the press release announcing the new member(s), on the specific reasons the person(s) appointed meet the criteria determined by the relevant Minister for the role.&quot; </i><br/><br/>The guidelines do not propose the publication of the Curricula Vitae of the successful candidates.<br/><br/>With regard to the specific issue referred to in the Deputy's Question, I assume that this relates to a decision made by an official of my Department last year under the provisions of the Freedom of Information (FOI) legislation. I am advised that the decision, which was made independently by the official in question, took account of all relevant factors, including matters relating to personal information. I am also advised that the requester in that case did not avail of the option to appeal the decision. As Minister, I have no role in determining what information is released in response to FOI requests.<br/><br/>I should also add that board membership details are generally published on the websites of the relevant bodies operating under the aegis of my Department. In many cases, these include biographies of board members and I expect that this practice will continue.</p></reply>
