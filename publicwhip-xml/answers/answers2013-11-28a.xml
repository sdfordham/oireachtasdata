The Department carried out a Fraud and Error survey on child benefit in 2012 which confirmed the Department&rsquo;s view that the child benefit scheme is a low risk scheme in terms of fraud and error and that the existing control policy is effective.</p><p>  Child benefit is a universal monthly payment made to the parents/guardians of children that assists families with the cost associated with raising children. Child benefit is paid to around 606,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children with an estimated expenditure of around &euro;1.9 billion in 2013.  I am very conscious of the requirement to safeguard the Child Benefit budget and, in this regard, my Department has taken a proactive approach to ensuring that it is only paid to eligible families. A control strategy has been adopted and operated by the Department which includes risk assessment, surveys of the levels of fraud and error, scheme specific review policies, data matching initiatives with both external and internal parties and investigation of anonymous reports. These control tools ensure that review activity is targeted in the most effective manner and the results are monitored.</p><p>  One of the main features of the child benefit control programme is the issue of continuing eligibility certificates to customers.  Another key measure, for customers who are paid at their local post office, is the monthly check carried out where the customer must certify that they qualify for the payment. The Department has also begun the phased roll out of the Public Service Card which features photographic identification of the customer.  The Department commenced the issue of eligibility certificates to parents in 2008 and the control policy for the child benefit scheme was again reviewed in 2010. <font color="#FF0000"> </font>The percentage of savings arising from the eligibility certificates has been falling year on year proving the effectiveness of the control programme. The child benefit control programme is kept under regular review based on the outcomes achieved.</p></reply>

Revised rent limits under the rent supplement scheme came into effect from Monday 17 June 2013 and will be in place until 31 December 2014.  The new rent limits have been determined following an extensive review of the private rental market based on the most up-to-date data available.  There have been increases in the maximum rent limits in Dublin and Galway and some reductions across a number of counties, reflecting the market conditions in those areas.</p><p>  The cost of the rent limit review for 2013 is some &euro;7 million which can be met from within the overall provision for the scheme.  The Department continues to monitor rent levels throughout the country and officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met.  I have no plans to further revise the rent limits at this time.  Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities.  Officials in the Department are working with those in the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, who are leading the project, in developing the necessary legal, policy and operational requirements to give effect to this transfer.  The Department is advised that following the enactment of the relevant legislation, HAP testing will be carried out in selected local authorities during 2014.</p></reply>

The Department is committed to developing and implementing a case management approach, across the full range of its services, with a focus on working with the person rather than administering a range of benefits.  In implementing this challenging programme of change, the objective is to ensure that all services provided are co-ordinated and support customers through the development of improved processes and the concentration of staff and resources in integrated units.  Skilled and knowledgeable case managers will work with individuals in need, to ensure that they not only receive the appropriate income supports but are also helped to find a way in which they can participate to the fullest extent possible in their community, economy and workforce.  A case management approach with a focus on the individual, and the development of a tailored plan for each person will produce better outcomes than the traditional transaction focused delivery of scheme services.</p><p>  It is in this context that the delivery of Community Welfare Services in Dublin 12 has changed.  The Department is progressing a number of elements to integrate services and to deliver a more efficient and effective service.  Rationalisation and reorganisation in Dublin 12 has occurred over the past 6 months and continues to be under review.  Rent and Mortgage Supplements are now dealt with centrally through a phone and postal service.  An integrated decision making process has been introduced in Bishop&rsquo;s Square Intreo Office, where people applying for primary payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and one parent family payment now no longer need to present to a local Community Welfare Officer for an interim payment. </p><p>The remainder of the Community Welfare Service for Dublin 12 is now being delivered through the formation of a Hub (team based approach).  This Hub was to be permanently located in Parnell Road Health Centre but preparatory works uncovered a number of structural flaws in the building.  It therefore became necessary to move this service to Castle Street in order to ensure continuity of service.  Cashel Road Health Centre had already been designated by the Health Service Executive for closure.   </p><p>  Notwithstanding these changes the full range of Community Welfare Services continues to be delivered to Dublin 12.  It also remains the intention of the Department to return this service in some form locally to Dublin 12 and options are being explored in order to facilitate this.  The service offered from Castle Street includes public opening hours as follows: Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday 2.15pm-3.30pm, and Friday 2.15pm-3.00pm.  An outreach clinic by appointment is operating from Dublin City Council offices in Crumlin Village.  These services are also supplemented by home visits and by the phone and postal service.  The staff and service will be operated in a flexible manner so as to accommodate people experiencing difficulties in accessing Castle Street whether this is for mobility reasons or other personal circumstance.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-28a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112800045#WRB00500"><p>The original purpose of the mortgage interest supplement scheme was to provide short term support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.  There are currently approximately 10,500 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement.  The Government has provided &euro;41.8 million for the scheme in 2013. The Government wants to provide an environment where mortgage holders can pay for and stay in their home but, where people have a genuine difficulty in meeting their financial commitments, they will have a framework to address and resolve that difficulty in an appropriate and fair way having regard to the particular circumstances of the case.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy to assist those in mortgage difficulty is built around the following measures, as recommended in the 2011 Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group (Keane Group), in four main distinct areas:</p><p>- Lenders providing sustainable and durable resolution options to their borrowers. </p><p>- A social housing response (Mortgage to Rent). </p><p>- Comprehensive advice to borrowers. </p><p>- Personal Insolvency Reform. </p><p>  In the context of the overall strategy, the continued payment of mortgage interest supplement does little to assist recipients in improving the long term difficulty in addressing their mortgage problem and provides little incentive for the lender to provide sustainable solutions. The Keane Group&rsquo;s over-arching theme was that the mortgage interest supplement scheme is not an appropriate long term support and should become a time bound payment with an appropriate exit strategy to be formulated for the recipient. </p><p>  As part of the fiscal adjustment required for Budget 2014, provision was made for the discontinuation of entitlement to mortgage interest supplement for all new applicants from 1 January 2014.  Existing customers are not affected by this measure and may retain entitlement to the scheme over the next four year period.  However, it would be expected that during this four year period, existing customers would no longer require this support through sustainable solutions being put in place, securing employment or exit strategies sponsored by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, namely the Mortgage to Rent scheme. </p><p>  Under the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, lenders are obliged to put in place Arrears Support Units to deal with borrowers under the MARP.  The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing short term mortgage difficulties can be supported is through engagement with their lender under this process.  Lenders must explore all options for repayment arrangements in order to determine which options are viable for each particular case.  These options include interest only arrangements and deferring payment of all or part of the instalment repayment for a period. </p><p>  Budget 2012 provided an amendment to the scheme that from mid June 2012 mortgage interest supplement is not payable until applicants have agreed with their lender and complied with an alternative payment arrangement for a cumulative period of not less than 12 months. The numbers on the scheme has continued to reduce since the introduction of this condition which indicates that the MARP process has succeeded in addressing customers&rsquo; short term financial difficulties. </p><p>  I am satisfied that the range of supports implemented by this Government, including the range of information and guidance resources available, are appropriate in assisting those facing mortgage difficulties following the discontinuance of the mortgage interest supplement scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-28a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112800045#WRB00800"><p>Food poverty refers to an inability to access a nutritionally adequate diet due to issues of affordability of, and access to, food, and that has related impacts on health and social participation.  Inadequate food consumption is central to the understanding of poverty as exclusion from everyday life due to lack of resources.  In recent years, there is specific focus on food poverty as a policy issue for two reasons: the structural constraints facing households in accessing food; and the links between food and nutrition and health problems, such as obesity, cancer.</p><p>  The World Health Organisation <font color="#2F2F2F">last month published the </font>Review of social determinants and the health divide in the WHO European Region: final report, which states that &ldquo;Social protection policies are critically important in shielding populations from the health effects of poverty and financial insecurity&rdquo;.  The Irish social protection system is highly effective in reducing the at-risk-of-poverty rate by 62 per cent (SILC 2011), as compared a 49 per cent reduction in 2004.  The improved impact of social transfers reflects concerted and sustained State investment in social protection during this period, including the economic crisis.</p><p>  The Department supports a number of interventions which address food poverty.  The school meals programme is a targeted intervention for children at risk of food poverty and educational disadvantage.  In 2013, the Department provided &euro;37 million to fund direct food provision to almost 200,000 disadvantaged school-children, in over 1,300 schools or organisations.  The Department also supports financially Healthy Food for All, a national charitable organisation which works to increase access and availability of affordable healthy food by low-income groups, including the development of community food initiatives. </p><p>  Finally, a new initiative that the Department has started work on is the programming of the new Fund of European Aid for the most Deprived persons (FEAD).  This will provide around &euro;3m of EU funds annually to support efforts to allow charities dealing with the most marginalised people to buy food and consumables.

However the Fund is not in a healthy financial position. The third Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund was completed by consultants KPMG in 2012.  A key finding of that Review is that the Fund has a significant shortfall in 2011 of &euro;1.5bn given expenditure of &euro;9.0bn but income of only &euro;7.5bn.  In the absence of any action to tackle this shortfall, the 2011 deficit of &euro;1.5bn will double to &euro;3.0bn by 2019 and will have increased to &euro;25.7bn by 2066.  These figures refer to the projected annual deficit in the particular year in question.</p><p>  The change in the number of &ldquo;waiting days&rdquo; from 3 to 6 before payment of illness benefit will apply from January next and it is estimated that approx. 220,000 claims a year will be affected. </p><p>The Social Insurance Fund operates on a &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; basis, with the Exchequer acting as residual financier of the Fund when there is a shortfall between contributions received and benefits paid. Following many years of surplus, the fund has operated in deficit over the last number of years.  In a difficult economic environment the choices facing Government in order to ensure the sustainability of the Fund are to either increase contributions or reduce benefits. It is in this context that the decision was made to make this relatively modest adjustment to illness benefit.</p></reply>

The main indicator is &lsquo;consistent poverty&rsquo;. It is measured by the overlap of two measures: those who are at-risk-of-poverty (below the threshold of 60 per cent of the median equivalised household income) <i>and</i> are suffering basic deprivation (an enforced lack, i.e. inability to afford, two or more items from an eleven item list of basic goods and services). Consistent poverty is the basis for the national social target for poverty reduction, which is to reduce consistent poverty to 4 per cent by 2016 and to 2 per cent or less by 2020, from a 2010 baseline rate of 6.3 per cent. In 2011, using the CSO SILC definition for people with a disability, the rate of consistent poverty for this group was 6.9 per cent, which was the same as the rate for the total population.  The at-risk-of-poverty measure only focuses on income (financial poverty) and does not take into account the costs of living or the extra costs of disability. The basic deprivation measure, however, measures actual living standards. Thus, if people are facing higher costs due to disability, the impact of these costs will be captured through the basic deprivation measure due to the inability to afford basic necessities.</p><p>  In 2011, the Department published a <i>Social Portrait of People with Disabilities</i>, as one of the lifecycle groups identified in the <i>National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016</i> (NAPinclusion). This report works from a model that understands disability in terms of how the individual interacts with their physical and social environment. The impact of a disability is therefore mediated by the resources people have, the services they can access, the environment in which they live and the attitudes they encounter. The national poverty target and high level goals pertaining to income support, employment and access to services in NAPinclusion are relevant to people with disabilities across the life course. </p><p>  NAPinclusion has a specific goal in relation to addressing the barriers to employment for people with disabilities. Of particular concern to the Department is how the social welfare system can support and assist people in receipt of disability payments to access the labour market. While as a society we face strong economic and financial challenges, it is important that we continue to address the barriers to the social and economic participation of people with disabilities. In turn, this will enable people with disabilities to make their contribution to national recovery and to underpin future progress.</p></reply>

Entitlement to this benefit for employees is contingent on entitlement to statutory maternity leave.  In 2013 my Department will spend &euro;297.4 million on maternity benefit and adoptive benefit, in respect of a weekly average of 21,800 recipients.  Budget 2014 provided that, from January 2014, a standard weekly rate of &euro;230 will be paid to persons qualifying for maternity benefit. It is estimated that the number of persons who will be affected in 2014 as result of the Budget 2014 change will be a weekly average of 16,500.  Persons currently in receipt and those receiving benefit before 6 January 2014 will not be affected by the change &ndash; they will continue to receive between &euro;217.80 and &euro;262 per week for the duration of their leave.</p><p>  Ireland provides generous maternity leave entitlements of over 42 weeks currently &ndash; 26 week paid leave and a further 16 weeks unpaid. This is reflected by one of the highest birth rates in Europe and high participation by women in the labour force.  The 26 week duration of the payment was preserved under Budget 2014 because I realise how important this time is for families and their children.  This level is substantially in excess of the 14 weeks required under EU legislation.  I therefore do not believe that the changes to maternity benefit announced in Budget 2014 will act as a disincentive for women from entering the labour force.</p></reply>

This Standard requires defined benefit pension schemes to maintain sufficient resources to meet the liabilities of the scheme in the event of the wind up of the schemes.  Where a scheme fails to satisfy the Funding Standard the trustees are required to submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board outlining plans to restore scheme funding.</p><p>  At the moment there are 820 schemes that are subject to the requirements of the Funding Standard and of these schemes, 50% approximately are in deficit.  The majority of the schemes in deficit have submitted funding proposals to the Pensions Board to restore scheme funding.  The Pensions Board is in contact with all schemes to ensure compliance with the Funding Standard.  Where schemes that are in deficit have failed to submit a funding proposal the Pensions Board is assessing on a case by case basis whether to make use of its powers under the Pensions Act.  These powers include prosecution of the trustees of the scheme for non-compliance, issuing unilateral direction under section 50 of the Pensions Act to restructure scheme benefits or ultimately directing the trustees to wind up the scheme.</p><p>  I am not in a position to provide the full information you are seeking in relation to occupational pensions in the private sector.  However, an analysis of sample data in relation to these schemes shows that 56% of pensions in payment are under &euro;12,000, 40% are between &euro;12,000 and &euro;60,000 and 4% are over &euro;100,000.</p></reply>

The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short term income assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.Revised rent limits under the rent supplement scheme have come into force with effect from Monday 17 June 2013 and will be in place until 31 December 2014.  The new rent limits have been determined following an extensive review of the private rental market based on the most up-to-date data available.  There have been increases in the maximum rent limits in Dublin and Galway while there have been some reductions across a number of counties, reflecting the conditions in the rental markets in those counties.  The Department continues to monitor rent levels throughout the country and officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met.  Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent, has an income equal to the basic supplementary welfare allowance rate, less a specified weekly minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</p><p>  The &ldquo;top up&rdquo; payments referred to fall into two specific categories. Where a person has an additional income above the rate of supplementary welfare allowance they are, in certain circumstances, allowed to top up their rent as they will still have sufficient income to meet their basic needs after paying their rent.</p><p>  The second type of top-up payment can occur where the application to the Department declares a rent lower than that actually being charged by the landlord.  There has been no evidence presented to the Department showing widespread or systemic &lsquo;false declarations&rsquo; of rent supplement through the use of illegal top-ups.  The tenant, landlord or landlord&rsquo;s agent must complete the rent supplement application form, which includes the amount of rent, and declare that the information provided is correct and accurate.  The Department&rsquo;s form clearly states that making a false statement or withholding information may lead to prosecution.</p><p>  The Department, in June 2012, introduced powers of enquiry (Section 14 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012) for staff to formally request and oblige landlords to provide information in respect of rent supplement tenants, principally to verify the agreed rent and existence of the tenancy. This measure improves both the governance and oversight arrangements in place.</p></reply>

The measure was implemented in July on a 2&frac12; year time limited basis to apply from 1 July 2011 until 31 December 2013.  The 4.25% employer PRSI rate will therefore revert to the original 8.5% rate from 1 January 2014.</p><p>  Retaining the 4.25% rate of employer PRSI in 2014 would reduce the expected PRSI yield to the Social Insurance Fund by &euro;195 million in a full year.  As the reversion of the employer rate to 8.5% is provided for in legislation, it has already been built into the PRSI income base for 2014 and subsequent years.  The level of wages paid to employees is a function of a number of critical factors including the prevailing economic environment.  There is no information available to indicate that this measure impacted, or will have an impact, on the number of employees on the national minimum wage.</p></reply>

Moreover, while they have on occasions raised questions about the pace at which reforms are being enacted, the most recent troika review has acknowledged that the main reforms &ndash; the roll-out of INTREO, the P300 project to reallocate 300 staff of the Department to casework duties, and the preparations for contracting out of certain employment services &ndash; are being implemented as rapidly as possible.Given the wide range of measures involved &ndash; ranging across training, education, employment and work experience programmes as well as the reform of employment service and welfare delivery, it is not possible to identify the number of people placed in full time employment as a result.  Information can however be given in relation to certain of the targets set for activation measures under Pathways to Work.</p><p>  For example, a target was set that, of the 180,800 people who were on the live register and fully unemployed for over a year at the beginning of 2012, 75,000 of these would move into employment by the end of 2015.  By the end of June 2013, 30,600 of this group were known to have moved into employment.  Of these, 21,900 had entered full-time employment and left the live register, and 8,800 had entered part-time employment.  As there can be some time lag in the reporting of new entries to employment by the relevant employers, it is likely that these figures will increase retrospectively as further records become available.  Equally, the Deputy will be aware of the success of certain programmes in helping participants find jobs. For example, evaluation results indicate that 61% of leavers from JobBridge find employment within 5 months of leaving their internship.</p></reply>

It was introduced in 1999 to replace &lsquo;Smallholders Unemployment Assistance&rsquo; for low income farmers, without the requirement to be available for and genuinely seeking work. Farm assist recipients retain all the advantages of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme such as retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.  Recent changes to the scheme have brought it into closer alignment with the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme&rsquo;s treatment of self-employed persons.</p><p>  Farm assist is a flexible payment and any farmer experiencing lower levels of income or cash-flow issues can ask his/her local social welfare/Intreo office to review the level of means applying to their claim.  The assessment of means for the purpose of qualifying for farm assist is designed to reflect the actual net income and looks at gross income, less any expenses necessarily incurred, from farming. Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year.  However, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.  In the case of new entrants or persons changing from one type of farming to another the assessment looks at all expected annual income and is based on normal output and costs appropriate to items such as normal stock levels, capacity, and market trends.</p><p>  As part of the normal budget process, all potential budget measures, including any changes to the farm assist scheme are assessed in terms of the impact they would have if introduced. Since the introduction of the changes to the farm assist scheme over recent budgets, no formal analysis of the impact of these changes has been carried out. However, the scheme is kept under review. In addition, the Department regularly discusses the scheme with the Irish Farmers Association. There are no plans to change the current scheme criteria.</p></reply>

I brought this proposal for legislation to the Cabinet as there are a number of important policy issues that I want to see implemented through amendments to the 2004 Act.  Two of the principal ones are as follows: the introduction of measures to combat marriages of convenience by making such marriages far more difficult to contract in the future; the establishment of a birth registration process which will make it an obligation to include the father&rsquo;s particulars on a birth certificate so as to ensure that the child will have a record of their father.</p><p>  The Bill will also provide for a wide range of issues relating to the registration of life events in the State.  Representations and recommendations have been made by various groups and organisations since the enactment of the Civil Registration Act 2004 and this Bill seeks to address these issues.  The General Register Office, which administers the Civil Registration Service, has identified areas where legislative amendments are required to streamline the service to the general public.  The Department is currently working with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government on the drafting of the heads of a Bill and I hope to introduce legislation early next year.</p><p>  It should also be noted that the Civil Registration Act 2004 will be further amended through gender recognition legislation which I intend to introduce early next year.  I published the General Scheme of the Gender Recognition Bill 2013 on 17 July 2013, following Cabinet approval.  The Bill provides for the recognition of the acquired gender of transgender people aged 18 and over and who are not married or in a civil partnership.  The General Scheme of the Bill was discussed at hearings of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection last month. Officials from the Department of Social Protection, representative groups and legal and medical experts participated in the hearings. The 2004 Act will be amended to provide for a gender recognition register.</p></reply>

The Finance Bill (No. 2), 2013, currently before the D&aacute;il, provides for the new credit which will have the same value as the current tax credit and will be available to the primary carer of a child.  The Minister for Finance also informed the D&aacute;il during the second stage debate on the current Finance Bill that he will be bringing forward an amendment at the committee stage of that Bill, which will allow the credit to be used by a non-primary carer in situations where the primary carer has no tax liability.</p><p>  The current arrangements in relation to the assessment of maintenance payments made to a recipient of one parent family payment are designed to encourage the payment of maintenance.  Where a recipient of one parent family payment is in receipt of maintenance payments, half of the value of these payments is assessed as means and the rate of payment is adjusted accordingly.  In addition, where a recipient has rent or mortgage payments up to a maximum of &euro;95.23 per week, these costs can be fully offset against any maintenance paid and no reduction occurs in the rate of one-parent family payment where the maintenance received does not exceed housing costs (subject to a maximum of  such costs of &euro;95.23 per week).  Where the maintenance received does exceed this level then any amount over &euro;95.23 per week is assessed at a rate of 50% and deducted from the one-parent family payment.  Accordingly, the impact of the current welfare arrangements means that, in many cases, any reduction or increase in the level of maintenance paid can have no effect or relatively minimal effect on the rate of one parent family payment payable.    </p><p>  It is not possible, at this stage, to quantify the number of one parent family payment recipients currently benefiting from maintenance payments whose welfare payment rates may be indirectly affected by any potential behavioural changes consequent on the proposed tax measure and, accordingly, no adjustment has been made to the estimate for that payment in 2014.  I will ask my officials to monitor any potential impacts during 2014.</p></reply>

Income tax and PRSI payable by a self-employed contributor is treated as one aggregate sum in accordance with the provisions of Section 23(4) of the 2005 Social Welfare Consolidation Act.  For that reason, it is not possible to separate payments to Revenue between tax and PRSI liabilities or to front-load the discharge of the PRSI element of the overall tax liability.  Section 110 (1), Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005 provides that a self-employed contributor shall not be regarded as satisfying the qualifying conditions for state pension (contributory) unless all outstanding self-employment contributions are paid.  Section 110 was amended in the Social Welfare and Pensions (No 2) Act 2009 to provide that where unpaid self-employment contributions are paid subsequent to the claimant&rsquo;s 66th birthday, a state pension (contributory) will only be payable from the date on which the liabilities are fully discharged.  While my Department does on occasion advise customers of their PRSI liability, the Department cannot advise on any other liabilities (e.g. taxation) as these are a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  Collection of any outstanding PRSI remains a matter for Revenue and for the reasons set out above, any communication from Revenue is likely to set out the full outstanding liabilities (PRSI, Tax etc.).</p></reply>

A request to change the address was received by Revenue in April 2013 and was updated to the person&rsquo;s tax record.  However, the change did not transfer across to the Property Register due to a data matching error and for that reason the LPT notification issued to the old address. </p><p>  Revenue has informed me that the Property Register address has now been amended to reflect the correct address.  Revenue has also informed me that the person&rsquo;s 2014 payment notification details have been input to the record on foot of correspondence from the individual assisting the person in question and no further action is required.  Revenue has confirmed these facts to the individual who is assisting the person in question. </p><p>  On the Deputy&rsquo;s comments about the LPT Helpline, Revenue has advised me that the introduction of LPT has represented a very great administrative challenge.  For example, Revenue has successfully answered in excess of 750,000 telephone calls and replied to in excess of 210,000 letters or emails since March 2013. The requirement to provide customer support to such a large volume of taxpayers did lead to some delays, particularly leading up to the peak 2014 paper filing deadline. </p><p>  Revenue responded to the delays by ensuring the deployment of significant extra resources to the LPT Helpline, which is operated by an external service provider.  Revenue also deployed additional resources to its internal telephone support service and put contingency plans in place to facilitate the rapid deployment of further resources should they be needed.  At this point there are 310 agents operating the combined Helpline.</p><p>  Revenue also extended the paper filing deadline by one week, to 14 November 2013 and extended the opening hours of the LPT Helpline from 9am to 5pm to 8am to 8pm for the peak periods.  Additionally, Revenue commenced a call-back service where people can leave their contact details in preference to queuing for service.  People availing of this service receive a call-back from Revenue off peak period.  These changes have significantly reduced the call waiting times for customers accessing the Helpline, with current waiting times running at approximately between five and nine minutes.  The Deputy mentioned the person was cut-off when waiting for access to LPT Branch; this occurred due to a temporary technical issue on the telephony system which was quickly identified and resolved.</p><p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s stated that e-filing is not practical for some property owners.  Section 36 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that a return may be prepared and delivered by a person acting under the authority of the liable person, which is how the specific case referred to by the Deputy was managed.  In addition to the legislative provisions, Revenue has made further arrangements to assist any property owner who may have difficulties meeting their obligations via the online system.  For example, property owners can file and pay via the LPT Helpline (1890 200 255) providing they have their Property ID, PIN and payment details to hand.  People can also contact their local tax office and make an appointment to meet an official who will be more than happy to assist them in meeting their obligations. </p><p>  Finally, I am very happy with the initiatives that Revenue has implemented to provide an efficient and user friendly service in regard to the overall administration of LPT and I commend them for the success of the project.</p></reply>

The parent or person must not be married, civil partner or co-habiting.<font color="#FF0000">  </font>A qualifying child is someone who is under eighteen years of age at the start of the tax year, or if over eighteen years of age, is receiving full time education or is permanently incapacitated either physically or mentally from maintaining himself or herself.  The value of the tax credit is currently &euro;1,650 per annum.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the qualifying conditions provided for in the legislation are very broad and make it difficult to ensure the proper administration of the One-Parent Family Credit.  For example &ldquo;part of a year&rdquo; is not defined and there can be, in certain cases, multiple claims in respect of the same child by different individuals.  Revenue operates on the basis of a &lsquo;presumption of honesty&rsquo; which is set out in its Customer Service Charter and most applications for tax credits, including the One-Parent Family Tax Credit, are processed based on the information provided by the claimant on the application form. </p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that applications will be queried if there is information on Revenue&rsquo;s records that does not entirely support the information provided by the claimant.  In particular, Revenue&rsquo;s real-time risk framework was developed to identify cases where claims for the tax credit should be challenged before they are granted.  Revenue has regularly run nationwide projects specifically to validate One-Parent Family Tax Credit claims and to ensure that the claimants continue to satisfy all the criteria for entitlement to the credit.  For example, one such project in the South West region in recent years yielded over &euro;4 million for the Exchequer.</p><p>  I am further advised that the Revenue Commissioners have been working collaboratively with the Department of Social Protection to ensure that the Commissioners have the most up-to-date information in relation to the claimant and the qualifying child.  Such information would include whether the claimant is entitled to child benefit in respect of the qualifying child as well as details of the child&rsquo;s date of birth.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the One-Parent Family Tax Credit (OPFTC) is being replaced with a new Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit from 1 January 2014. The Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit will be of the same value, i.e. &euro;1,650, as the existing OPFTC and will also carry the same entitlement to the extended standard rate tax band of &euro;36,800 per annum.  The proposed new credit, should the changes be approved by the Oireachtas, will operate differently from the One-Parent Family Credit, such that the credit will be available in the first instance, to the primary carer, that is, the single individual with whom the child resides for the greater part of the year. In addition I have brought forward a Committee Stage Amendment to allow the primary carer to relinquish the credit such that a non-primary carer can claim it in certain circumstances.  The qualifying criteria for the proposed Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit should also help to ensure that the credit can be administered in accordance with the intentions of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

There are constant flows into and out of the Exchequer account and all moneys within it are fungible. The Government must ensure through its management of expenditure, tax and non-tax receipts and borrowings that there are prudent and adequate balances available to the Exchequer at all times. This also helps to provide investors with the assurance they require that they will be repaid upon the maturity of debt. For small open economies such as Ireland, budgetary aggregates are generally more susceptible to the negative effects of external and internal shocks. In general terms the overall level of cash reserves maintained depends on the amount of liabilities falling due for payment in the short term and the State&rsquo;s risk appetite in relation to such shocks over the longer term. Particular factors which arise in that context include the international economic situation, the State's debt maturity profile and the projected pattern of Exchequer receipts and expenditure.</p><p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) manages the national debt in order to ensure liquidity for the Exchequer. Decisions regarding the appropriate level of cash and related assets to be maintained take account of various factors in addition to the cost of maintaining such reserves. These factors include the potential risks of not maintaining an adequate and prudent cash balance, including the risk that the Exchequer would be unable to meet its obligations and that market funding rates for Ireland would therefore be higher than would otherwise be the case due to the perception that the State had a precarious liquidity position. </p><p>  As Ireland returns to funding itself through the debt markets while still running a large though declining budget deficit, the need to hold appropriate cash balances as we emerge from the EU/IMF programme is paramount. The NTMA plans accordingly to have cash on hand as at the end of the programme in December 2013 to cover the Exchequer's full needs for the calendar year 2014 and the early part of 2015.  The State earns a return on its cash balances and related assets which the NTMA manages in a prudent manner consistent with minimising risk and always having sufficient cash on hand to cover any volatility which might arise.</p><p>  Due to the fungibility of the various cash streams flowing into the Exchequer, it is not possible to provide a precise measure of the total cost of maintaining the cash balances. However, the NTMA has estimated that the difference between the average rate of interest payable on long-term borrowing and the average rate receivable on cash and related assets is 2.7 percentage points in 2013 to date. The inputs to the cost of long-term borrowing include EU/IMF programme funds and the bond issuance done by the NTMA.</p><p>  The NTMA continues to keep the quantum, maturity and timing of market funding under review based on its assessment of what is required to regain full market access and the overall level of cash balances that it is prudent to maintain. It is the intention to run lower cash balances in the coming years and this has been reflected in the Budget 2014 projections.</p></reply>

The liability date of 1 November 2013, which applies for 2014, is settled and was approved by the Oireachtas in passing the LPT legislation.  I have responded to Parliamentary Questions on the liability date on several previous occasions.  In reply to Question No. 110 on 27 March last, I specifically stated that where a liable person sells their residential property between 2 November 2013 and 31 December 2013, provided that they owned the property on 1 November 2013, they will be liable to pay LPT on that property for 2014. </p><p>  I also informed the House in my replies to Questions Nos. 221 (49518/13) and 223 (49556/13) on 19 November 2013 that having a liability date before the year commences is preferable as there is certainty about who the liable person is for the coming year, that person has a reasonable amount of time to make the necessary provisions and they have access to the widest possible range of options for paying the tax.  </p><p>  For a tax such as LPT to function properly, legislation must specify a liability date for the tax to have application for a particular year.  Whatever date is prescribed, the question of liability when there is a change of ownership has to be managed, and I expect that the LPT liability involved is likely to be factored in during negotiations between the parties on the sale price and the closing date of a particular contract.  As there are a number of LPT issues to be considered when buying or selling a house, detailed guidance on LPT issues arising in the context of the sale or transfer of a residential property was prepared by the Revenue Commissioners in consultation with the Law Society and is available since last August on the Revenue website at  and on the Law Society&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  An individual selling a property will often be purchasing another property at around the same time.  While a vendor who owns a property on 1 November 2013 is liable for the 2014 LPT on that property, if s/he does not purchase another property before 1 November 2013 s/he will not be liable for the 2014 LPT on that &quot;replacement&quot; property - whoever is the owner as of 1 November 2013 will be liable.  I have no plans to amend the legislation governing the liability date for LPT.</p></reply>

I understand that Recommendation IV of the report calls for the establishment of a &ldquo;social innovation fund&rdquo; to &ldquo;support the establishment and growth of social innovations with the potential for transformative impact on critical social issues facing Ireland, including unemployment and the environment&rdquo;.  The report itself makes no mention of changes to the residence rules.  However, I have received a separate proposal, developed jointly by the Forum and the Worldwide Ireland Funds, to set up a &ldquo;jobs and social cohesion initiative&rdquo;.  The proposal involves modifying the residence rules to allow certain individuals to be in the State for up to 182 days in a year without becoming resident for tax purposes if they paid an upfront fee and an annual levy for ten years, with the money paid linked to the creation of jobs.  The proposal also suggested the re-introduction of the &ldquo;Cinderella rule&rdquo; for participants in the scheme &ndash; that is, participants would only be treated as present in the State on a day for tax residence purposes if they were in the State at midnight on that day.</p><p>  I asked the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure Reform to examine these proposals.  The Committee has indicated that it thought the proposal had some merit but that certain issues warranted further scrutiny. While I am always open to constructive proposals, I have no plans to change the day counting rules at present.</p></reply>

However it remains my intention to bring the annual Pay &amp;amp; File dates forward. This is required in order to provide increased certainty around the annual tax take and forecasting process following the move to an earlier Budget Day necessitated by the adoption of the Two-Pack.</p><p>  As I have previously noted, the scope for unanticipated events which would lead to either a higher or lower than projected outturn is considerably increased in the context of an October Budget. In addition the ability to project future yield is compromised. Consequently, measures which would result in improvements in the availability of information or increases in the proportion of total yield already available prior to the Budget have to be considered. In this regard, I would refer to the following comments from the recently published Fiscal Assessment Report of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council;<blockquote>  &quot;In summary, the movement of the Budget to October increases the risk that tax-forecasting and fiscal-deficit errors will be larger. This might warrant extra caution in setting the fiscal stance so as to ensure budgetary targets are met and fiscal rules are complied with. Moreover, this analysis takes no account of additional difficulties associated with preparing macroeconomic forecasts with two months fewer data. Recognising the issues arising from the existing structure of the Irish tax system, the Department of Finance has initiated a consultation process to bring forward the payment of taxes currently due in November.&quot;</blockquote>  However, given the results of the consultation process, I believe that it would be more appropriate to make any necessary changes next year, i.e. by means of Finance Bill 2014. These would then take effect, at the earliest, from 2015.</p></reply>

The rationale for the new scheme was the need to reduce the unsustainable cost of sick leave for the public service overall which is to be achieved through a substantial reduction in the period of time for which paid sick leave will be available from one year at present (comprising six months at full pay and six months at half pay &ndash; subject to certain conditions) to six months (i.e. three months full pay and three months half pay).  Under the Labour Court recommendation special arrangements were to be put in place, through the development of a Critical Illness Protocol, under which staff with serious illnesses of specified severity might be able to benefit from extended paid sick leave on an exceptional basis.  The finalisation of this protocol was recently the subject of conciliation at the Labour Relations Commission which aimed at securing agreement on it as soon as possible to facilitate the introduction of the new sick leave arrangements from 1 January 2014.</p><p>  The issue of transitional arrangements and specifically how employees who are on sick leave at the time of commencement of the new scheme as well as the approach taken to employees&rsquo; prior sick leave record was addressed by the Labour Court in its recommendations.  It was recommended by the Labour Court that anyone who is on sick leave at the time of the introduction of the new scheme will continue to avail of the current sick leave scheme and will be provided with access to six months full pay and six months half pay (over a four year rolling period) for the duration of that particular illness.</p><p>  In relation to the issue of retrospection it was agreed by the Labour Court that an employee&rsquo;s sick leave records over the last four years will, as is currently the case, be used to determine whether an individual has access to sick pay or not.  In the case of a non-critical illness there will, however, be a reduction in the number of days sick leave absences in the preceding four year period above which there will be no entitlement to paid sick leave &ndash; other than Temporary Rehabilitation Pay - from 365 days to 183 days.  The changes in sick leave arrangements clearly represent a significant change in the terms and conditions of staff.  It was, therefore, decided that the introduction of the scheme should take place in 2014 to provide all public service employees with sufficient advance notice of the sick leave scheme. </p><p>  Sick leave statistics in the public service are calculated on the basis of certified and non-certified sick leave.  Statistics for serious illness are not collected on the basis that there is not at the present time a consistent or agreed definition of serious illness.  However, the significant lead in time to introducing changes in the sick leave scheme was intended to provide staff with extended time to understand the impact of the revised scheme on their own circumstances.  The new sick leave arrangements were agreed under the Croke Park Agreement and did not form part of the Haddington Road Agreement.  The parameters of the new sick leave scheme are contained in the Labour Court Recommendation and the scheme will be implemented in accordance with this recommendation.</p></reply>

Following severe flooding in Clonakilty in June 2012, the CFRAM work for the town was accelerated to assess the risk and develop a potentially viable flood relief scheme as a matter of priority. In July 2013, the outcomes of the accelerated work, namely flood maps and a preferred Scheme option, were presented to the public. The preferred Scheme option for Clonakilty includes:</p><p>- Flood-water storage in an embanked storage area upstream of Clonakilty to reduce fluvial flood risk, and,</p><p>- On-land flood defences to reduce coastal flood risk.</p><p>  The OPW is currently in the process of procuring consultants to develop the design and assist with the implementation of a Scheme for the town. Tenders are due in shortly on this and it is expected that consultants will be appointed early in 2014. Stage one of the consultant's contract will be to further assess the outcome of the CFRAM Study and to bring a viable, cost-effective and sustainable scheme forward to public exhibition later in the year. Subject to such a scheme being acceptable after this public consultation stage it will then be taken forward to detailed design and construction.</p><p>  Provision for funding the design and development work on the Scheme and the construction works has been made in the OPW's multi-annual capital works programme.</p></reply>

Compensation is based on the worker&rsquo;s length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.  It is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to all their eligible employees.    </p><p>  Where an employer can prove that he/she cannot afford to pay a statutory redundancy payment, the State makes a lump sum payment, from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF), directly to the individual.  Some of the employers to which the Deputy refers may fall into this category.  Where the State makes a statutory redundancy payment directly to an individual a debt is raised against the employer which the State will endeavour to recover.</p><p>  Employers who pay statutory redundancy payments to their employees are entitled to a rebate of a portion of that payment from the State if the date of dismissal by reason of redundancy is before 1 January 2013.  In Budget 2012 the level of the rebate was reduced from 60% to 15% and in Budget 2013 the Government decided to remove the redundancy rebate to employers in respect of redundancies where the date of dismissal is on or after 1 January 2013.  Rebates to employers are also paid from the SIF.</p><p>  One of the factors which influenced the Government&rsquo;s decision to reduce the level of the rebate initially and to remove it in Budget 2013 was the significant cost of rebates in recent years.  Expenditure in this regard was &euro;373.2 million in 2010; &euro;185.3 million in 2011; and &euro;167.4 million in 2012.  While the SIF is constituted primarily from employer contributions, the taxpayers&rsquo; contribution is also significant.</p><p>  I am very concerned about the deficit in the SIF and I do not see why this country should continue to borrow money to plug the hole in the SIF in order to compensate often profitable companies for the cost of making their employees redundant in Ireland and, in some cases, transferring their employment abroad.  The continuation of the rebate payment was not sustainable in the current economic climate.  While this may cause difficulties for employers it should be noted that redundancy rebate payments to employers are not common in many EU and other jurisdictions.  The current arrangements bring Ireland more closely into line with practice in other countries and it is not proposed to review the matter.</p></reply>

This service includes EURES (European Employment Service) which is a European wide network of all the public employment services in the European Union and the European Economic Area.  Under EU regulations, public employment services are obliged to use EURES to advertise employment vacancies throughout Europe and, when requested by another European Public Employment Service, to source applicants for such vacancies.  This is considered an important enabler of the single market for labour in Europe.</p><p>  As part of the EURES network the Department informs jobseekers in Ireland of job opportunities in the wider European labour market which may be of interest to them.  At any one time, there are over 1 million vacancies displayed on the EURES website and people are entitled to apply for these jobs as they wish. It is an opportunity for jobseekers in Ireland to seek work in the wider European market. It also provides a system whereby Irish employers can advertise vacancies free of charge throughout Europe in situations where such vacancies cannot be filled by jobseekers in Ireland. A number of large employers have used these services to recruit people with specialist language skills and in so doing have secured the future of their mainly Irish workforce.</p><p>  From time to time the Department, via EURES, is also asked to assist State or Public employment Services in countries outside of the EU/EEA, typically Canada, Australia and the USA, to advertise and fill vacancies. Depending on the nature of the posts to be advertised the Department will respond positively to such requests on a reciprocal basis.  In the past the State and Public Employment Services in these countries facilitated Ireland in advertising vacancies and matching candidates for these vacancies. As part of these reciprocal arrangements the country advertising the posts typically provides assistance in securing employment visas and accommodation for jobseekers. </p><p>  To date in 2013, approximately 4,000 letters have issued to jobseekers in respect of jobs in Spain, Norway, France and the UK for a range of positions including English teachers, plumbers, sales &amp;amp; hospitality, mechanics and electricians.  As jobseekers apply for these vacancies through the EURES portal, it is not possible to know how many people applied for and secured employment using the service.</p><p>  It is important to note that there is no obligation on  unemployed jobseekers in receipt of income supports to apply for overseas vacancies. In notifying jobseekers of such vacancies the Department is simply drawing jobseekers attention to vacancies that exist and that are simultaneously being brought to the attention of jobseekers in other countries.  The Department would be failing in its duties if it did not offer Irish jobseekers an equal opportunity to compete for such vacancies if they so wish.</p></reply>

It enables eligible persons to pursue approved education courses that leads to a higher qualification than that already held and to continue to receive income support equivalent to the value of their prior social protection payment for the duration of a course of study, subject to conditions.  BTEA covers full-time second level courses and third level courses to higher diploma level (level 8 in the national framework of qualifications) including the professional diploma in education (primary and secondary teaching).  The BTEA does not provide income support for students pursuing other postgraduate qualifications, masters or doctorates. </p><p>  My Department conducted a review of employment supports schemes, including BTEA, in 2012 and published the report in January 2013.  The recommendations of that review are being implemented to better support Government policy on activation as set out in Pathways to Work.

Jobseeker's benefit is a weekly payment to people out of work and covered by social insurance.  If a person does not qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit they may qualify for means tested jobseeker's allowance.  The Revised Estimates for my Department provides for expenditure on the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes of &euro;3.66 billion in 2013.</p><p>  Legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions is not entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  In most circumstances persons leaving local Government employment at age 65 will claim jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  It is provided that, subject to the person having paid 156 or more qualifying contributions and satisfying the general scheme conditions, a person whose jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66.  On this basis, workers who suffer a substantial loss of employment at age 65 will generally be able to claim jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for the full year to age 66 provided they have paid at least 156 qualifying contributions.</p><p>  In addition, people in receipt of a jobseeker's payment must engage with the Department's activation measures and can face sanctions if they fail to do so.  From January 2014, these criteria will be eased for people aged 62 and over.  They will still be able to avail voluntarily of an array of supports, which are available from the Department if they wish to return to work, training or education.  However, sanctions will not be applied to this cohort, should they decide they do not wish to engage with the activation process.</p><p>  Special arrangements will also be made so that the majority of older people in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment will have to register with their local office only once a year and their payments will be paid directly into their bank accounts.  These provisions will enable these individuals to ease their transition into one of the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes until they become eligible for a State pension on their 66th birthday.  Issues relating to the terms of employment of local Government employees are matters for my colleagues the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Public Expenditure in the first instance.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 81,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million in 2013.  Where a person commences full-time employment, they normally no longer qualify for a rent supplement.  However, if a person is participating on the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance scheme, they may continue to retain entitlement to rent supplement, subject to the means test, if they are deemed as eligible for the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS).  The RAS gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more.  Details of these cases are notified regularly by my Department to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

The powers came into effect on 7th June 2012.  Since then, 122 cases have been detected at airports.  The total amount of control savings resulting from these detections amounts to &euro;1.35 m.  In all of these cases, on-going payments will have been stopped without further Exchequer loss.  Control savings estimate the future expenditure that would have been incurred but for this control work.

The main vehicle for achieving these objectives for public domestic water supplies is the multi-annual   Water Services Investment Programme (WSIP). The current Programme runs to the end of 2013 and includes contracts to address deficiencies in the quality of supply, to improve the overall capacity of the system and an accelerated programme of mains rehabilitation. </p><p>  From 1 January 2014 Irish Water will be responsible for the delivery of water services capital infrastructure and is currently preparing a Capital Investment Plan for 2014-2015. This Plan will include taking account of the transition of projects that are included in the current WSIP. </p><p>  The Exchequer proposes a direct equity investment of &euro;240m towards the capital funding of Irish Water in 2014. This will support projects to be included in Irish Water's Capital Investment Plan and will ensure that the entity is in a position to take on the water services investment programmes of the 34 water services authorities, including some 80 projects currently in progress. Irish Water will also finance some of its costs and the liabilities transferred from local authorities through borrowings in 2014. </p></reply>

It remains the responsibility of all non-EEA nationals who are resident in the State to ensure that they have an appropriate permission from the Minister for Justice and Equality and the great majority of migrants comply with this condition.  </p><p>  If a person is undocumented his /her case can be considered on its merits by officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department.  Sometimes this consideration will result in a positive outcome for the applicant.  In other cases, the  decision by the Irish authorities, subject to the oversight of our Courts, would be that the person has to go home.  That decision should be respected.</p><p>  Broad regularisation programmes are problematic.  They could give rise to unpredictable and potentially very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services.  At EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments &quot;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&quot;.  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases.  In our case there are also significant considerations based on maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area with the UK which must be taken into account.</p></reply>

On this basis, Government referred the issue of same-sex marriage to the Convention on the Constitution for consideration.

As well as providing for the establishment of a Judicial Council and Board that will promote excellence and high standards of conduct by judges, the proposed Bill is aimed at providing a means of investigating allegations of judicial misconduct supported by the establishment of a Judicial Conduct Committee which will have lay representation.  Having considered the Bill in light of the considered views of the judiciary and in relation to current Government policy, I am happy to confirm that work on the drafting of the new Bill continues in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel. While it had been hoped to publish the Bill this year, in light of the Government&rsquo;s heavy legislative programme I would now expect this to take place in the New Year.</p></reply>

This means, inter alia, that appropriate security measures must be taken against unauthorised access to, or unauthorised alteration, disclosure or destruction of personal data coming into his or her possession.  Such personal data may not be retained for longer than is necessary for any specific and legitimate purpose for which they were collected or processed.  Where computer equipment containing personal data has been seized by the Revenue Sheriff, such personal data should be returned under secure conditions to the person from whom the equipment was seized unless there is a legitimate reason for non-return of the data.  On return of the personal data, relevant provisions of the Data Protection Acts will apply to the data. </p><p>  In January 2012, the European Commission published proposals for a General Data Protection Regulation to update the current data protection framework. The negotiations on the proposed Regulation are ongoing at EU level. In the circumstances, I have no plans to amend the law at this time.</p></reply>

In cases where the animal must be slaughtered on-farm, it must be carried out humanely in accordance with the European Communities (Welfare of Farmed Animals) Regulations 2008 (S.I. No. 14 of 2008) either by a registered veterinary practitioner or by a slaughterman licensed by the Local Authority under the Slaughter of Animals Act 1935.  In July 2009 the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council published &ldquo;Guidelines for Veterinary Practitioners and Farmers on managing acutely injured livestock on Farm&rdquo;, aimed at assisting veterinary practitioners and farmers in arriving at an informed decision on the method of dealing with such animals, having regard to both animal welfare and public health.</p><p>  Procedures for dealing with such animals in slaughter plants are set out in the protocols of my Department&rsquo;s Veterinary Public Health Inspection Service and the Local Authority Veterinary Service. There is no obligation on any slaughter plant to accept such animals. Where an animal of this type is accepted, it is subject to the intake checks at the slaughter plant, as well as any additional examinations deemed necessary by the official veterinarian.  My Department is of the view that the number of service providers in this area is adequate as in addition to licensed units operating within the commercial sector, there are currently in excess of 2,400 registered veterinary practitioners in the State.</p></reply>

There is no evidence of a significant problem in relation to the welfare of horses due to the relatively high level of horse slaughtering for the human food chain this year and the very good weather during the Summer and well into the Autumn, which has created a very favourable fodder situation. In addition, the continuing work being undertaken by local authorities in conjunction with the Department via the Control of Horses Act 1996 has reduced the numbers of abandoned horses throughout the country particularly in urban areas.</p><p>  My Department also continues to stress that it is the responsibility of horse owners to ensure the welfare of horses in their ownership and/or their care and to dispose of them. In this context, horse owners are reminded of the advice of the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council that, where an owner can no longer adequately provide for their horse or where the horse can no longer fulfil the purpose for which it was bred, he or she should be proactive in seeking to dispose of the animal, including consideration of the option of humane disposal. The Department is, of course, continuing to deal with any animal welfare issues relating to horses through its existing mechanisms and has indicated that it is in position to provide emergency funding to assist horse owners who cannot afford to pay for their humane disposal. Farmers who are facing a critical horse welfare issue over coming months can contact the Department helpline for assistance.</p></reply>

The basis for these inspections is governed by EU legislation and there are certain minimum number and types of inspections that must be conducted each year.</p><p>  Land eligibility inspections must be carried out on at least 5% of applicants. These checks are carried out to verify that the actual area claimed in the application form corresponds to the area farmed by the farmer and to ensure that any ineligible land or features are not included for aid purposes. My Department has made every effort to respond to concerns about the impact of on-the-ground inspections on farmers and arising from this around 75% of these inspections are carried out in the first instance without the need for a farm visit, as the information needed is acquired using the technique of remote sensing via satellite.

The aid substantially covered the cost of transport into the country, thus reducing the cost to farmers of a bale of hay by approximately one third.  While the Scheme operated through the co-operatives, marts and other approved agencies, the actual beneficiaries are the individual farmers and primary producers who needed urgent supplies of feed. Operating the scheme in this manner was the quickest and most effective way of getting the fodder to those who needed it.</p><p>  Of the 78 different concerns which participated in the Scheme, to date, 70 have submitted claims, of which 26 have been fully processed and paid in full, with a further 29 having received an advance payment of 75%, the balancing payment will issue to these concerns once all outstanding issues are resolved. These concerns have been contacted directly and are working with my Department to resolve the outstanding issues. Of the remaining 23 cases, 15 are currently in progress, with documentation remaining outstanding from 8 concerns. To date, payments worth some &euro;2.2 million have issued, with total expenditure expected to be in the region of &euro;2.8 million.</p></reply>

Information held by the Adoption Authority is primarily in relation to adoptions which took place since the Adoption Act 1952.  If no adoption took place the Authority would not have an adoption file.  Where no adoption took place, if records exist they may be held by a number of sources including hospitals, GPs, Mother and Baby Homes, religious orders and other sources.  A large number of these files are being transferred to the HSE. </p><p>  The HSE provides an Information and Tracing Service throughout the country to birth mothers, adopted persons and their families.  The Adoption Act 2010, requirement that agencies providing Information and Tracing services would gain accreditation resulted in a number of religious orders deciding not to apply for accreditation and transferring files from their Mother and Baby Homes and Adoption Societies to the HSE.  Approximately 25,000 files have been transferred to the HSE Regional Adoption Service in Cork, from the Sacred Heart Adoption Society, which had responsibility for Bessboro, Co Cork; Sean Ross Abbey, Roscrea, Co Tipperary; and Castlepollard, Co Westmeath.  Work by the HSE on the organising and storage of these files has taken place and the HSE is anxious to preserve the integrity of these records.  The HSE has sought the advice of the National Archives in relation to the proper storage of these files, which are of great significance.  </p><p>  The HSE also has records that include those for St. Anne&rsquo;s Adoption Society; St Mary&rsquo;s Adoption Society, Kerry; Ard Mhuire, Dunboyne, Co Meath; Limerick Catholic Adoption Society; St Patrick's Mother and Baby Home Navan Road, Dublin; St Louise's Adoption Society Dublin; Dublin Health Authority Board of Assistance; Rotunda Girls Aid Society; the Ossory Kilkenny Adoption Society; St Kevin's and St Johns Adoption Societies.  The HSE is also in negotiation regarding files from Holles Street, St Brigid's, and St Patrick Guild. Furthermore PACT, who are an agency accredited under the Act, have records of various Protestant organisations.  A comprehensive list of records held, and their locations,  is available on the HSE website.</p><p>  The HSE Information and Tracing Service recognises the importance attached to this area of service provision and has put in place a plan to redistribute records from individual institutions in their entirety, to the various adoption teams around the country,  in a concerted effort to reduce waiting times.  The HSE is in the process of reorganising the information and tracing system to allocate social work resources country wide in a way that will allow for reduced waiting times across the country.  The HSE has advised me that, in the first instance, any person seeking information on adoption, or an illegal registration of a birth, should contact the Adoption Authority of Ireland  or the HSE Community Services who will assist in directing them to the personnel dealing with their particular records.  The HSE is working to provide a more streamlined  service and to ensure that enquiries in regard to information and tracing are handled as quickly as possible.</p><p>  The National Adoption Contact Register which is operated by the Adoption Authority was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  They decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.  The Authority, the Health Service Executive and accredited adoption services routinely inform enquirers about the existence of the register and encourage anyone interested in tracing or gaining information to sign up.  I am conscious of recent media coverage of the issue of information and tracing and I would hope that this will encourage more birth mothers in particular to access the  Contact Preference Register and where possible to consent to the release of information.  I have no plans to initiate an audit of all files in this regard.</p></reply>

This is why my Department and I have been progressing work on Ireland&rsquo;s first-ever Early Years Strategy and working on a comprehensive<b></b>Pre-School Quality Agenda which aims to improve quality standards in pre-school services in Ireland.  I have identified a number of key areas which I consider to require reform, and legislation to underpin these reforms is expected to be enacted before the end of the year.  This legislation will provide a statutory basis for registration of pre-school services and will introduce a range of new enforcement powers for Inspectors at pre-prosecution level.  Inspectors will be empowered to specify improvement conditions that a service must comply with and the threat of removal of registration will be available. </p><p>  The HSE is currently recruiting a number of pre-school inspectors to strengthen the inspection framework and a further &euro;0.5 million in funding will be allocated in 2014 towards the cost of further increasing staffing levels in the pre-school inspectorate.  I have decided to increase the minimum qualification requirement of Level 5 for pre-school leaders delivering the pre-school year to Level 6 and to increase the qualification requirement for all other staff working with children in the sector to a minimum qualification at Level 5.  These new requirements will apply from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services.  During 2014/2015 I will be implementing a new national training programme for which I have secured additional funding of &euro;3m.  This programme will support the existing childcare workforce in meeting the new qualifications requirement.</p><p>  The implementation of the S&iacute;olta and Aistear Practice Frameworks, developed to support quality early childhood care and education in Ireland, is an important initiative in the development of quality childcare services. I announced in Budget 2014 the introduction of a new quality support service which will work directly with services to improve quality and support the implementation of the S&iacute;olta Framework and Aistear Curriculum. &euro;2.5 million is being made available for this service in 2014.</p><p>  The Children and Young People's Policy Framework is currently being developed by my Department.  The Framework will set out the overall principles, vision and outcomes for children and young people and will guide actions across Government over the period 2014 to 2018.  I expect to circulate the Framework to other Ministers in December. Following approval by Government the Framework will be published early in the New Year for discussion at a Government meeting in January. </p><p>  The Early Years Strategy, which is one of a number of more detailed strategies under the Children and Young  People's Policy Framework, is currently being developed by my Department. The Strategy, which is expected to be published early next year, will address a range of issues affecting children in the first years of their life such as child health and well-being, parenting and family support, learning and development, play and recreation and early childhood care and education.  </p><p>  Significant investment totalling in excess of &euro;260 million is  provided annually by my Department to provide for the free pre-school provision through the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, and for support for disadvantage and low come families through the Community Childcare Subvention programme.  The funding also supports the Childcare Education and Training Support  programme which assists Solas trainees and Education and Training Board (ETB) students with the cost of childcare.  I have been successful in maintaining these programmes, despite the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure, and I am pleased that in the region of 100,000 children in the country benefit each year from these supports.</p><p>  This week I also announced that the Clondalkin Blue Skies Initiative has been selected as one of 13 projects to be funded through the Government's new ABC (Area Based Childhood) Programme.</p></reply>

While I am not in a position to comment on the Australian report referred to by the Deputy, I can assure him that tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products is a high priority for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, which is responsible for the area. Revenue&rsquo;s work in recent years has been guided in recent years by its <i>Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade 2011-2013</i>. The intention is that a further strategy will be put in place when the current one comes to an end, to act as the strategic focus for the ongoing extensive work against the smuggling and sale of illicit products.</p><p>  With regard to tobacco packaging, it is important to note that the Revenue Commissioners have advised that the tax stamp, which contains a range of sophisticated security features, is a key means for them to distinguish between legal and illegal products, irrespective of the way in which the cigarettes are packaged.  In addition, Ireland is party to legally binding agreements between the EU and three major tobacco companies which aim to strengthen anti-smuggling measures. The Protocol to Eliminate the Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products was agreed at the FCTC Conference of the Parties in November 2012, and Ireland will sign and ratify that protocol.</p></reply>

The Health Service Executive (HSE) has been provided with funding in the order of &euro;1.4 billion this year to fund its 2013 disability services programme for children and adults with disabilities.  This represents approximately 11.5% of overall health expenditure this year.  The majority of this funding is distributed through non-statutory agencies who deliver over 80% of all disability services. There are in the region of 300 such agencies at present across the country that provide a significant and broad range of services for children and adults with disabilities in partnership with and on behalf of the HSE.  It is important to note that many children and adults with a disability can be very effectively supported within mainstream child and adult health services.  </p><p>  Dyspraxia is a developmental co-ordination disorder that affects movement and co-ordination.  For some children, dyspraxia can affect their learning capacity.  For this reason they may require additional supports in the school setting to keep up with their classmates.  A comprehensive range of supports is in place in our school system to supports these children.  </p><p>  From a health perspective, there are a number of therapies that can make it easier for people with dyspraxia to cope.  These include speech and language therapy, to improve speech and communication skills, and occupational therapy to find ways to remain independent and complete everyday tasks.  Such therapy services do not necessarily have to be delivered through specialist disability providers and are frequently accessed through Primary Care Teams and community therapy services.        </p><p>  The Dyspraxia Association is just one of a range of organisations around the country at present providing supports to specific diagnostic groups who do not receive HSE funding.  Funding of these types of organisations is an issue that is under active and on-going consideration by the HSE.  Pending approval of the HSE's National Service Plan for 2014, it is not possible to predict the service levels and funding to be provided next year for the disability sector.</p></reply>

The Directive seeks to ensure a clear and transparent framework for the provision of cross-border healthcare within the EU, for those occasions where the care patients seek is provided in another Member State rather than in their home country.  However, it should be emphasised that the vast majority of EU patients receive healthcare in their own country and prefer to do so. </p><p>  The Department of Health is continuing to work on the necessary statutory provisions to fully implement the Directive.  Nevertheless, there are arrangements in place in respect of the key provision of the Directive in relation to a national contact point (NCP), which has been set up within the HSE &ndash; the email address is crossborderdirective@hse.ie.  </p><p>  The principal function of the NCP is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost, the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements.  The NCP also has a responsibility to ensure that all enquirers are informed of the rights, if any, that they may have through the legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (regulation 883/04) and which may be more beneficial to them.  The NCP will be able to inform patients what the cost of their treatments would be in Ireland to allow them make a comparison with the costs they are being quoted for comparable treatment in another Member State.</p><p>  While it has been possible to have these aspects of the NCP up and running by 25 October on an administrative basis, it has not been possible to have prior authorisation or reimbursement operating on a statutory basis. The Department is working on the legal arrangements to put in place the statutory provisions for these systems and will be implementing them as soon as possible.  Further information on the Ireland's implementation of the Directive is available on the NCP's webpage: .</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-28a.503.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112800068#WRZ01300"><p>I am determined to address rising unsustainable costs in the sector in the interests of consumers.  I want insurers to address the base cost of each element of claims which they pay and have made it clear to private health insurers that I believe significant savings can be made, ultimately reducing the impact of rising health costs on health insurance premiums for the consumer.  Earlier this year, I appointed  Mr. Pat McLoughlin to prepare an independent report on how best to achieve real cost reductions in the private health insurance market, having full regard to competition law.  I expect to receive an initial report from the Chair very shortly.</p><p>  Risk equalisation compensates for the costs of insuring older customers and I am committed to progressively increasing the extent of this compensation.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2013, currently progressing through the Oireachtas, sets out revised risk equalisation credits and the corresponding stamp duties that will apply under the Risk Equalisation Scheme from 1 March 2014.  Different risk equalisation credits will apply to 'advanced' and 'non-advanced' health insurance policies. There will be no change to the stamp duty payable on lower cost 'non-advanced' health insurance, which will help to ensure that the option of lower cost health insurance remains available. The stamp duty for health insurance products providing 'advanced' cover will increase from &euro;350 to &euro;399 per adult and from &euro;120 to &euro;135 per child.</p><p>  It is important to note that the stamp duty, or levy the Deputy refers to is collected from all health insurers and is in respect of the number of lives insured by them, and is not placed on individual policy holders.  The money collected is used to fund RE credits for older people with private health insurance who, if under a risk rated model of insurance, would be charged a higher premium for health insurance than younger people, given their higher risk profile.  Funding the RE credit for older people ensures that everyone is charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan, irrespective of age, gender and the current or likely future state of their health.  It is a matter for the insurance companies as to the extent, if any, they pass the stamp duty on to their customers.</p><p>  The Health (Amendment) Act, 2013 (No. 31 of 2013) provides for the introduction of a revised private in-patient charge for all private patients in public hospitals, including those accommodated in public beds.  All persons ordinarily resident in Ireland are entitled to use a public hospital.  However, some people choose to be treated privately, in which case they have chosen to pay the consultant and the hospital.  The Government believes that users of private services should pay for the costs of providing those services.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has reported that 45% of in-patients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance costs because they were not occupying private-designated beds.  This situation represents a significant loss of income to the public hospital system and an indirect subsidy to private insurance companies, who cover most private patients.  I believe that this situation cannot continue and that the new charge makes sense.</p><p>  From 16 October 2013, tax relief for medical insurance premiums has been restricted to the first &euro;1,000 per adult and the first &euro;500 per child insured.  Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings will no longer qualify for tax relief.  The new ceilings will ensure some continuing support via the tax system for those who purchase private medical insurance policies, while reducing Exchequer exposure to more expensive policies.  This will affect some consumers, depending on the cost of the policies that they purchase.  While individuals can of course opt for less expensive policies and therefore avoid the impact of this measure entirely, it is important that they fully understand the level of cover their policy provides.</p><p>  Many consumers can make savings on their health insurance premiums by reviewing the level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured.  The Health Insurance Authority provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits.  The HIA's web-site, www.hia.ie, has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.</p><p>  The Government remains committed to keeping down the cost of private health insurance, so that it is affordable for as many people as possible as part of measures to ensure the sustainability of the private health insurance market in the transition to Universal Health Insurance.</p></reply>

Ireland has a uniquely extensive road network.  There is approximately 99,000 kilometres of road in the network which represents two and a half times the EU average in terms of kilometres per head of population.

No. 477 of 2006) the Road Safety Authority has responsibility for the delivery of the National Car Test. The RSA has overall responsibility for the operation, oversight, development, quality assurance and delivery of vehicle testing arrangements.  In accordance with EU Directive 2009/40/EC, the minimum requirement for roadworthiness testing of passenger cars is that a roadworthiness test is undertaken when the vehicles are four years old and every two years thereafter from the date of first registration of the vehicle.  Additionally, Ireland requires that vehicles in excess of ten years old be tested annually.</p><p>  Under the <i>Road Traffic (National Car Test) Regulations 2009, S.I. No. 567 of 2009</i>, and in accordance with the Directive, the test due date is calculated by reference to the date of first registration of the vehicle. Where an NCT inspection does not occur on the original test due date, the NCT certificate is valid from the date of the original test due date to the next test due date. This can result in a certificate of less than 1 or 2 years duration, depending on when the car was presented for a test. No provision exists to permit an extension of the period covered by an NCT certificate beyond the next test due date. There is a 30 day time period for a re-test which is deemed to provide customers with a reasonable amount of time to address the fail items identified and arrange a retest, while minimising the risk that additional fail items may develop in the intervening period.</p><p>  It is a road safety imperative that all vehicles are adequately maintained and fit for use on a public road and I have no proposal to amend the current periods of validity of certificates of roadworthiness.</p></reply>

It was subsequently declared by the Department to be valid - but this was after the local projects from Kerry were reviewed and allocations made.  This project was then considered with applicants for regional projects and was unsuccessful.  &euro;26 million was allocated to 615 sports clubs and organisations. &euro;5 million was allocated for 32 regional projects.</p><p>  Unfortunately, with over &euro;7.50 sought for every &euro;1 available under the 2012 Programme it was not possible to fund every valid project.  Almost 500 valid applications were in the same position as this club and were not funded.  Submitting a valid application does not in any way guarantee funding.  Any sports organisation with a suitable project may apply for funding under the next round of the Sports Capital Programme under the terms and conditions that will apply.  I hope to make an announcement on the next round of the Programme before the end of the year.</p></reply>

A direct service to the West Coast of the US was identified as a key action point in the Government's Action Plan for Jobs and I am delighted that this need is being fulfilled by an Irish airline. The IDA has been advocating the return of the service ever since it was discontinued by Aer Lingus at the height of the recession back in 2009 and the Minister has raised the matter regularly in his meetings with Aer Lingus.</p><p>  The importance of this route is demonstrated by the fact that it is estimated that over 40% of Ireland&rsquo;s total foreign direct investment comes from Silicon Valley based companies alone. Many Silicon Valley companies such as Intel, PayPal, eBay, Facebook, Google and Apple have their European Headquarters in Ireland. The direct air access being provided by Aer Lingus will help to sustain this investment and attract further investment.</p><p>  Enhanced air access to key business and tourism markets around the world has been a key element of this Government's policy and the success of that policy to date is evidenced by the significant increased capacity that has been made available on transatlantic routes - over 26% in summer 2013 season and a number of other new services to the US and Canada have already been announced for next year.  The zero rate travel tax initiative in Budget 2013 will come into effect from April 2014 and is part of a process aimed at generating new airline routes into Ireland. There has been a positive response to the initiative from airlines so far with Ryanair and Aer Lingus Regional both announcing details of new routes and increased services from Dublin, Shannon, Cork and Knock. The elimination of the air travel tax coupled with the decision to maintain the tourism and hospitality VAT rate at 6% is a clear indication of the Governments support for air travel and Irish tourism generally.</p><p>  Tourism Ireland works closely with carriers, airports and agencies to make the case for the introduction of new services or extended capacity. The DAA also has attractive incentive packages available for the introduction of new routes. In Summer 2013, total available seat capacity was +3% higher thaan Summer 2012.  I will launch Tourism Ireland's Marketing Plans for 2014 to the industry on Monday 2nd December and I expect that cooperative promotion will continue to be a major focus of their programme in the year ahead.</p></reply>
