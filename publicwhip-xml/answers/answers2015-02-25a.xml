    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-25a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015022500070#WRA00600"><p>The HSE National Service Plan 2015 aims to improve placement of children in age appropriate mental health settings.  The 95% target indicated in the Plan allows for some flexibility surrounding emergency placements in Adult Units.  The corresponding target set in the 2014 Service Plan was 75% or above. <br/><br/>It is generally accepted that it will be most challenging for the HSE to meet the ambitious target for 2015, relative to the 2014 outturn position of around 70% for age appropriate placements.  However, progress in this area has been significant over recent years, as evidenced by the fact that the number of such admissions to adult units in 2008 was 247, and that the trend has been declining annually since then to the most recent draft figure of 89 admissions for 2014.  Clearly, there remains room for improvement and this issue has therefore been flagged as a Key Priority in this year's Service Plan.<br/><br/>At present, there are 54<b></b>in-patient beds for children and adolescents<b></b>in the HSE.  Overall, the HSE is targeting an operational capacity of 74 public Child and Adolescent beds nationally by the end of 2015.  It should be noted that difficulties with re-opening some existing beds at local level, already resourced in the system, primarily relates to securing or retaining staff rather than the non-availability of funding. <br/><br/>The HSE has recently refocused various operational initiatives to achieve improvement in this service area in 2015.  This includes a set of priority actions to enhance performance and national oversight in relation to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, including reducing admissions of children and adolescents to Adult Units. <br/><br/>I make no apologies for setting an ambitious target in this important area particularly in the context of the increased funding which is being made available for child and adolescent mental health services.  I can assure the House that I, and the Department of Health, will continue to closely monitor progress by the HSE on the agreed target for this important initiative over the remainder of the year. </p></reply>

The report emphasises the need for reform of our health services and acknowledges that this Government is the first in the history of the Irish State to commit to the principle of a universal, single-tier health service, which guarantees access to medical care based on need, not income.  We remain committed to this goal of universal healthcare and to driving forward key health reforms.  <br/><br/>With regard to the potential cost of a competitive universal insurance system, my Department is currently working with the ESRI, the Health Insurance Authority and others on a major costing exercise.  This exercise will examine the cost implications of a change to a multi-payer, universal health insurance model, as proposed in the White Paper on UHI.  The analysis will include a review of evidence of the effects on healthcare spending of alternative systems of financing, and of changes in financing methods and entitlements. <br/><br/>It will also estimate the cost of UHI for individuals, households, employers and the Exchequer.  I expect to have the initial results from this exercise in April, following which I will revert to Government with a roadmap on the next steps to UHI.</p></reply>

This has only been possible through everyone's best efforts.  However, this year is the first year in a long time where the overall health budget has actually increased.  I look forward to being in a position, as economic conditions further improve year on year, to continue to press for better resourcing of our health service.  </p>  <p>  University Hospital Waterford has been no exception to the restraints on acute hospital spending and has had to adjust its service provision to reflect the resources available.  In 2013 and 2014, two operating theatres at Waterford were closed, as part of measures to achieve the cost containment required, while continuing to offer as many services as possible within a restricted budget.  I am pleased to report that, since January this year, the hospital has been in a position to resolve staffing and resource issues and re-open one of the closed theatres.  The hospital now has a dedicated emergency theatre open for four and a half days per week, with additional capacity being provided when necessary.  In addition to the emergency theatre, the emergency orthopaedic trauma theatre is available on a 24/7 basis.  I am advised that, during the closure, all efforts were made to make the most efficient use of the remaining facilities and that surgical activity still reached 97% or more of the annual target in each year.</p></reply>

Blood, and the products derived from it, are an integral element of healthcare delivery.  A major objective of the organisation is to ensure that it always has the necessary programmes and procedures in place to protect both the donors and the recipients of blood and blood products. </p>  <p>  I want to pay tribute to those who regularly donate blood.  Their altruism allows the health service to deliver a full range of important and sometimes life saving treatment.  Interestingly, just 3% of the eligible population currently donates blood and so, despite extensive promotion by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, there is considerable scope to achieve more donation from within the currently eligible population.</p>  <p>  The Irish Blood Transfusion Service has no plans to reduce the age of consent for blood donations from 18 to 16 or 17 years of age.  They advise that they do not propose to reduce the age of consent due to a higher rate of adverse reactions, such as fainting, in younger donors. </p></reply>

Addressing this issue, nationally and locally, is a priority for me and for the Government and the Deputy will be aware that I established the Emergency Department Taskforce at the end of last year to develop sustainable solutions to ED overcrowding.</p>  <p>  A number of initiatives have been put in place to alleviate the situation in Mullingar Hospital.  These include the operation of an Acute Medical Assessment Unit, at least twice daily ward rounds and late evening hours worked by clinicians, daily bed management meetings, improved patient discharge, initiatives to  limit or avoid admissions for certain conditions and close communication with local GPs. </p>  <p>  The HSE has also advised that it has reviewed overall staffing levels at Mullingar, particularly in the Emergency Department and Obstetrics &amp;amp; Gynaecology.  Additional staff posts have been agreed, along with the ongoing process of agency conversion and replacement of vacant positions, with 90 staff in total to be recruited.  This includes a net increase of 35 nursing staff.  The recruitment of midwives and general nurses is well underway. </p>  <p>  Mullingar Midland Regional Hospital is part of the Ireland East Hospital Group.  In 2015, there will be an enhanced co-operation amongst all the hospitals in this Group, which will provide further support for the staff in Mullingar hospital to deliver high-quality, safe patient care on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

With the establishment of the National Ambulance Service, the service is now organised on a national rather than a localised basis.  The regional call centre structure has gradually been dismantled and we are working towards the establishment of a single national control centre.  Ambulance resources are now deployed in a dynamic manner, to provide coverage over a region, rather than just in the area around an ambulance station or within a particular county boundary.  This dynamic deployment of ambulance resources ensures that the nearest appropriate resource is mobilised to the location of any incident.  </p>  <p>  In the Waterford region, resources are deployed, as required, between Waterford, Dungarvan, New Ross, Kilkenny and Tipperary to maintain coverage and capacity in any particular area where emergency resources may be fully utilised.  In Waterford City, two ambulances provide night cover, with one covering the period 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. and the other 8 p.m. to 5 a.m.  In the event that an ambulance is required to transfer a patient out of the region between 5-8 a.m,, resources are dynamically deployed from the surrounding areas to provide cover for that period.  </p>  <p>  In  responding to emergency calls, the National Ambulance Service uses the Advanced Medical Priority Dispatch System in its control and communications centres.  The system uses internationally recognised protocols and standards to assess and prioritise 112 and 999 calls to ensure that life-threatening situations receive an appropriate priority response. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-25a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015022500070#WRA02100"><p>Additional funding of &euro;5.4m has been provided to the National Ambulance Service in 2015 to address service gaps, particularly in the West, by reforming rostering and staffing additional stations.  In this regard, 50 paramedic posts have been allocated to East Galway and Mayo.  It is also intended to expand the number of community first response teams, particularly in more rural and sparsely populated areas, to add to the more than 100 teams already operating around the country.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Emergency Aeromedical Support Service, which is specifically targeted at the West, will continue to provide rapid access to appropriate treatment for very high acuity patients where this might be difficult to achieve by road.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that response time performance is improving in the face of increasing demands on the service.  The latest available data shows that nationally, in December 2014, the volume of ECHO calls rose by 7% compared to the same period in 2013, and DELTA calls by 11%.  Despite this, an ambulance arrived within the target time for 78% of ECHO calls and for 64% of DELTA calls - an improvement of 9% and 4.6%, respectively, on the same period in 2013.  Of course response time targets only measure one aspect of ambulance performance.  Internationally, many services are moving to patient outcomes as a better indicator of performance.  The National Ambulance Service has therefore introduced a patient outcome target for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in 2014, and more are being developed.  </p>  <p>  HIQA recently published its review of ambulance services.  In addition, the national capacity review and the review of Dublin ambulance service are expected to be finalised shortly.  These three reviews, when taken together, will provide us with very good information which will help drive further service improvement.  I have therefore asked the HSE to prepare an action plan on completion of the three reviews, with timelines to realise a new vision for our ambulance services. </p></reply>

The Government has provided additional funding of &euro;3 million in 2014 and &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges.  The HSE is accessing all suitable non-acute accommodation to the maximum extent possible to allow those who have been clinically discharged to leave acute hospitals.  Actions currently being taken to address ED overcrowding include the provision of 900 additional transitional care beds in nursing homes (500 in January and an additional 400 in February); 173 short stay public beds being opened across the country for a three month period; up to 300 overflow beds opened in acute hospitals; additional home care packages; and 300 additional Fair Deal places and extension in Community Intervention Teams.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has the capacity to recruit where it is necessary to deliver front-line services.

To date, there are 86 Primary Care Centres in operation throughout the country, 43 of which have opened since 2011.<br/><br/>The HSE uses three mechanisms to deliver primary care infrastructure:<br/><br/>- Direct build (by HSE);<br/><br/>- Public Private Partnership (PPP) project; or<br/><br/>- Operational Lease with the private sector. <br/><br/>There are currently 37 locations where Primary Care Centres are at an advanced planning stage using one of these three methods of delivery.<br/><br/>Direct Build centres are funded by the HSE&rsquo;s capital allocation with funding provided for 16 centres.<br/><br/>14 centres are being progressed through Public Private Partnerships.  Tenders for this project have been returned and are currently being evaluated.  It is expected that the preferred bidder will be selected in Quarter 2, 2015.  Subject to successful completion of financial and contractual arrangements, it is expected that construction work will commence before the end of 2015, with the centres expected to be completed by the first half of 2017.<br/><br/>To date, 43 Primary Care Centres have been delivered through the Operational Lease model funded from the HSE's revenue allocation.  The HSE is at advanced stages with developers in 25 locations where Agreements for Lease have been entered into, and it is currently at negotiation stage in an additional 31 locations where Letters of Intent have been issued.<br/><br/>In November 2014, the HSE advertised an additional 73 locations for delivery of Primary Care Centres by Operational Lease.  January 16, 2015 was the closing date for receipt of Expressions of Interest.  The HSE is reviewing all Expressions of Interest to determine which are suitable for more detailed consideration and progression to the next stage of the process.<br/><br/>Despite constraints on the availability of public capital and revenue in recent years, a very ambitious programme is under way to develop Primary Care Centres and support the provision of an enhanced and more integrated range of services within communities.</p></reply>

Harm reduction interventions, such as needle exchange services and methadone maintenance treatment, are an important component of the response to problem substance use as such interventions encourage problem substance users to engage with, and avail of, drug treatment services.     </p>  <p>  The importance of promoting the recovery of people in treatment is recognised in the National Drugs Strategy.  Problem drug users have complex needs and may require multiple interventions from a range of agencies to assist them in their recovery.  The National Drugs Rehabilitation Implementation Committee, chaired by the HSE, is overseeing the roll out of a National Drugs Rehabilitation Framework.  The aim of the Framework is to provide a 'continuum of care' for the recovering drug user through promoting a more integrated and client-centred approach to rehabilitation, based on shared care planning.  The roll out of the Framework is currently being advanced through the HSE's Addiction Services and the Drug and Alcohol Task Forces. </p>  <p>  My Department is commencing work on the development of a new National Drugs Strategy for the period after 2016.  The process will involve a comprehensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public on the current national drugs policy and future priorities.  This will provide an opportunity to ensure that our strategic approach into the future continues to be firmly focused on recovery.  I have also asked my Department to examine the feasibility of utilising Social Impact Bonds as a funding model to improve both treatment and rehabilitation service outcomes.  The outcome of this work will inform decisions as to the viability of this approach to maximising the social benefits which the National Drugs Strategy seeks to achieve.</p></reply>

Two significant areas in that regard are to issue the first health identifiers and to increase investment in ICT and eHealth generally.  In late 2013 the Government published its eHealth strategy, <i>An eHealth strategy for Ireland, </i>along with the Health Identifiers Bill which was enacted in 2014.  Other foundation steps in support of this work included setting up the Office of the Chief Information Office/Chief Officer for eHealth Ireland in the HSE.  The HSE ICT strategy is expected to be finalised in late March and will set out the priority areas for development, investment and modernisation of ICT for the health services.  A number of critical areas which will require significant investment over the coming years are emerging, including the new National Children's Hospital, an enterprise financial management system to underpin the HSE's new Financial Operating Model, eReferrals and other initiatives to support the acute and primary care sectors. <br/><br/>The roll out of a system of health identifiers will also be a key priority for 2015.  The new identifier registers will be managed and operated by the HSE.  The Act provides for the establishment of a system of individual, professional and organisational identifiers.  The individual health identifier will be the initial focus of implementation.  HSE is currently finalising a project for the initial stages of the roll out and engagement with key stakeholders is under way.  It is my intention to commence the relevant parts of the legislation to support the initial roll out in primary care in the coming months.  The principal benefits of health identifiers will be improvements in patient safety. Health identifiers will also underpin the wider eHealth agenda and facilitate improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of our health services and benefits in terms of the customer experience.  The use of health identifiers will also contribute to maintaining the confidentiality and security of sensitive patient data within health care in both the public and private environment. </p></reply>

Some of these posts will be used to staff ambulance stations at Tuam and Mulranny.  Others will assist in the move from on-call to on-duty rostering.  On-call rostering means paramedics remain at home waiting to be called out, which on average results in a 20 minute delay in rolling out the ambulance.  In moving to on-duty rostering, our crews are in their stations or vehicles, ready to go immediately on dispatch. </p>  <p>  We also intend to expand the number of community first response teams, particularly in more rural and sparsely populated areas.  These are volunteer groups in the community, who are registered and trained to a certified standard.  We have over 100 such teams operating around the country at present but we need more and we are working on that. </p>  <p>  Also of particular benefit to western counties is the Emergency Aeromedical Support (EAS) Service.  The EAS is specifically targeted at the west and provides rapid access to appropriate treatment for very seriously ill patients, where this might be difficult to achieve by road.  I am currently looking at proposals to establish the service on a permanent basis and I am in discussion with my colleague, the Minister for Defence, on the matter. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that there are currently three major reviews of ambulance services: the recently published HIQA review and the awaited national capacity and Dublin ambulance service reviews.  These three reviews, when taken together, will provide us with very good information which will help drive further service improvement. I have therefore asked the HSE to prepare an action plan on completion of the three reviews, with timelines to realise a new vision for our ambulance services.  </p></reply>

The additional eligible population is approximately 100,000 and, when fully implemented, 540,000 women will be included in the BreastCheck Programme.</p>  <p>  Due to the number of people who will be added to the breast screening process, and the fact that women are screened on a two year cycle, the task of extending the age cohort is a major logistical and operational challenge for the service.  The age extension will be implemented on an incremental basis, in line with the capacity of the system to manage the additional screening and follow-up workload.  As part of this, the National Screening Service will need to recruit and train additional radiographers, medical consultants and administration support to accommodate the increased demand for the BreastCheck programme.  Funding for this, and for additional mobile units and medical equipment, will be made available across the implementation period.  The age extension will be fully rolled out by 2021.</p>  <p>  Women of any age who have concerns about breast cancer should seek the advice of their GP who will, if appropriate, refer them to the symptomatic breast services in one of the eight designated cancer centres.</p></reply>

This has resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001/2002 levels. </p>  <p>  A major deal on the cost of originator drugs in the State was concluded with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) in October 2012.  It is delivering a number of important benefits, including significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.</p>  <p>  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in nine EU member states (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, and UK) and these are the maximum prices paid by the HSE for originator drugs supplied through the community drug schemes.  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400 million over 3 years.  Over half of the savings to be delivered - &euro;210m - were to be reinvested by the State into the provision of new and innovative drugs.</p>  <p>  As part of the Mid-Term Review of the 2012 Agreement, my Department and the HSE have been engaging with IPHA in seeking to achieve additional savings in expenditure on drugs and medicines to ensure that funding is available to enable patients to have access to new and innovative drugs.</p>  <p>  An agreement was also reached with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry, in 2012.  Under this Agreement the maximum price the HSE pays for generic products is now 40% of the initial price of an originator medicine.  This has resulted in the price differential between off-patent drugs and most generic equivalents increasing from 5% to approximately 20%.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that the gross combined savings from the 2012 IPHA and APMI deals amounted to &euro;125 million in 2013 with &euro;148 million generated in 2014.</p>  <p>  The continued implementation of generic substitution and reference pricing as provided for under Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 is also contributing to reducing the cost of medicines.  It is estimated that reference pricing will yield approximately &euro;50 million in savings in 2014 and a further &euro;25 million in 2015.  Reference prices will ensure that generic prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms and once set reference prices must be reviewed every 12 months.</p>  <p>  Further reductions in the price of medicines in Ireland remains a priority for the Government, however, it is worth noting that neither the Minister for Health nor the HSE has any power to set the prices of drugs and medicines purchased by private patients.  It would none the less be disappointing if all pharmacists were not passing on the benefits of lower prices to patients. </p></reply>

The Oversight Forum on Drugs (OFD), which I chair, is responsible for considering developments in drugs policies and in dealing with problem drug use generally, at EU and international level.  It will oversee the development of a new National Drugs Strategy to cover the period after 2016, which will take account of evidence-based research, information and data sources on the extent and nature of problem drug use in Ireland.<br/><br/>The National Co-ordinating Committee for Drug and Alcohol Task Forces was established on foot of the recommendations of the Review of Drugs Task Forces.  It plays a key role in promoting effective local coordination between statutory bodies and the community and voluntary sectors in order to deliver a more comprehensive and effective response to the problem of substance misuse.  It also ensures policy on drugs is informed by the work of the Task Forces on the ground. <br/><br/>The National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol (NACDA) is a critical element of the overall drugs policy in Ireland.  It advises Government on the prevalence, prevention, treatment and consequences of problem drug use in Ireland.  It is also responsible for conducting and supporting appropriate research to fulfil the information needs of Government and my Department in formulating policies to address problem substance use.  The NACDA has produced over a hundred research reports relevant to the substance misuse situation in Ireland.

The model set out in the White Paper contains a number of important protections for the public, including open enrolment, lifetime cover, community rating and a system of financial protection, whereby the State will pay for, or subsidise, the cost of UHI premiums for those who qualify. <br/><br/>While my Department has not undertaken a formal social impact assessment on the UHI model, it is currently engaged in a major costing exercise.  This exercise will examine the cost implications of a change to a multi-payer, universal health insurance model, as proposed in the White Paper on UHI.  The analysis will include a review of evidence of the effects on healthcare spending of alternative systems of financing, and of changes in financing methods and entitlements.  It will also estimate the cost of UHI for individuals, households and the Exchequer.  I expect to have the initial results from this exercise in April, following which I will revert to Government with a roadmap on the next steps to UHI. <br/><br/>Finally, I have already indicated that it will not be possible to introduce a full UHI system by 2019, as envisaged in the White Paper.  However, I want to emphasise my commitment to implementing key health reforms, as set out in the Programme for Government and the White Paper.  In particular, I want to push ahead with critical building blocks for universal healthcare, including the phased extension of universal GP care without fees, improved management of chronic diseases, implementation of financial reforms, including activity-based funding, and the establishment of hospital groups.  As well as representing critical building blocks for the future health system, these initiatives are also important reforms in their own right that will drive efficiencies and bring benefits in advance of moving to a system of universal healthcare. </p></reply>

In addition, the HSE has a range of processes in place which provide guidance on these matters including, the National Policy for Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse, Trust in Care etc.  </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s National Safety Incident Management Policy was updated in 2014 and is in line with international practice in patient safety and risk management.  It requires that those who conduct such investigations are competent investigators who have the requisite training and skills required.  Investigators should not have responsibility for the service they investigate, nor should they have been involved in the incident that is being investigated.  It does not prevent a person who is or was an employee of the HSE from becoming involved in a review or an investigation of a service managed or funded by the HSE. </p>  <p>  In many circumstances, clinical directors and other senior clinicians will, as part of learning and organisational improvement, undertake investigations, look-backs and audits.  Furthermore, the HSE as the primary health service employer will employ the majority of individuals in this jurisdiction who would have the specialist skills and expertise required for any given review or investigation.  When independence from the HSE is required, the HSE policy does provide for national and international experts to be part of reviews.  There are arrangements in place with national and international professional bodies for identifying these experts and this further contributes to the independence of the experts who are participating in these reviews.</p></reply>

The Government has commenced this process in respect of all children under 6 years. The Health (General Practitioner Service) Act 2014, which provides an entitlement for all children aged under 6 to a GP service without fees, was enacted on 25th July 2014. Under a Framework Agreement, the Department of Health, the HSE and the IMO are engaged intensively on the introduction of GP services without fees for children aged under 6. The aim is to have the under-6s phase implemented by Quarter 2, 2015, subject to the conclusion of those discussions and the conclusion of the fee-setting process.</p>  <p>  The medical card system is fundamentally based on means and this position has obtained for more than 40 years. However the Government recognises that the health service needs to be responsive to the circumstances of people, including children, with significant medical needs.  In November 2014 the Minister for Health and I announced a series of measures to enhance the operation of the medical card scheme and make it more sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs, especially where serious illness is involved.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold.  Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs and appliances under the Long Term Illness scheme, where the qualification criteria are met.</p>  <p>  The HSE has recently established a Clinical Advisory Group for Medical Card Eligibility. The Group will provide oversight and guidance to the operation of a more compassionate medical card system and will focus initially on the development of a framework for assessment and measurement of the burden of disease in this context.</p></reply>

This treatment, in conjunction with other services and supports, such as counselling, training, rehabilitation and after-care, provides a pathway to recovery for the individual affected by substance misuse.<br/><br/>Retention in methadone treatment is generally regarded as a positive goal in drug treatment.  A report from the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction on <i>Substitution Treatment - Treatment Regimes</i>indicates that no country surveyed, including Ireland, imposes a limit on the amount of time a person can be on methadone.  A report from the UK Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs warned that time limiting opiate substitution therapy would lead to high rates of relapse and could trigger more drug-related crime and increase the number of new cases of hepatitis C and HIV infection among drug users.  <br/><br/>Government policy in relation to drugs emphasises the need to provide opportunities for people to move on from illicit drug use to a drug-free life where that is achievable.  The National Drugs Rehabilitation Committee, chaired by the HSE, is overseeing the national roll-out of an integrated model of service provision based on shared care planning so that people in treatment can access the services needed to support their recovery. The HSE Operational Plan for 2015 also contains new performance measures which are designed to ensure that all substance misusers for whom treatment has commenced have a written care plan and an assigned key worker.</p></reply>

There are approximately 70,700 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;298 million for 2015. </p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the difficulties people are experiencing in maintaining affordable rented accommodation in areas of high demand in the current market. The Department has undertook a review of the maximum rent limits and raising rent limits may not be the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and could impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers, their families and students. The matter remains under close review.</p>  <p>  The Department has put measures in place to ensure that the housing needs of rent supplement customers throughout the country who are at risk of homelessness are addressed by providing for increased flexibility within the administration of the rent supplement scheme. Notices circulated to all Community Welfare Service staff reminding them of their discretionary power to award, on a case by case basis, a supplement for rental purposes in such circumstances in July and December 2014. A National Framework has also been developed to ensure that appropriate supports continue to be provided throughout the country in a consistent manner. </p>  <p>  The Interim Tenancy Sustainment Protocol, introduced in the Dublin region during 2014, was further extended to include non-family households effective from 16th February 2015. Over 375 families in Dublin have been supported through increased rent limits to date. The Interim Tenancy Sustainment Protocol was also extended to Cork city in January 2015. </p>  <p>  I would advise the Deputy that he should advise any person in receipt of rent supplement who is at risk of losing their tenancy in the Dublin area to contact the Tenancy Protection Service provided by Threshold at 1800 454 454.</p></reply>

Under the scheme an employer may provide an employee with a bicycle and/or cycle safety equipment without the employee being liable for benefit-in-kind taxation. However, where the expenditure by the employer exceeds &euro;1,000, the excess amount is liable to tax.</p>  <p>  The legislation only allows for one purchase of a bicycle in respect of an employee in a 5-year period irrespective of whether the bicycle was used for the full period or not. It operates on a self-assessing basis using straightforward rules.  Any deviation from the current system would involve additional administrative procedures for either or both Revenue and employers in relation to the verification of loss, theft, insurance recovery, etc. As this runs counter to the existing provisions which are administratively simple, it would not be appropriate to alter the existing scheme.</p>  <p>  In any event, bicycles are normally covered as part of a general household insurance policy or some people may opt to have specific cover for it.

Revenue wrote to the French authorities enquiring as to whether the data obtained by them contained information in relation to Irish residents and whether the French authorities would consider disclosing this information to Revenue. The French authorities responded positively to that request and made a disclosure to Revenue on 23 June 2010. </p>  <p>  The information received was evaluated carefully by Revenue and it was found that, for a variety of reasons, there was no basis for pursuing an investigation in many of the cases. These included non-Irish addresses on certain of the accounts, persons associated with accounts not being resident or domiciled in the State, Revenue establishing that, by reason of prior disclosure, there was no liability, and, in the case of the corporate entities, that they were Irish registered but non-resident for taxation purposes. The vast majority of the funds linked to Ireland in the HSBC data is related to the Funds industry.  More than 98% of the total related to the Global Funds sector.</p>  <p>  Following this evaluation, Revenue initiated thirty three investigations. In eight of the investigations it was determined that there were no additional tax liabilities. Nineteen investigations resulted in settlement payments of &euro;4,559,371. In addition, a further amount of &euro;172,442 has been received, as payment on account, in relation to two appeals against tax assessments entered as a result of investigations into the account holders. Six investigations are ongoing.</p>  <p>  In addition to pursuing taxes owed, the Revenue Commissioners have also sought to have criminal proceedings brought in any cases where the information provided by the French authorities and their own subsequent investigations suggested that there was sufficient evidence to prosecute in respect of identified tax offences. Three prosecutions have been secured, resulting in the imposition of fines ranging from &euro;4,000 to &euro;25,000, and a further case remains under investigation. On the question of possible further prosecutions, it is not open to the Revenue Commissioners to comment as to whether any individual or corporate entity is under investigation with a view to prosecution. </p>  <p>  I am advised also that a detailed report on the overall investigation has been submitted to the Public Accounts Committee by the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  On the question of disclosure of the names of account holders, the Deputy will appreciate that the Revenue Commissioners have, under section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, a duty of confidentiality in respect of taxpayer information, and that they may disclose such information only where expressly authorised by law to do so. To date, nine of the settlement payments made to Revenue have satisfied the statutory criteria for publication and details have been published in Revenue s defaulters  list. </p></reply>

As outlined in Ireland's Road Map for Tax Competitiveness, published with Budget 2015, Ireland is maintaining its commitment to ensuring an open and transparent tax regime. One of the key ways we are doing this is through our commitment to the exchange of information between revenue authorities, in particular the automatic exchange of information. The automatic exchange of information between tax authorities is a vital tool in the worldwide fight against tax fraud and tax evasion and Ireland, along with our EU partners, has led the way in the promotion of this new global standard. At the October Ecofin, Ireland welcomed the political agreement on the recent revision to the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (which provides for automatic exchange of information within the EU), and we have legislated for it in Finance Act 2014. This was based on the new OECD Common Reporting Standard.</p>  <p>  Ireland  welcomed the G20 and OECD endorsements of the new Common Reporting Standard for automatic exchange of tax information in 2014, and we are one of the countries that have committed to early implementation of this standard. As a member of this Early Adopters Group Ireland welcomes all efforts to increase tax transparency at both international and EU level. Ireland was the fourth country in the world to sign a FATCA agreement with the United States in 2012, which was the inspiration for this new Common Reporting Standard. During our EU Presidency in 2013 Ireland prioritised work in the area of tax fraud and evasion and made significant progress, notably in brokering agreement on Ecofin council conclusions on a Commission Action Plan on Tax Fraud and Evasion.     </p>  <p>  In addition the results of the most recent Global Forum comprehensive analysis of how countries exchange tax information with each other, confirm that Ireland meets the highest international standards. The report confirms, following a forensic peer review, that the Irish system for the exchange of tax information is as good as anywhere in the world, and better than most.

I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or in relation to the mortgage interest rates charged.  It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations.  The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. </p>  <p>  As I stated in previous Parliamentary Questions, a previous Deputy Governor indicated that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr Patrick Honohan in his opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last November stated that, as in most advanced economies, including Ireland, it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis. Such control would strongly discourage new entrants. In this regard, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services.  In this regard, there has been some movements on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggest that the market may well be entering a new and more competitive phase.  </p>  <p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.  This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the Central Bank's work on mortgage arrears, lenders were asked to consider all avenues to help customers in arrears, including interest rate reductions.  </p></reply>

Each application for revision is considered by a "revision officer" appointed by the Commissioner of Valuation. </p>  <p>  The term "Material Change of Circumstances" is defined in the Valuation Act 2001. However, the main criteria for satisfying the rule are as follows:</p>  <p>1. The property is a new property that has never been valued before.</p>  <p>2. The property is an existing property which has been divided into 2 or more separate properties.</p>  <p>3. Two or more existing properties have been amalgamated into a single property.</p>  <p>4. There has been a change in the rateable status of an existing property. This occurs when a property which was previously rateable becomes no longer rateable or a property which was not previously rateable has now become rateable.</p>  <p>5. The property is an existing property whose value has changed by virtue of structural/physical alterations (including damage by fire or other physical cause).</p>  <p>  The latter criterion refers to a situation where an existing property undergoes structural or physical alterations which affect the value of the property. This usually refers to extensions, demolitions or other situations where the physical size or nature of the property has changed significantly (either made larger or smaller). It is important to note this condition in its entirety - i.e. the changes to the property must have brought about a change to its value. For example, a minor alteration such as adding a small porch to the front of a building will increase its total size, but may not affect its overall value for rating purposes. Also, a simple change of use is not sufficient on its own to be considered a Material Change of Circumstances, if the physical "bricks and mortar" of the property have not been altered. A change in the economic circumstances of a property (e.g. something which brings about new trading conditions) does not, of itself, constitute a Material Change of Circumstances which would result in a successful application for a revision of valuation. Unless a ratepayer's property meets at least one of the conditions referred to above, the Valuation Office will not be able to legally amend or alter a valuation. If a property satisfies the Material Change of Circumstances condition a revised valuation is determined.</p>  <p>  If a person is dissatisfied with a decision of the Valuation Office on his application for a revision of valuation there are a number of opportunities to either make representations on the proposed valuation or to appeal the final valuation to the Commissioner of Valuation and subsequently to the independent Valuation Tribunal. A further appeal can be made to the High Court on a point of law.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. As with all local charges, the invoicing and collection of due amounts is a matter for the local authority concerned to manage in the light of prevailing local circumstances and in accordance with normal accountancy procedures.</p></reply>

They can be used in public procurement in cases where they are targeted at factoring into the procurement process consideration of social issues such as employment opportunities, equal opportunities and social inclusion.  In order to be compatible with EU law, they must be made known to all interested parties at tender stage and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States.<br/><br/>In order to ensure that social clauses do not discriminate, it is best to use general categories of beneficiary (e.g. long-term unemployed, trainees, young people) and then target the social benefits through 'supply-side' activities (e.g. training and job-matching services). Targeted social clauses are effective in cases where they are actively supported by supply-side actions and good monitoring and evaluation processes taken by the Department or Agency with the relevant policy remit. <br/><br/>As the Deputy is aware, I announced the establishment of a Social Clauses Project Group led by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) to pro-actively seek projects with a view to including social clauses to ensure those awarded contracts contribute to employment or training opportunities for long term unemployed. In order to assist to OGP in this task, sectors have nominated projects for inclusion in the pilot from their respective procurement pipelines of projects for 2015. <br/><br/>The Government favours a targeted approach to the use of social clauses focused on contracts where employers are likely to be hiring additional workers to deliver the contract.  This should mitigate the risk of displacing workers already in employment while offering the opportunity of assisting with labour activation measures for the long-term unemployed.<br/><br/>Overall, OGP wants to gain practical experience from the pilot on the effective use of social clauses that will assist in the development of a robust and effective social procurement framework. The OGP will review the approach and issue guidance.<br/><br/>In the interim it is permissible to include social clauses provided they are not designed to disadvantage non-local contractors and they form part of the core purpose of the contract and must provide a benefit to the authority at award stage. </p></reply>

This would be subject to consultation with the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman for Children and the relevant Oireachtas Committee, in this case the Committee on Investigations, Oversight and Petitions in respect of such Orders.  I can confirm that no such Orders have been made and it is not the case that any organisation which conforms to the definition of a public body in Part 1 of the First Schedule of the 2012 Act has been removed from the remit of the Ombudsman.</p></reply>

The Act also established the Commission for Public Service Appointments (CPSA) as the regulator of civil service recruitment. The CPSA publishes codes of practice setting out how competitions are run and also issues recruitment licences to individual Departments to allow them to conduct their own recruitment.<br/><br/>Recruitment competitions are advertised on . By logging on to this website, individuals can also register to be notified by e-mail or text message of vacancies as they arise. Most recruitment competitions will have regional options and candidates will be asked to express a regional preference as part of the application process. <br/><br/>The majority of recruitment to the Civil Service is carried out by the PAS and the following competitions across a broad range of Civil Service grades are ongoing at present:<br/><br/>- Clerical Officer;<br/><br/>- Administrative Officer (i.e. the graduate recruitment grade for the Civil Service), for general service as well as for the Irish Government Economic Evaluation Service (IGEES);<br/><br/>- Executive Officer (both for general service and for the ICT area); and<br/><br/>- Principal Officer. <br/><br/>In the main, vacancies in the Civil service are filled on a permanent basis. However, temporary vacancies arise from time to time to cover such absences as maternity leave or shorter working year, and where a permanent vacancy will not exist. Temporary Clerical Officer (TCO) positions in the Civil Service are filled by an annual competition conducted by the PAS which is usually advertised in February. The next TCO competition will be advertised shortly and will include both Dublin and regional panels, Departments and Offices can then call from these panels in accordance with business needs.</p></reply>

As part of the reforms we have introduced, the REV also now contains information about the performance of Departments in relation to each of their Strategic Programme areas; this means that the Oireachtas and the public now not only have financial data about how much is being allocated and spent on the Strategic Programmes of each Department, but also data about the outcomes and results of that expenditure in relation to each such Programme.<br/><br/>I agree that the print size is very small on the page identifed by the Deputy in the 2015 REV.  This resulted from our seeking to present the performance information about each Strategic Programme on a single page.  My Department will reconsider how the information is presented in our next Estimates publication; we wish the information to be clear and readily accessible.  Of course most of our publications are accessed via electronic means nowadays rather than via the paper document, and the REV is available on my Department's website () where it can be scaled up to different sizes for comfort of accessibility by the reader.<br/><br/>Finally, the Deputy may be interested to know that a wealth of performance data is now also readily available on the public service performance information website) that we introduced and have been expanding over the last few years.  It now contains over 1,200 performance indicators for 35 Programmes across 11 Departments and is being updated on an on-going basis. </p></reply>

These Regulations came into operation on 1 July 2013.  Since July 2014 structural steelwork and aluminium now fall under the CPR and therefore must carry CE marking to demonstrate that they comply with the European Commission&rsquo;s harmonised standard EN 1090-1:2009 which relates to the Execution of Steel Structures and Aluminium Structures.  Under EN standard 1090, there are requirements for conformity assessment of structural components, which involves a number of steps that culminate in certification by a third party, known as a 'notified inspection body'.  In Ireland, the certification role is performed by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI).<br/><br/>Information on the CPR itself and other building regulations can be found on the website of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government who have allocated responsibility for compliance with the CPR to the building control officers under the local authorities. <br/><br/>In view of the NSAI&rsquo;s final certification role, and given the roles and responsibilities of other Departments and agencies, my Department has discussed the requirements of the CPR with the relevant Departments and agencies i.e. Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (DECLG), Department of Education and Skills, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) network and the NSAI. <br/><br/>The role of the LEOs is to provide information, guidance and assistance to small and micro firms, and to signpost these firms to other agencies or bodies where appropriate.  Over the last few weeks some of the LEOs, in conjunction with the NSAI, have held four information workshops to date at various locations throughout the country to ensure that steel fabricators had full information about the requirements under the CPR.  In addition, the NSAI hosted an information day for the LEOs network on 18<sup>th</sup>February, at which the NSAI outlined its certification role.  Fifteen LEOs were represented. <br/><br/>Any training needs (e.g. welding courses) for steel fabricators arising from the CPR should be directed &ndash; in the first instance &ndash; to the local SOLAS office, Education and Training Board (ETB) or Institute of Technology (IT) which fall within the remit of the Department of Education and Skills.  There may be scope to see what economies of scale might be achieved for companies seeking the same upskilling in the same area.<br/><br/>Any difficulty facing the small business sector is a concern.  That is why I would encourage companies to pursue the information and guidance that is available through the DECLG website , the LEOs and the NSAI , training avenues should be explored with SOLAS/ETBs/ITs for welding courses, and ultimately, CE marking certification can be organised through the NSAI for companies who have successfully implemented the requirements of the CPR.</p></reply>

Due to the technical nature of the approvals process specific induction and training is required.<br/><br/>The average days from application to approval are improving and the NSAI are aiming to reduce the backlog over the next 4-6 weeks with the target lead times of 10 days being achieved by the end of Q2.  In this regard, I would urge companies to ensure that complete and accurate technical information is provided to allow NSAI to expedite the completion of the certification process.</p></reply>

Essentially all applications for aid under EU funded Direct Payment Schemes must be subjected to these administrative checks to ensure their accuracy and validity.  The Direct Payment Schemes involved include the Single Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the Grassland Sheep Scheme, REPS and AEOS.    </p>  <p>  In accordance with the provisions of Article 28 of Regulation 1122/2009, the administrative checks must include cross-checks, using computerised means, to verify the eligibility of the land parcels declared for aid including the area declared for payment purposes.  In Ireland, the computerised database used for this purpose is known as the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS).  Member States also have obligations to protect EU funds when making payments under EU funded or partially funded Schemes.  In that regard, there is an obligation to ensure that the LPIS database is as accurate as is possible.  My Department is constantly updating the LPIS database. The updating is done using a combination of all of the following options:</p>  <p>- Land parcel maps submitted by farmers, which identify areas or features to be excluded.</p>  <p>- Findings of eligibility inspections including ground and remote-sensing inspections.</p>  <p>- Review of ortho-imagery to exclude ineligible area, which were identified on the imagery.  This updating exercise would also include ground verification visits to verify the initial findings based on the ortho-image and also to confirm whether there is a farming activity carried out on the parcel or parcels.</p>  <p>  The inspections in the case of the commonages referred to come under the third option and are not ground eligibility checks carried out in accordance with Articles 30, 31 and 32 of Regulation (EU) No 1122/2009 under which a control report is prepared. </p></reply>

In addition, Article 11 of this Regulation provides that the labelling and presentation of feed shall not mislead the user as to, <i>inter alia</i>, its composition, properties, nature or method of manufacture.  Furthermore, Annex IV lists permitted tolerances for the compositional labelling of feed materials or compound feed as referred to in Article11(5).  Accordingly, feed manufacturers are required to set out clearly on a label the composition of the animal feed for sale, within the permitted tolerances.  If it is the case that an end-user of animal feedingstuffs is of the view that the composition of a feed is at variance with its label details, they should raise this matter with the feed manufacturer in the first instance.

Following this, if the complainant so wishes, he would have the option to refer the matter to the Office of the Ombudsman.   </p></reply>

Of this, 49 were released on temporary release on that day.</p>  <p>   I wish to advise the Deputy that the Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014 was signed into law by the President on 16 April 2014.  The aim of the legislation is to seek to effectively eliminate, in so far as is possible, the need for judges to commit anyone to prison for the non-payment of a fine.  As well as introducing an option for persons to pay fines by instalment, there are also changes in the way those who fail to pay fines are dealt with, with a range of options available to judges including recovery orders, attachment of earnings, community service and ultimately imprisonment.  </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing in preparing for the implementation of the Act.  The area most directly affected by the changes is the Courts and the Courts Service is working on a number of developments which will ensure that the implementation of the legislation, and the new procedures which will operate under it, are as efficient as possible.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the introduction of payment of fines by instalment, a decision was taken to outsource all aspects of the recovery of fines to an external provider.  The Courts Service is introducing new arrangements for the payment of fines which will allow payments to be made in a range of outlets across the country, and not just through Courts Service offices.  There are significant changes in information technology required to ensure that the instalment payment system operates effectively and that the necessary accounting procedures are in place for the recording of payments.  Changes are also required in the way that information is transferred between the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that both organisations have fully up to date information on the cases and their current status.  </p>  <p>  It is expected that all the preparations for the new system will be completed by the third quarter of 2015.  While it is desirable that the Act be commenced as soon as possible, it is important that these preparations are done correctly to ensure that the significant changes being implemented in the fines system as a result of this legislation are implemented smoothly and effectively from the start.  </p></reply>

The review of current arrangements being undertaken by the Department of Health aims to explore the feasibility of setting up a system to allow appropriately trained non-medical persons to have ready access to certain prescription-only medicines for use in emergency situations, while ensuring that medicines continue to be controlled in an appropriate manner. </p>  <p>  Submissions to the public consultation are expected from a wide variety of respondents.  It is anticipated that strong engagement from the public and other stakeholders will help to inform a policy decision in this area within the coming months.  The details of the consultation process can be found on my Department's website www.health.gov.ie.  The closing date for responses is 13 March 2015.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the HSE, unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.  In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p></reply>

Mr. CHEN Zhu, Minister of Health of the People's Republic of China extended an invitation to visit China to James Reilly, the then Minister for Health.  Minister Reilly visited China from 13 to 19 August 2012.<br/><br/>A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on health co-operation between the Department of Health of Ireland and the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China was signed by both Ministers at a bilateral meeting on 16 August 2012.  The Memorandum replaced a previous MOU which covered the period 2004 to 2009.  The objective of the MOU is to encourage and develop cooperation and exchange in the field of healthcare between the two countries.<br/><br/>The areas of co-operation set out in the Memorandum 2012 - 2017 are:<br/><br/>1.Health regulation.<br/><br/>2.eHealth and telemedicine<br/><br/>3.Medical professional training <br/><br/>4.Health promotion<br/><br/>5.Maternal and child health<br/><br/>6.Hospital standards<br/><br/>7.Traditional Chinese medicine<br/><br/>In May 2013, Minister Reilly hosted a visit from Madam Li Bin (appointed Health Minister in March 2013) and a delegation of senior officials from China's National Health and Family Planning Commission (HHFPC).  The programme included meetings with Minister Reilly and senior officials at which a range of health issues were discussed including health reform, public hospital management, primary health care, community health services and general practitioner training.Visits to a primary care centre and St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin also took place.  The visit afforded the opportunity to discuss issues of mutual interest and establish links between appropriate institutions.  It also provided the delegation from China to witness and learn of examples of good practice in the health area.<br/><br/>I am aware that in September 2014 sixteen Chinese healthcare workers (GPs) and two Chinese officials were invited to Ireland by the Royal College of Surgeons (RCSI), the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) and Heedo (accredited healthcare education online company) to visit a number of primary care centres in Dublin, Kildare and Cork and to attend a series of GP training workshops in key primary care teaching facilities.<br/><br/>The current MOU is valid until 2017.  </p></reply>

In order to meet this challenge a wide-ranging set of measures have been put in place.  The Government provided additional funding of &euro;3m last December and &euro;25m in Budget 2015 to address delayed discharges.  This funding is being targeted at hospital and community services to address specific needs of delayed discharge patients. The funding will support <br/><br/>- 300 extra people under the Nursing Home Support Scheme.  <br/><br/>- 50 additional transitional care beds allocated to the Dublin Hospitals on a named patient basis which will be recycled to the hospitals when available.<br/><br/>- 65 beds to be brought on stream on a phased basis, during 2015 at Mount Carmel Hospital.<br/><br/>- 400 extra Home Care Packages to benefit 600 people in the course of the year. <br/><br/>- The expansion of the community intervention team services in primary care.<br/><br/>Increased levels of activity being experienced in acute hospitals since the beginning of January 2015, driven by presentations of older people with chronic disease and the ongoing high level of delayed discharge experienced by the hospitals have led to further measures being required.  These include the funding of 900 transitional care beds in private nursing homes (500 in January, and a further 400 in February), as a short-term measure to assist in the discharge of patients from acute hospitals, and 173 short-stay public beds being opened across the country for a three month period.</p></reply>

However, the Government recognises that the health service needs to be responsive to the circumstances of people with significant medical needs.  In November 2014 the Minister for Health and I announced a series of measures to enhance the operation of the medical card scheme and make it more sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs, especially where serious illness is involved.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold.  Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs and appliances under the Long Term Illness scheme, where the qualification criteria are met.</p>  <p>  The medical card system is now operating in a more sensible and sensitive manner.  Greater discretion is clearly being exercised by the HSE because the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation has increased by about 50% - from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to nearly 79,000 at the end of January this year. </p>  <p>  The HSE has recently established a Clinical Advisory Group for Medical Card Eligibility.  The Group will provide oversight and guidance to the operation of a more compassionate medical card system and will focus initially on the development of a framework for assessment and measurement of the burden of disease in this context.</p></reply>

Overall there are of the order of 80 projects detailed, of which approximately 40 relate to acute care services and the remainder to community care services including primary care. </p>  <p>  Planned infrastructure developments to support acute facilities include the National Ambulance Control and Call Centre at Tallaght; the upgrade and replacement of equipment for BreastCheck; the new endoscopy unit at Roscommon General Hospital; the fit-out of the underground car-park at Limerick UH; expansion of the radiology department at Clonmel&rsquo;s South Tipperary General Hospital; completion of the new ED, medical assessment unit and endoscopy unit at St Luke&rsquo;s Kilkenny; additional cubicle space and resus accommodation at Tallaght ED and upgrade of its endoscopy unit.  At Connolly Hospital, the radiology department upgrade is being completed and its urology department expanded.  In addition, planning for the new Children&rsquo;s Hospital and the relocation of the NMH to St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital is progressing.</p>  <p>  The HSE is also undertaking a substantial infrastructure project at Naas General Hospital.  The project will be a two storey build.  An  oncology unit and a physical medicine department (which includes physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy) will be accommodated on the ground floor adjacent to the main concourse and out-patients.  An endoscopy unit will be located on the first floor adjacent to the theatre department, which is the ideal location from a patient safety, logistics and staffing viewpoint.  </p>  <p>  The opening of the Ballinamore primary care centre earlier this month brings to 43 the number of primary care centres opened since March 2011.  This represents considerable progress.  Overall there are now 86 primary care centres operating across the country.  There  are  also currently over 30 locations where  primary care infrastructure is at an  advanced planning stage and approximately 50 further locations where the HSE proposes to use the operational lease mechanism to deliver primary care infrastructure.  In November 2014, the HSE advertised a further 73 locations for delivery by the operational lease mechanism; the closing date for expressions of interest was mid-January 2015.  </p>  <p>  In the light of recent Emergency Department pressures the HSE has postponed most elective care, apart from cancer and urgent cases, whilst opening all bed stock to the maximum extent possible to allow those who need immediate treatment to be accommodated.  Hospital bed requirements generally will be further considered by hospital groups in their strategic plans, which are due to be developed this year as part of the implementation of the groups.  Changing clinical practice requirements and the closer integration of community and hospitals services which, it is anticipated, will see more care and treatment delivered in community settings in the future, will be taken into account in these plans.</p></reply>

However, the issue of pricing and reimbursement of medicines has been the subject of recent discussion at an EU level.</p>  <p>  The Council of the European Union issued conclusions in December 2014 on the issue of innovation for the benefit of patients which included the issue of co-operation on the pricing of medicines between Member States.  The Council conclusions invited the European Commission and Member States to examine opportunities for potential co-operation on a voluntary basis in the field of pricing and reimbursement.</p>  <p>  I have indicated previously in discussions at an EU level on this issue that I am supportive of proposals that would deliver greater transparency in prices.  However, I am mindful that this may be difficult to achieve as Member States negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies to agree commercially confidential discounts on the price of medicines and to establish patient access schemes.</p>  <p>  A number of mechanisms exist at a European level to assist with the issue of pricing and reimbursement of medicines.  In 2008 the network of Competent Authorities on Pricing and Reimbursement was created of which Ireland is a member.  This is an informal platform which discusses the issues and challenges in the field of pricing and reimbursement of medicines.  Ireland also has access to the EU Euripid Database which was launched in 2010. This is a web based database which provides up to date information on the prices of medicines which can be accessed by participating Member States. </p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that a Joint Procurement Agreement for medical countermeasures is in place at an EU level which enables countries, including Ireland, to procure pandemic vaccines and other medical countermeasures on a group rather than individual basis.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable. It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need.  Patients with the greatest level of need, i.e. Grade 5 or some with a Grade 4 are provided with treatment by the HSE. </p>  <p>  The HSE has established a pilot scheme in Dublin North East which will involve the use of orthodontic therapists in the treatment of a number of eligible children.  In addition to the services provided by HSE staff, orthodontic treatment for certain categories of misalignment will be provided by a panel of independent practitioners under contract to the HSE over the next three years.  A national procurement process is being finalised.  This initiative will especially focus on those waiting for 4 years or longer. It is expected that this initiative will have a positive impact on waiting times.</p></reply>

The Foreign Affairs Council adopted conclusions on Yemen at this meeting which reflect the urgency of the situation on the ground.     </p>  <p>  My Department has no information on the case of the individual in question other than publically available reports on his arrest and treatment at the hands of the authorities, as well as the calls by organisations such as Human Rights Watch for the charges against him to be dropped. </p>  <p>  Ireland does not have an Embassy in Sana&rsquo;a.  The present crisis in Yemen has resulted in a vacuum of effective political authority.  Until this situation improves, the scope for us to engage with Yemeni authorities on this or any other matter is severely constrained.</p>  <p>  Freedom of religion and belief continues to be a priority area for our human rights policy.  The persecution of any individual on the ground of his religious beliefs is unacceptable wherever it occurs.  My Department regularly engages with the Baha&rsquo;i community in Ireland on this issue, and they are represented on my Department&rsquo;s standing committee on human rights. </p>  <p>  Ireland participated in the Universal Periodic Review of Yemen at the UN Human Rights Council in January 2014.  Both of the recommendations we made in this review were accepted by Yemen.  Our most recent statement on human rights in Yemen was in September 2014 at the Human Rights Council where we welcomed the UN efforts to conclude a &lsquo;Peace and National Partnership Agreement&rsquo;.  Regrettably, the promise of this agreement has not yet been fulfilled.  Our statement at this time called for an end to hostilities and expressed serious concern about the death penalty in Yemen and the recruitment of child soldiers. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the political, security and human rights situation in Yemen, including monitoring in so far as is possible the case raised by this question in this regard.</p></reply>

I had also intended to visit Jordan but it was not possible to visit on this occasion due to deteriorating weather conditions.  I hope to reschedule that visit in the near future.<br/><br/>In Lebanon, I had the opportunity to meet with the UNIFIL Force Commander, Lieutenant General Portolano, who briefed me on UNIFIL&rsquo;s operations and, in particular, on the impact on those operations of the continuing regional instability.  I also visited the Irish UNIFIL troops and I had the honour of laying a wreath at the memorial in Tibnin in honour of the Irish soldiers who have died in UNIFIL service. <br/><br/>The primary purpose of my visit to Israel and the Palestinian territory was to gather information and develop a deeper understanding of the situation on the ground in the context of the Middle East Peace Process. <br/><br/>What was striking overall was that increasing instability, in particular arising from the conflict in Syria and the violence unleashed by the so-called Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, but including the deteriorating situation in Yemen and Libya, is casting a shadow over the entire region.<br/><br/>I met with a range of interlocutors, including the Foreign Minister of Israel, Avigdor Liberman, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Prime Minister, Rami Hamdallah.  I did not meet with Hamas in Gaza.<br/><br/>I also met with UN agencies and with civil society groups to develop a better understanding of the issues faced on all sides.<br/><br/>In Gaza, I was struck by the desperation of the humanitarian situation for so many people on the ground.  There, I met with Pierre Krahenbuhl, the Commissioner General of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).  <br/><br/>I visited an UNRWA school and a temporary shelter for families displaced by last year&rsquo;s conflict, where I met with a number of families directly affected by the conflict. <br/><br/>In my subsequent meeting with Foreign Minister Liberman, I raised the need to make further progress in lifting the blockade to meet humanitarian need and as an enabler of social and economic progress.<br/><br/>One of the big challenges for the reconstruction of Gaza is that much of the money committed at the Cairo Conference on Reconstruction has not yet materialised.  I was pleased to announce funding of &euro;4.7 million for UNRWA and the UN&rsquo;s Emergency Response Fund in the course of my visit.  I hope that other donors can move quickly to deliver on their commitments. <br/><br/>I also met Israelis living near the border with Gaza who live in fear of Hamas attacks.<br/><br/>In the West Bank, I saw at first-hand the impact of settlements, including on the daily life of Palestinians.  In my meeting with Minister Liberman, I raised the issue of settlements and the fact that their continued expansion is a threat to the viability of a two-State solution. <br/><br/>At the end of my visit, I had an opportunity to discuss the situation with the Quartet representative, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.  I also had a telephone conversation with the leader of Israel&rsquo;s Labour Party, Isaac Herzog, who has strong links with Ireland.  In all of my meetings, I emphasised the need for political leadership and risk-taking.  <br/><br/>Israel is currently in the middle of an election and I hope that we will also soon see elections to the Palestinian Authority. <br/><br/>I met last month in Dublin with the EU High Representative, Federica Mogherini, and I spoke with her again from Israel last week.  She is committed to increasing the EU&rsquo;s engagement in the Middle East Peace Process.  She is proposing a reappraisal of the EU&rsquo;s approach and how it can best contribute to creating the conditions for a resumption of purposeful negotiations aimed at the achievement of a two-State solution in co-operation with other key players.  This accords with my own thinking, and my visit will enable me to contribute substantively to the discussions she will convene. <br/><br/>I also had a number of engagements not directly related to the Middle East Peace Process.  <br/><br/>I visited the site of Teva, an Israeli pharmaceutical company that employs more than 500 people in Ireland.This was an important reminder that Ireland&rsquo;s relations with Israel are, and should be, multifaceted. <br/><br/>I was also honoured and moved to lay a wreath at Yad Vashem, the memorial to the victims of the holocaust. </p></reply>

It is clearly important to bring about a return to serious negotiations, and I encouraged this in my political meetings during my visit to the region last week.  However, there is a widespread view among EU Ministers, which I share, that neither party is at this moment ready for such engagement.  This is particularly true in advance of the election in Israel next month.  In addition, the existence of multiple parallel crises across the Middle East region has clearly demanded much of the attention of the international community. </p>  <p>  It is also very clear that it is not enough to focus specifically on the opening of negotiations, unless both parties also come to the table ready to seek an agreement.  This has been a major weakness in some previous efforts.   </p>  <p>  I believe that, for our part, the EU needs to reconsider carefully its approach to the Middle East Peace Process, and what it can do to help create conditions conducive to the resumption of purposeful negotiations.  I have discussed this with High Representative Federica Mogherini, and she is of the same mind.  I look forward to participating in that discussion at EU level.</p></reply>

It is schools that employ teachers and not my Department.  However my Department has issued a number of Circulars addressing this issue in recent years.<br/><br/>  Under these Circulars School Principals must maintain a list of unemployed registered teachers who are available for substitute work at short notice and report to the Board of Management on any exceptional occasion where they have had to engage a registered teacher who is retired.  Circular 31/2011 details a cascade of measures for the recruitment of teachers, prioritising registered teachers over retired registered teachers and unregistered people.<br/><br/>  A retired teacher who returns to teaching on or after 1 February 2012 will commence at the first point of the incremental salary scale (i.e. the lowest point or starting salary for teachers).  Incremental credit for service prior to 1 February 2012, qualification allowances and certain job role allowances are also not payable.  This measure represents a significant financial disincentive for teachers who retired at the top of their salary scale, often with a post of responsibility allowance, to return to teaching. <br/><br/>  The most recent information available on retired teachers employed by managerial authorities of schools relates to the 2013/2014 school year. <br/><br/>  During this period a total of 9,421 teaching days were worked by retired teachers.  Retired Primary school teachers worked 5,259 days and retired Voluntary Secondary and Community and Comprehensive schools teachers worked 4,162 days.  This is equivalent to 0.09% and 0.15% of the teaching allocation for the 2013/2014 school year in the respective sector. <br/><br/>  A total of 537 retired teachers were employed during the 2013/14 school year: 302 retired Primary teachers and 235 retired Voluntary Secondary and Community and Comprehensive teachers.  74% of those teachers worked the equivalent of 20 days or less during the entire school year.  The number of retired Education and Training Board teaching staff who have been re-employed is not readily available in my Department.</p></reply>

The circular sets out the improvements to the staffing schedule for the 2015/16 school year for small schools.  These improvements are improved retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher and also the improved appointment and retention thresholds for isolated one-teacher schools.  These improvements are estimated to benefit of the order of about 30 small schools.  The final number of schools to benefit from these improvements to the staffing schedule will be known in the Autumn after the teacher allocation process has fully transacted. <br/><br/>  These improvements particularly recognise the challenges faced by very small schools that are more than 8 km from the next nearest school of the same type.<br/><br/>This package of measures will provide rural communities with security about the future of their small schools, recognising the essential social function which small schools can play, especially in isolated communities.<br/><br/>  These improvements in the Staffing Schedule for small schools are the only changes that I am making to the staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 2015/16 school year.</p></reply>

Many pupils with special educational needs will be able to attend a local mainstream school, whereas for pupils who have needs which require more specialist interventions, special class and special school placements are provided for. <br/><br/>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), engages with schools annually in order to plan for, and to open, new special classes each yea, in order to ensure there are sufficient special class placements available at primary and post-primary school level to meet demand in a given area.<br/><br/>  SENOs also assist parents to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs and advise parents in relation to supports which may be available to support children with special educational needs, including special transport arrangements which may be made available.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. <br/><br/>  The NCSE will continue to monitor and review the requirement for special class places in the area referred to by the Deputy and has capacity to open such new special classes where necessary.<br/><br/>  Parents may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and to seek assistance in identifying placement options, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie. <br/><br/>  The NCSE has published a Guide for Parents and Guardians of Children and Young People with Special Educational Needs on Choosing a School.

The General Allocation Model contains provision for resource teaching hours for pupils with mild general learning difficulty and also learning support provision for pupils who have learning needs but who may not have been assessed as having a learning difficulty. <br/><br/>  I am aware that some parents, and organisations representing children with Down's syndrome, continue to have concerns that the existing system does not give them certainty as to the number of resource teaching hours that may be allocated to their child under the General Allocation Model, as these hours are distributed locally by schools.  <br/><br/>I met with Down Syndrome Ireland, and with some parents of children with Down's syndrome, recently on 19th February.

The Student Assistance Fund is administered on a local basis by participating higher education institutions and targets those students most in need.  The overall allocation to both these funds in the 2014-15 academic year is &euro;15.5m &ndash; the same as in 2013-14.  The determination of the allocation of this fund between the two sub-priorities is a matter for the HEA and involves balancing the needs of students with disabilities for reasonable accommodations with that of students in more general, financial need.  While the overall Third Level Access Measure has remained stable, a rising demand by both students with disabilities and those in need of Student Assistance Funding has had to be accommodated within this.  Both the HEA and overall education budget have been fully committed for the current academic year.  The matter of whether there is scope to increase the overall Third Level Access Measure in the next academic year will be revisited as part of the budgetary process for 2015-16 academic year.  This year the HEA also plan to commission an independent review of policy, guidelines and practice in relation to the Student Assistance Fund. </p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.<br/><br/>The approach taken to dispute resolution for customers of Irish Water is consistent with the general approach for commercial State companies and recognises that Irish Water is working in a different regulatory framework than that which obtained prior to 1 January 2014.  It was a policy decision of the Government to establish Irish Water as a public utility and this is reflected in the Water Services Acts 2013. <br/><br/>Section 32 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall submit a code or codes of practice to the CER for approval and the CER may modify any such code.  A code of practice made under section 32 can include,<i>inter alia</i>, a provision for customer complaints to Irish Water in relation to provision of water services, the standards for the performance by Irish Water of its functions and any other matter the CER considers necessary and appropriate to secure the interests of customers of Irish Water.  In discharging its functions, the CER may consult with Irish Water, the public, or any other person it considers appropriate.  Irish Water also has a statutory obligation to comply with any direction from the CER in relation to the approved codes.  Irish Water&rsquo;s approved codes of practice can be found on its website at:<br/><br/>Similar to the approach it has taken in the electricity and gas industries, the CER has required Irish Water to submit a Customer Handbook outlining the minimum requirements of customer service standards they will provide to their customers.  The Customer Handbook comprises Irish Water&rsquo;s Customer Charter, Codes of Practice and the Terms and Conditions of supply.  Following a public consultation on the document, the CER published the approved Irish Water Customer Handbook in August 2014.  On 17th February 2015, the CER published a revised version of the Irish Water Customer Handbook which takes account of changes required following the enactment of the Water Services Act 2014.  The revised handbook is available on the CER website at:<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Water Services Act 2014 provides that there will be a statutory basis for the investigation by the CER of customer complaints, which Irish Water has not resolved. This will be similar to the service operated by the Commission for the gas and electricity markets.  An updated Irish Water Code of Practice on Complaint Handling has been sent to the CER for approval, to reflect the legislative change. <br/><br/>In addition, the CER will be engaging with both Irish Water and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop complementary complaints processes to ensure customers are directed in an efficient manner to the appropriate organisation with their complaint or query.  In this regard, it should be noted that Irish Water is also subject to statutory supervision by the EPA and the Health Service Executive in respect of any environmental and human health aspects of its water services provision.</p></reply>

In this regard, letters have issued to each local authority, from my Department, seeking delivery proposals, across all delivery mechanisms, for the years 2015 to 2017 and returns are currently being received and collated.<br/><br/>With regard to overall national delivery targets for 2015, I expect that some 7,400 new social housing units will be provided, broken down as follows:<br/><br/>- 1,400 units to be built or acquired by local authorities and approved housing bodies;<br/><br/>- 3,000 units under the Social Housing Leasing Initiative;<br/><br/>- 1,000 vacant local authority units will be returned to use ;and<br/><br/>- 2,000 new Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS)units.<br/><br/>In addition, a further 8,400 households will be assisted through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Total housing provision for 2015 will result in an investment of almost &euro;800 million across a range of housing programmes.<br/><br/>Over the two year period 2016 to 2017, I envisage some 13,500 additional new units will be provided, while a further 22,000 households will also be accommodated through HAP and RAS in that period. The precise details of the delivery will be agreed on a local authority by local authority basis.<br/><br/>In terms of land use, local authorities will have regard to the suitability and availability of land within their land banks and sites within the Land Aggregation Scheme, when making proposals to my Department.<br/><br/>Finally, my Department collates and publishes a wide range of housing and planning statistics that inform the preparation and evaluation of policy. Data on local authority housing stock (including the number of units completed and the number of units in progress, broken down by local authority) is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:.</p></reply>

Applications for a new round of funding, which commenced on 1 July 2014, were subject to an appraisal process. 55 applications were approved for funding for the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. The organisation referred to in the Question was not successful on this occasion.</p>  <p>  Pobal were asked to undertake the appraisal and management of the scheme and, in that context, put in place a dedicated team to deal with any inquiries from applicants and to provide detailed feedback. Furthermore, an appeals process was put in place, on foot of which Pobal submitted a report, which is currently being considered.</p>  <p>  On 18 July 2014, it was announced that bridging funding of &euro;1.4 million would be allocated for a twelve month period to a number of previously funded health, disability and other organisations that were not approved for funding under the new scheme, pending the carrying out of a review of the public funding of national organisations in the health and disability sector. This bridging funding in 2014/2015 is a once-off transitional arrangement and will enable organisations to plan for their future, whether with or without State support, such as that provided under the SSNO. The Migraine Association of Ireland was allocated &euro;29,014 for the twelve month period to 30 June 2015.</p>  <p>  The review process is underway and is being advanced in consultation with the Department of Health. The Health Service Executive and Pobal are also participating in the review. All organisations in receipt of bridging funding have been contacted to make submissions as part of the review process.

These Regulations are designed to promote the segregation and recovery of household food waste, in line with the national policy and the Waste Framework Directive objectives of maximising the resource which can be extracted from waste and minimising the disposal of waste.There are positive indications that the implementation and enforcement of these Regulations is resulting in more food waste being diverted from landfill. The Environmental Protection Agency recently published Compost and Anerobic Digestion (AD) Statistics for 2013 which highlighted the following trends:<br/><br/>-  The quantity of municipal organic waste accepted for treatment at composting facilities was 158 ktonnes in 2013, a 3% increase from 154 ktonnes in 2012;<br/><br/>-  The quantity of food waste accepted at composting and AD facilities in 2013 was up 8% (from 105 ktonnes in 2012 to 114 ktonnes in 2013); <br/><br/>-  The quantity of brown bin organic waste (food and garden waste) accepted at anaerobic digestion facilities increased from 0.7 ktonnes in 2010 to 7.7 ktonnes in 2013.<br/><br/>The successful roll-out of the brown bin is dependent on appropriate education and awareness measures being introduced to support households in using the brown bin correctly. In this regard, my Department has supported the organisation referred to through conference sponsorship and grants to fund food waste awareness campaigns. Support has also been provided to the organisation to develop a website, , to provide the public with the information required to use the brown bin appropriately, including advice on the optimal methods for effective collection and storage of food waste. <br/><br/>Further funding has been provided to conduct a review of best international practice on how to educate households on using the brown bin correctly and in implementing a pilot project on the use of brown bin advisors, a key recommendation of the review. The aim of this project is to assess how a range of educational and collection tools can improve the capture and quality of food waste in the brown bin.<br/><br/>This interaction demonstrates the continued close working relationship which exists between my Department and the organisation concerned. I am prepared to continue to support initiatives such as those outlined which assist the public in the diversion of their food waste towards more beneficial uses and to continue working with organisations that are active in developing measures that will increase the amount of food waste that is recovered through the production of energy, compost and digestate, thereby creating opportunities for added jobs and value.<br/><br/>Any requests from the organisation concerned for a meeting, either at Ministerial or Departmental level, will be considered, having regard to, inter alia, the suggested agenda and diary pressures.</p></reply>

IFI monitor the trends in the elver run at these locations on an annual basis. The data collected is used in Irelands reporting obligations to the European Commission under EU Regulation 1100/2007.  The data is also provided to the Eel Working Group of the European Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Advisory Commission (EIFAAC - United Nations) and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). The data is scientifically analysed and modelled to determine the eel production for Europe as eel stocks in Ireland are a component of a pan European stock. </p>  <p>  Ireland's Eel Management Plan (EMP) was accepted by the EU in 2009 under the 2007 EU Eel regulation. The plan outlined the following main management actions aimed at reducing eel mortality and increasing silver eel escapement to the sea:</p>  <p>  -  a cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market, </p>  <p>  -  mitigation of the impact of hydropower installations, </p>  <p>  -  ensure upstream migration of juvenile eel at barriers, </p>  <p>  -  an improvement of water quality.</p>  <p>  The overall requirement and objective is to provide, with high probability, a long-term 40% escapement to the sea of the biomass of silver eel, relative to pristine conditions (i.e. if the stock had been completely free of man-made influences including commercial fishing).</p>  <p>  The latest advice from ICES in 2014 states that &ldquo;The status of eel remains critical and ICES advises that all anthropogenic mortality (e.g. recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pumping stations, and pollution) affecting production and escapement of silver eels should be reduced to &ndash; or kept as close to &ndash; zero as possible. The annual recruitment to Europe has increased over the last 3 years from 5% to 12% of historic levels, however recruitment is still well below the reference levels of 1960-1979 and there is no change in the status of the eel as being critically endangered&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s EMP was reviewed in 2012 including a comprehensive scientific assessment of eel stocks nationally. The 2012 review included a robust public consultation during which many issues were raised and considered. Full details of the outputs of the public consultation are available on the Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) web site. Similar reviews were carried out across EU Member States as the eel stock has radically declined throughout Europe. The status of the European Eel is defined by the United Nations as critically endangered. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s EMP will be reviewed again this year and an opportunity for further consultation with, and submissions from, stakeholders will be advanced at that time.</p></reply>

One of the main ways that competitiveness is addressed at a European level is through ensuring that the EU has well-functioning, liberalised energy markets. This is seen as the most effective means to deliver energy to consumers at lowest cost.  The fall in oil and gas prices on international markets has not been a specific topic of discussion between energy ministers at recent meetings.<br/><br/>At a domestic level, the Commission for Energy Regulation's (CER) primary economic responsibilities in energy are to regulate the Irish electricity and natural gas sectors. There is free entry to the Irish oil market, no price control and it is Government policy to encourage price competition and consumer choice. It is important to note that the Irish oil sector is completely privatised, liberalised and deregulated and the CER has no role in the oil market.<br/><br/>Oil is consumed in two sectors of the economy - in transport and heating. The amount of oil used in the electricity sector is negligible at less than 1%. In terms of gasoline and diesel prices at the pump and home heating prices, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (under the aegis of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation) has a role in ensuring that the market is functioning correctly and that consumers are not being disadvantaged. Previous investigations and surveys into oil prices, including home heating oil, have been undertaken by the National Consumer Agency (now the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission), and these are available at . The research indicates that the price paid by consumers is largely determined by taxation levels, the internationally traded price of crude oil and the consequent price at which refined product is traded in Europe, along with the level of competition in the retail market.<br/><br/>The European Commission maintains a Statistics and Market Observatory, which presents consumer prices and net prices (excluding duties and taxes) of petroleum products in EU Member States (known as the Oil Bulletin) on a weekly basis. The Oil Bulletin is designed to improve the transparency of oil prices and to strengthen the internal market.

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided. <br/><br/>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades. Approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services within the next two years.<br/><br/>A public consultation on a national high speed coverage map 2016 which was launched last November, closed on the 12th February. 27 submissions have been received to date and will be assessed over the coming weeks in terms of the overall intervention strategy. The map continues to be available at . The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016. The AMBER area shows the target areas for the State intervention.<br/><br/>The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises or home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. It also provides detailed information on over 50,000 townlands throughout the entire country and includes islands in the north west of the country. All individual premises can be viewed on the map. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will be also delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.<br/><br/>In tandem with the mapping consultation, intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy. The strategy will address a range of issues in relation to the intervention including the optimum procurement model, ownership model for the infrastructure and likely market impact. <br/><br/>On 12th January, the Department attended a roundtable meeting in Brussels hosted by EU Telecommunications Commissioner, G&uuml;nther Oettinger. The aim of the meeting was to understand the challenges faced by Member States in ensuring high speed broadband availability to all citizens and to inform the development of the &quot;Juncker Plan&quot; funding package which aims to accelerate investment in broadband and other economic infrastructure. Arising from the roundtable, the Department had a further meeting with Commission officials and also met with the European Investment Bank to consider funding options. Discussions on the most appropriate funding model are continuing as the Department moves to finalise a draft intervention strategy.<br/><br/>Following a public consultation process on the draft Intervention Strategy during next summer, I hope to move to formal procurement phase towards the end of this year in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders. The Department will design a tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost of the network build as low as possible. I anticipate that the first homes and businesses will be connected in 2016 and connections will continue thereafter, with the intention of having all premises connected within a 5 year period. <br/><br/>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government. It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland.</p></reply>

I think this decision is best made at a local level.<br/><br/>The total grant available for LIS for each local authority is outlined in the table below:<table><tr><th>County Councils </th><th>Discretionary Grant</th><th>Available for LIS</th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td>&euro;906,358</td><td>&euro;135,954</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>&euro;1,886,484</td><td>&euro;282,973</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>&euro;3,099,477</td><td>&euro;464,922</td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>&euro;3,487,574</td><td>&euro;523,136</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>&euro;4,531,433</td><td>&euro;679,715</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td>&euro;4,798,774</td><td>&euro;719,816</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>&euro;3,343,504</td><td>&euro;501,526</td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>&euro;2,241,473</td><td>&euro;336,221</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>&euro;2,292,455</td><td>&euro;343,868</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td>&euro;1,542,915</td><td>&euro;231,437</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td>&euro;1,573,178</td><td>&euro;235,977</td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td>&euro;2,913,092</td><td>&euro;436,964</td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td>&euro;1,137,968</td><td>&euro;170,695</td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH</td><td>&euro;1,159,161</td><td>&euro;173,874</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td>&euro;4,585,378</td><td>&euro;687,807</td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td>&euro;3,062,913</td><td>&euro;459,437</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>&euro;1,742,007</td><td>&euro;261,301</td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td>&euro;1,552,009</td><td>&euro;232,801</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>&euro;2,805,948</td><td>&euro;420,892</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td>&euro;1,874,723</td><td>&euro;281,208</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>&euro;4,018,126</td><td>&euro;602,719</td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td>&euro;2,320,528</td><td>&euro;348,079</td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td>&euro;1,584,921</td><td>&euro;237,738</td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td>&euro;2,552,570</td><td>&euro;382,886</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td>&euro;1,520,116</td><td>&euro;228,017</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro; 62,533,085</td><td>&euro; 9,379,963</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Council is chaired by the Chairman of daa, and comprises senior representatives from the tourism and business sectors in the Cork region who are actively engaged in achieving the goals set for the Council.</p>  <p>  I believe that there are opportunities, particularly in the tourism sector, to grow incoming passenger numbers in the Cork region.  I am aware that daa has attractive incentive programmes available that encourage the introduction of new routes and services at their airports.  I also understand that Tourism Ireland has undertaken significant cooperative marketing activity with carriers serving Cork Airport to promote flights to Cork and boost travel to the wider regions.  The agency will continue to monitor developments at Cork Airport and work with the Airport and relevant stakeholders to maximise the numbers using existing services and to help to make the case of additional new services with potential tourism benefits for the Cork region.  In this connection, it should be noted that all of my Department's allocation for tourism is provided for the use of the tourism agencies, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, and I do not have discretionary funding available for individual marketing initiatives.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, creating new services and growing inbound tourism depends not just on the availability of competitive access but also on ensuring that potential visitors have a reason to visit.  I would urge all the regional stakeholders to work with Cork Airport, daa and the CADC to pursue every opportunity to develop and highlight the tourism product that is available in the catchment area of the airport.</p>  <p>  It is intended that the National Aviation Policy (NAP), which is currently being finalised, will restate Government Policy in relation to Cork while recognising Cork Airport&rsquo;s role as a key tourism and business gateway for that region, the strategic role of the airport in serving Ireland&rsquo;s second city and its hinterland, as well as the potential for the airport to avail of opportunities for growth such as Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s co-operative marketing investment initiative.  The NAP will make clear, however, that it is a matter for the airport and daa to stabilise and grow traffic and that it remains Government policy that Exchequer funding is not provided to the State airports.</p>  <p>  As a result of the decision by Government that Cork Airport would remain part of the daa Group, provision was included in the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014 for the dissolution of the Cork Airport Authority (CAA) and that process is currently underway.  While the Act also provides for the re-establishment of CAA if separation is decided on by Government at a future date, there are no plans to revisit that policy at this time.  It should be noted, however, that daa has since put in place arrangements for Cork Airport to be run as a stand alone business unit within the Group, properly resourced at management level locally.  This leads to faster day to day decision making, with daa Group assisting and providing support where required.</p></reply>

Nonetheless, a number of State financial supports provide for the conservation and preservation of heritage structures in general.<br/><br/>I recently announced an allocation of &euro;624,000 for the Structures at Risk Fund 2015,<i></i>to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000, as amended, which are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration. This Fund, which will be administered through the local authorities, encourages the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and helps to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost. The amount of funding available per project will be subject to a minimum level of &euro;15,000 and a maximum level of &euro;60,000. Works to windows to prevent water ingress and to repair significant elements of external joinery are deemed to be qualifying works under the terms of the Fund.<br/><br/>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage. For 2015, the Council is administering a community-based heritage grants scheme with funding of &euro;600,000 available for projects that contribute to particular heritage themes. If relevant to the case in question, I understand that applications are now open until 20 March 2015 for the scheme. The Heritage Council&rsquo;s website is .<br/><br/>The project referred to by the Deputy may also be eligible for reliefs or grants administered by other Government Departments, local authorities or agencies.<br/><br/>The statutory Architectural Heritage Protection Guidelines for Planning Authorities (2004), reissued by my Department in 2011, contains a chapter on <i>Openings - Doors and Windows </i>(Chapter 10), which outline the general conservation principles that apply to protected structures and to historic structures in general. In addition, as part of an Architectural Advice Series, my Department has published a series of advice books, one of which includes practical advice and guidance on the &ldquo;repair&rdquo; of historic windows, with another guide published in 2010 on energy efficiency in traditional buildings. Both the Planning Guidelines and the Advice Series are also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i>It is advised that owners or occupiers of historic properties seek advice directly from their local authority regarding heritage conservation.</p></reply>
