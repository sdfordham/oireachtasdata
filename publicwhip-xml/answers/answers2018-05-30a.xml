I indicated that any move on customs that keeps the UK close to the EU is to be welcomed.</p><p>I indicated that we're willing to examine the UK proposal, but we need to see it presented as a formal written proposal in the Brexit negotiations process. </p><p>I also emphasised to the Prime Minister that upholding the commitment to avoid a hard border requires progress on more than just customs.</p><p>The agreed report from December makes clear that continued alignment on both single market and customs rules is necessary. In many ways, the regulatory issues are even more important than customs here. </p><p>More generally, I made clear to the Prime Minister that Ireland would continue to insist on a legally operable backstop being in the Withdrawal Agreement.

The National Inventory Report 2017 to the UNFCCC shows that in 2015 Irish forests and wood products sequestered 4.3 Million Tonnes of CO2 equivalent. </p>  <p>Under the now agreed Effort Sharing Regulation, forests and other land-uses must be accounted and, in Ireland&rsquo;s case, up to 26.8 MT CO2 eq of greenhouse gas removals can be accounted against our national non-ETS targets during the 2020 to 2030 period. This figure is based on 15% of average agriculture emissions in 2008-2012 in recognition of the limited mitigation potential in agriculture. Afforestation is measured as the greenhouse gas change in forests less than 20 or 30 years of age.  Thus the mitigation benefits of current afforestation in terms of national targets can last for a considerable time. </p>  <p>  Wood harvested from forests is itself a long term, renewable carbon pool and can produce sustainable materials that can substitute more emissions-intensive non-renewable materials and fossil fuels.  With regard to forest based biomass almost 1.6 million cubic metres of this material was used for energy purposes in 2016.  Domestically produced biomass was the primary source of this material and abated 761,000 tonnes of CO2   emissions from fossil fuels.  My Department&rsquo;s strategy is to fully exploit the potential of forestry in relation to climate change mitigation.  I have made sure to place at the core of this strategy ongoing support for a sustainable afforestation programme. </p>  <p>  My Department's action plan for forestry is set out in the Forestry Programme 2014 -2020 which represents almost &euro;500 million in development funding for the sector. During the period 2015 &ndash; 2017 over 18,000 hectares of new forests have been established.  A midterm review of the programme was finalised earlier this year and new measures were put in place to drive further planting. Increased planting rates were introduced, with a particular focus on broadleaf species. </p>  <p>  Andrew Doyle T.D. Minister of State in my Department with responsibility for forestry, has recently established a Forestry Implementation Group comprising stakeholders from the forestry sector, landowners and environmental NGOs to help drive implementation of the Afforestation Programme to 2020.</p>  <p>  Finally, a publicly funded capital programme for afforestation beyond the lifetime of the current Forestry Programme 2014-2020 is provided for under the National Development Plan 2018-2027 thus demonstrating this Government's ongoing commitment to forestry as a key element of our climate change mitigation strategy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-30a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018053000075#WRA02300"><p>In March this year the Central Statistics Office released its Preliminary Estimate of Output, Input and Income in Agriculture and this shows that aggregate farm income, or operating surplus, increased by 35% to &euro;3,498 million in 2017.  This followed an increase in aggregate farm income of 3.6% in 2016 and 2.3% in 2015. </p>  <p>   Last week Teagasc released preliminary results of its National Farm Survey (NFS) for 2017, which showed that average family farm income was the highest on record at almost &euro;31,400, a 32% increase on 2016.  Average family farm income fell by 9% in 2016 and increased by 5% in 2015. It should be noted that there are significant differences in family farm income depending on the system of farming and the size of the farm. Average income on:</p>  <p>  - Dairy farms increased by 65% to &euro;86,100 </p>  <p>  - Cattle rearing farms increased by 1% to &euro;12,700 </p>  <p>  - Cattle finishing farms decreased by 1% to &euro;16,700 </p>  <p>  - Sheep farms increased by 8% to &euro;16,900 </p>  <p>  - Tillage farms increased by 20% to &euro;37,200. </p>  <p>  Dairy farms are consistently the most profitable farms, when looked at per farm and per hectare.  However it should also be noted that almost all dairy farms are classified as full-time farms in terms of the labour input required.  Most cattle farms and the majority of sheep farms are classified as part-time in terms of labour input requirements.  This preliminary release does not break farm income down between full and part-time farms but this will be available with the full NFS 2017 publication in the summer.  The NFS for 2016 showed an average income of almost &euro;46,600 for full-time farms and &euro;11,100 for part-time farms on a labour input basis. </p>  <p>  The Food Wise 2025 strategy includes actions to support farmers in improving the competitiveness and profitability of their enterprises.  This includes actions aimed at helping farmers to improve productivity, manage the impact of price volatility and adopt new technologies.  There are also actions to incentivise land mobility and farm restructuring.  These actions and the various supports available from CAP direct payments, the Rural Development Programme and our agri-taxation system are aimed at making Irish farm enterprises more competitive and sustainable, and maximising their contribution to regional and local rural economies.</p>  <p>  I expect specific legislative proposals on the shape of the CAP post 2020 to be published in early June.  I will be working hard to ensure that these proposals are configured in a way that supports family farm incomes, the rural economy and the environment.</p></reply>

Our own Marine Institute is a very active contributor to the work of that body.  The Commission also takes account of the views of the (STECF) Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, on the economic, technical and social impacts of the scientific advice.  It is these proposals that are considered by the Fisheries Council each December.</p><p>As part of our preparation for the December Council each year, I present a Sustainability Impact Assessment on the proposals to the Oireachtas.  This assessment is informed by the advice of the Marine Institute, a socio economic assessment by BIM and the views of stakeholders following a public consultation.  This work informs my position on the negotiations. </p><p>The advice from ICES is principally based on achieving the Maximum Sustainable Yield exploitation rate or FMSY as it is more commonly known.  This is the largest average catch or yield that can continuously be taken from a stock under existing conditions without damaging the future returns from the stock.  It is also one of the key objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy agreed in 2013 to bring and maintain our fish stocks to levels that can deliver FMSY by 2020 at the latest. </p><p>In 2009, only five stocks had Total Allowable Catches set at FMSY. The outcome of the 2017 December Fisheries Council brought 53 stocks to FMSY levels.</p><p>Ireland intends to continue to work with all stakeholders, Member States and the Commission to build upon this substantial and tangible progress to achieve the ambitious targets set out in the CFP.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-30a.36.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018053000075#WRA02800"><p>I am very aware of the importance of the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme, which issues annual payments in excess of &euro;200 million to over 95,000 farmers.  </p>  <p>  The ANC Scheme has always been recognised as a very important support for rural society and farmers across the country who farm constrained lands.  In light of the importance of the scheme, the Programme for a Partnership Government included a commitment to provide an additional &euro;25m for the Scheme in 2018.  I am pleased to confirm that this commitment was delivered in Budget 2018 and that, subject to the EU Commission&rsquo;s approval of an amendment to Irelands Rural Development Programme, this new funding will be available for payment under the 2018 ANC Scheme.   </p>  <p>  A number of different options were available in deciding how this additional funding was to be divided.  I was conscious of the need for money to be targeted at those farmers on lands with higher levels of constraint.</p>  <p>  With this in mind and having considered the views of stakeholders, I decided to distribute the additional &euro;25 million as follows: </p>  <p>  - &euro;13m will be allocated to the 'mountain type land' category </p>  <p>  -  &euro;9m will be allocated to the 'more severely handicapped' category and </p>  <p>  - &euro;3m will be allocated to the 'less severely handicapped' category.  </p>  <p>  These allocations will have the effect of increasing the current payment per hectare rates across all land categories.  Those farming on what is called &ldquo;mountain type land&rdquo; will see their payment increase from &euro;109.71 to &euro;135 on their first 10 hectares, and from &euro;95.99 to &euro;112 on remaining hectares up to a maximum of 34 hectares.  Farmers with land categorised as &ldquo;more severely handicapped lowland&rdquo; will see an increase from &euro;95.99 to &euro;104 per hectare up to a maximum of 30 hectares.  Finally, those with &ldquo;less severely handicapped lowland&rdquo; will see an increase from &euro;82.27 to &euro;88.25 per hectare up to a maximum of 30 hectares.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that these increased payment rates are consistent with the underlying logic of the Scheme, where the highest level of support is targeted at those who are faced with the highest level of constraint on their land.  These changes must now be formally agreed with the EU Commission, by way of an amendment to our Rural Development Programme.  My officials have initiated this process, with a view to introducing these new rates for payment in 2018.</p></reply>

For example, some 57,000 tonnes of Irish sheep meat worth &euro;274 million was exported last year, with diversification evident from our traditional primary markets of France and the UK.</p><p>With this in mind, I have ensured that my Department has put in place a range of supports for the sheep sector in recent years across a number of schemes.  On CAP Pillar 1, sheep farmers continue to benefit from the direct income support available under the Basic Payment Scheme.  In addition, Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014-2020, also contains a number of support schemes which offer direct financial benefit to Irish sheep farmers.  Sheep farmers continue to benefit from the Areas of Natural Constraint (ANC) Scheme and from GLAS in large numbers, as well as from capital investment support under TAMS.  The RDP also includes specific provision for sheep farmers within the Knowledge Transfer Programme, which has helped to build on the existing knowledge base and skills set in the sector in a way which will help to ensure continued sustainable development in the sector.</p><p>In addition to these measures, in December 2016 I announced the new Sheep Welfare Scheme as an amendment to the RDP.  Under this scheme, farmers are required to choose from a menu of actions which aim to improve the overall welfare of their flock. These actions must be completed over a 12 month period, and in return the farmer receives a payment of &euro;10 per breeding ewe.  This important new support was introduced for a period of four scheme years, and I am glad to say that over &euro;18m has issued on time to sheep farmers in respect of Year 1 of the Scheme.</p><p>The total amount of financial support received by sheep farmers under the main schemes operated by my Department over the past three years is as follows:</p><p>2015: &euro;519,565,397</p><p>2016: &euro;601,649,660</p><p>2017: &euro;617,512,369</p><p>I am committed to ensuring that my Department continues to work to underpin the development of the sheep sector.</p></reply>

It is a hugely significant achievement for our industry, as well as an excellent endorsement of our world-class safety standards and product quality.</p>  <p>   Three beef plants were approved by the Chinese certification authority in April.  As part of my recent Trade Mission to China it was confirmed that a further three beef plants have met the required standards for approval.  I expect that they will be formally approved and listed by CNCA in the near future.  This was a great result and reflects the on-going work in this area.</p>  <p>   My Department has spent many years working closely with the Chinese authorities in order to secure this agreement.  This work has included inward and outward trade missions, inspection visits, and various bilateral contacts with officials in relevant Chinese Ministries. Throughout the course of this work, my officials have developed a deep understanding of Chinese requirements. This understanding has been essential in devising procedures to satisfy the conditions of China&rsquo;s protocol.</p>  <p>   A new Veterinary health certificate that will cover both beef and pigmeat comes into effect on 1st June.  My officials continue to make progress on various technical issues and I expect the beef trade to commence during the summer.  As I have previously stated, the role of the Government is to open up market access and to remove barriers to trade; the industry must then make its own decisions in relation to market priorities.  But I hope that Irish beef exports will follow the same success that our dairy and pigmeat sectors have enjoyed in China to date.</p></reply>

The BDGP is the current main support for the suckler sector and will provide farmers with some &euro;300 million of funding over six years.  </p>  <p>  It was introduced by my Department with the clear and stated objective of using bovine genetics to address the progressive decline in key maternal traits within Ireland's suckler herd.  The scheme aims to improve the profitability of the sector and  reduce the carbon footprint of the herd.  This is being achieved through the use of objective metrics which ensures consistency in evaluation of animals in terms of genetic merit.  Currently there are 24,775 participants between BDGP I and II and a total of &euro;42.8 million has been paid to participants for 2017 already.  </p>  <p>  The scheme's effectiveness is based on enhancing the genetic merits of the national suckler herd through clearly defined objective metrics for participants in the scheme.  Key metrics such as the number of calves per cow per year, the calving interval, and age at first calving, docility, size and vitality, along with the prevalence of conditions such as scour and pneumonia are measured against agreed criteria.  One of the most notable examples is the number of calves per cow per year, which has moved from 0.80 in 2014 to 0.87 for 2017; which across the entirety of the scheme herds represents an additional 40,000 calves for sale, with a weanling output value of some &euro;30m to the participating beef farmers.</p>  <p>  After years of decline in key maternal traits, genetic trend for replacement index has now turned around and is generating significant additional gains for participating beef farmers.  Additionally, important validation work undertaken by Teagasc and the Irish Cattle and Breeding Federation (ICBF) on 46 participating commercial beef farms over the past 3 years has confirmed that 5 star cows are more fertile, lighter (thereby requiring less feed), produce more milk (a heavier weanling) and overall produce a heavier carcass for beef farmers.  In effect the key metrics of the scheme have provided clear evidence that cattle in the BDGP schemes are producing more benefits from less resources.  This is consistent with the key objectives of the scheme, which is to breed more profitable and climate efficient cattle.</p>  <p>  On this basis, I believe the scheme is an excellent example of utilising empirical evidence to enhance the quality and sustainability of the national herd. </p></reply>

As well as by official from my Department, I was accompanied throughout the trip by Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland and senior executives from our leading companies in the beef, pigmeat, dairy and seafood sectors.</p>  <p>  By way of background, Ireland&rsquo;s agri-food exports to China have increased roughly five-fold from around &euro;200 million in 2010 to nearly &euro;1 billion last year.  China is now Ireland&rsquo;s third largest market overall. Dairy exports to China reached &euro;667 million in 2017, and pigmeat exports have increased from &euro;37 million to &euro;100.3 million between 2012 and 2017.  China is also a growing market for seafood and other food and drink exports. </p>  <p>  This growth is, of course, very welcome. But the partnership between Ireland and China goes far beyond a transactional trading arrangement.  This is about cooperation at multiple levels. Political visits in both directions at the very highest level, technical engagement between officials providing assurance on food safety standards, and a programme of internships in my Department for Chinese veterinary officials have all played an important part in building trust and developing key relationships.</p>  <p>  This mission was an opportunity to strengthen and develop those relationships. It is imperative that we continue raising the profile of Ireland as a source of quality food and beverages, and expand the range of exports into China and Hong Kong. </p>  <p>  The Trade Mission itinerary was an extensive one that encompassed over 20 official engagements in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Hong Kong.  I had extremely productive meetings with the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Affairs Han Changfu, the Minister for Marketing Regulations, Zhang Mao and the Vice Minister for the General Administration of Customs, Zou Zhiwu.  A number of additional Irish beef plants and one additional pork plant have now met the required approval standards to export to China.  It is intended to complete the final administrative details to register other plants.  We also held preliminary discussions around the issues of approval for additional plants as well as the prospect of sheep meat access.</p>  <p>  In Hong Kong I raised the profile of Irish food at a Bord Bia prestigious cooking competition.  I also met with the Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation, Dr. S.F. Leung.  I took the opportunity to impart information on Ireland's unique agri-food sector including our commitment to strict food safety standards, sustainable production and high quality.  Hong Kong has a population of almost 8 million consumers  with relatively high disposable incomes.  </p>  <p>  We had a particular opportunity to present the Irish beef sector to potential buyers and distributors, following the recent success in obtaining access to the Chinese market. But we also wanted to build on existing trade links in other areas including dairy, pig meat and seafood.  We wanted to highlight the credentials of Ireland&rsquo;s food and drink sector from a food safety, sustainability and authenticity perspective, in order to develop a unique selling point for Irish product.</p>  <p>  A key engagement in the itinerary was our participation in the leading food event, SIAL, in Shanghai, where Irish companies had an opportunity to engage with buyers, distributors and manufacturers from China&rsquo;s food sector. </p>  <p>  I also oversaw the signing of a memorandum of understanding, committing to an Irish presence at the China International Import Expo taking place this November in Shanghai.  It is a great honour for Ireland to be invited by the Chinese authorities to participate in this November&rsquo;s event in Shanghai.  This initiative which is being personally driven by the President of China, Xi Jinping, will have an expected attendance of 185,000 Chinese buyers.  An event such as this, which is being promoted by the Chinese Government, offers the ideal opportunity for Irish food exporters to do business and enhance relationships.</p>  <p>  I also held high level meetings with a number of potential investors in the food and agri tech sectors. </p>  <p>  Overall this was an extremely successful mission, facilitating the development of our ever growing partnership with China.  There is a clear ambition on Irish and Chinese sides to further build co-operation between Ireland and China on many levels, including trade. Against the backdrop of Brexit, market diversification is crucial for the Irish Agri-food sector.  As markets and opportunities go there are none bigger than China and in that regard the Trade Mission represented a very good week indeed for Ireland&rsquo;s food exporters.</p></reply>

This is a modern Act and is the main legal instrument available to my Department to enforce animal welfare standards.  This Act was passed following a constructive and extensive debate and all sides of this House engaged in the issues in a spirit of co-operation, significantly improving the Bill in the course of its passage. </p>  <p>  In the context of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, particular attention should be paid to section 38 of the Act which establishes the framework within which officers of my Department carry out inspections.  Before entering on land or premises, an authorised officer must have reasonable grounds to do so.  Where the officer has reasonable cause for believing that an offence may be involved, the officer may exercise a range of powers in the interest of animal welfare for the purposes of enforcing the Act.  The Deputy will notice that the Act places emphasis on the fact that the actions of the officer must be based on &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  In the normal course, investigations are carried out by authorised officers of my Department based in 16 regional veterinary offices around the country.  An investigation will invariably involve a visit to the land or premises concerned, a veterinary assessment of animals and the conditions in which they are kept and, where appropriate, gathering physical or documentary evidence; the person having possession or control of the animal or animals concerned will normally be interviewed.  Formal notices requiring specific corrective actions may be issued. Whilst there is a strong focus by authorised officers on ensuring compliance, where breaches of the Act are encountered, a file is prepared and the responsible person is prosecuted should the evidence support this course of action.</p>  <p>  It remains my policy that animal welfare standards are vigorously applied in a fair and even-handed manner.  Those responsible for causing unnecessary suffering to animals or being negligent regarding animal welfare are and will continue to be prosecuted through the Courts; some 46 individuals have been successfully prosecuted in the past few years and a further 32 cases are in preparation or remain before the Courts.  The determination of any particular case is of course, a matter for the trial court and it would be a gross violation of the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution for the executive to interfere in this regard.</p>  <p>   It continues to be my policy that neglect of, or causing unnecessary suffering to, animals is not acceptable in our society and my Department continues to enforce the law as does An Garda Siochana and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. </p></reply>

These documents have been circulated to all applicants under the BPS.</p><p>Where land has been burned, it is not in a state suitable for an agricultural activity such as grazing or cultivation and therefore it is not eligible, except where controlled burning is carried out. It is specified in the BPS Terms &amp;amp; Conditions that under the Wildlife Acts, growing vegetation cannot be burnt between 1<sup>st</sup>March and 31<sup>st</sup>August of any given year, on any land not yet cultivated. Enforcement of the Wildlife Acts is a matter for the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. </p><p>It was apparent during the closed season for burning in 2017 that there was widespread burning of vegetation. Accordingly my Department confirmed via Press release on 17<sup>th</sup>May 2017 that it was examining the illegal burning of land in relation to applications for payment under the BPS and other area-based schemes.</p><p>My Department actively investigated incidents of illegal burning using the most up to date technology and satellite imagery as well as field visits. Lands were identified that had been included in some 2017 BPS applications that were burnt after the permitted timeframe and would therefore be deemed ineligible for payment. In this regard some 57 parcels of land, including some on Killery Mountain, were identified as having been burned between 1 March and 31 August 2017.  The majority of these fires took place on commonage land.  </p><p>In general terms, where the area determined to have been burned exceeds 3% of the eligible area declared, an administrative penalty of 1.5 times the area burned is applied. Where the applicant provides appropriate evidence that he/she was not involved in the burning of the affected lands, the administrative penalty may be waived. However, the burnt land remains ineligible for payment.  </p><p>My Department wrote to the farmers concerned, including those on Killery Mountain, outlining that the burned land parcel(s) were ineligible for the purpose of BPS and had given rise to over-claims.  The letters explained the options open to them including the right to a review and also requesting them to submit any relevant documentation. </p><p>All things being equal the lands burnt illegally in 2017 are likely to be eligible in 2018. Those affected were informed accordingly and the updated eligible areas were provided at the time of application to on-line BPS applicants. </p><p>My Department is not responsible for the investigation of the actual causes of illegal burning such as occurred on Killery Mountain. That responsibility lies with other state agencies such as An Garda Siochana and the Local Authorities.</p><p>My Department is however responsible for determining the eligibility of land under the BPS and other area related schemes. My Department has been in contact with 33 farmers in relation to ineligible land due to burning on Killery Mountain.  29 of these farmers have lodged an appeal with my Department on this issue. 25 of the appeals have now been decided, and my Department has communicated these decisions directly to the farmers concerned and advised them of their right of appeal to the Agriculture Appeals Office.  A further 4 cases remain under review.</p><p>To date, 8 appeals, which relate to Killery Mountain, have been lodged with the Appeals Office.</p><p>This year Press Releases were issued in March, and again on 21st May, reminding farmers not to burn during the closed season, and not to include ineligible land in their applications. In addition my officials and I have held discussions with farmer representative bodies to further ensure clarity of message around this important issue.</p><p>Farmers and the wider public must be mindful of the risks and damage that burning can cause to human life and the environment and must take appropriate care.</p><p>The issue raised by the Deputy regarding walking trails is a matter in particular for the National Parks and Wildlife Service and my colleague the Minister for Culture Heritage and The Gaeltacht.</p></reply>

Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agri-food sector in particular. </p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for sustainable growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region. </p>  <p>  In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025, I led a very successful Trade Mission in February 2017 to the Gulf Region. This covered the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. This was followed by an extensive Trade Mission to the US and Mexico in June. Both of these latter markets offer many elements that are very attractive to Irish exporters. The US is the largest food and beverage market in the world and has a population of 324 million people. Around 35 million Americans also claim Irish ancestry. Mexico has a population of 127 million, making it the eleventh-largest country in the world in population terms and the fifteenth-largest economy in the world, with projections that it will move into the top five by 2050.</p>  <p>  Later in 2017, during a Trade Mission to Japan and South Korea in November, I was accompanied by 40 representatives of the Irish food sector, as well as by experts from my Department, the CEO of Bord Bia and senior representatives from Enterprise Ireland and Teagasc. </p>  <p>  This was a very opportune time to bring a delegation of Ireland&rsquo;s food leaders to this part of the world, given that the EU has concluded a Free Trade Agreement with South Korea as well as concluding an Economic Partnership Agreement with Japan in December 2017. Japan and South Korea are markets of high potential for beef, pigmeat and sheepmeat exports, and so it is important that we raise the profile of Irish agri-food enterprises that already have access to these markets, and make progress in negotiating access for others.</p>  <p>  Following a further Trade Mission to the US and Canada in February, earlier this month I led a Trade Mission to China and Hong Kong. This was an extremely successful mission in the development of our ever-growing partnership with China. For example, being present at one of the World&rsquo;s largest food trade exhibitions in Shanghai allowed me to reinforce the positive messages about the quality and sustainability of Irish agri-food exports to Asian buyers, and I was also fortunate to secure meetings with three senior Chinese Ministers and three Vice-Ministers over the course of the week. There is a clear ambition on both sides to further build co-operation between Ireland and China on many levels, including trade, and I will continue to do all I can to maximise this potential. </p>  <p>  These and the other missions that my Department are planning for the latter half of 2018 will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in these destinations.  It will also promote Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of high quality, safe and sustainably produced meat and dairy products. </p>  <p>  The destinations are also in keeping with the market prioritisation exercise that was completed by Bord Bia in December 2017, at my request. This exercise identified opportunities in new and more mature markets, and will provide valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers as we continue to navigate the very uncertain environment created by Brexit.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to seek out and identify new markets, and I am ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise. </p></reply>

It is widely accepted that the system is overly complicated, relying too heavily on the manual transcription of lengthy identification numbers of sheep at various stages of production.</p>  <p>  My Department commenced a review of the current NSIS in 2015. The farm organisations and mart organisations were contacted and meetings took place in July and August of 2015. I also met stakeholders in the context of developing the Sheep Welfare Scheme and sheep EID was discussed in that forum. </p>  <p>  The new rules are being introduced requiring all sheep sold from 1 October 2018 onwards to be identified electronically. The rationale for sheep EID includes the provision of a more robust sheep traceability system that will further support the development and sustainability of the sheep industry. This measure will significantly reduce the record keeping requirements for sheep farmers moving sheep to livestock marts, slaughter plants and export assembly centres. There is the potential of decreased cross compliance issues following the provision of a printed list to producers detailing the electronic tag numbers presented by them to marts and factories approved as Central Points of Recording (CPRs).</p>  <p>  I will be providing a one off support measure of up to a maximum of &euro;50 per keeper for the first purchase of EID tags. Electronic tag readers and associated software are included as eligible investments in the Targeted Agriculture Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) scheme to assist sheep farmers in flock management.  The move to full EID and the inclusion of EID readers as an eligible investment in TAMS will make the recording of the movement of lambs off farm much more convenient and will greatly simplify the paperwork involved for sheep farmers.</p>  <p>  This enhancement of the current sheep identification system will allow the sheep sector to further develop and build on its impressive performance supporting some 35,000 farm families directly in addition to supporting several thousand jobs indirectly in rural area.</p>  <p>  The improved traceability system will assist in maintaining existing markets and in securing new international outlets for Irish sheep meat.  Ireland has market access for sheep meat to 45 countries at present, compared to our beef access to 65 countries, and exports of dairy products to almost 180 countries. Opening new markets for sheep meat access, including potentially valuable markets such as the USA, Japan and, in due course, China is therefore a key concern, as some of these markets have identified lack of EID as a barrier to access.</p>  <p>  The extension of EID to all sheep is a critical requirement to provide the required traceability demands across the market place, serving to protect public and animal health in line with the highest international standards. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Clean Livestock Policy,  my Department undertook an extensive consultation process with all stakeholders following which an agreement was reached and the policy was then introduced in all meat plants. It's primary objective is to ensure the safeguarding of public health, and my Department is greatly encouraged by the very positive impact which the policy has had on sheep cleanliness since it was implemented on 1st   January, thus contributing to overall carcass hygiene.There was an initial learning phase after the introduction of the policy and it is safe to say that all stakeholders are now aware of their responsibilities when it comes to producing safe wholesome food.

Food Wise 2025 identifies competiveness as a key theme and includes a recommendation that stakeholders work to &ldquo;improve access to finance for agriculture, forestry and seafood producers and agri-food companies&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  I launched a new &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo; on the 28th March in cooperation with the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Finance, which will provide up to &euro;300 million of affordable, flexible working capital finance to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or who will be in the future. The Scheme will be available to SMEs and mid-cap businesses. Given their unique exposure to the UK market, my Department&rsquo;s funding ensures that at least 40% of the fund will be available to food businesses. The finance will be easier to access, more competitively priced (at a maximum interest rate of 4%), and at more favourable terms than current offerings. This will give Brexit-impacted businesses time and space to adapt and to grow into the future. The Scheme will remain open until 31st March 2020. This scheme was modelled on the Agriculture Cash Flow Loan Support Scheme which I made available to farmers in 2017.</p>  <p>   I announced in Budget 2018 that my Department is considering the development of potential Brexit response loan schemes for farmers, fishermen and for longer-term capital financing for food businesses. These schemes are developed and delivered in cooperation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and take time to develop and operationalise. Consideration and discussions are ongoing in this regard and I will announce further details on this as they become available. </p>  <p>  While continuing to explore additional funding mechanisms, I also liaise with the main banks on issues relating to the agri-food sector, all of whom have specialised agriculture products available and have expressed a commitment to servicing the future financing needs of the sector.  </p></reply>

The regional spread of both sectors means they underpin the socio-economic development of rural Ireland.  </p>  <p>  It is for this reason that my &lsquo;asks&rsquo; from the EU/UK negotiations are:</p>  <p>   - Continued free access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures;</p>  <p>   - Minimisation of the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries; and</p>  <p>   - Maintenance of current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and north of Donegal and protection of Ireland&rsquo;s quota share for joint fish stocks. </p>  <p>  The primary means through which the Government is seeking to safeguard the interests of the sectors ahead of Brexit is through the EU/UK negotiation process and our influence in that process. </p>  <p>  I and my Department have been actively feeding into the DFAT coordinated whole-of-Government response and we are represented on all of the interdepartmental committees.  The negotiations are now at a crucial stage, with the main focus resting on finding solutions for the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The UK commitment in the Joint EU-UK Report of last December to avoid a hard border was extremely important. At the Government insistence this commitment is now being translated into legal form in the draft of the Withdrawal Agreement, and we are currently working closely with our EU counterparts and the European Commission Task Force to achieve progress in the actions necessary to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and any disruption to trade in agri-food and fishery products..</p>  <p>  In the meantime, we are continuing our work on assessing the impacts of Brexit, consulting with stakeholders and engaging with EU colleagues with a view to mitigating the potential impacts. On contingency planning, my Department is sharpening its focus on preparedness issues, and is currently engaged in a round of detailed discussions with industry stakeholders. These discussions are aimed at getting a fuller understanding of the potential financial, administrative and operational impacts of Brexit along the supply chain, as well as providing logistical data that will help the Department tailor its response in the negotiation process.</p>  <p>  Since the Brexit vote, I have introduced a range of measures in the two most recent Budgets. These were aimed principally at helping reduce farm gate and business costs and also assist in reducing costs and improving competitiveness,.  </p>  <p>  The measures cover the introduction of low-cost loan schemes for farmers and SMEs, as well as new agri-taxation measures and increased funding under the Rural Development and Seafood Development Programmes.</p>  <p>   In Budget 2017, I introduced measures to help reduce farm gate business costs, including a &euro;150 million low-cost loan scheme, new agri-taxation measures and increased funding under the Rural Development and Seafood Development Programmes. </p>  <p>  In the 2018 Budget I announced a &euro;50m Brexit support package, which will comprise a number of initiatives. Firstly, in cooperation with my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I recently announced a new Brexit Loan Scheme aimed at providing affordable, flexible financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future, at least 40% of which will be available to food businesses.  </p>  <p>  I am also considering the development of a separate loan scheme similar to the 2017 low-cost scheme, based on &euro;25m funding from my Department to the Scheme. These measures are aimed at enhancing competitiveness within the sector.</p>  <p>  I have also introduced supports for Bord Bia for investment in market insight and market prioritisation initiatives, which are aimed at identifying and developing potential diversification opportunities. I had already increased funding to Bord Bia by &euro;14.5m since the Brexit vote, and a further &euro;4.5 million was allocated in Budget 2018.  I am of the view that a further effective way of mitigating the Brexit impacts is to expand our international trade opportunities, thereby reducing our exposure to the UK market. </p>  <p>  To enhance product diversification, I have also allocated funding to support the development of the new National Food Innovation Hub, which will be located in the Teagasc Moorepark complex. </p>  <p>  I have just returned from a Trade Mission to China and Hong Kong to develop our relationship further given that the Chinese beef market is now open to beef exports from Ireland. Among other meetings, I had a very good and productive meeting with my counterpart, the Chinese Minister for Agriculture.  </p>  <p>  This follows on from successful earlier trade missions to Canada and the USA in February 2018, Japan and Korea in November 2017, the USA and Mexico in June 2017, and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in February/March 2017. I will, as part of the marketing effort, lead further trade missions in 2018 to promote Irish food and drink in key markets.  </p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government remains very focused on supporting the agri-food and fishing sectors through the challenges ahead.  </p></reply>

That is why the fishing sector has been a high priority for Ireland throughout the negotiations, and will continue to be so for this Government.  I am determined to ensure that fisheries remain high on the Brexit agenda in the EU and that the interests of Ireland's fishing communities are fully safeguarded.</p>  <p>  My continued overall objective is to ensure that fisheries are fully taken account of in the negotiations on the framework for a future EU-UK relationship.  Ireland&rsquo;s key priorities in this regard will be maintenance of current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone and protection of Ireland&rsquo;s existing quota shares. I am satisfied that, thanks to our ongoing close engagement with Michel Barnier and the Task Force, as well as other relevant Member States,  these priorities are fully reflected in the future relationship guidelines and in the transition arrangements as part of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>  <p>  The progress achieved to date has been welcomed by the Irish fishing industry and the importance attached to the sector by this Government was clearly demonstrated last month with a meeting between industry representatives, An Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and myself. In addition, the T&aacute;naiste and I arranged for the sector to express their concerns directly to Michel Barnier during his recent visit to Dundalk.</p></reply>

We have consistently stressed the importance of avoiding negative consequences for the Irish and EU agriculture sectors, and for the beef sector in particular. </p>  <p>  This position has been reiterated many times, for example by myself and my colleague Andrew Doyle at Council of Agriculture Ministers meetings, and by other Ministers in the relevant EU Trade policy fora. It has also been done through direct contacts with Commissioners Hogan and Malmstroem, and by the Taoiseach at European Council and through his own direct contacts, including with Commission President Jean Claude Juncker and French President Emmanuel Macron.</p>  <p>  I myself have been very consistent in urging caution in the approach to these negotiations, and have expressed Ireland's very grave concerns about the offer of a beef tariff rate quota of 70,000 tonnes made by the EU to Mercosur last October, and our strong view that this should not be exceeded. I have been working closely with Member State colleagues in this regard, and have also remained in close contact with Commissioner Hogan on the matter.</p>  <p>  There have been reports recently of agreement being reached in relation to other aspects of these negotiations. I would be very concerned if progress on these aspects were to lead to further concessions on beef.</p>  <p>  I am aware that there will be a further round of negotiations in Montevideo in the week commencing 4th June. In this regard I continue to remain in close contact with European Commission counterparts and with Member State colleagues, and to press Ireland's concerns. </p>  <p>  In an overall sense there is undoubtedly a need for continued vigilance in relation to the conduct of these trade negotiations, and I will continue to insist that they are handled appropriately, and in a manner that safeguards the interests of the Irish and European beef sector. </p>  <p>  I will also continue to work very closely with Member State colleagues in this regard. In particular, I believe full account must be taken of the findings of the Commission&rsquo;s own assessment of the cumulative impact of trade deals on the agri food sector, and the potentially very damaging impact of Brexit on an already delicately balanced EU beef market. </p></reply>

The main item on the Council agenda was the Presidency's draft council conclusions on CAP post 2020. The aim of the draft Council conclusions is to provide guidance to the European Commission on the drafting of legislative proposals, which are expected to be published on 6th June 2018.</p>  <p>  In the event, it was not possible to achieve the required unanimous agreement for Council conclusions, however Presidency conclusions were issued covering a wide range of issues that arise in CAP reform.</p>  <p>  The determination of budgetary ceilings, including those of the Common Agricultural Policy, is a matter for Finance Ministers. Nonetheless Minister of State Doyle who represented Ireland at the most recent Council of Agriculture Ministers indicated that the EU will need as strong a budget as possible to deliver on the many objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy. Ireland has been very consistent on this issue in recent months especially as discussions around potential increases in GNI contributions have been floated.  The Taoiseach, in his address to the European Parliament in January 2018, has already indicated that Ireland is open to contributing more to the EU budget, but only if it is spent on policies that contribute to the advancement of the European ideal. I am also engaged in a round of discussions on the matter with counterparts in other member states. </p>  <p>  The next stage in the CAP post 2020 process will be the publication of the legislative proposals. I expect this to happen in early June.  In that context, I look forward to engaging constructively with the Presidency, my European counterparts and the European Commission, to ensure that the next CAP continues to provide necessary support to the Irish and European agriculture sector.

The negotiation of the framework is a matter for Finance Ministers, and the proposals will ultimately require the approval of the European Council and the European Parliament. </p>  <p>   In so far as the funding for the Common Agricultural Policy is concerned, the proposal indicates a cut of around 5% for the next MFF period of 2021 - 2027. </p>  <p>  I believe that European agriculture policies have delivered for Irish farmers and consumers and it is important that support continues to be provided to these programmes.  Over the next few years farm families will be required to play a vital role in the protection and enhancement of the environment and the production of food to the highest standards in the world. These high standards, and the family farm model, are part of the fabric of European values.  EU citizens have shown that they support this model.  </p>  <p>  We need farmers to take active steps to mitigate climate change, protect water quality and biodiversity, and improve their competitiveness. A strong CAP is a prerequisite if these objectives, which are in the best interests of all citizens, are to be achieved. </p>  <p>  Member States are facing into a difficult negotiation, however, and a number have already indicated that they are not willing to provide additional funding for the MFF. From Ireland's perspective, the Taoiseach has already indicated that we are prepared to contribute additional funding, but only if critical policies are supported. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the proposal published by the European Commission is the initial MFF proposal. The final outcome will be determined by negotiations at EU level over the coming year. Achieving Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in these negotiations will be a key issue for the Government.</p>  <p>  In that context, I have discussed with my counterparts at the EU Agriculture Council the importance of a strong CAP Post 2020 budget.  I will continue to work with my colleagues across Europe on these matters as do my officials.  </p>  <p>  The next stage in the CAP post 2020 process will be the publication of the legislative proposals, which are due in early June.

The Passport Service provides a range of channels to Irish citizens wishing to apply for a passport. These include a postal application system, an online passport application service and in person counter application facilities in Dublin and Cork.The target turnaround time for applications made via the online passport application service is 10 working days plus postage. The majority of online applications are currently being processed within 5 working days, well ahead of target. The online service currently accommodates adult renewals and passport card applications and it is planned to further extend this service to other categories of renewals by the end of 2018.    The average turnaround time for renewal applications submitted through Passport Express is currently on target at 15 working days. Other types of application, which are generally submitted through Passport Express, such as first time applications or applications to replace lost, stolen or damaged passports take longer. Such applications must undergo additional processes including security checks.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently in its peak season for passport demand with the vast majority of applications being received between February and August each year. Measures taken by the Passport Service to minimise the impact of peak time application volumes on turnaround times include the recruitment of additional staff and the use of targeted overtime in all Passport Offices for both temporary and permanent staff. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service received sanction this year for 220 Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) for appointment to the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork. TCOs are working together with permanent staff to process passport applications and to deal with the high number of enquiries being made through the Passport Service&rsquo;s various customer service channels. </p>  <p>  The number of Full Time Equivalent staff permanently employed by my Department and assigned to the Passport Service stood at 322 at the beginning of the year. This compares to 310 Full Time Equivalent staff assigned to the Passport Service at the same point last year. In addition, over 20 additional permanent staff have been assigned to the Passport Service in 2018. </p>  <p>  The continuous implementation of service improvements has been central to my Department&rsquo;s response to increasing application volumes. The Passport Reform Programme is delivering major upgrades to the passport service technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements. The online passport application service will continue to make a major contribution to the effective management of high application volumes by allowing existing resources to be more effectively deployed within the Passport Service.</p>  <p>  My Department has an extensive communications strategy to promote good practice amongst passport holders when planning to travel abroad. We regularly advise applicants:</p>  <p>   - to check the validity of their passport in advance of booking travel;</p>  <p>   - to apply at least 6 weeks in advance of their travel plans; and</p>  <p>   - if they are eligible adults renewing their passport, to consider the online passport application service.</p></reply>

Accordingly, it was discussed by Ministers in informal format over lunch.Many Ministers expressed their deep concern at the disproportionate use of force by Israel, and the appalling number of casualties. These concerns had already been expressed in EU and national statements, and at the UN Human Rights Council, where Ireland and others supported a successful resolution which will, inter alia, establish a commission of inquiry into these events.   In my intervention I also argued strongly that events such as this will only recur if the vicious cycle in Gaza is not broken. It was essential not to despair of progress in Gaza but instead to redouble our efforts to find practical ways to begin to ease the situation there and provide hope. The inhabitants of Gaza must be able to see a political and economic perspective to end the blockade and end their isolation, otherwise more militant voices and groups will inevitably be strengthened. </p>  <p>  The meeting also discussed humanitarian assistance, the difficult position of UNRWA, the recent move of the United States Embassy, and the prospects for a peace initiative by the US.</p></reply>

Professor Federico Fabbrini of Dublin City University, the author of the report, also brought it directly to my attention and to that of my officials.  It is a welcome addition to the body of research and analysis that is informing the Government&rsquo;s ongoing contingency planning and our overall approach to Brexit.  This report provides an analysis of the default legal framework that would apply in what would be commonly referred to as a &ldquo;disorderly Brexit&rdquo; or &ldquo;no-deal scenario&rdquo;, including those rules that would be applicable or might be invoked within the WTO and GATT framework.  As concerns the specific reference to Article XXIV of the GATT, the author acknowledges that this has never previously been invoked and, given that it only covers some customs controls, it would also fail to address key issues that would entail the need for other checks and controls, such as animal health checks or sanitary and phytosanitary controls.  It would therefore not prevent the emergence of a hard border. </p>  <p>  This serves to further support the shared analysis of both the EU and the UK that the issues identified in the draft Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland as set out in the Withdrawal Agreement are those that need to be addressed within the context of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. In this regard, the Protocol not only addresses the free movement of goods, but also provides for continued regulatory alignment in other areas which are fundamental to the avoidance of a hard border, including but not limited to EU sanitary and phytosanitary rules. </p></reply>

I met with my French counterpart, Minister Le Drian, most recently on 13 May when he visited Dublin. Minister McEntee also met with her French counterpart the following day in Brussels. Brexit was of course, one of the main issues discussed at both meetings.My meeting with Minister Le Drian was an important opportunity to thank him for the continued support of France for Ireland in the negotiations. I also updated the Minister on Ireland&rsquo;s perspective regarding the current state of play. We discussed the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s need to see real and substantial progress on agreeing the Protocol ahead of the June European Council.We agreed that the UK needs to come forward with workable proposals which could form a serious basis for seeking agreement on the text so that the entire withdrawal agreement can be concluded by October. I reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s readiness to consider any such proposals when they are forthcoming. During our meeting, Minister Le Drian assured me yet again of France&rsquo;s support for our position on the Irish-specific issues and their solidarity with the EU&rsquo;s position that <i>&ldquo;nothing is agreed until everything is agreed&rdquo;</i>. And so the Minister was clear that negotiations can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken so far are respected in full, including the Irish-specific issues.</p><p>The European Council is continuing to follow the negotiations closely and will return in particular to the remaining withdrawal issues, including the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, at its next meeting in June when it will assess if satisfactory progress has been made and if not, what consequences this will have for the overall negotiations. It is therefore crucial that our engagement with EU partners continues, so that they remain fully aware of Ireland&rsquo;s position ahead of this important meeting.</p></reply>

As Minister for Finance I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation, and neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.</p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland has informed me that its members, since 1 June 2014, have factored data on all completed flood defence schemes, provided by the OPW, into their overall assessment of flood risk. This information has been provided as part of the information sharing arrangement entered into between OPW and Insurance Ireland (Memorandum of Understanding). The nature of this arrangement is such that it has led to a greater availability of flood cover in previously higher risk areas. For instance, the most recent Insurance Ireland survey of approximately 85% of the property insurance market in Ireland indicates that of the completed defence schemes, 90% of policies in areas benefiting from permanent flood defences include flood cover, while there has been an increase from 66% to 77% of policies in areas benefiting from demountable defences including flood cover.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy should note that the Insurance Ireland/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, now meets on a quarterly basis to support the above information flow and to improve the understanding of issues between both parties. The working group allows for the sharing of relevant data on completed flood defence schemes. In this regard, the OPW has also provided a significant amount of detailed data in relation to adequacy and resourcing of flood warning systems, and mobilisation, efficacy, maintenance and development of demountable defences to Insurance Ireland. A sub-group has also been set up to explore the technical and administrative arrangements that may allow for the further sharing of data.  </p>  <p>  One of the outcomes of these discussions is that the insurance industry has now acknowledged that they accept that the demountable defences meet the desired 1:100 year standard. However it still maintains the view that while demountable defences are effective where correctly deployed, there are significant interdependencies, including human intervention, which increases the risk of failure. This is subject to ongoing discussions.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated.  In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance. </p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  </p><p>However, it is acknowledged that pricing in the motor insurance sector has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years and, indeed, the problem of rising motor insurance premiums was the main impetus for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  Its <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance </i>was published in January 2017.  As the Deputy notes, the Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes. </p><p>Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations and there is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The Fifth Quarterly Progress Update was published on 11 May 2018: <i></i>.  It shows that of the 50 separate deadlines set to date within the Action Plan, 40 have been met.  Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.  </p><p>In line with the EU framework, the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s starting position on insurance for small public service vehicles was that it was not possible for it to make a recommendation on pricing as this is primarily a commercial matter for insurers. It did however recognise that this sector serves a social as well as an economic purpose, particularly in rural areas where public transport is less readily available.  This position was acknowledged by the inclusion of Recommendation 10 in the Report of the Cost of Insurance Working Group on the Cost of Motor Insurance.  This recommended that the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles should enter regular discussions with Insurance Ireland to explore solutions for drivers in the sector. </p><p>That Fifth Update Report mentioned above outlines the implementation of this recommendation.  In summary, Insurance Ireland met with the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles, commonly known as the Taxi Advisory Committee (TAC), on 22 May 2017.  The TAC submitted the required report in relation to this meeting on 21 June 2017 to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  To date, no further meetings have taken place between the TAC and Insurance Ireland.  However, the TAC has advised my officials that it is keeping itself informed of developments in the area, particularly through the industry representatives on the Committee, and future meetings with Insurance Ireland are a part of the TAC strategy.  Recommendation 10 has been completed in the sense that the TAC has reported to the Minister for Transport.  Notwithstanding this, my view would be that work needs to continue on this general issue.  Therefore, I look forward to further engagements between the TAC and the insurance industry.  </p><p>I would add that, notwithstanding the role of the TAC, the issues raised by the taxi sector were in the main similar to those affecting consumers generally, notwithstanding that there are risks that are specific to the sector.  While there is no silver bullet to reduce the cost of insurance, I believe that cooperation and commitment between all parties can deliver fairer premiums for consumers, including taxi drivers.  </p><p>I also believe that the work of the Cost of Insurance Group should better facilitate potential new entrants to the market.  In this regard, I have been informed by my officials that Insurance Ireland has stated that there has been some increase in market capacity in relation to the provision of motor insurance for taxi drivers recently.</p><p>Finally, if a consumer is unable to secure a quotation on the open market, he or she may be in a position to avail of the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA) process.  Under the terms of the DCA, the insurance market will not refuse to provide insurance to an individual seeking insurance if the person has approached at least three insurers and has not been able to obtain cover from them.  Insurance Ireland also operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  The relevant contact details are: <i>feedback@insuranceireland.eu or declined@insuranceireland.eu</i>or 01-6761914.  </p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure that every child who is assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to such support. </p>  <p>  In considering applications for SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources. SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource.</p>  <p>  SNA allocations to all schools can change from year to year as children with care needs leave the school, as new children with care needs enrol in a school and as children develop more independent living skills and their care needs diminish over time.</p>  <p>  I was very pleased to announce on Friday 18th May that 800 additional Special Needs Assistants will be allocated for the beginning of the next school year, with a further 140 expected to be allocated by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  I was also pleased that the announcement was in keeping with the commitment made last year to inform schools of the September 2018 allocation before the end of May. In making this announcement at this time the Department is providing certainty to schools, parents and of course SNA's in relation to the posts that will be in place for the coming school year.  </p>  <p>  By the end of this year, there will be a total of 15,000 Special Needs Assistants working in our schools, a 42% increase on 2011. </p>  <p>  The NCSE Appeals Process may be invoked by a parent or a school where it is considered that a child was not granted access to SNA support on the grounds that Department policy was not met in accordance with Circular 0030/2014. </p>  <p>  Schools may also appeal a decision, where the school considers that the NCSE, in applying Department policy, has not allocated the appropriate level of SNA supports to the school to meet the special educational and/or care needs of the children concerned.</p>  <p>  Where a school has received its allocation of SNA support for 2018/19, but wishes new enrolments or assessments to be considered, which were not taken into account when the initial allocation was made, they may continue to make applications to the NCSE.  The closing date for receipt of any appeals in regard to SNA allocations is Friday, 28th September 2018.</p>  <p>  As this question relates to an individual child I have referred the question to the NCSE for their direct reply. </p></reply>

This will also help ensure that works done under the Summer Works Scheme fit better with any wider refurbishment/energy retrofit plans that may be done at schools under the increased funding provided in the National Development Plan. The engagement with education partners will commence shortly and will assist in developing a better timeline for the planning and delivery of summer works projects for 2019 onwards.</p>  <p>  It remains open to the school to use its minor works grant, which all primary schools received last November, to carry out works in full or on a phased basis, as that grant permits, if the school considers the works to be a priority. </p></reply>

The National Council for Special Education notified the schools of their SNA allocations on 18th May and the details of these allocations are now published and available on their website.</p><p>The NCSE has completed a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme, in consultation with other relevant Departments and State Agencies, including the National Disability Authority (NDA), to identify the most appropriate form of support options to provide better outcomes for students with Special Educational Needs, having regard to the significant amount of State investment in this area.</p><p>The NCSE has submitted that full and final report of the SNA Comprehensive Review and its contents are currently under consideration.

Children with autism can be enrolled in an early intervention class from the age of 3.</p><p>Children in early intervention classes benefit from a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1. Class teachers are fully qualified and have access, through the Special Education Support Service, to training in a range of autism-specific interventions. Each class will have a minimum of 2 Special Needs Assistants. </p><p>Children with disabilities now have better access to pre-school services under a new Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) programme of supports, which was announced, on 15th June 2016, by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. </p><p>AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, depending on the needs of the child and the pre-school.</p><p>Details of the supports which are available under AIM can be found at <i><i>www.preschoolaccess.ie</i></i>which contains comprehensive information on the access and inclusion model and on how to apply for the new schemes and supports.  As Lorraine is attending a private pre-school through the ECCE programme, questions relating to the AIM supports should be addressed to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s policy is that all children enrolled in an Early Intervention Class funded by this Department must have left the class and be enrolled in the primary school system, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools in the September prior to their sixth birthday. If children are not in school by six years of age, under the Education Welfare Act 2000, the Educational Welfare service must be satisfied that the child is receiving a minimum standard of education in a place other than a recognised school.</p><p>The Department provides for a continuum of provision which includes mainstream school placements with additional supports, or for pupils who require more specialist interventions, special school and special class placements.</p><p>Where a Special Needs Assistant with a minimum of one year&rsquo;s service is made redundant he/she is deemed to be a member of the SNA supplementary panel and can apply for other SNA posts.  If a Special Need Assistant does not want to take up another position he/she can opt out of the panel and receive a Redundancy payment.  Circular 0034/2018 (Recruitment of SNA&rsquo;s &ndash; Supplementary Assignment Arrangements for 2018/2019 school year) refers.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-30a.209.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018053000078#WRD03300"><p>During discussions on section 30 in the Select Committee, and once again during Report Stage discussions, I pointed out that the processing of personal data for marketing and profiling purposes takes place under the so-called &ldquo;legitimate interests&rdquo; ground in Article 6.1(f) of the GDPR, and that the Court of Justice had already addressed the issue of whether national law could impose additional conditions on processing carried on under the corresponding provision of the 1995 Data Protection Directive in Joined Cases C-468/10 and C-469/10. In its ruling, the Court of Justice had underlined the importance of free movement of personal data under the 1995 Directive and concluded that Member States were not permitted to impose additional conditions that would have the effect of amending the scope of any of the grounds in Article 7 of the Directive. Those grounds are now set out in Article 6.1 of the GDPR. </p>  <p>  The Office of the Attorney General has now advised my Department that insofar as section 30 purports to make it an offence for any company or corporate body to process the personal data of a child for the purposes of direct marketing or profiling, such a prohibition appears to go beyond the margin of discretion afforded to Member States in giving further effect to the GDPR and would conflict with Article 6(1)(f), read in conjunction with Recital (47). Put simply, it is not an option for a Member State to unilaterally prohibit a category of processing activities which might otherwise be lawful under Article 6.1(f). Since commencement of section 30 could, therefore, give rise to a substantial risk of infringement proceedings against the State pursuant to Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, I have requested my Department to clarify the matter with the European Commission. </p>  <p>  Apart from this apparent conflict with the GDPR, the Office of the Attorney General has pointed out that section 30 gives rise to difficulties under Article 38.1 of the Constitution and under Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 38.1 provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law. In order for a domestic offence provision to comply with Article 38.1, it must be clear, precise and foreseeable in its application.  This is not the case here since it is not clear what might constitute the processing of personal data of a child for the purposes micro-targeting.  Whereas the GDPR refers to both direct marketing and profiling, the concept of micro-targeting does not appear in the GDPR and its scope remains uncertain and undefined. It is also a requirement under Article 7 of the Convention that offence provisions must be sufficiently clear and precise so as to enable individuals to ascertain which conduct constitutes a criminal offence and to foresee the consequences of engaging in such conduct.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the difficulties concerning section 30, the Deputy will be aware that I have made provision in section 32 for the drawing up of codes of conduct intended to contribute to proper application of the GDPR with regard to the processing of the personal data of children for the purposes of direct marketing and creating personality and user profiles. I regard the drawing up of such a code as an urgent priority and I urge all relevant stakeholders, including bodies that represent the interests of children, to support that objective and to make appropriate input into its development and implementation.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key health service objective.  However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner.  Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults.  This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.</p><p>Clinical concern arose when, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service.  In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters. The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.</p><p>From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care. Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient. If an application is refused, the clinician may submit an appeal, making a clear clinical case for the patient, to the MMP. Information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE MMP website at: <i>hse.ie/yourmedicines</i>.</p><p>The decision to introduce a new reimbursement approval process is a matter for the HSE and you will appreciate that, as Minister for Health, I cannot intervene in individual cases. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the Community Drugs scheme, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the Reimbursement List.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p>  <p>  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  I am keen to engage with Industry and to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily introduced in Ireland.  However, any innovative approaches that may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions which are in place and must also recognise the fundamental pricing/funding issues in the context of finite Exchequer resources.  </p>  <p>  My Office has been in contact with MS Ireland regarding their request and have scheduled a meeting for early June. </p></reply>

In the Budget and Estimates 2018, funding for the NTPF to treat public patients was increased to &euro;50 million.  </p>  <p>  The Inpatient/Day Case Action Plan is a joint initiative between the HSE, the NTPF and my Department and sets the projected activity and impact that will be delivered in 2018 from within the allocated funding.  As outlined in the Action Plan, a projected 1.16 million inpatient and day case procedures will take place in 2018, with NTPF activity accounting for 20,000 procedures and HSE activity 1.14 million procedures.</p>  <p>  Cataract surgery is among the most common surgical procedures carried out in the Ophthalmology specialty.  Through the work of the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and the HSE, the overall number of patients waiting for cataract surgery has fallen by 22% since July 2017, while the number of patients waiting more than 12 months has declined by 71% in the same period. </p>  <p>  For 2018, under the Inpatient/Day Case Action Plan, all clinically suitable patients waiting for more than 9 months for a Cataract procedure will be offered treatment this year, with 5,000 NTPF funded procedures planned in both public and private hospitals. </p>  <p>  Last year funding was allocated to provide additional capacity at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital as a result and a cataract theatre is now operational three days per week.  This year, in line with the Action Plan, the HSE is planning to open a dedicated Cataract theatre in Nenagh Hospital in July.</p>  <p>  The NTPF procures capacity for each of the procedures identified in the Action Plan in both private hospitals or public hospitals.  In 2018, the NTPF projects that the 4,000 of the 20,000 treatments will be delivered in public hospitals.  </p>  <p>  No formal cost-benefit analysis was carried out in relation to activity funded through the NTPF, nor indeed in respect of activity funded through the HSE.  However, the Action Plan strikes the appropriate balance between maximising the number of patients treated in both public and private capacity, as appropriate, and ensuring the best return for the taxpayer.  </p></reply>

Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the State and EEA, an employment permit may be sought from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation by an employer to hire a non-EEA national. </p>  <p>  Ireland operates a managed employment permits system which maximises the benefits of economic migration while minimising the risk of disrupting Ireland&rsquo;s labour market.  It operates a list system for in-demand occupations (the highly skilled list) and those for whom a ready source of labour is available (the ineligible list).  </p>  <p>  Care workers are currently included on the ineligible list of employments.  Changes to access to the Irish labour market for specific occupations via the employment permits system are made on the basis of evidence which involves research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs and the National Skills Council in tandem with an extensive public consultation process with Government Departments, agencies, industry and social partners invited to provide observations.  </p>  <p>  Retention issues in the State&rsquo;s labour market should not be addressed through the deployment of the employment permits system.  There would need to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to shortages and not to other factors such as salary and/or working conditions.  Organisations such as Nursing Home Ireland would need to provide the necessary data to substantiate their claims.  A detailed business case for removal of care workers from the ineligible list would then need to be put forward by my Department to DBEI.  </p>  <p>  While I have had various meetings with Nursing Homes Ireland and this matter has been discussed, to date such detailed evidence has not been provided by the sector to my Department.  It should be noted that the overall policy is that recruitment of workers from non-EEA countries should be a last resort and all other avenues should be first exhausted.  However, I am very willing to work with the industry on this important issue to ensure continuity of service in the best interests of residents.  </p>  <p>  As part of the Deputy's question relating to the waiting list for home support in Dun Laoghaire is a service matter, I have arranged for that aspect of the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.   </p></reply>

The Assessment Panel examined and assessed the material submitted in the application letters and CVs of all the candidates and agreed that three candidates should be further considered and invited to meet with a subgroup of the panel. </p>  <p>  One of the three shortlisted candidates was out of the country and was interviewed via conference call by the members of the subgroup. The same members of the subgroup also interviewed the other two candidates but as these were available to travel to the PAS offices, the meetings were face to face. The same PAS representative was present for each of the three interviews. Of the three candidates, two were considered to meet the published criteria for the position and these two names were put forward to the Minister for consideration for appointment. </p>  <p>  In relation to the person appointed, prior to the competition my Department confirmed to him that the appointment would be made through the PAS application process, and one of my officials informed him of the outcome at the end of the process.</p>  <p>  I am personally committed to achieving the Government target of 40% gender balance on the Boards of State Bodies. I wrote to the Chief Executives of some agri-business companies asking them to support women within their companies who express an interest in being appointed to the Boards of State Bodies and to encourage those who may not as yet have considered putting themselves forward to do so.</p>  <p>  In relation to six of the State Bodies under the aegis of my Department, some of the board appointments are made by me on the basis of nominations from third-party organisations for specified vacancies as set out in legislation. These State Bodies are the Aquaculture Licensing Appeals Board, Bord Bia, Horse Racing Ireland, National Milk Agency, Teagasc and the Veterinary Council of Ireland. I actively encourage the relevant nominating organisations to be pro-active in encouraging women within their membership to consider putting themselves forward for nomination for appointment to the Board of the State Body to which the organisation makes a nomination.</p>  <p>  I will continue to take every opportunity to achieve gender balance on the Boards of State Bodies under the aegis of my Department.</p></reply>

These objectives should ultimately lead to healthier fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and more sustainable fishing patterns.</p>  <p>  In the European Union as a whole, 53 stocks will be fished at MSY in 2018 which is an improvement from 44 in 2017.  As recently as 2009 the number of stocks at MSY was only 5.  The rebuilding of many of our stocks is demonstrated by a 34% increase in our whitefish quotas off the north-west coast and a 64% increase in the Irish Sea compared to 5 years ago - both areas where stocks were depleted.</p>  <p>  Scientific information on the state of the fisheries exploited by the Irish fleet is compiled by the Marine Institute and is published in the Stock Book each year.  The most recent Stock Book, 2017, contains 74 stocks managed under the CFP in which Ireland has a quota share.  Of those 74 stocks, 29 were assessed as being sustainably fished in 2017.  This number has grown every year since 2013.  This in turn leads to the number of stocks being overfished declining from 22 in 2014 to 17 in 2017.  The biomass of stocks, the quantity of mature fish in the sea, has also increased. In 2017 there were 27 stocks in a positive state above biomass trigger points. This is an increase over the preceding year of 22.</p>  <p>  Ireland intends to continue to work with all stakeholders, Member States and the Commission to build upon this substantial and tangible progress to achieve the ambitious conservation targets set out in the CFP while supporting the communities that depend on a vibrant fishing industry.</p></reply>

Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agri-food sector in particular. </p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region. </p>  <p>  In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025, I led a very successful Trade Mission in February 2017 to the Gulf Region.  This covered the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  This was followed by an extensive Trade Mission to the US and Mexico in June. Both of these latter markets offer many elements that are very attractive to Irish exporters.  The US is the largest food and beverage market in the world and has a population of 324 million people.  Around 35 million Americans also claim Irish ancestry.  Mexico has a population of 127 million, making it the eleventh-largest country in the world in population terms and the fifteenth-largest economy in the world, with projections that it will move into the top five by 2050.</p>  <p>  Later in 2017, during a Trade Mission to Japan and South Korea in November, I was accompanied by 40 representatives of the Irish food sector, as well as by experts from my Department, the CEO of Bord Bia and senior representatives from Enterprise Ireland and Teagasc. </p>  <p>  This was a very opportune time to bring a delegation of Ireland&rsquo;s food leaders to this part of the world, given that the EU has concluded a Free Trade Agreement with South Korea as well as concluding an Economic Partnership Agreement with Japan in December 2017. Japan and South Korea are markets of high potential for beef, pigmeat and sheepmeat exports, and so it is important that we raise the profile of Irish agri-food enterprises that already have access to these markets, and make progress in negotiating access for others.</p>  <p>  Following a further Trade Mission to the US and Canada in February, earlier this month I led a Trade Mission to China and Hong Kong. This was an extremely successful mission in the development of our ever-growing partnership with China. For example, being present at one of the World&rsquo;s largest food trade exhibitions in Shanghai allowed me to reinforce the positive messages about the quality and sustainability of Irish agri-food exports to Asian buyers, and I was also fortunate to secure meetings with three senior Chinese Ministers and three Vice-Ministers over the course of the week.  There is a clear ambition on both sides to further build co-operation between Ireland and China on many levels, including trade, and I will continue to do all I can to maximise this potential. </p>  <p>  These and the other missions that my Department are planning for the latter half of 2018 will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in these destinations.  It will also promote Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of high quality, safe and sustainably produced meat and dairy products. </p>  <p>  The destinations are also in keeping with the market prioritisation exercise that was undertaken by Bord Bia at my request.  This exercise identified opportunities in new and more mature markets, and will provide valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers as we continue to navigate the very uncertain environment created by Brexit.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to seek out and identify new markets, and I am ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-30a.402.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018053000081#WRG04800"><p>Brexit has the potential to have a significant impact across all areas of the Irish agri food sector, including the beef, lamb, poultry and pigmeat sectors.  These sectors are of critical importance to the Irish economy.  Their regional spread means they underpin the socio-economic development of rural Ireland. Farming is an essential part of the social, cultural and economic fabric of the country and it is also part of a wider EU dispensation that values a Common Agriculture Policy built on family farming, food security, high standards of food safety and environmental sustainability.  These are values that we hold dear, and so it is critically important when we consider the impact of Brexit that the positive contribution of agriculture to the rural and national economy, and to society in Ireland - and, indeed, elsewhere in the European Union - is to the forefront in our deliberations. </p>  <p>  Market diversification is a key component of the Government response to the challenges posed by Brexit, as we seek to reduce our exposure to the UK market and develop alternative markets for our exports.  The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agri-food exports is of course an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of the agri-food sector, as evidenced by its placement right at the centre of Food Wise 2025, the industry&rsquo;s strategy for development over the coming decade. </p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, including in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region.  This is something that I have been following up in a very practical way by leading Trade Missions to these destinations.  For example, I have just returned from a Trade Mission to China and Hong Kong where I continued to develop the trade and political relationships that have been given a very significant boost recently through the opening of the Chinese market to beef exports from Ireland.  I had very good and productive meetings with a number of Ministers, including my counterpart, the Chinese Minister for Agriculture, as well as supporting the Irish presence at SIAL Shanghai, which is now the largest food fair in the world.</p>  <p>  This follows on from successful trade missions to Canada and the USA last February, Japan and Korea in November 2017, the USA and Mexico in June 2017, and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in February/March 2017.  I will also, as part of the ongoing effort to reduce our exposure to the UK market, lead further trade missions in 2018 in order to promote Irish food and drink in key markets.  </p>  <p>  It is also worth pointing out that the identification of Trade Mission destinations is in keeping with the recent market prioritisation exercise that was completed by Bord Bia, at my request.  This exercise identified opportunities in new and more mature markets, and will provide valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers as we seek to deal with the impacts of Brexit. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to seek out and help to develop new markets, and I am ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise.</p></reply>

The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement.  This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place.  These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain. Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied. In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have what is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system.  There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail.   </p>  <p>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants. Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment.  An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks. </p>  <p>  Extra veterinary checks are carried out on selected consignments of foods imported into DAFM-approved establishments from other EU Member States or from Third Countries outside the EU.  These checks include physical checks of product condition, checks of accompanying documentation and checks of labelling and health markings.</p>  <p>  The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety, to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards.  The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States.  Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department.  Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the Directorate to ensure compliance. Inspection finding reports are published on the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the controls and checks in place and enforced by my Department which included 183 annual meat labelling audits in 2017, ensure that Irish consumers are protected and correctly informed when they purchase and consume food products.</p>  <p>  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) has service contracts in place with the official agencies performing official controls, to verify compliance with the extensive requirements of food labelling legislation, in these establishments.  The FSAI reports in detail on the number of inspections and checks carried out, and non-compliance findings.</p></reply>

In 1996 there were approximately 500 deer farms with 20,000 deer in Ireland, but numbers have declined sharply since that time. </p>  <p>  Today there are only a small number of farmers in Ireland actively supplying deer for meat production, which cater primarily to specialised niche markets.  The sector is reliant upon producers and companies ensuring that a market exists for their product, an objective which Bord Bia assists in by identifying and developing potential market outlets.</p>  <p>  There was some recent growth in game (venison) market during 2016 for example with around 764 deer slaughtered for this market, but, this declined to 271 deer for 2017, with no deer slaughtered so far in 2018.  Growth in the past was achieved as a result of improved distribution for game meats, especially in supermarkets. Game and exotic meats historically occupy a premium, niche segment of the meat market.  Whilst there are opportunities to compete with the larger premium segment of the red meat/poultry categories, it is important to note that demand is seasonal, with the greatest concentration of retail shelf space dedicated to game in the Winter/Christmas period. </p>  <p>  My Department has approved one factory for the slaughter of deer in Ireland, and two game handling plants.  There may also be outlets for processing of venison in Local Authority approved plants, but this would be a matter for the Local Authority concerned. </p>  <p>  In addition my Department will continue to seek out and identify viable markets for all types of meat products, including venison, and I am ready to respond as appropriate to market opportunities that could arise in the future. </p></reply>

Growth has also been seen in trade with the Scandinavian nations and Spain. Exports to third country markets now amounts to 10% of export totals, with South Africa showing the biggest growth for Irish exporters. </p>  <p>  Irish production  hit record levels in 2017, with 95.5 million birds slaughtered in export-approved plants, an increase of 3.9% compared to 2016, with most of the increase evident in broiler and duck production.  Overall, Irish poultry production is forecast to remain broadly stable during 2018.</p>  <p>  While the outlook for the poultry sector is positive, the sector continues to face challenges particularly the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit. In this context, the pursuit and development of new markets is an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of the agri-food sector, as evidenced by the market development theme of Food Wise 2025. </p>  <p>  Avian influenza remains a threat. Following recent outbreaks in Europe, my Department continues to monitor the situation closely and engage with flock owners, with a view to remaining vigilant and implementing the necessary biosecurity measures required to safeguard Irish flocks.</p>  <p>  The Rural Development programme 2014 &ndash; 2020 (RDP) is also providing key supports for the enhancement and the competitiveness of the poultry sector.  The main areas for support in the RDP for the poultry sector include support for on-farm capital investment under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme II (TAMS II) scheme and knowledge transfer and innovation measures, aimed at underpinning farm viability, sustainability and growth through the adoption of best practice and innovative solutions.</p></reply>

Under this new framework, each participating Member State was required to submit to the EU Commission a six year Statement of Strategy setting out its particular objectives for the scheme for this duration.  Ireland submitted its six year Statement of Strategy in July 2017.  The  2018/19 school year is the second year of this strategy. </p>  <p>  With regard to the School Milk Scheme, one of Ireland&rsquo;s main objectives in the Strategy is to halt the decline in the participation rate by Irish schoolchildren in the school milk scheme, which has  been declining steadily over the last number of years, and thereby contribute to the formulation of healthy eating habits and choices at an early age. </p>  <p>  Under the new framework, which takes effect from the 2017/2018 school year, the National Dairy Council (NDC) was appointed to manage and run the School Milk Scheme on the ground at school level in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The NDC ran a National School Milk Week in April 2018 together with a targeted publicity and early recruitment campaign for schools to sign up to the Scheme for the 2018/19 school year. </p>  <p>  Accompanying educational measures are an essential element of the new School Scheme.  Ireland has introduced new accompanying educational measures including the NDC&rsquo;s Moo Crew school based programme, which provides a positive platform to educate children about dairy and the importance of dairy as part of a balanced diet.  This programme includes dairy based lesson plans, DVD&rsquo;s and other tailored activities for all participating school children.  Additionally, fun packs for Montessori schools and specific nutrition booklets for junior and senior pupils in primary and secondary schools are distributed. </p>  <p>  The model of delivery in the 2018/2019 School Year of the School Milk Scheme in Ireland will stay largely the same as the 2017/18 school year  which was the first year of the new framework, but will include more frequent deliveries, where feasible, and a minimum of 2 weeks free milk for participating schoolchildren. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with the National Dairy Council in the 2018/19 school year to pilot additional activities under the school milk scheme. </p></reply>

The SSC uses catch returns to individual rivers (rod catch, catch and release and any commercial catch) over the previous five years to estimate the total salmon returns in each of the previous five years.  The use of a five year average ensures that a good or bad year does not have a disproportionate impact on the stock assessment in any single year.</p>  <p>  The decline in wild Atlantic Salmon is a shared international issue manifesting in rivers in all countries around the North Atlantic with scientific analysis from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) estimating that marine survival of migrating salmon has been at or below 5% in the North Atlantic for more than a decade. </p>  <p>  Marine survival is considered to have a most significant influence on return, from far North Atlantic feeding grounds, of salmon to all rivers on Atlantic coasts.  Climate change in the ocean is considered to be a major factor.  There is also evidence that heavy sea-lice infestation from salmon farming has resulted in additional mortality in respect of migratory North Atlantic salmon generally.  In freshwater, water quality and a range of pressures such as afforestation, drainage, effluent discharge, siltation and agricultural enrichment can all have an impact on juvenile salmon production.</p>  <p>  The protection and conservation of salmon internationally is managed through the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) with which Ireland is aligned through the European Union. Concerted international co-operation has ensured that restrictions in Greenland and Faroese waters have been in place for a number of years via NASCO agreement. In June this year, my officials and those of IFI will join delegates from the EU, USA, Canada, Norway, the Russian Federation, Greenland and the Faroes in seeking to negotiate a continuation of restrictions in these waters. </p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to Greenlandic waters, the majority component of the stock complex migrating to these waters originates from the North American Continent.  There is no commercial harvest in Faroese waters where the migratory stock complex comprises a majority component of European river stocks including those from Ireland.   </p>  <p>  The Atlantic salmon is a protected species under the EU Habitats Directive with which Ireland&rsquo;s current salmon management regime complies. In order to align fully with the Directive and the North NASCO principles, Ireland closed mixed stock fisheries at sea since 2007.</p></reply>

The creation of a National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) is one of the key provisions of the proposed Governance of the Energy Union Regulation. The plan will include trajectories for renewable energy, energy efficiency, and national emissions, as well as the measures required to achieve these trajectories. </p>  <p>  In October 2014 EU leaders agreed on a 2030 Framework for climate and energy, which included new EU-wide targets and policy objectives for the period between 2021 and 2030. The three targets from this framework are at least 27% share for renewable energy, at least 27% improvement in energy efficiency, and at least 40% cuts in greenhouse gas emissions (from 1990 levels). The proposed Governance of the Energy Union Regulation will underpin these commitments. The NECP will cover all five dimensions of the Energy Union, the policies and measures proposed to reach these goals and will be based on a common template to allow for comparability. The first draft is due for submission to the Commission by end 2018, with a final version due by end 2019.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Governance Regulation is the subject of an ongoing trilogue process with the European Parliament which is expected to conclude later this year. Until this point is reached, the targets, policy objectives and timelines are subject to revision.  </p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with other Departments on the development of the plan through the structures that have been established to co-ordinate Government activity on climate change. There is a high-level steering committee on climate action, which I chair, and a Technical Research and Modelling group which provides expert advice and support. Relevant Departments and agencies are members of these groups.   </p>  <p>Preparation of the plan is at an early stage but its development will be facilitated by the work already undertaken to complete the Energy White Paper, the National Mitigation Plan, and the recently published National Development Plan. The NDP in particular represents a step-change in Government commitment to climate change, with &euro;21.8 billion in funding directed to addressing the transition to a low-carbon society over the period to 2030. This week I launched a &euro;500 million Climate Action Fund, which is a key element of Government strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase renewable energy and enhance energy efficiency as set out in the NDP.   </p></reply>

As this growth trend is expected to continue, albeit at a slower pace, capacity concerns at Dublin Airport in the short, medium and longer term are being managed and addressed in a number of ways.</p>  <p>  In the short to medium term, I understand that the daa has a programme of works underway at the Airport, which comprises a suite of passenger-processing, stands and airfield projects required to deliver passenger growth to end-2019.  With further passenger growth envisaged beyond 2019, additional infrastructure will be required to ensure the sustainable development of the Airport in accordance with a new Dublin Airport Masterplan.  The next Capital Investment Programme, due to be finalised by the Commission for Aviation Regulation next year, will provide an allowance for necessary investment in capital infrastructure at the Airport from 2020.  </p>  <p>  To ensure that Dublin Airport, along with our other State airports at Cork and Shannon, are prepared for the longer term to 2050, a Review of their capacity need is now underway. In the case of Dublin Airport only, the study is considering the time frame for the development of new terminal capacity &ndash; Terminal 3 &ndash; and its appropriate design and optimum location as well as an assessment of the relative advantages and disadvantages of the funding and operation of Terminal 3 by the existing airport operator in comparison to being operated on an independent basis. I expect the review to be completed shortly. </p></reply>

The Report of that Group and subsequent updates can be found here - www.finance.gov.ie/what-we-do/insurance/the-cost-of-insurance-working-group/.  </p><p>The Cost of Insurance Working Group Report commented that an &lsquo;older vehicle may have a greater risk of injury due to its lack of safety features compared to a modern vehicle&rsquo; (See Point 2.4 Underwriting Risks and Coverages, Section vii. Vehicle details on page 29 of the Report).  Research by the Road Safety Authority indicates that in the event of a collision, the level of personal injury to an individual in an older car can be significantly higher than if that person was driving a new car. Safety features on newer cars can include greater use of airbags, electronic stability, improved braking systems, roll-over protection, etc., all of which are designed to reduce the impact of a collision on the occupants.  A higher overall level of personal injury payout may be one factor that leads some insurance companies to consider older cars a higher risk in terms of potential payouts when underwriting a policy.</p><p>If a person is unable to obtain a quotation for motor insurance or feels that the premium proposed or the terms are so excessive that it amounts to a refusal to give them motor insurance, they should contact Insurance Ireland, 5 Harbourmaster Place, IFSC, Dublin 1 Postcode DO1 E7E8 quoting the Declined Cases Agreement email : declined@insuranceireland.eu Tel. 01.6761820.See <i>www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/declined-cases-agreement</i>.  Under the Declined Cases Agreement, which all motor insurers must adhere to under the Central Bank&rsquo;s &lsquo;General Good Requirements for Insurance and Reinsurance Undertakings&rsquo;, a Declined Cases Committee, including consumer representatives, deal with any cases of difficulty in obtaining motor insurance.</p></reply>

The 2018 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes of &euro;2.17 billion.</p>  <p>  An Taoiseach, in his previous role as Minister for Social Protection, gave a commitment at D&aacute;il report stage of the Social Welfare Bill 2016 that he would ask officials to examine the issue of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the treatment of part-time and seasonal workers, including those categorised as having a subsidiary employment.

Deciding officers are appointed by the Minister under section 299 of the Act. Section 301 of the Act provides for the questions which shall be decided by a deciding officer. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.  Appeals Officers are appointed by the Minister under section 304 of the Act. </p>  <p>  Section 302 of the Act provides for the effective date of revised decisions. The effective date can be the date of a previous decision, the date of some new fact or evidence of a change of circumstances or a current date. </p>  <p>  Section 302(a) relates to situations where there is evidence that the person deliberately gave false or misleading information or deliberately concealed relevant information.

Under this provision a deciding officer has the power to determine the effective date of a revised decision, having regard to the new facts or new evidence and to the circumstances of the case.  In cases where the effect of the revised decision is to reduce or disallow a payment but the revised decision is made effective from a current date there is no overpayment.  </p>  <p>  In accordance with section 311(3) of the Act an appeals officer, when deciding a question shall not be confined to the grounds on which the decision of the deciding officer was based, but may decide the question as if it were being decided for the first time. This means that an appeals officer when determining an appeal can decide that section 302(b) instead of section 302(a) is the appropriate provision for that case.   </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Code sets out co-ordinated actions to be taken in relation to forecasting future demand for school places by the Department of Education and Skills and planning for the provision of school sites within the planning system, as well as the efficient handling of planning applications and associated consultations by the relevant planning authorities to expedite school delivery.</p><p>With regard to assessing the implications of local authority development planning on the issue of schools and school provision in a given area, local authorities are obliged under the Code of Practice to take this matter into account in preparing and finalising their plans, working in  conjunction with the relevant forward planning and new school sections of the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>Furthermore, section 10(2)(l) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) requires a development plan to include objectives for &ldquo;the provision, or facilitation of the provision, of services for the community including, in particular, schools, cr&egrave;ches and other education and childcare facilities&rdquo;.

Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities, who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers.</p><p>In addition, local authorities also have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, the Housing Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, all of which may be relevant where fire safety concerns arise in residential developments. Fire services may inspect buildings in cases of defects or complaints in respect of fire safety.  They work with building owners to ensure immediate risks are addressed, and put a plan in place for works to bring buildings into compliance. They have enforcement powers for cases where co-operation is not forthcoming, or progress cannot be made on an agreed basis. </p><p>In addition in August 2017, I published a Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings, which is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern. The Framework is also of assistance to professional advisors both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations.  The framework is available on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p><i>www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/framework_for_enhancing_fire_safety_in_dwellings.pdf.</i></p><p>In the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower tragedy in June 2017, and in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety, Minister Murphy tasked the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management with convening and coordinating a Task Force to lead a re-appraisal of our approach to fire safety in Ireland. He also tasked them to oversee a review of fire safety in local authority provided multi-storey, multi-unit social housing and a separate review of medium to high rise buildings (&amp;gt; 18 metres or 6 storeys). The Task Force has recently completed its report and this is now being examined urgently.</p><p>Separately, under the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017, which apply to all properties let or available to let, local authorities also carry out inspections to check that rental properties comply with the regulations. This includes checking compliance with fire safety requirements, such as fire detection and alarm systems and emergency lighting.</p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015 governing the Scheme provide for a number of specified classes of houses to be excluded from sale, including houses provided to local authorities under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, houses specifically designed for older persons, group Traveller housing and houses provided to facilitate people with disabilities transferring from institutional care to community-based living. </p>  <p>  The provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, are designed to enable the development of mixed tenure sustainable communities. Part V units are excluded from the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme 2016 to ensure that units delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time. The continued development of mixed tenure communities remains very important in promoting social integration. </p>  <p>  Local authorities may also, within the provisions of the Regulations, exclude certain houses which, in the opinion of the authority, should not be sold for reasons such as proper stock or estate management.  It is a matter for each individual local authority to administer the Scheme in its operational area in line with the over-arching provisions of the governing legislation for the scheme, and in a manner appropriate to its housing requirements.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in Rebuilding Ireland, a review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken. The review has incorporated analysis of comprehensive data received from local authorities regarding the operation of the scheme during 2016 and a wide-ranging public consultation process which took place in 2017 and saw submissions received from individuals, elected representatives and organisations.</p>  <p>  The review is now complete and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations some of which will necessitate amendments to primary legislation in order to be implemented. I hope to be in a position to publish the review shortly once an appropriate piece of legislation has been identified that can accommodate the recommended changes to the scheme.</p></reply>
