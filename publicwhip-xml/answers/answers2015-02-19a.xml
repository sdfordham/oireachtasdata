Accordingly, decisions in relation to the introduction or extension of such systems are a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that current Garda CCTV arrangements are  kept under ongoing review in the context of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's operational requirements. </p>  <p>  As regards community-based CCTV, a scheme was launched in 2005 which provided financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of a local community CCTV system.  Two rounds of funding were  advertised under that Scheme, most recently in 2007.  All of the available funding provided under the previous two rounds was fully allocated.  There are currently no plans to further extend the Scheme, but of course the issue will be kept under review in the context of the availability of funding and competing priorities.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the decision to close a number of Garda stations in 2013 was the result of a comprehensive operational assessment carried out by the Garda Commissioner, the objective of which was to ensure that Garda resources are used in the best and most efficient way possible.  In particular, freeing up Garda&iacute; from desk duties has increased the number of Garda&iacute; available for frontline policing and confronting crime.  More generally, in relation to Garda numbers, the Deputy will be aware that for the first time since May 2009 there are now 300 Garda recruits in training in Templemore.</p></reply>

His report was published in January 2009.  He concluded that the original Tribunal finding of arson was a hypothetical one only and that no-one present on the night can be held responsible.  He further concluded that in the absence of any identified evidence as to the cause of the fire, the most another inquiry could achieve would be another set of hypothetical findings, which would not be in the public interest.  The then Government accepted Mr. Coffey's findings and motions were passed in both Houses of the Oireachtas endorsing his conclusions and expressing sympathy with the families. </p>  <p>  I accept, of course, that some of the victims and their relatives of this dreadful tragedy do not accept the conclusions of the Independent Examination, during which persons were free to make their case to Mr. Coffey.  Indeed the concerns of the Stardust Committee in this regard were outlined to me when I met with representatives of the Committee last July.  This meeting provided an opportunity for me to hear their concerns at first hand.  At that meeting they set out, in some detail, their concerns in relation to the Inquiries into this matter that have been undertaken previously and some related financial issues that have arisen.  </p>  <p>  Since that meeting my Department has engaged in extensive communications with representatives of the Committee in relation to matters raised by them and these communications are ongoing.</p>  <p>  I remain open to considering any material that the Committee or their representatives wish me to consider in this regard and my Department has, in its communications, made that clear.  In saying this I should caution against raising unrealistic expectations about what can be achieved or appearing to suggest that the outcome of the Coffey examination can be set aside, simply on the basis that his conclusions are not accepted by some.</p>  <p>  I wish also to inform the Deputy that allegations raised by the Stardust Relatives' and Victims Committee and their representatives in relation to certain matters are the subject of an ongoing investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am informed, by the Garda Commissioner, that this is a complex investigation and, you will understand, I cannot do anything that might cut across this investigation.</p></reply>

There were also 1,124 Garda Reserve members, with a further 48 in training.  In addition, there were over 2,000 Garda civilian staff.     </p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides a vital public service, protecting the public from crime and safeguarding the security of the State.  As with any such a service, there must be a twin-track approach of investment and reform.  In that regard, the Deputy will be aware of the significant programme of Garda reform  already under way.</p>  <p>  Side by side with the reform process, I was very pleased  my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform agreed to the resumption of Garda recruitment.  Last September, 100 new Garda recruits entered training at the Garda College in Templemore, the first intake of Garda recruits since May 2009.  This was followed by an intake of a further 100 recruits in December and a third intake of 100 this month.  This means that there are now 300 Garda students in training.  I remain in discussion with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the timing of future intakes of Garda recruits.</p>  <p>  In addition to investing in recruitment, I am committed to see that the Garda ICT infrastructure gets the investment it needs to enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver an optimum policing service.  The recent report of the Garda Inspectorate on Crime Investigation highlighted the importance of this.  That is why I have established, in cooperation with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, a steering group to oversee the drawing up a Garda ICT strategy, which will identify the medium and longer term Garda ICT requirements, as well as more immediate priorities.  The steering group, which has started work, is chaired by Josephine Feehily, the chairperson-designate of the Policing authority, and includes representatives from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda Inspectorate, my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as the Government's Chief Information Officer.  This work is being taken forward with urgency, and will provide a clear basis for planned and sustained investment in Garda ICT.</p></reply>

These grounds do not include income source.<br/><br/>While I do from time to time receive correspondence relating to this matter and while the general issues so raised may come to inform policy and legislative change, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate it would not appropriate for me, as Minister of State, to provide an interpretation of the law. <br/><br/>However, I can confirm at this point in time,<b></b>that the Government has decided, in principle, to bring forward amendments to the Equal Status Acts to prohibit discrimination in relation to residential tenants, or prospective tenants,on the basis that they are assisted with their rent through rent supplement or social welfare payments.<br/><br/>Legislative amendments in this regard are being prepared by my Department in consultation with the relevant other Departments.  These are expected to be ready soon and once approved by Government, I intend to publish them as amendments to the Employment Equality (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill.

It also provides that following commencement of any such proceedings, a court may on the application of a party, or of its own motion where it considers it appropriate, suspend proceedings in order to facilitate mediation.</p>  <p>  The Government approved the General Scheme of the Bill in March 2012 and the Mediation Bill is being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  The Deputy will appreciate that the Government has a demanding schedule of urgent legislation at present and for that reason it is not possible to give a specific date for publication of the Bill at this stage.  However, it is my intention to proceed quickly with enactment of the legislation following publication of the Bill later this year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-19a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015021900024#WRA02100"><p>I can confirm to the Deputy that the person to whom he refers is included amongst those whose complaints are under consideration by the panel of counsel appointed to operate the Independent Review Mechanism set up to consider allegations of Garda misconduct and inadequacy in the investigation of such allegations.</p>  <p>  The review of each complaint will consist of an examination of the papers in the complaint by a counsel from the panel.  Following the review of each complaint a recommendation will be made as to whether any further action is desirable and could practicably be taken.</p>  <p>  I am aware of requests that the person concerned, her legal representatives and other third parties have made to have her complaints investigated by the Commission of Investigation recently established under Order No 38 of 2015 and being conducted by Mr Justice Kevin O'Higgins following the recommendations made in the Guerin Report.</p>  <p>  Where counsel do recommend further investigations, I will be very strongly guided by that advice.  Clearly, there are a number of possible options for further investigations, in particular by way of referral to GSOC, but any recommendation for referral of a case to a commission of investigation will be very carefully considered, including whether this could be achieved by way of amending the terms of reference of an existing commission or the establishment of a separate commission.</p>  <p>  I am clear that where further investigation is recommended by the review then that will occur.  However I would also make the point that in many cases, counsel may recommend that no further action can reasonably be taken. This might be, for example, because a case has already been through due process even though the complainant remains unhappy with the outcome.  The crucial point, however, is that every case will have been reviewed by independent counsel, who will have made an objective recommendation.</p></reply>

Section 19 of the Act inserted a new provision into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which provides for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) to be a prescribed person under the 2014 Act to investigate disclosures relating to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including disclosures from members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Accordingly, Garda&iacute; have attended routinely at water meter installations and protests where it has been necessary to perform these functions.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na always endeavour as best they can to facilitate peaceful protests and demonstrations.  This is clearly evidenced by the many peaceful demonstrations and protests that take place around the country on a variety of issues of public interest, including large demonstrations late last year with regard to water charges.  These peaceful and dignified protests are in stark contrast to the other forms of protest against the installation of water meters where a small few have prevented workers from going about their lawful business through intimidation, obstruction and worse behaviour.</p>  <p>  I am sure the House will agree that is it always unfortunate when a small number of individuals resort to means other than peaceful ones to express their views or to engage in protest.  We have, unfortunately, seen examples of this in respect of some of the protest actions against water charges and the installation of water meters.  In this context, the Garda&iacute; are trained to defuse confrontation using a range of proportionate methods appropriate to the circumstances.</p>  <p>  I have every confidence that this will continue to be the case.</p>  <p>  Let me emphasise that there is also an obligation on the organisers of protest actions to ensure that they do not create situations which they cannot control.  Such events can on occasion lead to the danger of breaches of public order.  The role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in such instances is to ensure, insofar as it is possible, that this does not happen and that other members of the public may go about their lawful business.  Indeed, the presence of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also essential to ensure the safety of protesters in such circumstances.</p>  <p>  Of course, it is open to anyone to complain about the behaviour of an individual member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) where they feel that such complaint is warranted.

Funding for such works is provided for in the Vote of the Office of Public Works.</p>  <p>  In July 2012, the Government announced an economic stimulus package which included three major Garda construction projects, namely the development of new Divisional HQ Stations at Wexford, Galway and Kevin St, Dublin.  Initially, these projects were to be financed by way of public private partnership (PPP), however the Office of Public Works (OPW) was subsequently requested to develop the new facilities by way of a traditional procurement process.</p>  <p>  Included in Budget 2015 is a capital allocation of &euro;42 million in 2015 for the provision of these three new Garda Divisional Headquarters.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that the procurement process for the construction of all three Divisional Headquarters is significantly advanced with work expected to commence on the Galway project in the coming months.</p></reply>

The refugees have been resettled in 21 different communities throughout Ireland.</p>  <p>  Over the coming years, Ireland is committed to continuing to support the efforts of the UNHCR to respond to the plight of vulnerable refugees.</p>  <p>  Resettlement is just one of a suite of responses to persons displaced by the Syrian conflict.  In 2014, Ireland introduced a Syrian Humanitarian Admission Programme (SHAP).  The SHAP offered naturalised Irish citizens of Syrian birth and Syrian nationals already legally resident in Ireland an opportunity to make an application for vulnerable close family members to join them in Ireland for up to two years under a sponsorship programme.</p>  <p>  These are persons who are considered by their sponsoring family member present in Ireland to be most at risk. 114 beneficiaries have been granted admission under the programme.  In addition, Syrians legally resident in Ireland, for example, students or persons on work permissions may apply for an extension of their permission to remain in the State while the crisis situation continues.</p>  <p>  Of course, the opportunity to access Ireland's asylum procedures is open to any person who arrives at the frontiers of the State seeking protection or otherwise indicating an unwillingness to leave the State for fear of persecution.  All applications for protection made in Ireland are processed in accordance with our international obligations and the granting of protection in Ireland is considered in accordance with a prescribed legal framework and exclusively on the merits of applications having regard to their subjective and objective elements.  The protection system in Ireland is robust but fair and anybody who presents seeking protection and who is entitled to such protection will be granted it.</p>  <p>  A total of 1,444 asylum applications were received in 2014 as compared with some 950 for 2013 equating to a 52% increase.  This reverses the trend of recent years when application numbers were decreasing year on year.  Applications have continued to trend upwards in 2015 with a further significant increase reported in January compared with the same period last year.</p>  <p>  A total of 426 persons were declared to be refugees or persons eligible for subsidiary protection in 2014.  This equates to a grant rate of 30%.  Those granted protection were mainly from high risk countries such as Somalia, Sudan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Malawi.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also made generous financial contributions (over 28 million euro) to countries in need through Development Aid at a time of severe financial constraints, and continues to provide support to those directly involved in humanitarian work in Syria and the wider region.</p></reply>

This unprecedented decision was taken with a view to getting an objective and independent legal view on whether further action might be warranted in any case.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, a panel consisting of two senior and five junior counsel was established for that purpose.  This independent review panel has been examining 315 cases referred to them.  This is a significant number of cases, and somewhat higher than originally estimated, but I think it was important to refer to the Panel all of the allegations that have been made to me as Minister or to the Taoiseach, whether they came direct from complainants or through representative groups, with only the most minimal filtering out of cases which did not actually relate to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This does mean that counsel are examining a very wide range of cases, some of which deal directly with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but others of which extend to other aspects of the criminal justice system beyond my remit, such as the prosecution and trial of offences.  It is also worth noting that the cases contain a very wide variety in the seriousness of the allegations.</p>  <p>  The Panel has made significant progress and the submission of recommendations to me is being prepared by officials.  Each recommendation will be very carefully considered, but as a matter of general principle let me say quite clearly that, in coming to a decision in each case, I will be very strongly guided by the independent advice of counsel.  Quite clearly, having engaged counsel for this review it would be entirely appropriate to be guided by their advice.</p>  <p>  Where counsel do recommend further investigations, I will as I say be very strongly guided by that advice.  Clearly, there are a number of possible options for further investigations, in particular by way of referral to GSOC, but any recommendation for referral of a case to a commission of investigation will be very carefully considered, including whether this could be achieved by way of amending the terms of reference of an existing commission or the establishment of a separate commission.</p>  <p>  However I would also make the point that in many cases, counsel may recommend that no further action can reasonably be taken.  This might be, for example, because a case has already been through due process, such as an investigation by GSOC or a court hearing, even though the complainant remains unhappy with the outcome. The crucial point, however, is that every case will have been reviewed by independent counsel, who will have made an objective recommendation.  There will be no undue delay in the process of notifying complainants of the outcome of the reviews.</p></reply>

The Court found that disclosure of old minor criminal records should not be automatic but should instead be based on consideration of the relevance and proportionality of the conviction.  The Attorney General has advised that similar considerations should apply to disclosure of criminal convictions in this State. </p></reply>

This unprecedented decision was taken with a view to getting an objective and independent legal view on whether further action might be warranted in any case.<br/><br/>  As the Deputy is aware, a panel consisting of two senior and five junior counsel was established for that purpose.  This independent review panel has been examining 315 cases referred to them.  This is a significant number of cases, and somewhat higher than originally estimated, but I think it was important to refer to the Panel all of the allegations that have been made to me as Minister or to the Taoiseach, whether they came direct from complainants or through representative groups, with only the most minimal filtering out of cases which did not actually relate to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This does mean that counsel are examining a very wide range of cases, some of which deal directly with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but others of which extend to other aspects of the criminal justice system beyond my remit, such as the prosecution and trial of offences. It is also worth noting that the cases contain a very wide variety in the seriousness of the allegations.<br/><br/>It is important that nothing arises which might detract from the integrity of the review mechanism.  It is therefore considered inappropriate to place a time constraint upon the working of the Panel, although they intend to conclude their work as soon is reasonably practicable.  The crucial point is that every case will have been reviewed by independent counsel, who will have made an objective recommendation.<br/><br/>  The Panel has made significant progress and the submission of recommendations to me is being prepared by officials.  Each recommendation will be very carefully considered, but as a matter of general principle let me say quite clearly that, in coming to a decision in each case, I will be very strongly guided by the independent advice of counsel.  Quite clearly, having engaged counsel for this review it would be entirely appropriate to be guided by their advice. There will be no undue delay in the process of notifying complainants of the outcome of the reviews.</p></reply>

In September last year, I published the report of the Penal Policy Review Group which was tasked with carrying out a strategic review of penal policy.  As an initial step, the Government agreed in principle last November to proceed with the implementation of a number of key recommendations, including the bringing forward of legislative proposals to establish the Parole Board on an independent statutory basis.<br/><br/>I believe this will help to strengthen the Board and improve its functions.  My Department is currently considering the matter in more detail ahead of presenting proposals for legislation.<br/><br/>415. Deputy <b>Fergus O'Dowd</b>asked the Minister for Justice and Equality if she will respond to issues raised by the Irish Penal Reform Trust (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter. [49699/14]<br/><br/>The Question relates to an independent investigation by the Inspector of Prisons into the death in custody of a prisoner in the Midlands Prison on 30 January, 2012.  I published the Inspector's report on 17 December, 2014.<br/><br/>ANSWER:<br/><br/>I would like to begin by taking this opportunity to offer my sympathy to the family concerned on their loss.  I would also like to thank the Inspector of Prisons, Judge Michael Reilly, for his very comprehensive investigation and report into the death in custody of the prisoner concerned.<br/><br/>Since 1 January, 2012, the death of any prisoner in custody or on temporary release is the subject of an independent investigation by the Inspector of Prisons.  The Office of the Inspector is a statutory independent office established under the Prisons Act, 2007.<br/><br/>The Inspector's investigation and reports are part of a three pronged process, the other elements being investigations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and investigations and inquests conducted by Coroners.  The combination of the Garda inquiries, the Coroners' investigations and inquests, and the Inspector's reports mean that this country is in compliance with its national and international obligations and meets the criteria laid down by the European Court of Human Rights when interpreting the procedural requirements of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.<br/><br/>It is important for all concerned, where any issues or deficiencies arise, that we ensure they are addressed and that we learn from them.  In that context, I am carefully studying the Inspector's report and am considering the issues involved.<br/><br/>These include the issue of temporary release for the category of offenders referred to in the report, which is currently considered on a case-by-case basis. Proposals are under consideration for a more structured approach of limited temporary release in such cases, where full and constructive engagement with the prison and probation services could lessen the risk of re-offending. In this consideration, the safety of the public, the importance of victims, and the goal of reducing re-offending will be the primary objectives.<br/><br/>In relation to the issue of Garda submissions on applications for temporary release, it is important, given the crucial role that Garda advice can have in the consideration of such applications, that this issue is addressed generally, and not simply in relation to any individual case. The Irish Prison Service is therefore being asked to engage with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on agreeing a more structured format for the submission of advice on such applications, drawing on the findings of this report and their joint experience in managing this issue.</p></reply>

The DACT projects commenced at the end of 2012 and will end on 30 April 2015, as the ESF portion of the funding was provided under the Human Capital Investment Operational Programme 2007- 2013 and this programme has recently come to an end. </p>  <p>  There is therefore no provision for ESF co-funding arrangements to continue beyond the end of April next. This position was recently communicated to the individual projects, and it was pointed out that the terms of the grant agreement with each DACT project stipulated that the project must be delivered and completed by the end of April this year.</p>  <p>  I very much welcomed and supported the setting up of these projects as they set out to explore a variety of routes towards ensuring that people with disabilities are enabled to avail of progression, education and development opportunities within the world of work. However, the projects were not intended to become ongoing service delivery organisations.  </p>  <p>  The department has now commissioned an independent evaluation of the projects and a key part of this evaluation will be to identify from the projects what works with regard to increasing the capacity and potential of people on disability/illness welfare payments to participate in the labour market, and which of those are capable, where appropriate, of being mainstreamed in the delivery of supports to people with disabilities in the future. In the meantime, the department is considering the position of those people who will still be participating in the projects at the end of April.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-19a.148.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015021900027#WRD01600"><p>In September 2013, I published the Third Report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.</p>  <p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker's allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker's allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker's benefit. </p>  <p>  The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points. </p>  <p>  In addition to the above the Group identified a range of issues associated with the subject of social insurance for the self-employed that should be addressed and made a number of other recommendations in this regard.  Among the issues identified by the Group was the simplification of the methodology for assessing means for jobseeker's allowance payments, credited PRSI contributions, modification of the eligibility criteria for non-income support based activation and training schemes to enable the self-employed to gain access to such schemes and the role that information campaigns might play in addressing information deficits, particularly with regard to entitlements to jobseeker's allowance and the importance of making voluntary contributions.</p>  <p>  The position in relation to the means assessment applied to self-employed income is that income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings.  Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person's income from one year to the next are taken into consideration.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker's allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant are taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p>  <p>  The primary purpose of PRSI credits is to secure social welfare benefits and pensions of employees by covering gaps in insurance where they are not in a position to pay PRSI such as during periods of unemployment, illness, etc.  The class at which a contributor paid his or her last PRSI contribution determines entitlement to credited contributions.  Credits are usually awarded at the same rate as the person's last paid PRSI contribution.  For example, class A PRSI contributions may entitle a person to all insured DSP benefits, provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions.  Credits are not available to a person who has only class S contributions.</p>  <p>  If income from self-employment falls below &euro;5,000 in a contribution year or a person is unable to work, he or she may opt to pay voluntary contributions.  To become a voluntary contributor a person must:</p>  <p>  -	have paid at least 468 weeks PRSI (since 6 April 2014) in either employment or self-employment,</p>  <p>  -	apply within 12 months of the end of the tax year during which he/she last paid compulsory insurance or were last awarded a credited contribution,</p>  <p>  -	agree to pay voluntary contributions from the start of the contribution week that follows the week in which he/she leaves compulsory insurance.</p>  <p>  -	To become a voluntary contributor on or after 6 April 2015 a person must have previously paid 520 weeks PRSI.</p>  <p>  The annual voluntary contribution charge for the self-employed is a special flat rate payment of &euro;500.  The payment of voluntary contributions allows the self-employed to maintain their PRSI record and qualify for State pension (contributory), widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's contributory pension and guardian's payment (contributory).</p>  <p>Self-employed people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance have access to the full range of activation measures available through the State.  Given the scale of unemployment levels, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.  This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by my Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.  However, many services are available to the formerly self-employed who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.</p>  <p>  Some employment services, such as assistance with job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department's employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status.  Unemployed persons, including the previously self-employed, not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course.  Springboard courses are open to people who were previously self-employed, regardless of their social welfare status.</p>  <p>  The Department undertakes advertising and awareness activities to ensure that all members of the public are made aware of their rights and entitlements and that they are kept informed of significant changes and improvements in schemes and services as they occur. </p>  <p>  Information on the full range of social welfare schemes and services is available from the Department's INTREO/local office network and the nationwide network of Citizens Information Centres.  In addition, many people access information on the Department's and Citizen Information Board's websites.</p>  <p>  My colleagues in Government and I will continue to  reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on the various issues outlined above and will consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.</p></reply>

Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies to provide home insurance cover to specific individuals.  <br/><br/>I contacted Insurance Ireland in relation to this matter and they have informed me that in general terms where there has been no motor insurance in an individual s name and there is a gap of cover of two years or more since their last insurance, the no claims discount is deemed invalid and that in the case of a returning emigrant the same principle would apply.

In Budget 2015, myself and my colleague Minister Coveney published an Agri-Tax Review, overseen by a working group made up of the Department of Finance, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Revenue Commissioners. This review examined agri-taxation measures and made recommendations to ensure resources were directed towards activities of maximum benefit to this sector. It also aimed to ensure tax policy was aligned with the objectives set out in Food Harvest 2020, and analyse the benefits of various tax measures versus the costs. </p>  <p>  The Review included an independent cost benefit analysis, an international benchmarking exercise and a public consultation process. A number of recommendations were made by the working group to maximise the potential of the primary agriculture sector, and as appropriate, most of these were legislated for through the Finance Act 2014. These included measures to increase the mobility and productive use of land, to assist succession and to complement wider agriculture policies and schemes.</p>  <p>  In addition to the taxation measures which are exclusively aimed at the farming community, I would also highlight that farmers are eligible to take part in the Start Your Own Business (SYOB) scheme, introduced by the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013, which provides for relief from Income Tax for long term unemployed individuals who start their own new unincorporated business. The scheme provides an exemption from Income Tax up to a maximum of &euro;40,000 per annum for a period of two years to individuals who set up a qualifying business; having been unemployed for a period of at least 12 months prior to starting the business. The relief is available from the 25 October 2013 to 31 December 2016 and may be claimed on the return of income filed with the Revenue Commissioners.  </p>  <p>  Taking all these elements into consideration, I am not minded to consider the proposal made here.</p></reply>

The Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23% in Ireland, unless there is a provision in the Directive that permits a lower rate.  Settled case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) requires that the limited circumstances in which rates other than the standard rate are used be strictly interpreted and narrowly applied so as not to create or increase divergence of VAT treatment in the EU Member States.  These limited circumstances are set out in the Schedules of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 <br/><br/>Schedule 1 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 lists activities that are exempt from VAT and in respect of which the supplier has no entitlement to deduct input VAT.  Schedule 2 lists supplies that are liable at the zero rate and in respect of which the supplier has an entitlement to deduct input VAT.  Schedule 2 includes international services, human and animal oral medicines, children's clothing and footwear, books and a range of food and drink items.  The range of food products that can benefit from the zero rating is constrained by Article 110 of the VAT Directive which permits the retention of the zero rate for &quot;clearly defined social reasons&quot; where the products were liable to VAT at the zero rate on 1 January 1991.  <br/><br/>Schedule 3 lists the goods and services that are liable to VAT at the reduced rates of 9% and 13.5%.  The goods and services currently liable to VAT at the 9% rate are ones listed in Annex III of the VAT Directive and Ireland was permitted under Article 113 of the Directive to apply a rate lower than 12% to these goods and services.  The goods and services liable to VAT at the 13.5% rate are ones that are not listed in Annex III, but in respect of which Ireland is permitted under Article 118 to retain a reduced rate.  The goods and services to which the 9% rate applies include the supply of food and drink (excluding alcohol, soft drinks and bottled water) in the course of catering<br/><br/>-hot take-away food and hot drinks<br/><br/>-hotel lettings, including guesthouses, caravan parks, camping sites etc.<br/><br/>-admissions to cinemas, theatres, certain musical performances, museums, art gallery exhibitions<br/><br/>-amusement services of the kind normally supplied in fairgrounds or amusement parks <br/><br/>-the provision, by a person other than a non-profit making organisation, of facilities for taking part in sport <br/><br/>-printed matter e.g. newspapers, magazines, brochures, leaflets, programmes, maps, catalogues, printed music (excluding books)<br/><br/>-hairdressing services <br/><br/>The goods and services to which the 13.5% rate applies include:<br/><br/>-The supply of gas, electricity, solid fuel and home heating oil<br/><br/>-The supply of new buildings, concrete block and ready to pour concrete<br/><br/>-The supply of photographic services, agricultural services and photographic services<br/><br/>-The hire of cars and boats<br/><br/>-Beauty services such as facials, nail treatments, tanning and sunbed services<br/><br/>The supply of goods and services not listed in the Schedules to the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 is liable to VAT at the standard rate.  Where a good or service is not specified in the Schedules mentioned then the correct rate is the standard rate. Revenue does have a VAT rates database on its website () that lists thousands of product and services types and gives the correct VAT rate by reference to the Schedules.  <br/><br/>It is widely recognised that there are anomalies in the rates applying to goods and services and I receive Parliamentary Questions concerning particular anomalies from time to time. Under the VAT Directive the apparent anomalies can generally only be eliminated through applying higher rates to goods and services currently liable at the zero- rate or at one of the reduced rates.  I am not planning to undertake such a review at this time.</p></reply>

Support and independent professional advice is available for borrowers in serious debt difficulty through the following channels:<br/><br/>-Insolvency Service of Ireland ()<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>-Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) <br/><br/>Borrowers in difficulty must engage with their lender as early as possible in order to identify the best solution to their debt situation.  This will afford them the protection of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) and ensure that the resolution arrangement that is finally agreed is both affordable and sustainable.  <br/><br/>The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long-term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers. The Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) framework, as set out in the CCMA, outlines the steps which lenders must follow:<br/><br/>Step 1: Communicate with borrower;<br/><br/>Step 2: Gather financial information; <br/><br/>Step 3: Assess the borrower's circumstances; and <br/><br/>Step 4: Propose a resolution.<br/><br/>A lender may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where the lender has made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment arrangement under the Code with the borrower or his/her nominated representative and the specific timeframes set out in the Code have been adhered to or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating <br/><br/>If a borrower is not happy with the way that their lender is dealing with them or if they think they are not complying with the CCMA, the borrower can make a complaint to their lender. <br/><br/>Borrowers can also make an appeal to the lender's Appeals Board if they are not happy with the alternative repayment arrangement offered or where a lender declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement or if they believe they have been wrongly classified as not co-operating.<br/><br/>If the borrower is not happy with the outcome of the appeal/complaint made to the lender they can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO). Further information on how to make a complaint to the FSO is available at .<br/><br/>The strong view of the Government is that, in respect of co-operating borrowers under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), repossession of a person's primary home should only be considered as a last resort. Every effort should be made to agree an acceptable arrangement as an alternative to repossession. Regretfully, however, it must also be accepted that due to the individual circumstances, not all mortgages can be made sustainable and that in these limited circumstances, it will be in the best interests of both parties to resolve the situation in a fair manner.  <br/><br/>Of course, the Central Bank is also working to ensure that banks are fully complying with the codes of conduct.  The Central Bank expects to see that mortgage lenders have taken the letter and spirit of the CCMA seriously. Where the Bank finds evidence of instances of non-compliance, it will continue to hold lenders to account for any deficiencies in their policies and practices in this regard.</p></reply>

There are many types of restructure available for borrowers including interest only mortgages, reduction in the payment amount, temporary deferral of the payment, term extensions and capitalising arrears.<br/><br/>In their most recent release, the Central Bank restructures data shows that split mortgages, term extension and arrears capitalisation are the most common types of arrangement and amount to over half of the total restructures in place.  This shows that engagement works and is delivering results. <br/><br/>If the lender does not offer the borrower an alternative repayment arrangement, for example, where it is concluded that the mortgage is not sustainable, the lender must provide the reasons, in writing, to the borrower. The lender must also inform the borrower that a copy of the most recent Standard Financial Statement (SFS) is available on request, and provide the borrower with details as set out in Para 45 of the CCMA, in writing.<br/><br/>The same information must be given to the borrower if he/she does not accept the alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender.<br/><br/>Under the CCMA, a lender may only commence legal proceedings for repossession of a borrower's primary residence, after the failure of all reasonable efforts to agree an alternative repayment arrangement and in accordance with the timeframes set out in the CCMA.<br/><br/>If a borrower is not happy with the way that the lender is dealing with his/her case or believes that the lender is not complying with the CCMA, the borrower can make a complaint to the lender. <br/><br/>Borrowers can also make an appeal to the lender's Appeals Board if they are not happy with the alternative repayment arrangement offered or if they believe they have been wrongly classified as not co-operating.<br/><br/>If the borrower is not happy with the outcome of the appeal/complaint made to the lender they can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO).

This reflects, inter alia, the effectiveness of  the Irish tax and social welfare system in reducing inequality of market incomes. This is evidenced by the fact that the tax and social welfare system in Ireland reduces the Gini-coefficient (which is a measure of income inequality) by more than any other country in the OECD.</p>  <p>  The tax and social welfare is also highly effective at reducing poverty in Ireland. CSO data show that social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate from 49.8 per cent to 15.2 per cent in 2013. This was one of the highest reductions across the EU Member States in that year. </p>  <p>  These outcomes reflect the highly progressive nature of the Irish tax and social welfare system. For example, the ratio of the tax wedge for an individual at 167% of the average wage compared with an individual at 67% of the average wage, a standard measure of the progressiveness of an income tax system, is the second highest in the OECD.  </p>  <p>  While the tax and welfare system plays an important role in achieving a relatively equal distribution of disposable income, this Government believes that the best way to combat inequality is to encourage job creation and to deliver employment opportunities for those at the bottom of the income distribution. This in turn will help to reduce the level of market income inequality identified in the TASC report.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-19a.200.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015021900030#WRG00300"><p>As the Deputy is aware, employees in the PAYE system benefit from a PAYE income tax credit worth &euro;1,650 per annum, to which the self-assessed are not entitled.  The PAYE allowance, as it was then, was introduced in 1980 to improve the tax progression of PAYE taxpayers and to take account of the fact that the self-employed generally then had the advantage of paying tax on a preceding year basis.  The argument was also made at the time that the general scheme of allowances for expenses discriminated against employees and in favour of other taxpayers.</p>  <p>  There have been some changes since 1980.  For example, the self-employed now pay tax on a current year basis.  In addition, the PAYE allowance has become a tax credit.  However, there are other aspects to how the self-assessed are taxed which can be beneficial to them.  For instance, there are significant timing benefits, depending on the accounting period used by the taxpayer, which are available to the self-assessed but which are not available to PAYE workers.  In addition, the expenses regime for self-assessed taxpayers remains somewhat more liberal than that afforded to employees and therefore the self-employed can actually pay less tax when compared to a PAYE worker on the same income.</p>  <p>  All tax reliefs, incentives and credits are reviewed as part of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process.  However, it is important to note that the changes to the Income Tax system introduced in Budget 2015 benefits all those who pay income tax and or USC equally, regardless of whether they are PAYE or self-assessed taxpayers.</p></reply>

The next phase involves extending the accessible areas and allowing visitors to more easily enter the Castle site.  A key aspect of the work will involve the careful dismantling of a 19th century wall and its reconstruction on a new firmer foundation with the addition of an access door through which members of the public will be able to pass.  This will dramatically improve the current situation.</p>  <p>  This next phase of works is a major conservation project in its own right.  A large amount of preparatory work, design and careful Archaeological investigation and assessment has been carried out and the Minister for Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht has provided the necessary Archaeological Consent required under National Monuments legislation to allow the work to proceed.  All that has been done, to date, at the Castle, though substantial, has been carried out to facilitate the major element that is yet to come.</p>  <p>  The OPW intends to commence the next phase of works at this site in the summer of 2015.  It is not possible just yet to say when all works will be completed.</p></reply>

In relation to the first Independent TDs to receive payment of the allowance, as advised in previous replies on this issue the current data systems in use do not permit detailing the payments prior to 2001.<br/><br/>The legislation sets out the categories of expenditure for which the allowance may be used and provides that it is not liable to income tax.  Under the provisions of the 2014 Act, and with effect from 1 July 2014, the same audit and reporting provisions applicable to Parliamentary Leaders now also apply to Independent Members in receipt of the allowance.  For the first time, Independent Members must record and account to the Standards in Public Office Commission for expenditure from the allowance.<br/><br/>Details of the payments made in the 31st D&aacute;il to each Independent TD up to 2013 are contained in my reply to the Deputy on 16 December 2014 under Question No. 253 (ref. 48134/14).

The Policy Statement highlights that it is essential that entrepreneurs are not inhibited or discouraged by red tape and unnecessary bureaucracy.  The Government has committed to continue with focused work on key areas such as reducing the administrative burdens facing startups, including the length of time it takes to register a new business and the burden of applying for licences.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing to significantly reduce the time and cost of company incorporations.  Over the past three years alone the Companies Registration Office (CRO) has reduced processing time i.e. maximum number of days to register a new company by three days and the cost of registration by one third, achievements due to augmenting its online business registration facility.  In 2013, the average processing time was 13 days.  The target for 2015 is 7 days.  </p>  <p>  My Department's reduction of administrative burdens on business by 25% between 2008 and 2012 will benefit all businesses, but especially startup, micro and small businesses, for whom the burden of regulation is proportionally higher, due to their small size. </p>  <p>  Successful initiatives include:</p>  <p>- Company Law, savings of &euro;82.5 million per annum have already been realised, more than &euro;33 million of which are due to the work of the Companies Registration Office (CRO), as companies can submit their annual returns online via the CRO website and can now use digital signatures for the B1 Form and Accounts.</p>  <p>- In Health &amp;amp; Safety Law, a total of &euro;124 million in annual administrative savings for business has been delivered by the HSA via two key projects: the BeSMART online tool for preparing the Risk Assessment and Safety Statement (&euro;60m), and the SMP20 Guidelines (&euro;64m), which assist construction firms with fewer than 20 employees in establishing and maintaining an effective safety management system.</p>  <p>  An integrated licensing system will also be introduced.  A key goal of the proposed system is to support the licence application process through the provision of a single portal or website through which businesses will be able to apply for, and renew, a multiplicity of licences.  The new licensing system will be developed for the retail sector in the first instance and rolled out to other sectors of the economy thereafter.</p>  <p>  With regard to registering for tax, customer service standards for business tax registration require that 100% of such applications are completed within 5 working days, with the exception of 10 working days for VAT registration applications. In order to facilitate the prompt and efficient registration of business taxes, Revenue's online eRegistration system includes services for the online registration and cancellation of a number of business taxes.  In all applications made through eRegistration with the exception of Value Added Tax (VAT) and Relevant Contract Tax (RCT), registration and risk assessment is an automated process which is completed within a single overnight period.</p></reply>

I intend to prioritise their applications under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation scheme (TAMS), with grant-aid payable at 40%, being introduced under the new RDP.  EU Commission approval is awaited on the proposed schemes under TAMS.</p>  <p>  Under Pillar 1 the Regulation provides that young farmers and new entrants are priority categories under the National Reserve. It also provides scope to include an optional provision whereby Member States may use the National Reserve to allocate new entitlements or give a top-up on the value of existing entitlements for persons who suffer from a 'Specific Disadvantage'.</p>  <p>  As a result of my direction and with the recent agreement of the Commission the group of young farmers who established their holding in 2008 and 2009, but who missed out on both the Young Farmer Installation Scheme which closed to applications in 2008, and the Young Farmer priority category under the National Reserve which includes young farmers who commenced since 2010, can be considered as a 'group suffering from specific disadvantage'.  This development means that these young farmers will be eligible to apply under the 2nd phase of the National Reserve to be given new entitlements or be given a top-up on the value of existing entitlements.</p>  <p>  Application forms will be made available in early April 2015. This is a very welcome outcome that I feel will address an anomaly in the system and allow for fair and equal treatment for this particular category of young active farmers.</p></reply>

These events were attended by over 400 forest owners. Teagasc forestry advisers continue to be available to discuss the issue with forest owners affected.

This includes personnel, Garda vehicles and the various technologies utilised to support frontline Garda&iacute; and intelligence led operations against organised crime.  This process takes account of annual policing priorities determined by me as Minister for Justice in consultation with the Commissioner as provided for under Section 20 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  </p>  <p>  The first intake since 2009 of 100 new recruits entered training at the Garda College, Templemore, on 15th September 2014.  As part of Budget 2015, a further intake of 200 recruits in two batches was announced.  On 15 December 2014, the first 100 of these batches commenced their training and a further 100 entered the college in early February.  This will bring to 300 the number of recruits in the Garda College and is a measure of the Government's commitment to ensure that recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues seamlessly.  The September intake will attest as members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in May 2015 and the December intake will attest in August 2015.  On attestation they will be assigned to Garda stations throughout the country by the Garda Commissioner. </p>  <p>  The strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 31 December 2014, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 12,799.  There were also 1,124 Garda Reserve members, with a further 48 in training.  In addition, there were over 2,000 Garda civilian staff.  I remain in discussion with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the timing of future intakes of Garda recruits.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are continually looking to ensure that the latest information, communications and forensic technologies are sourced and deployed to achieve their strategic objectives as set out in the context of their annual policing plans, as provided for in section 22 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which includes commitments to target individuals and groups engaged in organised criminal activity and terrorism.  This policy is designed to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be in a position to meet the evolving needs of a modern effective police force and take advantage of proven up to date technological developments in crime detection and prevention as they occur.</p>  <p>  In terms of existing technology, the Deputy will be aware that a considerable amount of new Garda ICT solutions has been delivered over the past number of years.  These include the deployment of a secure national digital radio system (NDRS), the deployment and support of Garda and Community CCTV systems, an automated number plate recognition (ANPR) system, and the addition of many new functions to the PULSE system, which itself is further supported by a dedicated Garda data entry service in Castlebar.   </p>  <p>  In the area of forensics the situation is that the Garda authorities currently employ state-of-the-art automated fingerprint and ballistics identification systems which I am informed are at least on a par with those used by police forces in other EU jurisdictions.  The Deputy will also be aware that the forensic capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be further enhanced by a new national DNA database, scheduled to become operational shortly, which was established on foot of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act, 2014.</p>  <p>  I have also clearly signalled my intention to support the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in its efforts to address deficits which were identified in the recent Garda Inspectorate report on crime investigation.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that the issues raised in the report are widespread, varied and far-reaching and, when taken together with the review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Haddington Road agreement, will demand significant structural reform within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The need for additional resources across a number of areas will be examined within that context.  Furthermore, I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Commissioner has commenced an in-depth examination of all recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate Report with a view to determining what can be  implemented in the short, medium and long term.  I also look forward to the significant contribution to this process of reform that will be made by the new policing authority which is to be established shortly.  </p></reply>

The Garda Commissioner, will of course, continue to keep the needs of Kildare Garda Division under review within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.<br/><br/>I remain in discussion with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the timing of future intakes of Garda recruits.<table><tr><th>Garda Station</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th></tr><tr><td>Athy</td><td>27</td><td>29</td><td>31</td><td>34</td><td>32</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Ballytore</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>Closed </td><td>Closed</td></tr><tr><td>Castledermot</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>32</td><td>33</td><td>26</td><td>27</td><td>29</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Monasterevin</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Newbridge</td><td>44</td><td>45</td><td>47</td><td>50</td><td>49</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>Rathangan</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Carbury</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Celbridge</td><td>18</td><td>18</td><td>17</td><td>17</td><td>14</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Kilcock</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Leixlip</td><td>33</td><td>35</td><td>34</td><td>30</td><td>38</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Maynooth</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>13</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Ballymore<br /><br />Eustace</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>Closed</td><td>Closed</td></tr><tr><td>Clane</td><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>9</td><td>8</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Kilcullen</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Kill</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>Closed</td><td>Closed</td></tr><tr><td>Naas</td><td>107</td><td>101</td><td>101</td><td>103</td><td>100</td><td>96</td></tr><tr><td>Robertstown</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr></table></p></reply>

I am in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner in relation to the challenges presented by this type of crime and the Commissioner has outlined the substantial efforts being made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to identify and target those involved.  Such crimes demand a robust response, and this is precisely what is happening.  Garda&iacute; tackle this type of crime through a range of targeted and intelligence based operations, often disrupting and preventing incidents, as well as detecting and prosecuting those involved.<br/><br/>Heavy penalties are provided for weapons offences in our criminal law and mandatory minimum penalties have been introduced for certain firearms offences.  The considerable powers already available to Garda&iacute; have been supplemented further by the DNA Database legislation enacted last year, which  provides for the establishment of a Database which will have the capacity to link suspects to unsolved crimes using forensic evidence, and will greatly assist Garda&iacute; in investigating a whole range serious offences. <br/><br/>The various Garda operations which target armed and organised criminals are complemented and supported by Garda engagement with local communities, including a range of community local fora, to address local concerns relating to crime, community safety and the impact of organised crime on community life.  Support for young persons who may be at risk of becoming involved in crime is particularly evident in the Garda Youth Diversion Programme and in particular the 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects which operate nationwide and which are  funded and overseen by my Department's unit within the Irish Youth Justice Service.  These projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives run by community based organisations in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which aim to reduce youth crime and seek to stop young people from progressing into adult crime.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p></reply>

Garda operations such as Operation Fiacla identify and target prolific offenders and arrangements are in place for the case management of such offenders so that all relevant information is co-ordinated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and available when such persons come before the courts.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that both the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service work through a variety of programmes to address offending behaviour and to promote desistance from future criminal activity.  In this regard my Department has published two studies on recidivism rates for offenders who were given a community sanction or a custodial sentence in recent years.  The findings of these reports, and it is hoped future studies on recidivism rates, provides invaluable information to both the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service in identifying the interventions that are most effective in changing offending behaviour.</p>  <p>  In relation to bail, the Deputy will be aware that a decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions.  There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail because, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.</p>  <p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that the accused person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses or evidence.  Section 2 of the Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, permits the courts to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where refusal of bail is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  A "serious offence" is an offence listed in the Schedule to the Bail Act that is punishable by at least five years imprisonment.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Criminal Justice 1984 as amended by section 22 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 provides that any sentence of imprisonment for an offence committed while on bail shall be consecutive but if imposed in the District Court the aggregate term of imprisonment shall not exceed two years.</p>  <p>  As regards reform of the bail laws, I can inform the Deputy that the preparation of the General Scheme of a Bail Bill to modernise the law on bail is at a very advanced stage and I intend to bring proposals to Government on the matter in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  While the primary aim of the proposed Bail Bill is to consolidate and update bail law, I wish to take the opportunity to seek, as far as is possible, within the constraints of the Constitution and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, to focus the legislation on the protection of the individual and of the public.  The intention is that the new provisions will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.  The new Bill will seek to improve the operation of the bail system and make the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against the commission of offences by persons on bail.</p>  <p>  In relation to the information sought about crimes committed while on bail, I have asked the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency responsible for the publication of crime statistics, to provide relevant information directly to the Deputy. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-19a.327.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015021900035#WRM02200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 121, 122 and 125 together.</p>  <p>  I should say initially that my Department is not aware of any reliable basis for the figure quoted in the Deputy's question as representing the number of illegal firearms here.</p>  <p>  In light of public safety concerns highlighted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a joint Department of Justice and Equality/An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Working Group was established by the Department of Justice and Equality to review firearms licensing.  The report of this Working Group was published on 13 November 2014 and submissions on the report were sought from stakeholders and the public by 31 January 2015.  The consultation process gave individuals and groups an opportunity to contribute to the development of firearms policy and legislation and will enable consideration to be given to the future direction of such legislation.</p>  <p>  The submissions received are currently being examined and incorporated into a report for me.  The Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality  has also sought submissions and held hearings with interested parties in relation to the Working Party report. It is expected that their report on the issue will be available in a number of weeks.</p>  <p>  I understand the Deputy's Question No 122 relates to what effects, if any, proposed changes to firearms licensing will have on firearms dealers.  I wish to advise that the majority of licensed and licensable shotguns and rifles in this State will not be affected by the proposals to amend the firearms licensing system.</p>  <p>  The issue of compensation which the Deputy raises is dealt with at Section 13 of the Working Group Report.  The report states that the Courts have held that the possession of a firearm is not a right but a privilege.  The Courts have in the past taken the view that what is in the State's gift cannot be required to be compensated if it is withdrawn.</p>  <p>  I have  already given a commitment that I will not make any final decisions until I have considered all the submissions which have been made and have met the key stakeholders, including the organisations who represent those who use firearms for sporting purposes.  These meetings will take place following receipt and consideration of both my Department's and the Oireachtas Committee reports.</p>  <p>  I have asked the Garda Commissioner for a report in relation to specific measures being taken to tackle illegal firearms.  I will reply further to the Deputy when that information becomes available. </p></reply>

He will appreciate, however, that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on any specific crimes which are currently under Garda investigation.</p>  <p>  It is unfortunately the case that gun crime has for some time been an inherent part of organised criminal activity in Ireland, as it is in other similar jurisdictions.  I am in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner in relation to the challenges presented by this type of crime and the Commissioner has outlined the substantial efforts being made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to identify and target those involved. Such crimes demand a robust response, and this is precisely what is happening.  Garda&iacute; tackle this type of crime through a range of targeted and intelligence based operations, often disrupting and preventing incidents, as well as detecting and prosecuting those involved.</p>  <p>  A range of Garda operations is in place to target and confront armed and organised criminals.  In addition to these enforcement measures, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also engage extensively with communities in a range of fora to address local concerns relating to crime and community safety, including the impact that organised crime can have at a community level.</p>  <p>  Heavy penalties are provided for weapons offences in our criminal law and mandatory minimum penalties have been introduced for certain firearms offences. The considerable powers already available to Garda&iacute; have been supplemented further by the DNA Database legislation enacted last year, which  provides for the establishment of a Database which will have the capacity to link suspects to unsolved crimes using forensic evidence, and will greatly assist Garda&iacute; in investigating a whole range serious offences.</p>  <p>  I should also advise the Deputy that, in view of public safety concerns raised by the Garda Commissioner, a joint Review of operational, legislative and administrative issues governing firearms licensing was conducted by my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The report of this working group review was published in November 2014 and submissions on the report were sought from stakeholders and the public by 31 January 2015.  The submissions received are currently being examined and incorporated into a report for my attention.</p></reply>

Subsequently a decision was made to re-allocate the ten families to Tusla services.<br/><br/>Tusla's primary concern was that no families would be inconvenienced or left without a service. The service was not terminated until this re-allocation had taken place and the Social Work service was informed throughout the process.<br/><br/>In relation to the Galway and Roscommon, Tusla will be commissioning a new Family Support Service in these areas and Empowerment Plus have been invited to tender for this contract.</p></reply>

An additional &euro;4m was allocated in 2014 to assist in implementing the Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  Further investment of &euro;4 million will also be made to support the development of therapy services in 2015 (equating to &euro;6 million in a full year).

As the Deputy is aware, one of my  Department's  priorities for 2015 is to get all of the Hospital Groups up and running as single cohesive entities. </p>  <p>  A key step in this regard will be the development of Hospital Group Strategic Plans.  The Strategic Advisory Group, established to provide objective advice and expertise on the implementation of Hospital Groups, is currently finalising a guidance paper on developing the strategic plans.  This guidance will  ensure a coherent approach nationally and  will  be provided to the Hospital Group Chairs to inform  and assist them in developing their  strategic plans in 2015.  I  understand  that the Systems Reform Division in the HSE has also been engaging with the Group Chairs and Group CEOs and will be providing them with assistance in the development of their plans.</p>  <p>  Essentially, in developing their plans, Hospital Groups will be expected to demonstrate a co-ordinated approach to the planning and delivery of services within and across the hospital groups, with an increased focus on small hospitals managing routine urgent or planned care locally and more complex care managed in the larger hospitals and appropriate deployment of staff is key to achieving this.  Hospital Groups are subject to the Employment Control Framework and Public Service Pay Policy in respect of staff numbers, pay, terms, conditions and other relevant matters.  However, as part of the drive to empower management, encourage innovation and ensure autonomy with real accountability, it is intended that the HSE will devolve authority to the Hospital Groups to recruit and deploy staff across the Group.</p></reply>

Since 2009 all nursing homes - public, voluntary and private have been registered and inspected by HIQA.</p>  <p>  The functions of the Minister for Health in relation to HIQA, and the Chief Inspector of Social Services are prescribed in the Act, and in this respect the Chief Inspector is independent in the exercise of these functions.</p>  <p>  As regulator, HIQA&rsquo;s remit operates at the level of facilities rather than that of individual complaints, but the requirements at facility level impact very directly on how individual cases are dealt with.</p>  <p>  Nursing home operators must ensure that all reasonable measures are taken to protect residents from all forms of abuse.  These measures include staff training in relation to the detection and prevention of and responses to abuse.  Any incident or allegation of abuse must be investigated and operators must have policies and procedures in place for the prevention, detection and response to abuse.  Furthermore, they must notify HIQA of any allegation of abuse or serious adverse incidents that occur in a nursing home.</p>  <p>  All nursing homes are required to have an accessible and effective complaints procedure, including an appeals process. They must investigate all complaints promptly, and following investigation put in place any measures required for improvement.  Records of complaints made are required to be kept.  These are available for inspection, thus enabling the HIQA inspector to determine whether the complaints system is sufficiently robust. </p>  <p>  HIQA takes into account and uses all information received to inform and plan its regulatory activity, and information on individual cases can provide useful pointers in this context.  HIQA&rsquo;s programme of both scheduled and unannounced inspections helps to ensure that standards are maintained and where issues of non-compliance arise, that these are addressed and rectified.  If a nursing home is found not to be in compliance with the Regulations it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status. HIQA also has wide discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of registration on nursing homes.</p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with both HIQA and the service providers, is working on an ongoing basis to improve and update the requirements that apply to nursing home care. Any request from HIQA for an extension of their remit on the lines suggested by the Deputy will be carefully considered. </p>  <p>  I would also like to point out that  Ireland has a highly developed and effective system in place in relation to elder abuse. In particular, within the HSE there are 30 Senior Case Workers for the Protection of Older People who assess all referrals of alleged abuse reported to them.</p></reply>

However, as the aircraft in question did not at any time enter Irish sovereign airspace there was no requirement to seek permission in accordance with the Order.</p>  <p>  The aircraft were in an area for which the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) has responsibility for the provision, operation and management of air navigation services for civil aviation.  In the discharge of its operational mandate, pursuant to the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993, issues relating to entry into Irish controlled airspace are accordingly a matter for the IAA, which operates under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Given this mandate and the potential impact of this incident on civil aviation, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the IAA monitored this incident closely. </p>  <p>  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has since relayed its concerns about the incident to the International Civil Aviation Organisation.  It is emphasised that the IAA coordinated closely with its UK counterparts at all stages during the incident so as to avoid a risk to any civil aircraft during the incident.  Although there was no such risk on this occasion, such non-notified and non-controlled flight activity is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport consulted with me and with other members of the Government in relation to the incident and on the development of an agreed response.</p>  <p>  As part of that agreed response, and at my instruction, a senior official from my Department met with the Russian Ambassador.  The official conveyed the serious concerns of the Government about the unacceptable safety risk which could be posed by non-notified and non-controlled flight activity.  The Ambassador undertook to bring the concerns expressed to the attention of his authorities in Moscow.</p></reply>

The document includes features which communicate simply and effectively what is delivered across Government to achieve Ireland's foreign policy goals.<br/><br/>As I outlined in my foreword to the review, through our foreign policy we safeguard our peace, security and economic prosperity, and promote reconciliation and cooperation at home.  At the core of this foreign policy are the protection of our citizens and the promotion of our values abroad.  The Global Island considers the challenges and opportunities for Ireland's foreign policy under five interconnected themes: Our People, Our Values, Our Prosperity, Our Place in Europe and Our Influence.<br/><br/><i>The Global Island</i>is the result of a wide-ranging process of consultation involving other Departments, State agencies, the Oireachtas, civil society and members of the public.  I will be bringing forward a series of initiatives to implement the vision and goals set out in review in the period ahead.<br/><br/>The electronic version of the review was prioritised both to reduce costs and ensure broad accessibility, including overseas.  This version was made available from the launch date in accessible electronic formats in both official languages and eReader versions will be available shortly.  A limited print run of <i>The Global Island </i>was commissioned and is being distributed to key contacts and decision-makers at home and abroad. <br/><br/>The total cost for the production of the Foreign Policy Review is estimated at &euro;40,069.  This includes design, layout and preparation of both English and Irish versions as well as printing, translation and electronic versions in both official languages.  As some items have yet to be invoiced, the cost outlined is approximate at this stage. </p></reply>

The attack took place in the village of Ngouboua, on the shores of Lake Chad.  Reports suggest that the militants killed and wounded a number of Chadians and destroyed most of the village before being pushed back by the Chadian army.</p>  <p>  I utterly condemn the appalling acts of violence being perpetrated in Nigeria and its neighbouring countries by Boko Haram.  These include the recent killing of a large number of civilians in an attack by militants in the north-eastern state of Borno in Nigeria.  I share the horror at reports of the group's use of innocent young children to carry primed explosives.  I have previously also condemned the abduction of more than 200 young girls from a school in the Nigerian town of Chibok last April.</p>  <p>  The attack in Chad, as well as the recent attacks on Kerawa in Cameroon and Diffa in Niger, confirm the regional nature of the threat now posed by Boko Haram and the need to tackle it on a regional basis.  The EU Foreign Affairs Council, which I attended in Brussels last week, noted that the responsibility to address the immediate security challenge lies primarily with the countries most affected, and called upon them to urgently intensify cooperation and coordination.  The Council commended the Chadian army's recent assistance to the Cameroonian forces already engaged in the fight against Boko Haram.  We also welcomed the decision of the States in the region, endorsed by the African Union, to deploy a multinational force, which will also be endorsed by the UN Security Council.  Experts from Cameroon, Chad, Niger, Nigeria and Benin met at Yaound&eacute;, Cameroon, from 5-7 February to finalise operational issues for the multinational force.</p>  <p>  The Council also expressed concern about the humanitarian consequences of the Boko Haram attacks on Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger and pledged to continue providing immediate relief to those in need and to increase supports at regional level.  Ireland provided &euro;1 million in December 2014 to the UNHCR to support its work for Nigerian refugees in Chad. </p></reply>

The upsurge in violence and the increasing number of casualties, in particular innocent civilians caught up in the fighting, has been deeply troubling.</p>  <p>  I welcome the agreement reached in Minsk on 12 February, following all-night talks involving Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande, President Poroshenko and President Putin. The package of measures signed by the parties to the conflict offers hope for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine, which has claimed over 5,400 lives and forced almost a million people to flee their homes. The agreement provides for a ceasefire and withdrawal of heavy weapons in eastern Ukraine.  It also provides a timetable for the implementation of key parts of the September Minsk Agreements, including those relating to elections, border control and prisoner exchange.</p>  <p>  The true test of last week's accord will be in its full implementation.  The ceasefire came into effect at midnight on Saturday, and the OSCE has reported that it is largely holding, except in the Debaltseve area where attacks continue. It is crucial that the parties abide by their commitments to end the fighting as the next step involves the withdrawal of heavy weapons and it is important that this process begins without delay.</p>  <p>  A comprehensive and lasting ceasefire remains central to a de-escalation of the conflict. I support the calls on Russia to exercise its influence on the separatists to fully implement the commitments they entered into in Minsk.</p>  <p>  At the informal European Council held on 12 February, Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande briefed EU leaders on the outcome of the Minsk talks. President Poroshenko also addressed the meeting and provided a realistic assessment of what was agreed. Leaders assured President Poroshenko of the EU's full backing for his efforts to restore peace in Ukraine and to maintain its sovereignty and territorial integrity. They also considered practical ways of supporting implementation of the agreement, including through further humanitarian assistance and strengthening of the OSCE Mission.</p>  <p>  Unity and consistency has characterised the EU's actions in response of the Ukrainian crisis to date. It is crucial that this unity is maintained as it is key to our influence and our effectiveness.</p>  <p>  We have consistently stated that there can be no military solution to the crisis in Ukraine.  The initiative undertaken by Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande was aimed at reviving the September Minsk Agreements and bringing an end to the current spiral of violence. The focus must now be on implementing the commitments in last week's accord, including the withdrawal of heavy weapons. Providing lethal military equipment would risk undermining these diplomatic efforts to find a political resolution to the crisis.</p></reply>

Third level institutions are autonomous bodies and it is therefore a matter for the institution to determine the rate of fee payable by students (EU or non-EU).</p>  <p>  However, in the case of students who do not meet the residency clause, higher education institutions have been requested to charge the more moderate EU fee to EU/EEA/Swiss nationals who have completed at least five academic years of study (Primary or Post-Primary level) in the EU/EEA or Switzerland.</p></reply>

That increase has provided funding for 1,700 additional teachers and SNAs to be recruited for our schools, as well as funding important reforms. However, it was not possible to secure the funding which would be required to also increase the rates of capitation paid to our schools. <br/><br/>The school funding measures introduced in Budget 2011 provided for a 5% reduction in funding for capitation and related grants to primary and second level schools. This was applied to schools by a 5% reduction across the range of per capita grants.<br/><br/>The multi annual school funding measures introduced in Budget 2012, provided for a 6% overall reduction in the funding for capitation and related grants to primary and second level schools. The reduction was introduced on a phased basis and applied by a 2% reduction in 2012 and 2013 and a further reduction of 1% in 2014 and 2015.<br/><br/>In total these measures have resulted in primary school per capita funding being reduced by &euro;38 per pupil since 2011 and post primary per capita funding being reduced by &euro;66 per pupil since 2011.<br/><br/>I am determined that education will be prioritised for further investment in future years, and I believe that increasing the staffing and funding of our schools should be priorities for such investment.<br/><br/>The attached table contains a breakdown of the annual per capita grants rates as requested by the Deputy.<table><tr><td>-</td><td>Voluntary Post Primary</td><td>Primary</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Capitation</th><th>SSSF</th><th>SSSF Secretary</th><th>SSSF Caretaker</th><th>Secretary</th><th>Caretaker</th><th>Capitation</th><th>Ancillary </th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>&euro;345.00 </td><td>&euro;  212.00 </td><td>&euro;25.39 </td><td>&euro;19.05 </td><td>&euro;38.10 </td><td>&euro;31.75 </td><td>&euro;200.00 </td><td>&euro;  155.00 </td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;328.00 </td><td>&euro;  201.00 </td><td>&euro;24.00 </td><td>&euro;18.00 </td><td>&euro;36.00 </td><td>&euro;30.00 </td><td>&euro;190.00 </td><td>&euro;  147.00 </td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;317.00 </td><td>&euro;  201.00 </td><td>&euro;24.00 </td><td>&euro;18.00 </td><td>&euro;36.00 </td><td>&euro;30.00 </td><td>&euro;178.00 </td><td>&euro;  147.00 </td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;306.00 </td><td>&euro;  201.00 </td><td>&euro;24.00 </td><td>&euro;18.00 </td><td>&euro;36.00 </td><td>&euro;30.00 </td><td>&euro;176.00 </td><td>&euro;  147.00 </td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;301.00 </td><td>&euro;  201.00 </td><td>&euro;24.00 </td><td>&euro;18.00 </td><td>&euro;36.00 </td><td>&euro;30.00 </td><td>&euro;173.00 </td><td>&euro;  147.00 </td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;296.00 </td><td>&euro;  201.00 </td><td>&euro;24.00 </td><td>&euro;18.00 </td><td>&euro;36.00 </td><td>&euro;30.00 </td><td>&euro;170.00 </td><td>&euro;  147.00 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

In addition, section 28 of the Litter Pollution Acts provides that a dog warden, within the meaning of the Control of Dogs Act 1986, may issue a notice or on-the-spot fine to an individual believed of committing a prescribed offence under the Act. It is also open to a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a litter warden under the Litter Pollution Acts 1997-2009 to issue a notice where an offence is believed to have been committed. Local Authority Performance Indicators, including those pertaining to litter enforcement, are available at: .<br/><br/>I am of the view that there are sufficient penalties in place under the Litter Pollution Acts and that the powers are conferred on appropriate personnel to deal with the issue of dog fouling, when enforced, and I have no plans to introduce further legislation at this time. I believe that raising awareness of the litter problem and educating our young people is key to effecting a long-term change in society's attitudes towards litter disposal. Ultimately, however, it is the responsibility of each individual to ensure that they play their part in preserving the environment for others through the responsible disposal of their litter, including in relation to dog fouling.</p></reply>

Rents for houses were 4.3% higher while apartment rents were 7.3% higher than in the same quarter of 2013. In Dublin, which is seeing the highest rates of increase nationally, overall rents were higher by 9.5% although the rate of annual increase was down slightly.<br/><br/>A report by DKM Economic Consultants, Rent Stability in the Private Rented Sector commissioned by the PRTB and published last autumn considered a number of options in relation to rent control, including a rent cap. A review of the literature for the report found that in every jurisdiction where it was introduced, a rent cap led to a reduction in the supply of rental units due to an increase in demand for the 'lower' priced units. As the main reason behind increasing rents is a shortfall in housing supply, caution must be exercised in relation to measures which, <i>prima facie</i>, would seem to offer a solution.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, the main cause of rising rents is a lack of supply in the market. The implementation of the range of actions under the Government's Construction 2020 Strategy will support increased supply in the wider housing market. New house completions in 2014 amounted to 11,016 units nationally, up 33% on the 2013 figure. Similarly, in the third quarter of 2014 planning permissions were granted for 2,144 dwelling units, compared with 1,409 units for the same period in 2013 - an increase of 52%.<br/><br/>In addition the recently published Social Housing Strategy 2020 sets out clear, measurably actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list. In 2015 we will provide over 7,000 new social housing units and a further 8,400 units will be secured under the HAP scheme.<br/><br/>The Government is monitoring the rental market closely and is considering policy options in relation to achieving greater rent certainty. The options put forward in the DKM report form part of these considerations.</p></reply>

There is no commercial production of oil in the Irish offshore. The revenue generated for the State from the production from these gas fields is received in the form of acreage rental fees, royalty payments (with the exception of the Seven Heads Gas field) and corporation tax.</p>  <p>  Profits from the three producing gas fields are taxed at a corporation rate of 25% (double the standard rate of corporation tax for trading income). In addition, royalties from the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields are payable to the State at a rate of 12.5% of the fair market value of the gas at the well head. The combination of tax, royalties and acreage rental fees currently provides for a State take of 40% of net income from these two fields.</p>  <p>  Royalties are not payable on production from the Seven Heads Gas field as Ireland moved away from a royalty based payments system to a tax based system in 1987.</p>  <p>  The direct financial return to the State from the Corrib gas field, which is expected to come into production in 2015, will be through acreage rental fees and the 25% corporation tax on profits.</p>  <p>  In June 2014 Government approval was received to revise Ireland's oil and gas fiscal terms along the lines recommended by international energy consultants Wood Mackenzie. A key recommendation of Wood Mackenzie was that tax rates in respect of new licences should be revised to ensure a higher share for the State from the most profitable fields. This would result in the application of maximum rate of 55% in the case of new licences. My Department is working with the Department of Finance and Revenue Commissioners to give operational effect to this approach.</p>  <p>  The acreage rental fees figure for 2012, 2013 and 2014 for the three producing gas fields were, respectively &euro;0.77 million, &euro;0.73 million and &euro;0.77 million. The forecast acreage rental fees figure for the three gas fields for 2015 is &euro;0.77 million.</p>  <p>  The royalties received in 2012, 2013 and 2014 from the two gas producing fields were, respectively, &euro;3.96 million, &euro;4.59 million and &euro;1.98 million. The forecast royalty figure for the two gas fields for 2015 is &euro;1.5 million.</p>  <p>  The amount paid in taxation in respect of Ireland's producing gas fields is a matter between the companies concerned and the Revenue Commissioners and not one in respect of which I have a function.</p>  <p>  Several factors impact on the level of State take from a producing gas field, such as the wholesale price of gas, which is subject to significant movement over time, as are production levels. As such attempting to accurately estimate State receipts in the next five years and beyond would be a speculative exercise.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.<br/><br/>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades. Approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years. These very significant investments represent a step change in the quality of broadband services available.<br/><br/>A public consultation on a national high speed coverage map 2016 which was launched last November, closed on the 12th February. 27 submissions have been received to date and will be assessed over the coming weeks in terms of the overall intervention strategy. The map continues to be available at . The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016. The AMBER areas show the target areas for the State intervention.<br/><br/>The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises or home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. It also provides detailed information on over 50,000 townlands throughout the entire country including Counties Cavan and Monaghan.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will be also delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.<br/><br/>In tandem with the mapping consultation, intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy. The strategy will address a range of issues in relation to the intervention including the optimum procurement model, ownership model for the infrastructure and likely market impact. <br/><br/>Following a public consultation process on the draft Intervention Strategy during next summer, I hope to move to formal procurement phase towards the end of this year in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders. <br/><br/>The Department will design a tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost of the network build as low as possible. I anticipate that the first homes and businesses will be connected in 2016 and connections will continue thereafter, with the intention of having all premises connected within a 5 year period.<br/><br/>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government. It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland.</p></reply>

The IAA coordinated closely with its UK counterparts and there was no risk to commercial aircraft operating in the area during the incident.  The Russian aircraft did not enter Irish sovereign airspace (over the land territory of the State and 12 nautical miles from the Irish coast) at any time but were in an area under IAA air traffic control (which extends to 256 nautical miles from the Irish coast). The Russian aircraft were approximately 50 nautical miles from the Irish coast at their nearest point.</p>  <p>  In line with International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) rules, it is normal practice for the IAA to be informed by the relevant State of any military flights operating in Irish controlled airspace. Ensuring the application of this practice is an important consideration and as this did not occur in this particular instance my Department has raised the issue with ICAO and outlined concerns arising.</p></reply>

No. 477 of 2006), the Road Safety Authority (RSA) has overall responsibility for the operation, oversight, development, quality assurance and delivery of the National Car Testing Service (NCTS). </p>  <p>  I understand from the Road Safety Authority (RSA) that any car owner should receive an NCT appointment within 28 days and that in order to meet this standard, in some cases, the National Car Testing Service (NCTS) holds requests on a waiting list until a suitable slot is found. In the majority of cases, customers are given a slot within the required timescale. </p>  <p>  The RSA has also repeatedly emphasised that the availability of appointments on the NCTS website is not a reflection of the total number of test slots available to customers. If a person requires an early test, they should follow the advice on that website which clearly advises that if a suitable slot cannot be obtained online, to contact the NCTS call centre directly on (01) 413 5992 or to log a request for an appointment through the website.</p>  <p>  The RSA is encouraging people to book early, as the test may be undertaken up to 90 days in advance of the due test date without affecting the expiry date of the new certificate. This system is to ensure that owners have ample time to have their vehicle tested before their current NCT certificate expires. </p>  <p>  Enforcement of the relevant legislation is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. If a person's NCT test date is imminent, it will be a matter for the Garda&iacute; to use their discretion. However, responsibility rests with owners and users of vehicles to ensure their vehicles are in compliance with the law.</p></reply>

The funds available under that the programme are fully committed to the end of 2016.  Accordingly, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is unable to accept new applications for funding.</p>  <p>  The point at which F&aacute;ilte Ireland will be in a position to consider new proposals for capital funding is dependent on the annual estimates and budgetary process but I am hopeful that we will be in a position to progress a range of developments as funding becomes available in coming years.</p>  <p>  Similarly, all transport funding available to my Department for the delivery of greenways is  fully committed to end 2016.  </p>  <p>  However, given the success of greenways already delivered, I feel optimistic that funding may become available from other sources over the coming years.  The EU Structural Funds Programme 2014-2020 is currently being finalised and there may be significant opportunities for cycle infrastructure development under Interreg and the Rural Development Programme. I would also encourage Local Authorities and Community Groups seeking to promote Greenways to see if funding from LEADER companies may be available.</p>  <p>  I am also encouraging Local Authorities to attempt, where possible from within their own resources, to bring their plans for Greenways through Part 8 planning so that, when funding does come available again, they will be best positioned to apply for funding.</p></reply>

Accordingly I have referred the question to the agency for direct reply.  Please contact my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 days.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that the route of the Wild Atlantic Way was developed with the assistance of consultants, Paul Hogarth and Company and, using a collaborative approach, regional steering groups were also convened to inform route development. The steering groups comprised F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Local Authorities, local LEADER and Development companies and other key agencies such as Udar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, the Western Development Commission and others as relevant to each particular region.</p>  <p>  For those communities that are not on the route it is important to note that the actual route is not simply a touring route but is rather a means to guide and attract visitors, and that all villages, businesses and geographic areas within close proximity of the route are in essence part of the geography of the Wild Atlantic Way.  The purpose of the Wild Atlantic Way is to give guidance to visitors as to what there is to see on our western coast, and provide easy access to a range of experiences along the route and so enable local businesses to take advantage of the benefits of the Wild Atlantic Way. My advice to communities on and near to the Wild Atlantic Way is to focus on how to use the route to generate more tourism revenue and not to focus on specific details of the route.</p></reply>

However, local authorities have the option of applying a 30 km/h - the lowest special speed limit under the current legislation - where they feel it is appropriate.  I have been active in encouraging local authorities to adopt this 30 km/h limit where possible.  Earlier this month, I made an addition &euro;2 million available in funding to this end.</p>  <p>  The House this week debated a Private Members Bill to amend the legislation on speed limits, proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies.  That Bill proposed a 20 km/h speed limit for residential roads, and a new 20 km/h special speed limit.  As I indicated in the debate on that Bill, I can agree in principle to a 20 km/h limit, but am concerned about the practical implications of making it obligatory.</p>  <p>  Further work on the practicalities  and implications of such a change is, I believe, also necessary, in order to be sure that we get the legislation right.</p>  <p>  Work is now underway on the drafting of a Road Traffic Bill 2015, the General Scheme of which was approved by the Government last week.  I intend to examine the issue of speed limits in residential areas with a view to including proposals in that Bill.</p></reply>

Both are protected under the EU Habitats Directive and Ireland is obliged to monitor their populations and report to the European Commission on their conservation status. A standardised monitoring programme has been in place for both species since 2009. The most recent report on their conservation status was submitted to the European Commission in June 2013 and is available on the website .<br/><br/>The current national minimum population estimate for Grey Seal, derived from survey data gathered in 2009-2012, is 7,284-9,365 animals. There is some evidence of a modest level of population growth in this species over the past 10 years. Overall, however, numbers in Ireland remain low compared with the UK.<br/><br/>Comprehensive nationwide surveys for the Harbour Seal have been undertaken on two occasions - in 2003 and 2011-2012 - in order to provide minimum population estimates for the country as a whole and to update information on the national distribution of the species. The 2011-2012 data produced a national minimum estimate of 3,489 Harbour Seals. While this is slightly higher than the 2003 estimate, variability in breeding success between sites and between years does not allow for a robust population trend to be determined at this stage.<br/><br/>Seals have a broad diet which varies depending on fish species availability. Studies of the interactions between seals and salmon are ongoing at Inland Fisheries Ireland. The outcomes of this research, together with recently published studies from Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Marine Institute concerning seal depredation (fish eaten by seals during fisheries operations) and bycatch of seals in set nets, will require careful consideration. All of these studies will continue to inform policy in relation to seal protection.</p></reply>

These have focused on events commemorating for example, aspects of the Irish Revolutionary Period including the Home Rule Bill; Cumann na mBan; the Howth gun-running, the 1916 Rising, as well as events to commemorate the outbreak and progress of World War 1.</p>  <p>  My Department has received proposals to support many events and programmes and it is not possible to support them all, and this is the position in this case. It should be noted that the outline proposal was raised with the Expert Advisory Group of historians on 27 January last.</p>  <p>  My Department is issuing a reply to the person concerned.</p></reply>

This Fund, which will be administered through the local authorities, encourages the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and helps to secure the preservation of protected structures, which might otherwise be lost. The Fund is open to two applications per local authority, of which only one application may be in respect of a publicly-owned building. The amount of funding available per project will be subject to a minimum level of &euro;15,000 and a maximum level of &euro;60,000.  Final details of projects funded will be made available once all applications are received by the local authorities and assessed by my Department.  Since 2011, over 100 structures have been safeguarded for the future as a result of the Structures at Risk Fund.<br/><br/>The remainder of my Department's built heritage capital budget for 2015 will be focused on the conservation and presentation of the State's heritage portfolio, which is managed by the Office of Public Works. <br/><br/>In the published Revised Estimates for Public Services 2015, funding of &euro;4.743m was allocated to the Heritage Council to supports its functions under the Heritage Act 1995, in its role of supporting heritage infrastructure, promoting pride and best practice in conservation and sustainable heritage management. It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports in 2015 and future years, having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.<br/><br/>In 2014 my Department was provided with a special allocation of &euro;5m from Capital Stimulus funding for a new Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme to assist with works to safeguard structures, in private and civic ownership, protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000, as amended. A total of &euro;15m was invested in 540 historic structures across the country and information provided by the local authorities indicates that 175 jobs were created as a result of this scheme. The operation of a similar scheme in the future would be contingent on dedicated funding being made available to my Department.</p></reply>
