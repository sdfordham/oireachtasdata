Following placement of the awards, the revised programmes will be validated by QQI, and implemented during 2015.<br/><br/>  The establishment and development of new apprenticeships will be guided by the ongoing implementation of the recommendations from the recent Review of Apprenticeship in Ireland, as outlined in the implementation plan published by my Department last June.  I have recently appointed a new Apprenticeship Council to manage a call for proposals from enterprise and education and training partners for the development of new apprenticeships.</p></reply>

My Department's opinion was that the level of investment required across both sectors could be greater.  However, an up to date quantification of the amount required has not been undertaken.  <br/><br/>  In light of the very difficult economic situation and the significant costs involved in fully implementing the EPSEN Act, the previous Government deferred the full implementation of EPSEN.<br/><br/>It is intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.</p></reply>

I have also recently met with the Minister for Business and Employment, Gerald Nash, to discuss the progress on this new legislation.<br/><br/>  In relation to the on-going dispute at the site referred to by the Deputy I understand that both parties have been invited to attend a hearing in the Labour Court on the 16th December, which I welcome.  I would urge both the contractor and UNITE to now engage meaningfully with the Labour Court with a view to reaching a resolution.</p></reply>

Further the survey found that on average about two thirds of parents pay a voluntary contribution.<br/><br/>  The Deputy will be aware that voluntary contributions by parents are permissible provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition. <br/><br/>  The manner in which contributions are sought and collected is a matter for school management; however their collection should be such as not to create a situation where either parents or pupils could reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character. <br/><br/>  I have no plans to alter this position provided schools ensure that the contributions are sought in manner that makes this clear to all concerned.</p></reply>

Given that the last of the Budget 2012 phased increases in pupil thresholds has been implemented the overall number of one teacher schools should now start to stabilise. <br/><br/>  In relation to the 44 schools in the current school year, 6 of those are schools newly established to meet demographic need and will therefore grow in size quickly.  26 of the schools have a school of the same patronage within an 8km distance of it.  Of the remaining 12 schools, four are on islands and four are Church of Ireland.  I am providing a table for the Deputy setting out the breakdown of the ethos for each year.<br/><br/>  The Government recognises the importance of small schools to rural communities.  However, this does not mean that they can be exempt from the budgetary measures that have contributed to putting our public finances on a more sustainable basis.  <table><tr><th>2011/12</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>CATHOLIC</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>CHURCH OF IRELAND</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>MULTI DENOMINATIONAL</td><td>1</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>2012/13</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>CATHOLIC</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>MULTI DENOMINATIONAL</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>CHURCH OF IRELAND</td><td>1</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>2013/14</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>CATHOLIC</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>CHURCH OF IRELAND</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>MULTI DENOMINATIONAL</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>PRESBYTERIAN</td><td>1</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>2014/15</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>CATHOLIC</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>CHURCH OF IRELAND</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>MULTI DENOMINATIONAL</td><td>6</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The funds being transferred to the schools must be spent on the physical infrastructure of the school or on items of furniture and equipment for educational use including IT related equipment. <br/><br/>  The annual calendar of grants circulated by the Central Funds Section in my Department features the grants that are issued by that Section.

The purpose of these reforms is to protect the educational and consumer interests of genuine international students, to tackle abuse of the labour market and the immigration regime and to safeguard the strong international reputation of high-quality Irish education providers.  <br/><br/>  These reforms have three main pillars.  The first pillar is a new list of eligible programmes, the second pillar is an enhanced inspection and compliance regime and the third pillar relates to changes to the operation of the work concession. <br/><br/>  It is expected that these reforms will significantly enhance the overall quality of Ireland's international education offering, reduce the risk to our reputation from the activities of lower quality operators and enhance the net benefits of internationalisation to the labour market and the wider economy.  Officials from our two Departments are co-operating closely on the implementation of these reforms.</p></reply>

This priority commitment was most recently demonstrated in Budget 2015, where my priority was to provide funding to maintain class sizes and to ensure that the education system could recruit more teachers.  As a result, almost 1,400 additional teachers will be taken on in primary and post-primary schools next year.  This includes some 900 new classroom teachers and 480 new resource teachers.  There were no increases in staffing schedules in schools.  The Budget also provided for an increase of 365 on the existing cap on numbers of Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) posts.  By the end of 2015 there will be some 63,470 teachers and 11,330 SNAs in our schools.  Funding provision has also been made to provide the additional school places needed to meet the increased demand and to progress the reform agenda in education.</p></reply>

These supports include ongoing provision of funding for the principal, teaching and special needs assistant staff as well as the standard supplementary funding for schools. <br/><br/>  I can confirm that this funding will continue to be provided for the 2014/15 school year, and beyond. <br/><br/>  I understand that some campus land, excluding the 2 school buildings, is currently on the market.

At a meeting on 19th November between myself and the Unions there was again little movement by the Unions.<br/><br/>  The Teacher Unions have decided to strike on 2nd December, with a further event being proposed for January. I have said publicly, and will repeat again here today, that I think this is disappointing, and I believe it to be a disproportionate response to the compromise proposals which remain on the table.<br/><br/>  I would urge both unions to reconsider their position and re-engage in talks rather than proceeding with a strike that serves no-one's interests.</p></reply>

This is on foot of recommendations set out in the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Policy Advice on &quot;Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools (May 2013) and the recommendations of the NCSE Working Group Report &quot;A Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for Students with Special Educational Needs&quot;. <br/><br/>  Following the publication of these reports, my Department advised that it would commence the process of gathering information which would be required to develop the proposed new model, to allow its impact to be assessed, and to assess if, and from when, the model could be implemented. Part of this process involves the collection of information in relation to the social context of schools.<br/><br/>  The working group report recommended that a school's social context should be used because it can contribute strongly to the level of learning needs that students have. The report considered that, on the basis of available research evidence, the use of a school's social context is valid in developing an educational profile, as socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with the incidence of certain types of special educational needs, including low achievement in academic learning and emotional or behavioural disorders. <br/><br/>  The report also noted that a school within a disadvantaged social context may have a higher share of students presenting with emotional or behavioural disorders. While some of these needs are likely to be reflected in low test scores, others may not, as students with relatively high levels of educational achievement can have emotional and behavioural disorders. <br/><br/>  Accordingly, it was recommended that consideration of a schools social context should form part of any proposed new resource allocation model.<br/><br/>  Pending the availability of a more objective source of information, the working group stated that it was confident that survey reporting by school principals could produce robust up to date data on school context in a similar manner to DEIS and earlier initiatives. <br/><br/>  The Department therefore, in conjunction with the NCSE, asked the Educational Research Centre (ERC) to conduct a survey of schools to assist the development of an educational profile.<br/><br/>  Though recognising that all schools would not be able to have specific detail regarding all of the questions asked in relation to their pupil populations, schools were asked to provide their best possible estimates in relation to the questions being asked in the survey, in order to ensure that as accurate as possible a social context allocation component of any revised allocation model could be developed for each school. <br/><br/>  At all stages of the development of the advice and in particular in the work of the working group there was comprehensive consultation with education partners and stakeholders and through this consultation there was awareness and broad support for the proposed approach including the deployment of a survey. <br/><br/>  The data which schools were requested to return as part of the survey was non-personal, anonymised data. Schools were not asked to return data in relation to the social circumstances of individual pupils.<br/><br/>  Schools were also advised that the ERC had put in place a dedicated phone help line in order to provide assistance and support to schools in completing the questionnaire. I understand that many schools used this help line to gain assistance in completing the questionnaire.<br/><br/>  Whereas I understand that the return of this survey has caused extra work and some difficulties for some schools, I am confident that having up to date social context data will be highly beneficial to the Department and the NCSE in developing proposals for a new profiled allocation model for schools.</p></reply>

These posts continue to be replaced in the normal manner. The impact of the moratorium was therefore limited to the Assistant Principal and Special Duties posts of responsibility.The alleviation arrangements are set out in Circular 0004/2014 which provide a floor by which schools acutely affected at AP level by the impact of the moratorium can fill their AP vacancies as they arise to the level of the thresholds set out in that circular. These arrangements are mainly focused at post-primary level. <br/><br/>  It continues to be a matter for each individual school authority to re-organise and prioritise the appropriate duties for post of responsibility holders in the context of implementing the moratorium.<br/><br/>  I think it is fair to say that before the moratorium, notwithstanding the fact that one out of every two teachers held a management allowance the workload issue and the pressures on Principals and Deputy Principals existed. <br/><br/>  Simply lifting the moratorium as extra funding becomes available in future years is not the best way of improving how school leadership is distributed in our schools.<br/><br/>  The school management bodies at second level have published proposals for a more flexible model of middle management supports for schools. There is more work to be done in relation to these proposals and they will be the subject of more detailed discussions between my Department and the management bodies in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

We have a growing population of young people in this country and despite the difficult financial circumstances we face as a country, we prioritised education so that the number of teachers we have in the system has also grown in order to protect existing pupil teacher ratios. There were a thousand more teachers employed in schools around the country in the last school year, than there was the year before. There will be a further increase of circa 1,300 teachers in the current school year. This is a very significant investment at a time of scarce resources. <br/><br/>  At primary level the staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. The national average class size at primary level is 24.7 pupils. However, with over 21,100 classes in over 3,100 primary schools throughout the country there will always be variations in class sizes at individual school level. My Department's guidance to local school management is that such variations should be kept to the minimum.</p></reply>

It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth over a sustained period that will enable us to move to a point where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about an improvement in PTR, class size and support for classroom teachers.<br/><br/>In the meantime, my Department's focus is on targeting any available resources to cater for the continued increase in student numbers. In this regard, there were a thousand more teachers employed in schools around the country in the last school year, than there was the year before. There will be a further increase of circa 1,300 teachers in the current school year.<br/><br/>  It is important to point out that within the schools sector we know, from international research, that while class sizes is a factor, the quality of teaching is a far more significant factor in determining outcomes. In terms of international comparison, the last published statistics by the OECD are for the 2011/12 school year. They show Ireland's PTR at slightly above the OECD average and average class size at primary level at 24.4 compared to an OECD average of 21.3.  The Department's most recently published statistics are for the 2013/14 school year. They show an average class size at primary level of 24.8.<br/><br/>  At primary level the staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. The primary staffing schedule currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils, with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools.<br/><br/>  My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.). School authorities are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes.</p></reply>

My Department supports the changes as contributing to overall quality improvement in initial teacher education, however, I do not have a role in assessing the Tr&eacute;imhse Foghlama sa Ghaeltacht.</p><p>  Initial teacher education providers such as Mary Immaculate College have responsibility for quality assuring the content, teaching and assessment of the Gaeltacht element of initial teacher education programmes.

This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments, and in particular those who have been receiving such payments for extended periods.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people. </p><p>  Persons who are unemployed but not in receipt of a social welfare payment are not, however, disqualified from receiving training and employment supports. A range of services are in fact available to such people. </p><p>  For example employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status.   </p><p>  Further, unemployed persons not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through ETB (formerly F&Aacute;S) training for unemployed people, although they are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course (they may receive some financial support for travel and meals).  </p><p>  The Work Placement Programme operated by my Department is also open to persons not in receipt of a social welfare payment, although the participant will not receive a payment while on the programme.</p><p>  An unemployed person who does not qualify for a social welfare payment due to the assessment of their means may be eligible to sign for social insurance contribution credits.  Persons who sign for credits for three months (78 days) of the last six months are eligible to participate in the JobBridge programme.</p><p>  The number of young people who do not qualify for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance (JA) because of parental means is relatively low. In the most recent twelve-month period for which data are available, some 52,808 awards of JA were made to young people under the age of 25. Over the same period, 1,579 JA claims from young people were disallowed on the grounds that the applicant&rsquo;s means (from all sources) were deemed to be in excess of the prescribed limits. Disallowances on grounds of means thus represented a maximum of 3% of the claims actually awarded to young people. This would include cases where the means involved were those of the applicant or the applicant&rsquo;s spouse, not just parental means cases. At present the Department of Social Protection is not planning to change the eligibility criteria for JA.</p></reply>

As at 20 November 2014, a total of 35,381 internships have commenced with 6,700 participants currently on a JobBridge placement, and 1,933 internship posts currently advertised on the JobBridge website.  </p><p>  In County Kerry, there have been a total of 1047 internships since the scheme commenced.  Of this, 232 are currently on a placement, with 815 internships completed at this point in time.  A total of 232 of these interns progressed into employment, either with their host organisation or another organisation on completion of their JobBridge placement.  This represents a 28% progression rate, immediately on completion of the scheme.</p><p>  Progression into employment on completion of an internship understates the impact of the scheme as many people use their work experience to apply for and secure employment in the months immediately following the internship. In this regard, an independent evaluation of JobBridge found that 61% of individuals who have participated in the scheme have progressed into employment within five months of completing their internship placements.  A total of 45.2% of these were in full-time permanent employment, 9.3% were in part-time permanent employment, 35.0% were in full-time temporary employment and 10.5% were in part-time temporary employment. The majority of these have progressed to employment with their host organisations, while the remainder took the skills and experiences gained during their internship to employment in the wider labour market. This high level of progression into employment exceeds that of similar schemes across Europe. </p><p>  I am confident that JobBridge will continue as a positive activation programme, and that the scheme will display similar progression rates into employment, into the future.</p></reply>

The original intention of the MIS scheme was to provide short-term support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  The supplement assisted with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.  In the context of the overall strategy, the continued payment of MIS did little to assist recipients or lenders in improving the long term difficulty in addressing the mortgage problem. </p><p>  Customers availing of this support prior to 1 January 2014 have been able retain entitlement to the scheme up to 1 January 2018.  There are currently approximately 6,400 people in receipt of the supplement for which the Government has provided &euro;17.9 million in 2014.</p><p>  It is expected that during the four year period, existing customers will no longer require this support through sustainable solutions being put in place with their lenders, securing employment or exit strategies sponsored by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I am satisfied that the most appropriate way in which customers experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported is through engagement with their lender.</p></reply>

The Accountant of the Courts of Justice is in ongoing discussions with both the Liquidator and his legal advisors to put in place appropriate mechanisms to make the applications to the High Court in accordance with the Insurance Act 1964. I am advised that in tandem with this he is also working to acquire the necessary skilled resources to enable applications to the ICF to be processed effectively and efficiently.  Due to the unprecedented nature and scale of the insolvency the Accountant is not yet in a position to provide a timetable for applications to be made to the Fund, but it is hoped that applications by the Accountant to the High Court can begin sooner rather than later.</p><p>  I appreciate that the current uncertainty regarding the timing of compensation payments is causing difficulty for the former customers of the insurance company and I have asked that information on ICF procedures is made available publicly as soon as possible.  The Accountant of the Courts of Justice can only deal with claims which are submitted by the Liquidator, so the advice to all claimants continues to be that they should contact the Liquidator.</p></reply>

I would also point out that food for the purposes of interpretation of the provisions of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 has the ordinary and everyday meaning of food; alternative definitions in an unrelated EU Directive are not relevant.</p></reply>

The additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% which I introduced for 2014 and 2015 mainly to help continue to fund Jobs Initiative will also end after next year.</p><p>  The position is that the equivalent value of all of the money raised from the stamp duty levy has been used to fund the wide range of measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative to protect existing jobs and create new jobs.  These include expenditure measures such as the Jobbridge and the Springboard schemes, as well as a number of tax and PRSI incentives such as the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the tourism and hospitality sectors and the halving of the lower employer PRSI rate.  </p><p>  The reduced VAT rate of 9% on tourism and certain other services was one of the very significant and successful measures introduced by the Jobs Initiative. It was due to end in 2013. In my Budget 2014 speech I announced the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate. I also announced that the Air Travel Tax is being reduced to zero with effect from 1 April 2014. The 9% VAT rate has helped to create thousands of new jobs as well as protecting existing jobs. Since the Budget announcement about the reduction in the Air Travel Tax, airlines have announced the opening up of new routes resulting in significant increases in passenger numbers with the associated increase in tourism activity and employment.</p><p>  While the pension fund levies have ceased and will be ceased as I have already outlined, I have no plans to repay some or all of the pension fund levy tax collected as proposed in the question. The value of the funds raised by way of the levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State to which the Deputy refers. Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons for the levy (pension scheme trustees and other persons with responsibility for the management of pension scheme or pension plan assets) will benefit from the changes which I began in Budget 2015 and which will continue in future Budgets to reduce the income tax burden on low and middle income earners. It is in this prospective way that the benefits of an improving fiscal and economic position are usually passed on.</p></reply>

On a rating system where less than 100 is regressive and above 100 is progressive, most EU countries have a progressivity rate of between 120 and 140. Ireland, in comparison, has a progressivity rate of 183 for 2013, the latest year for which data is available. This is considerably more progressive than any other EU member of the OECD, and the second most progressive overall. OECD tax data is not readily available for years prior to 2005. Nonetheless, Ireland has had either the most or second most progressive income tax system among OECD member states since 2005. Ireland's progressivity relative to the other OECD member states for this period is set out in the table. <br/><br/><b><i>Income Tax Progressivity relative to other OECD States 2005-2013</i></b><table><tr><th>Ireland</th><th>2005</th><th>2006</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th></tr><tr><td>Position</td><td>2nd</td><td>1st</td><td>1st</td><td>1st</td><td>1st</td><td>1st</td><td>2nd</td><td>2nd</td><td>2nd</td></tr></table><br/><br/>A fair, efficient and competitive income tax system is essential for economic growth and job creation. I have long said that the burden of the income tax system in Ireland is too high and that I would seek to reduce it as soon as it was prudent to do so. The income tax measures introduced in Budget 2015 are the first stage of a three-year plan to progressively reduce the marginal tax rate on low and middle income earners in a manner that maintains the highly progressive nature of the Irish tax system. <br/><br/>All those who currently pay income tax and or USC will see a reduction in their tax bill in 2015.</p></reply>

This was not matched by proportionate import growth, despite the growth in domestic demand in the same period. As a result net exports increased by 11.0 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter to stand at &euro;11.2 billion, or 24 per cent of GDP.<br/><br/>Part of the strong performance in goods exports can be put down to what is known as  contracted manufacturing'. This contracted production occurs when an Irish-resident (though not necessarily Irish-owned) enterprise contracts a plant abroad to produce a good for supply to a third country. The sale of the good is recorded as an Irish export as the economic ownership of the good prior to sale is regarded as belonging to the Irish-resident enterprise. Imports used in the production process are also recorded as Irish imports. Neither these exports nor imports associated with contracted production are recorded in the monthly trade series which is based on measurement of when goods physically cross the Irish border. <br/><br/>The difference between national accounts-based and trade-based measures of exports and imports are known as national accounts adjustments. In the three years to 2013 national accounts export and import adjustments have largely offset each other. This relationship appears to have broken down in the first half of 2014. The export adjustment has increased considerably more than the import adjustment and is believed to be associated with a sharp increase in contracted production, adding significantly to the contribution of net exports to GDP growth. However, other adjustments (such as the correction for carriage costs of imports) are also made. It is important to stress that the contribution of contracted production to growth cannot be calculated with precision with the publically available data to hand.<br/><br/>Contracted production involves very little employment effect or second-round impact on the wider economy and complicates the task of forecasting net exports. Developments in contract production are sector-specific and product-specific and have little relationship with concurrent indicators of export performance. As such, they have the potential to unwind or accelerate with potentially large impacts on measured GDP.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding these developments, there is no doubt that economic recovery has gained momentum this year and that it has broadened to include a recovery in domestic demand.  High-frequency data such as retail sales, industrial production and purchasing managers' indices (PMIs) are all in strong positive territory. Employment growth resumed in 2012 and the Live Register continues to fall month-on-month. This recovery has manifested itself in tax revenues which are expected to come in &euro;1 billion (or 2.5%) above original expectations.</p></reply>

However, there are other potential supports available and the LEO staff can advise appropriately.  <br/><br/>Any business can use the LEOs as a gateway to accessing finance from Micro Finance Ireland (MFI), which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks.  The Fund available to MFI has a significant entrepreneurship focus and is open to anyone with a viable business proposal.

Meat processors make their own arrangements for the procurement of animals for slaughter.  These are commercial decisions for individual processors and their supply base will include animals purchased from farmers on the open market, animals reared on a contract basis, and animals supplied from their own holdings.  This has been the longstanding practice in Ireland and elsewhere.  It is also my understanding that this is also the practice in the US and that processors are not prohibited from rearing animals in that jurisdiction.  I do not intend to introduce measures to prevent this practice.<br/><br/>With regard to any suspected manipulation of the market by beef processors, I would ask the Deputy to bring forward any information or evidence he has in this regard to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission which has been formed through the merger of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority.  The Commission is an independent statutory body that <i>inter alia</i>enforces Irish and European competition law in Ireland.  It does this by taking action against anti-competitive practices (e.g. price-fixing) and by blocking anti-competitive business mergers.  The Commission also has a role in promoting competition in the economy by identifying legislative restrictions on competition, advising the Government on the implications for competition of proposed legislation, and by providing general information about competition issues.</p></reply>

In 2013 export volumes were largely unchanged but values increased by 3% to over &euro;520 million, continuing the growth seen in recent years. Pigmeat prices tend to be cyclical in nature with periods of lower prices and production followed by recovery and this has remained the case for many years. <br/><br/>My Department carefully monitors developments in the pig sector, both domestically and internationally. I also met with members of the IFA National Pigs and Pigmeat Committee last month to hear their views on recent developments.<br/><br/>In relation to the<b></b>Russian ban on EU pigmeat exports, I am fully aware of the concerns Irish pig farmers have as a result of the closure of this market. At EU level the Commission has referred this matter to the WTO for resolution. I have called on the European Commission to monitor the developments on markets and where necessary, to quickly activate safety net provisions such as public interventions and/or private storage aid.<br/><br/>Indeed, at the most recent EU Agriculture Council meeting on 10 November, I supported a request from my Danish counterpart for the introduction of Private Storage Aid for the pigmeat sector. While this proposal had the support of a number of Member States, it was refused by the European Commission who nevertheless, pledged to keep the issue under review. <br/><br/>Support is provided by my Department for the pig sector in a number of ways. Firstly I have included provision in 2015 and throughout the whole RDP for an on-farm capital investments scheme, TAMS II, with an overall budget of &euro;395 million across all sectors, with &euro;37 million allocated for 2015.  Amongst the areas identified for initial funding are investments on pig farms for energy, water meters and medicine dispensers.Other elements of the RDP, such as targeted on farm animal health and welfare scheme will also be of benefit to the pig sector. <br/><br/>Other supports for the sector come through Teagasc which, through its Moorepark pig research facility and courses in pig production, plays an important role in improving production at farm level. Through its Joint Research Advisory Programme, Teagasc will support Irish pig producers by providing advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector. The programme has enabled Teagasc to employ four additional advisors and researchers to support producers and the sector through advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector. The high level objective of the programme is to enhance the sustainability of Irish pig meat production, including improvements in economic, social and environmental standards. This will result in improvements in the production and marketability of Irish pigmeat. <br/><br/>I am also conscious of the need to promote the consumption of Irish pigmeat in domestic and overseas markets. Bord Bia provides assistance to the pigmeat sector through its marketing and promotional activities, and the pigmeat quality assurance scheme helps to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and helps expand its presence on EU and third country markets. <br/><br/>For my part, I have undertaken to ensure that as many alternative markets as possible are open to Irish Pigmeat processors. In this regard I was pleased to recently announce the opening of the markets in Vietnam and the Philippines for Irish pigmeat which will serve as valuable alternative markets to Russia for Irish pigmeat exports.</p></reply>

The superlevy is set by milk quota Regulations agreed at EU level.  Any amendment to the regime requires a proposal from the Commission and agreement of a qualified majority of all other Member States.  At numerous Agriculture Council meetings over the recent past the issue of additional measures to ensure a &lsquo;soft landing&rsquo; to milk quota abolition in 2015 was discussed.  I, and some other like-minded Ministers, consistently called on the Commission to take action to ease the burden of the super levy in the final year of the quota regime but such an agreement was not forthcoming at the time and this remains the case.  As there is no common position at the Council of Agriculture Ministers such an adjustment looks unlikely to be achieved.</p><p>  It must be clearly noted that a number of other countries are opposed to any action on this and have sought to link the issue to possible measures to regulate supply after quotas are gone.  I am obviously resolutely opposed to any talk of supply controls after quota abolition next April on the basis that these quotas have only served to shackle Irish farmers over the last 30 years.  The resultant stalemate means there is insufficient support for any change to the regulations and no agreement has been possible.  The current Italian presidency agreed to consider the issue at their first Council meeting in July, it was again discussed in October and I fully expect that the issue will remain high on the agenda for discussion at future Councils, including December, where I will continue to seek to have the matter progressed in a way that is fair to both Irish and EU dairy farmers.   </p><p>  In preparing their enterprises for the post quota era, I have at all times urged that farmers have regard to the fact that milk quotas would remain in place until April 2015, along with the associated superlevy regime, and I would take this opportunity today to reiterate this call.  I would again urge farmers to use the time period between now and the removal of milk quotas to identify, with their dairy adviser, steps to manage both their milk supply and their dairy herds so that they have an efficient herd as they enter the post quota era.</p></reply>

The Nordic Battlegroup will consist of a<b></b>combined total of approximately 2,500 personnel.  The contributing nations in this Battlegroup are Sweden, Ireland, Finland, Norway, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia.  Sweden, acting as Framework Nation, takes the lead role in the Nordic Battlegroup formation and will contribute most of the personnel.  The planned Defence Forces contribution to the Nordic Battlegroup is a Reconnaissance Company and related combat support elements.  It is also planned that Ireland will take command of a multinational Reconnaissance Group Headquarters, providing Ireland with a more significant role within the Battlegroup.  The total number of Defence Forces personnel involved in the Nordic Battlegroup will be approximately 175.  However, this level of resource commitment will only arise should the Battlegroup be called on to undertake an operation and should Ireland agree to participate.  Fourteen (14) Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed to the Force Headquarters in Sweden for the lead up to and the duration of the standby period for the Nordic Battlegroup. These personnel, mainly staff officers and NCOs, are engaged in training and planning activities serving in various appointments and posts.<br/><br/>The capabilities and the requisite high-end equipment in respect of Ireland's contributions to the Battlegroups already reside within the Defence Forces.  As with all Defence Forces overseas deployment, the Defence Forces personnel assigned to the Nordic Battlegroup will have, at their disposal, all the necessary equipment and force protection assets to carry out the tasks that may be assigned to them should the Nordic Battlegroup deploy in 2015.  This equipment includes MOWAGs Armoured Personnel Carriers and Reconnaissance vehicles, Light Tactical Armoured Vehicles and highly specialised Reconnaissance and Surveillance equipment, together with the requisite personal protection equipment. <br/><br/>Participation in EU Battlegroups underlines our commitment to the development of the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy and enables Ireland to continue to contribute effectively to UN-authorised EU military and civilian crisis management operations in support of international peace and security.  Any decision by Ireland to participate in a specific Battlegroup operation is subject to our national sovereign decision-making procedures - &ldquo;Triple Lock&rdquo;, i.e. UN mandate, Government and D&aacute;il approval.</p></reply>

The current process for the appointment of judges in Ireland is set out in the Courts and Courts Officers Act 1995 as amended which established the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and set out the basic requirements for eligibility for judicial appointment. Applicants wishing to be considered for judicial appointment can submit written applications to the Board providing information on their education, professional qualifications, experience and character. Amendments to the Act in 2002 rendered practising solicitors eligible for appointment to all courts and as a consequence both solicitors and barristers in legal practice for a designated number of years are eligible for appointment to each of the courts from the District Court up to and including the Supreme Court.<br/><br/>The Minister for Justice and Equality announced a consultation process on the system of judicial appointments in December 2013.  Submissions were invited to address issues such as<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>-  eligibility for appointment;<br /><br />-  the need to ensure and protect the principle of judicial independence;<br /><br />-  promoting equality and diversity;<br /><br />-  the role of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, including its membership and its procedures.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>I can inform the Deputy that the eligibility issues to which he refers - experience as an academic lawyer or an 'in-house' lawyer - have been raised in the consultation process. While legal academics are not eligible for judicial appointment, the position is that solicitors in employment including those in the full-time service of the State are regarded as practising (and are therefore eligible for appointment subject to normal conditions) but generally employed barristers are not so regarded.<br/><br/>A report addressing all relevant eligibility and other issues arising from the consultations process is currently being finalised which, following further discussions with the judiciary and the approval of Government, will lead to Draft heads of a Judicial Appointments Bill.</p></reply>

Indeed, while I appreciate his concerns on the issue, it is the responsibility of all non-EEA nationals who are resident in the State to ensure that they have an appropriate permission from the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Most migrants do in fact comply with this condition and obey the State's immigration laws.</p><p>  Ireland has shown itself to be a country that is open to migration and it is quite clear that those who opt to abide by our rules benefit from doing so.  For instance, since March 2011 over 78,000 immigrants have been naturalised; in the past three years over 240,000 visas have been issued to tourists, students, business people and so forth to enable them to come here.</p><p>  At the end of 2013 there were over 109,000 non-EEA nationals resident in the State.  Ireland continues to provide a safe haven to those who come here to seek our protection.</p></reply>

The schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme under which funding is made available on an annual basis to 31 national and major regional youth organisations and targeted support schemes for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people. The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2014, funding of &euro;49.78m has been provided to my Department for these schemes. </p><p>  I am pleased to advise that Budget 2015 has confirmed that funding of &euro;49.78m will again be provided to my Department in 2015 to support the provision of youth services. There will be no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015 which was a key priority for youth organisations.</p><p>  In recent years capital funding has been made available to my Department for the development of youth caf&eacute;s and some 100 new youth caf&eacute; facilities have received support under the scheme since 2011 when the Department of Children and Youth Affairs was established. Recent research undertaken by my Department indicates that there are now over 160 youth caf&eacute;s throughout the country. In the main, these have been developed, over the years, by local communities with the support  of different funding sources.</p><p>  The youth caf&eacute; initiative referred to by the Deputy has not received funding under the capital funding schemes administered by my Department. I have been advised that the youth caf&eacute; in question has received funding under the Local and Community Development Programme administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.  I understand that funding has been provided under the programme and that an allocation has been made to the youth caf&eacute; in 2014 and that the caf&eacute; remains open to the young people in the area.</p><p>  My Department does not have available to it a capital fund for the development of new youth caf&eacute;s in 2014. Youth Caf&eacute;s offer young people a safe, alcohol and drug free space, for recreation, non-formal learning and youth activities and they make an important contribution to facilities for young people at local level. Youth Caf&eacute;s make an important contribution to the development of services to meet the needs of young people in their local communities. The development of youth caf&eacute;s is a priority for my Department should further capital funding become available in future years.</p><p>  In 2014, funding of &euro;548,205 has been provided for local youth work projects and services in County Cork.</p></reply>

Towards this end, funding of &euro;90 million and some 1,100 posts have been provided since 2012 to develop our community mental health services and suicide prevention resources. <br/><br/>At the end of September 2014, 770 posts of the 890 provided for in 2012 and 2013 had been recruited with the remainder at various stages in the recruitment process, with some difficulties in identifying some outstanding candidates for geographic and qualification reasons.  Therefore, approximately 86% of combined 2 years posts have taken up duty. <br/><br/>In relation to 2014, while &euro;20 million was provided for mental health services, the HSE National Service Plan outlined that this expenditure would be phased-in, in order for the HSE to live within the overall available resource in 2014.  Accordingly, it was decided that the recruitment of 2014 posts would be commenced to provide for posts to come on stream during the last quarter of 2014.  To this end, and informed by the analysis carried out, some 200 posts have now been identified from the 2014 allocation and the recruitment process has now commenced.<br/><br/>In relation to the specific details of the recruitment of posts per region and initiative, as this is a service issue the question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with the Executive.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p><p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the HSE, unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p></reply>

In addition, detailed discussion and analysis was required by the Group on complex areas of mental health legislation including, for example, the requirement to take account of certain Articles of the Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the need to achieve a balance between individual human rights and the requirements for public safety. I made it clear to the members of the Group at the commencement of their work that they should take an open and expansive approach, and consider all issues which they might feel were relevant and necessary for a thorough review, having regard to the Review's term of reference.</p><p>  As I have previously indicated to the Deputy, the Mental Health Act 2001 was introduced on a phased basis and was fully enacted by 2006. For the majority of legislation that has been fully operational for less than a decade, it would not be normal to have such a formal comprehensive review of the legislation. However a commitment was made in the Programme for Government to review the Act and the Government and I attach great importance to the review. </p><p>  The Mental Health Act 2001 was consistent with prevailing approaches to rights issues at that time and continues to underpin a modern approach to the regulation of mental health services in Ireland. As I have previously indicated, I am satisfied that the additional timeframe which was necessary for the current review is not impacting on human rights issues within the mental health system. </p></reply>

Under the legislation, determination of an individual&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the HSE. The 1970 Health Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and their family, having regard to their overall financial situation and reasonable expenditure. There is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with specific illnesses, or with a disability.</p><p>  The system of assessment for eligibility for those 70 years of age and over is based on significantly higher gross income limits rather than the standard net income thresholds. This advantageous arrangement for persons aged over 70 years has facilitated a much greater share of this cohort qualifying for a medical card compared to the general population as a whole. In the main, persons in the over-70s age cohort do not have the same outlays and expenses as those under 70 years of age who are assessed on a means basis. However in circumstances where their income exceeds these limits persons aged over 70 years may still be eligible for a medical card where discretion is exercised where they face undue hardship in arranging medical services as a result of medical or social circumstances.</p><p>  The Deputy is aware that the Director-General of the HSE established an Expert Panel to examine and recommend the range of medical conditions that would be considered as a basis of eligibility for health services.  The Expert Panel report was presented to Minister Varadkar last month.  The Expert Panel concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. It also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card and recommended that the existing eligibility assessment should be extended beyond financial hardship to include an assessment of the burden of a medical condition, but it noted that there are significant challenges to including such an assessment. It is however recognised by Government that there is a need for discretion and sensitivity in assessing eligibility, which will take into account an individual's medical condition and needs, rather than a list of specific medical conditions. In that context, the Government has approved a number of immediate improvements that the HSE is making to the medical card system. </p></reply>

These are provided directly by the HSE or by voluntary service providers funded by the HSE.  At the same time, the HSE has recognised the need to improve the way in which both early intervention services and services for school-aged children are delivered.  It is currently engaged in a major reconfiguration of its existing therapy resources for children with disabilities into multi-disciplinary geographically based teams, as part of its <i>National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years).</i>The key objective of this Programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, where these children go to school or the nature of the individual child&rsquo;s difficulties.  <br/><br/>The Programme is a key priority for the HSE&rsquo;s Social Care Directorate.  An additional &euro;4m was allocated this year to assist in implementing the Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts, and further investment in the Programme will take place in 2015.  The transition to this new service model is taking place on a phased basis and includes consultation and engagement with stakeholders, including service users and their families.<br/><br/>Within this context, I have asked the Executive to provide the Deputy with the detailed information that he has requested.

In addition, we and our EU partners are not persuaded that the continued embargo is contributing in a positive way to the democratic transition in Cuba.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about economic, commercial and financial measures against Cuba, which are contrary to commonly accepted rules of international trade, are long-standing and clear.  We object to unilaterally imposed measures that impede the economic and commercial relations of EU member states with Cuba.</p><p>  Accordingly Ireland, and the other EU member states, support resolutions at the UN General Assembly that record opposition to the embargo, most recently last month on the 28th of October.</p><p>  The resolution also recognised the continued EU concerns and criticisms regarding governance and human rights in Cuba.  It was noted that while the US embargo has a damaging effect on the Cuban economy, domestic Cuban economic policy seriously hampers its own economic development.  The resolution urged that the package of economic and social reforms adopted by the Cuban Parliament in August 2011 be extended and implemented in a manner that will address the key concerns of the Cuban population.  I urge the Cuban authorities to bring about real improvements in all areas mentioned, and to grant its citizens internationally recognised civil, political and economic rights and freedoms.</p><p>  I am aware of the case of to which the Deputy refers of the Cuban citizens imprisoned in the US. As this is a bilateral consular issue between the US and the Cuban authorities, the Government have no standing in the matter.</p></reply>

In the course of his meetings there with a senior Pakistani Foreign Ministry representative, he raised this case, noting that it is a matter of grave concern in Ireland.<br/><br/>Officials in my Department also keep in regular contact with the Embassy of Pakistan on this, and a number of other issues.  Officials recently raised this case, and our concerns regarding the blasphemy laws and persecution of Christians generally, with the Embassy of Pakistan.<br/><br/>At EU level, freedom of religion or belief and freedom of opinion and expression play a central role in the EU&rsquo;s dialogue with Pakistan.  The former High Representative for Foreign Affairs of the European Union, Catherine Ashton has expressed her concerns at the judgment, and others like it, on numerous occasions, and has called on Pakistan to respect human rights as guaranteed under international conventions.<br/><br/>On 18 October last, a spokesperson for the European External Action Service expressed sadness and deep concern at the High Court decision to uphold this person&rsquo;s conviction, and called on Pakistan to ensure for all its citizens, full respect of human rights as guaranteed by international conventions to which it is party.  The spokesperson further noted that the EU considers the death penalty a cruel and inhumane punishment and expressed the hope that the verdict would be appealed to the Supreme Court and struck down swiftly.<br/><br/>The issue of the death penalty in Pakistan and this case were also the subject of a statement made on behalf of the EU High Representative/Vice-President Catherine Ashton at a plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg on 22 October last.  In the course of that Statement, it was noted that the EU, and particularly its Delegation in Islamabad, would continue to follow the case closely and would continue to advocate for the verdict to be overturned and for the person concerned to be released.  While not trying to intervene in an ongoing court case, the Statement noted that the EU would use any opportunity to raise this case and the wider issues of the death penalty and blasphemy law, with Pakistan.<br/><br/>The EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Mr Stavros Lambrinidis also visited Pakistan at the end of last month, where he held an in depth dialogue with the Pakistan authorities on key human rights issues.<br/><br/>At the UN level, Pakistan underwent a &lsquo;Universal Periodic Review&rsquo; of the human rights situation in the country at the United Nations Human Rights Council in October 2012.  At this review, concern was expressed about this case and calls were made for Pakistan to consider adopting an official moratorium on the death penalty.  During the process, Ireland recommended that Pakistan take all appropriate measures to combat and prevent discrimination against religious and other minority groups, including by removing educational material which could serve to perpetuate discrimination.<br/><br/>Ireland attaches great importance to the fundamental human rights of freedom of thought, conscience, religion or<font color="#FF0000"> </font>belief.  We are aware of the vulnerable situation of persons belonging to religious minorities in Pakistan and will continue to raise this case and others bilaterally with the Pakistan Government as well as through the framework and mechanisms of the European Union and the United Nations.</p></reply>

These posts continue to be replaced in the normal manner. The impact of the moratorium was therefore limited to the Assistant Principal and Special Duties posts of responsibility.The alleviation arrangements set out in Circular 0004/2014  provide a floor by which schools acutely affected at AP level by the impact of the moratorium can fill their AP vacancies as they arise to the level of the thresholds set out in that circular. <br/><br/>  It continues to be a matter for each individual school authority to re-organise and prioritise the appropriate duties for post of responsibility holders in the context of implementing the moratorium.<br/><br/>  However, I think it is fair to say that before the moratorium, notwithstanding the fact that one out of every two teachers held a management allowance, the workload issue and the pressures on Principals and Deputy Principals existed. <br/><br/>  Simply lifting the moratorium as extra funding becomes available in future years is not the best way of improving how school leadership is distributed in our schools.<br/><br/>  Economic constraints and the moratorium on recruitment, albeit alleviated to some extent for schools, have presented challenges within the education sector. They also provide an opportunity to review the role of the principal so that our principals are leaders of learning, and to reconfigure the middle management structure to support principals in their role, ensuring ownership of responsibility rather than tasks, thereby building expertise and supporting a career path within the profession. <br/><br/>  The Department, in consultation with the representative bodies has commenced an exploration of the opportunities to support and thereby advance our understanding of the needs of school leaders and how they might be addressed.</p></reply>

Under the terms of these circulars school Principal's must maintain a list of unemployed registered teachers who are available for substitute work at short notice and report to the Board of Management on any exceptional occasion where they have to engage a registered teacher who is retired. <br/><br/>A retired teacher who returns to teaching on or after 1 February 2012 commences at the first point of the incremental salary scale. Incremental credit for service prior to 1 February 2012, qualification allowances and certain job role allowances are also not payable.<br/><br/>  These measures represents a significant financial disincentive for teachers who retired at the top of their salary scale, often with a post of responsibility allowance, to return to teaching.</p></reply>

It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth over a sustained period that will enable us to move to a point where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about an improvement in PTR, class size and support for classroom teachers.  In the meantime, my Department's focus is on targeting any available resources to cater for the continued increase in student numbers across primary, post-primary and third level.  If in future years there is funding available to reduce class sizes my preference is that it would be targeted at reducing class sizes at the infant years.</p><p>  We have a growing population of young people in this country and despite the difficult financial circumstances we face as a country, we prioritised education so that the number of teachers we have in the system has also grown in order to protect existing pupil teacher ratios.  There were a thousand more teachers employed in schools around the country in the last school year, than there was the year before.  There will be a further increase of circa 1,300 teachers in the current school year.  This is a very significant investment at a time of scarce resources.</p><p>  The staffing arrangements for schools currently include the provision where schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds.  Such posts are provisionally approved pending confirmation of actual enrolment on the following 30th September.</p></reply>

In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.</p><p>  All State-funded primary and post primary schools have been allocated additional resources to provide for children with special educational needs enrolled in school.</p><p>  For children for whom mainstream provision may not be appropriate, my Department has provided placement options in some 125 special schools which have approximately 1,000 teachers and approximately 860 special classes and units located around the country, 96 of which are early intervention classes for young children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.</p><p>  Primary and Post Primary schools have a permanent allocation of additional teaching supports to provide for children whose educational psychological assessment places them in the high incidence, or less complex, disability category.</p><p>  Separately, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for children with additional care needs, as outlined in Circular 00030/2014 and additional resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been assessed within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05.  The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>  I recently announced, as part of Budget 2015, that an additional 365 Special Needs Assistant posts would be provided in 2015, as well as an additional 480 Resource Teachers, to take into account increased demand and demographic growth and to ensure that children can continue to have access to additional supports in school.</p><p>  This is the highest number of Resource Teaching and SNA support that we have ever had.  These increases, building on increases which have already been provided in recent years, will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.</p><p>  Other supports include enhanced levels of school capitation payable to special schools and special classes, Special School Transport arrangements, the National Educational Psychological Service, an extended school year for pupils who have either a severe/profound general learning disability or who have autism and the provision for Assistive Technology/specialised equipment support for pupils with Special Educational Needs.</p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that I have not had any significant level of correspondence from schools in Co. Kildare in relation to special needs teachers and special needs assistants.</p><p>  Correspondence from schools in Kildare have mainly been in relation to general staffing issues.</p><p>  We have a growing population of young people in this country and despite the difficult financial circumstances we face as a country, we prioritised education so that the number of teachers we have in the system has also grown in order to protect existing pupil teacher ratios.</p><p>  Staffing schedules operate in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.  My main priority for any additional resources for the foreseeable future will be to cater for the continuing increase in demographics at all levels in the education system.  There were a thousand more teachers employed in schools around the country in the last school year, than there was the year before.  There will be a further increase of circa 1,300 teachers in the current school year.</p></reply>

They place a strong focus on education and prevention strategies to deal with bullying behaviour including, in particular, cyberbullying and identity based bullying such as homophobic and transphobic bullying.  The procedures make clear that the focus of any prevention and education awareness measures in schools about cyber-bullying should be on educating pupils on how to stay safe while on-line and also on developing a culture of reporting any concerns about cyber-bullying.  The procedures also recognise that parents and pupils have a role and responsibility in helping the school to prevent and address school-based bullying behaviour and to deal with any negative impact within school of bullying behaviour that occurs elsewhere.  <br/><br/>The procedures set out requirements in relation to the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour amongst pupils.  They also require that a programme of support for pupils who have been bullied must be in place in all schools.  Details of the school's programme for working with pupils affected by bullying must be set out in the school's anti-bullying policy.<br/><br/>There is no requirement for reporting incidents of bullying centrally to the Department.  The procedures contain new oversight arrangements which include a requirement that the school Principal reports regularly to the board of management in relation to the overall numbers of bullying cases and provides confirmation that they are being dealt with in accordance with the anti-bullying procedures.  The board of management is also required to undertake an annual review of the school's anti-bullying policy and its implementation by the school.  Written confirmation that the review has been completed must be made available to the Parents' Association and published on the school website.<br/><br/>Arising from commitments made in the Action Plan on Bullying, my Department's Inspectorate is placing a stronger focus on the actions schools take to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying.  For example, parent and student questionnaires issued as part of whole school evaluations, include, since January 2014, additional questions to get a clearer picture of how the school deals with bullying.  Furthermore, the Inspectorate's plan for the current school year provides for a focussed evaluation to be conducted in a sample of schools to examine the school's work to create and sustain safe and healthy environments.</p></reply>

There were a thousand more teachers employed in schools around the country in the last school year, than there was the year before. There will be a further increase of circa 1,300 teachers in the current school year. This is a very significant investment at a time of scarce resources.</p><p>  It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth that will enable us to move to a point in future budgets where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about an improvement in PTR, class size and support for classroom teachers.</p><p>  In relation to school accommodation my Department's over-riding objective is to ensure that every child has access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing numbers. In that regard, the highest priority has been assigned to school building projects serving rapidly developing areas where there is no existing school or where existing provision is unable to meet the demand for additional places.</p><p>  The 5 year School Construction Plan announced in March 2012, provides for a &euro;2 billion school capital investment programme to 2016 and lists the individual new school building projects, as well as major extensions that are planned to proceed to construction over the duration of the Plan.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that under my Department's Prefab Replacement Initiatives announced in 2012 and 2013, approval was given to 217 schools to replace 614 prefab units with permanent accommodation. In excess of &euro;56m has been allocated to these initiatives.</p><p>  My Department allocated more than &euro;70 million on the 2014 Summer Works Scheme which will enable over 770 schools undertake various improvement work. This week, I announced the allocation of more than &euro;28 million to primary schools under the Minor Works Grant Scheme. This will allow schools to carry out improvement works to the school buildings and grounds.</p><p>  The policy of my Department is that children with special educational needs should be included in mainstream placements with additional supports provided. In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.</p><p>  All State-funded primary and post primary schools have been allocated additional resources to provide for children with special educational needs enrolled in school. For children for whom mainstream provision is not appropriate, placement may be made in one of the 125 special schools which have approximately 1,000 teachers and approximately 860 special classes and units located around the country, 96 of which are early intervention classes for young children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.</p><p>  Separately, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for children with additional care needs, as outlined in Circular 00030/2014 and additional resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been assessed within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05. The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>  I recently announced, as part of Budget 2015, that an additional 365 Special Needs Assistant posts would be provided in 2015, as well as an additional 480 Resource Teachers, to take into account increased demand and demographic growth and to ensure that children can continue to have access to additional supports in school. In addition, over 130 new Special Classes have been sanctioned for the 2014/15 school year.</p><p>  This is the highest number of Special Classes and the highest level of Resource Teaching and SNA support that we have ever had. These increases, building on increases which have already been provided in recent years, will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.</p><p>  Other supports include enhanced levels of school capitation payable to special schools and special classes, Special School Transport arrangements, the National Educational Psychological Service, an extended school year for pupils who have either a severe/profound general learning disability or who have autism and the provision for Assistive Technology/specialised equipment support for pupils with Special Educational Needs. </p></reply>

The establishment of a high performance utility will lead to lower costs and improved services in the future, providing much better outcomes for customers and the environment. <br/><br/>Details of Irish Water&rsquo;s costs are outlined in their revenue and water charges plan which was reviewed by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  Details of the review and the CER&rsquo;s decision are available at .<br/><br/>The CER imposed an annual efficiency challenge of 7% on Irish Water&rsquo;s costs as submitted and following the Government announcement of 19 November, an adjustment to operational costs will be made to reflect the proposal that water services infrastructure will be exempt from commercial rates.  A note on the financing of Irish Water in 2015 and 2016, reflecting this position, has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website - .<br/><br/>Irish Water has published its Capital Investment Plan 2014-2016 and this is available online at .<br/><br/>The plan identifies where Irish Water considers investment in infrastructure is necessary for the effective performance of its functions, including compliance with Water Framework Directive requirements, improving sewage treatment and collection infrastructure in accordance with the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, responding to judgments of the European Court of Justice and achieving environmental and public health objectives arising from various regulations and EPA reports dealing with water quality. <br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives and has contacted all Oireachtas members to provide details of an improved level of service which it is aiming to provide.

Longford, Inland Fisheries Ireland&rsquo;s (IFI) has co-ordinated actions of a range of State bodies, including the design and build of a disinfection station prototype and four units, funded by ESB, and the fishery has since reopened with strict biosecurity conditions including the prohibition of keep nets at the site.    </p><p>  Alien invasive species are a relative new issue that Irish public bodies have had to address and while IFI does not have a statutory remit as regards such species, it continues co-ordinating the comprehensive multi-agency response to the infestation and has been facilitating and chairing meetings of the Agencies since the infestation was discovered.  This group includes the IFI, the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service (NPWS), the Office of Public Works (OPW), Roscommon County Council, Longford County Council, Bord na Mona (BNM), the ESB and Waterways Ireland (WI). </p><p>  A detailed scientific assessment of the nature and extent of the infestation has been completed and based on this assessment the Agency Group agreed a dredging operation of the &ldquo;hot water&rdquo; stretch.  The possibility of a dredge operation on the navigation cut to Lough Ree is also being considered by the Group. </p><p>  The Agency Group has worked on a plan to carry out a trial dredge operation on the &ldquo;hot water&rdquo; stretch.  This trial is required to inform on the feasibility and success rate of the method(s) to be used in any larger scale operation, the method of disposal of the material collected and the overall funding that will be required to conduct the operation including disposal.</p><p>  The trial operation has required a number of matters to be resolved, including:</p><p>  1. Categorisation by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the material for disposal to determine where and how it can be disposed of and the cost of disposal.  Substrate samples were obtained by IFI with the assistance of the ESB, and BNM.  These samples are currently being analysed.</p><p>  2. Both Longford and Roscommon County Councils are investigating potential disposal locations and BNM is also investigating the suitability of one of their sites.</p><p>  3. Waterways Ireland has indicated its preparedness to carry out the trial dredge operation with the support of the Agency Group once the disposal requirements are determined by EPA. Progress has also been achieved in finalising the methodology and appropriate screening with WI, NPWS and IFI.</p><p>  4. The possible onset of deteriorating weather and water conditions is a concern for all agencies but they are confident that the trial dredge will proceed shortly.</p><p>  IFI, on behalf of the Agency Group, has kept local stakeholders advised of developments as they occur and will provide further update closer to the commencement of the trial operation. </p><p>  However, as emphasised in the response to Questions Nos. 1082 and 1083 of 4th November last, it is important that all understand that Asian Clam, like many other aquatic invasive species, is extremely pervasive in the environment, and once in a water body it is likely that operations will be focused on managing the infestation rather than eradication.</p><p>  I visited the site shortly after the outbreak was discovered and met local representatives and community leaders. I would commend them for their proactivity and positive engagement with the State Agencies in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

Currently, this is a 'straight-to-court' offence which attracts 5 penalty points on conviction.  The change I will be implementing shortly - by commencing section 10 of the Road Traffic Act 2014 - is to bring this offence within the Fixed Charge Payment System so that persons will have the option of receiving 3 penalty points on payment of the Fixed Charge rather than automatically being required to go to court.</p><p>  The RSA has overall responsibility for the operation, oversight and delivery of the National Car Test and as such, statistics relating to NCT waiting times at any particular test centre is a matter for the Authority.  I have therefore referred this aspect of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question to the RSA for direct reply.  Please advise my Office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days. </p><p>  I am advised that, while there is currently a high demand for car tests, the vast majority of car owners will receive an NCT appointment within 28 days.  Customers who need an early appointment are put on a priority list and get the test within this timescale. </p><p>  I also understand, from the RSA, that the availability of appointments on the NCT website is not a reflection of the total number of slots available for customers.  Customers are advised that if they cannot obtain a suitable slot online they should contact the NCTS call centre directly on (01) 4135992.</p><p>  To further facilitate demand, an NCT may now be undertaken up to 90 days in advance of the test due date without affecting the expiry date of the new certificate.  This system is in place to ensure that owners have ample time to have their vehicle tested before their current NCT certificate expires.  The RSA has run a significant advertising campaign since September to highlight this and informs me that it is in a favourable position to deal with current demand.</p></reply>

The remaining 95% comes from revenues from the services provided by the Authority such as driver licensing and National Car Testing.  The RSA has indicated that it will not draw down any of its Exchequer allocation for 2014. <br/><br/>In the period from August 2013 to August 2014, the Authority has been operating on a self-financing basis and did not draw down any Exchequer funding in this period.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.<br/><br/>The economic reality of recent years has meant significant reductions in roads budgets across the board and this has resulted in some grant programmes being curtailed, including the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes, in order to protect funding for road maintenance and repair. However it is open to Monaghan County Council to undertake drainage works on the R190 from its Restoration Improvement or Discretionary Grant programmes.<br/><br/>All funding for regional and local roads in 2014 has been fully allocated. I will announce the 2015 grants early in 2015.<br/><br/>It is important to reiterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement local authorities in their spending in this area and it is also open to Monaghan County Council to fund this work from its own resources. </p></reply>

This specifically includes independence in its decisions on what it funds and the amounts it allocates. Full information on the Council's funding decisions is made available on its website at <i>.</i><br/><br/>As a public body, the Arts Council is required to adhere to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's <i>Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies</i>and other practices of good governance and transparency.  Disbursal of funding is required to be fully in line with public service financial and accountability requirements. I understand that the Arts Council also requires the organisations it funds to comply with similar standards.<br/><br/>The Deputy will note that, on its website, the Arts Council commits to operating to the highest standards of corporate governance and has adopted a corporate governance regime in accordance with best practice, which includes a section on conflicts of interest. <br/><br/>I am confident that the Arts Council continues to discharge its duty as the principal State agency for the promotion and development of the arts in Ireland, in a strategic but transparent manner.</p></reply>
