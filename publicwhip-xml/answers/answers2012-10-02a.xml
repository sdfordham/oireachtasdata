The &lsquo;fair use&rsquo; doctrine was also to be examined to see if it would be appropriate in an Irish/EU context.  </p><p>  The Committee conducted an initial consultation during the summer of 2011 and received submissions from a broad spectrum of interested parties. It published a comprehensive Consultation Paper in February, 2012 which examined the current legislative framework. It set out issues raised in the submissions, and requested responses to specific questions.</p><p>  Further submissions were invited from those interested in these issues including Rights-holders, Collecting Societies, Intermediaries, Users, Entrepreneurs and Heritage Institutions. A public meeting was held on 24th March for the purpose of facilitating discussion in relation to the Consultation Paper.  In the region of 180 submissions were received in which many complex and substantial matters were raised and these are currently being appraised by the Committee.</p><p>  The Committee has indicted that it expects to submit its final Report containing recommendations and a draft Bill before March next year. Detailed consideration of the recommendations should then proceed immediately. As the number and complexity of proposals will not be known until then, nor whether detailed Regulatory Impact Analyses will be required, it is difficult to put a time frame on the process save to say that every effort will be made to have the matter expedited.</p></reply>

Previous Governments had become too dependent on a small number of sectors to support economic performance &ndash; an approach that was neither wise nor sustainable. </p><p>  This Government has set about transforming the economy, firstly by making fiscal and bank consolidation more job friendly, including through tax changes, asset sales and the creation of a stimulus package.  We have introduced the annual Action Plan for Jobs to support employment creation by the enterprise sector based on innovation, entrepreneurship and exporting.  We have also developed the Pathways to Work initiative to transform our engagement with those who are unemployed.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs has an ambition of supporting an extra 100,000 jobs in the economy by 2016.  The Plan contains 270 measures for delivery across all Government Departments, as well as 36 State agencies.     </p><p>  In spite of very difficult domestic and external economic environment, we are beginning to see the positive impact of the Government&rsquo;s policies.  2011 saw an increase of 6,000 jobs in IDA-supported companies, compared with net losses of 15,000 jobs between 2008 and 2010.  So far this year, the IDA has announced investments with the potential to create more than 6,000 further jobs as these projects come on stream.  </p><p>  Similarly, jobs in Enterprise Ireland companies started to grow again in 2011, for the first time in three years.  In the first eight months of 2012, a total of 4,669 job commitments over the next three years, linked to Enterprise Ireland approvals to client companies, have been secured.</p><p>  In spite of continued job losses in more traditional sectors such as Construction, and Financial, Insurance and Administrative activities, we are seeing a stabilisation in the level of private sector employment, particularly in areas targeted by the Action Plan for Jobs.</p><p>  It is particularly encouraging that exports from indigenous companies have been growing even faster than FDI and reached &euro;15.2 billion in exports in 2011 &ndash; the highest level ever. In spite of continued job losses in more traditional sectors such as Construction, and Financial, Insurance and Administrative activities, we are seeing stabilisation in the level of private sector employment.   However, the downgrading of growth forecasts in most of our trading partners will create a particularly challenging environment for the next 12 months.</p><p>  We are now working on the preparation of proposals for the Action Plan for Jobs 2013. I have had a number of constructive meetings and invite submissions for consideration.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-02a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012100200051#WRB01000"><p>The rise in youth unemployment as a result of the global economic downturn is a challenge for most EU countries.  Comparative figures from Eurostat show that Ireland had a youth unemployment rate of 30.5% at the end of last year.  The EU average was 22.1%, with several countries having a higher youth unemployment rate than Ireland.      </p><p><br />  The Government is tackling unemployment generally through the twin strategies of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work.  The aim of the Action Pan for Jobs is to support the creation of 100,000 net new jobs by 2016, while the objective of Pathways to Work is to ensure that as many of those jobs as possible go to those who are currently unemployed.  Many young people will benefit from the opportunities provided through these initiatives. </p><p><br />  The 2012 Action Plan for Jobs contains over 270 measures to be delivered across all 15 Government Departments and 36 State agencies.  Pathways to Work includes various training, education and work experience initiatives delivered by the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Social Protection.  </p><p><br />  Under Pathways to Work, the Department of Social Protection is committed to supporting over 85,000 job placement, work experience and Back to Education beneficiaries this year, including through the JobBridge internship programme.  To date, over 10,500 participants have commenced JobBridge placements, which by its nature, is very amenable to participation by young people.  Preliminary statistics compiled by the Department of Social Protection indicate that in the region of 40% of interns have secured jobs following their participation on JobBridge.  This number can be expected to grow as more interns finish their placements and more detailed data is gathered on outcomes from the programme. </p><p>The latest Quarterly National Household Survey, published by the CSO on 19 September, indicates that 66,500 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 years were unemployed in the second quarter of 2012. Under the National Employment Action Plan process, 35,400 people under 25 years of age were referred to the Employment Services last year. Of those referred, 62% of clients had signed off the Live Register by the end of the year.<font color="#004080">  </font>For the first eight months of this year, there were 23,700 referrals affecting 18,300 young jobseekers.    Over 18,000 persons aged 25 and under also completed a training course with F&Aacute;S in 2011.</p><p><br />  The Department of Education and Skills will provide over 450,000 education and training places this year under Pathways to Work, across the range of provision in the higher education, further education and training sectors. These places will include provision for school leavers.  The new &#8364;20 million Labour Market Education and Training Fund operated by the Department of Education &amp; Skills will also include specific provision for those under 25 years of age.</p></reply>

The system that developed over the last sixty years had become unwieldy and complex; it lacked consistency, involved long delays and in some cases proved expensive for users. </p><p>  In short the system was no longer fit for purpose and it was for this reason that I committed to delivering a root-and-branch reform with the objective of establishing a world-class Workplace Relations Service.  </p><p>  Significant progress has been made to date and I am happy to report that in the last year:</p><p>- Two public consultation processes were completed</p><p>- Two policy documents were published</p><p>- A new single contact portal has replaced the five separate entry points</p><p>- Complaints are now acknowledged, on average, within a week of receipt. This was previously taking up to eight months in some cases</p><p>- The employer is also notified, on average, within a week of the complaint being lodged thus increasing the possibility of a resolution being reached without the need for a hearing. Again this was taking up to eight months in some cases</p><p>-  There are now no backlogs for Rights Commissioner hearings</p><p>- A Single Complaint Form has replaced the 30 forms previously in use </p><p>- A new workplace relations interim website is in place</p><p>- A pilot Early Resolution Service is now seeking to resolve disputes at an early stage without the need for adjudication.</p><p>  In addition the Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill has been prepared and Government Approval for priority drafting of the Bill has been secured.</p><p>  I intend to progress the reform programme to the next stage with the same determination that has delivered the achievements to date.  I am working towards delivery of the new two-tier Workplace Relations structure so that from next year two statutorily independent bodies will replace the current five. </p><p>  In the meantime I intend to continue to progress the reform and bring about further enhancements for users of the services on an administrative basis in the coming months.</p></reply>

This number has been increasing continuously over recent years having been under 100,000 up to the start of 2009. Part-time underemployed people now account for over one-third (35.6%) of all people working on a part-time basis. </p><p>  Opportunities to access full-time jobs and up-skilling and further career development are essential to overcome involuntary part-time work and to provide individuals with the necessary means to maintain their employability and make transitions work.  </p><p>   It will be through transitioning the economy onto a competitive and sustainable path that greater employment opportunities will be created for those that are currently underemployed. The policies to address underemployment are not dissimilar to wider employment strategy. Assisting companies to win new markets, to innovate and grow are essential to overcome underemployment.  The Action Plan for Jobs concentrates on implementing changes to help promote entrepreneurship, improve access to finance, the capacity of our companies and educational institutions to innovate and build new sectors of opportunity.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-02a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1081" speakername="John Perry" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012100200051#WRB01600"><p>The latest official statistics available on business start-ups and closures were published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) in their Press Release on &#8220;<i>Business Demography 2010&#8221;</i>   which was published on 22 June 2012. </p><p><br />  These returns show that: </p><p>- During 2010, there were over 195,000 enterprises active in the private business economy in Ireland, with nearly 1.24 million persons engaged;</p><p>- During 2010, over 11,000 enterprises were created. </p><p>- During 2009, more than 24,000 businesses ceased resulting in a loss of nearly 35,000 jobs.</p><p><br />  Comparable CSO figures for 2011 will not become available until 2013.</p><p><br />  It is an unfortunate reality that companies for a wide range of reasons find themselves in difficulty and early intervention is critically important. For this reason, the Enterprise Development Agencies, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Shannon Development operate an early warning system, which has been in place for over ten years. When triggered, this mechanism brings the full capacity of the agency concerned to bear on whatever situation has arisen within the client company. This involves engaging closely with those client companies reporting difficulties or potential job losses to determine what appropriate proactive measures can be put in place by the Agency to prevent or minimise the job losses. </p><p><br />  Supporting SME&#8217;s in the current difficult economic climate is a key Government priority. Government actions to relieve pressure on small and medium sized businesses in the domestic economy are set out in the Action Plan for Jobs published in February 2012 and reported on quarterly.  </p><p><br />  In addition to the wide-range of programmes being delivered by the Enterprise Agencies, the Government is also focusing on other measures to address the challenge of access to finance being faced by SMEs. Last Thursday, my colleague Minister Richard Bruton launched the new Microfinance Loan Fund and we will shortly be launching the Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme.</p><p><br />  We are also ensuring that Enterprise Ireland progresses the Development Capital Scheme and the Innovation Fund.  This is real evidence of Government getting involved in filling gaps in the market and supporting viable businesses. </p><p><br />  We are making solid progress on this crucially important agenda and have already put place a number of measures that will make a practical difference in making it easier for businesses to grow and create jobs.   We will redouble our efforts in the coming year with the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 to ensure that we put in place policies that respond in a meaningful way to the many challenges faced by business on a daily basis.</p></reply>

It is employment-intensive and covers every community in the country.  Combined with wholesale, the sector employs 258,000 people in Ireland &ndash; that is almost 15% of our total workforce.  Recognising its importance to the economy, the Action Plan for Jobs includes a number of specific measures aimed at supporting employment in the retail sector in 2012.  These actions are for delivery across a number of Departments and agencies and include a renewed focus on prompt payments, an assessment of the potential for future development of the retail sector, the introduction of a statutory code of practice for grocery goods undertakings and the provision of support to retail firms seeking to internationalise.  Other more general measures in the Action Plan which will also help to support employment in the retail sector include improved access to finance for businesses, the enactment of legislation to reform the statutory wage setting mechanisms and the acceleration of the programme of revaluation of commercial premises, which will provide a basis for the adjustment in commercial rates.  Other initiatives which the Government introduced as part of the Jobs Initiative in May of last year will also continue to help support employment in the retail sector.  These include the halving of employer&rsquo;s PRSI on earnings up to &euro;356 per week and the reduction in the 13.5% VAT rate to 9% on certain goods and services.  I regularly meet representatives of the retail sector to hear about the challenges they face, including in relation to the costs of doing business.  My officials have also held separate discussions with retail representatives.  These engagements will assist us in implementing the commitments in the Action Plan for Jobs and in identifying any further actions that can be taken to support the retail sector.</p></reply>

In its most recent National Skills Bulletin, which was published on 25 July last, the Expert Group stated that it considers "skills shortages" to refer to a situation where there are an insufficient number of individuals who have the required qualifications, skills set, and/or experience to fill a particular post.  The Expert Group considers that current skills shortages almost entirely have third level qualification requirements, coupled with experience and a specific skills mix.  The National Skills Bulletin found that the magnitude of shortages is unlikely to be greater than several hundreds in terms of headcount for the overall economy, with the exception of IT skills where the demand is greater especially for experienced personnel who are in demand and short supply globally.   Job vacancies were most frequent for sales and related occupations, including marketing (especially digital marketing) and customer services roles.  Vacancies also arose for IT professionals, science and engineering professionals, business professionals, administrative occupations, IT associate professionals, and personal care occupations.  Language skills continue to be important, particularly for sales and customer service roles but also at a professional level (e.g. ICT, engineering and finance).</p><p>  The conclusions of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs with regard to the incidence of shortages in specialist skills categories that require a specific skill mix, and also in relation to the persistence of some difficult to fill vacancies, concur with my own experience based on continuing discussions with employers and their industry level representatives.  The Government has brought education and training to the heart of its Action Plan for Jobs.  Initiatives such as Springboard, the ICT Conversion Programme and the target to double the annual number of honours degree ICT graduates to 2,000 by 2018 are aimed at delivering the skills needed by enterprise. n Graduates from these programmes are available to industry and increasing numbers will qualify over the next 18 months.  We will continue to depend on inward migration for highly experienced specialists in ICT who are in short supply globally.  While these are small in number; their recruitment is linked to the additional hiring of a team of graduates and professional staff.  In the area of multilingual skills requirements, I met exporting companies when I launched the Expert Group Report on Key Skills for Enterprise to Trade Internationally.  I am working with the Minister, Deputy Quinn, in the context of the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 to address the specific recommendations in relation to sales and foreign language skills development as identified by companies.  My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Education and Skills to ensure our workforce is well aligned with the skills that employers need now and into the future.</p></reply>

Negotiations regarding the sale of the MBNA Ireland portfolio have culminated in its recent sale by BOA to Apollo Global Management, a leading global alternative investment manager headquartered in New York.   Apollo has more than US$75 billion in assets under management in private equity, credit-oriented capital markets and real estate funds invested across nine industries where the group has considerable knowledge and resources.  This transaction involves approximately 250 employees in Carrick-on-Shannon currently supporting the Irish portfolio transferring to Apollo, under Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations, in 2013 following a transitionary period for the remainder of 2012 and early 2013.  Apollo and BOA are currently finalising the sale contract.  BOA has not yet sold the UK MBNA portfolio which is the other business supported out of Carrick-on-Shannon.  IDA Ireland continues to monitor the situation closely and is providing relevant input into the process as it moves forward.  IDA is in regular contact with Bank of America management in Carrick-on-Shannon and Dublin and at corporate level to monitor developments and is also in contact with Apollo.  IDA last spoke with BOA MBNA management in Carrick-on-Shannon on 27 September 2012 and is scheduled to meet with the local management again in the first week of October.  IDA&rsquo;s understanding is that while BOA does not now expect to sell this UK MBNA portfolio in the short term, the process remains ongoing and a potential deal could materialise at any time.</p></reply>

To this end, there is ongoing dialogue between the relevant Ministers North and South in all areas to promote economic development in the Border region.  From my own perspective, I attend meetings in the trade and business development sectoral format of the North-South Ministerial Council which are held twice a year.  I also attend two meetings each year of the North-South Plenary which are hosted by either the Taoiseach or the First and Deputy First Ministers.  At these meetings, there is full engagement with Northern Ministers, particularly at the sectoral meetings where I have face-to-face discussions with my NI counterpart, Ms Arlene Foster MLA, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, on issues around cross-Border trade and on the work of InterTrade Ireland, the North-South Implementation Body whose remit is to "exchange information and co-ordinate work on trade, business development and related matters in areas where the two administrations specifically agree it would be in their mutual interest".  InterTrade Ireland is co-funded by my Department and its counterpart in Northern Ireland.  I look forward to meeting Minister Foster again at the next trade and business development sectoral meeting scheduled to be held on 28 November 2012.</p><p>  My officials engage in ongoing dialogue with their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and keep me informed of all key North-South related issues including the North-South activities of the enterprise development agencies.  In fact, there is a long history of co-operative action between North-South enterprise agencies to achieve mutual benefits.  The enterprise development agencies North and South of the Border have for many years co-operated where this has added value to their activities, and this collaboration has greatly increased in recent years.  Enterprise Ireland, which stimulates the development of indigenous enterprise, has extensive contact with its Northern counterparts and works with them on a range of programmes.  IDA Ireland collaborates with Invest Northern Ireland, for example, in the Northwest Now initiative.  More recently, there have been very positive developments where a wide range of agencies and institutions now co-operate on science and technology issues, including participation in the EU Research Framework Programme.  In addition, my Department provides funding support for enterprise-themed Interreg projects jointly approved with the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment.  Through Interreg, my Department has supported a number of North-South projects, including enterprise networking for the Border counties and Northern Ireland, capacity-building initiatives and several other enterprise development projects.   The process of assessing further Interreg projects for joint funding is ongoing.  The Government, along with the enterprise development agencies, will continue to work diligently with the Northern Ireland Executive and its agencies to increase the economic benefits accruing from cross-Border co-operation.</p></reply>

It was established to implement the &quot;Ideas Programme&quot; of the Seventh European Union Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7).  Its main aim is to stimulate scientific excellence by supporting and encouraging the very best, truly creative scientists, scholars and engineers to be adventurous and take risks in their research.  Being investigator-driven or bottom-up in nature, the ERC approach allows researchers to identify new opportunities and directions in any field of research.  To date, Irish researchers have won ERC awards totalling &#8364;34 million.  While this is not insignificant, there is certainly scope for improvement and I am confident that we will see more success in ERC grants by the end of FP7.  To get a better appreciation of Irish researchers' performance in securing EU funding one has to look at the success rate across FP7 as a whole.  Funding from the ERC is only one part (14.87%) of the overall FP7 budget of &#8364;50 billion over the 2007-13 period.  Since the commencement of FP7 in January 2007 to June 2012, Irish researchers have won awards under the Programme totalling &#8364;438 million, representing a success rate of 21.78%.  This is above the EU average success rate of 20.72%.  This shows that overall Ireland continues to perform very creditably <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> other EU Member States and that we remain on track to secure our target of &#8364;600 million from FP7.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-02a.58.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012100200052#WRC01800"><p>The requirement for an employer to provide additional compensation to employees for Sunday work has not been removed.  The obligation to provide a Sunday Premium is derived from Section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 (OWT).  In summary, while the OWT Act specifies the means by which an employer should provide a premium for Sunday working, the nature and value of the premium rate is a matter for negotiation and agreement between the employer and trade union(s) representing employees or between the employer and employees who are affected by Sunday trading, in circumstances where employees are not unionised.  Thus, under section 14 any employee who is required to work on a Sunday, and his or her having to work on that day has not been taken account of in the determination of pay, shall be compensated by the payment to the employee of a reasonable allowance having regard to all the circumstances; or by increasing the employee&rsquo;s rate of pay by a reasonable amount having regard to all the circumstances; or by granting the employee reasonable paid time off from work having regard to all the circumstances; or by a combination of two or more of the above.</p><p>  Prior to the High Court ruling in the Grace Fried Chicken case that resulted in the striking down of all Employment Regulation Orders, many EROs had provided premium payments to those required to work on Sundays.  Where EROs had made provision for a Sunday premium, they had only prescribed the level of monetary compensation (e.g. double time; time plus one-third) and had excluded the possibility of the use of the other options under section 14 of the OWT Act.  These provisions were a source of significant concern to employers in sectors in which Sunday is a normal working day.  In some cases, such as the hospitality sector, it is the day of greatest demand for the services provided.  The Duffy-Walsh report accepted that there was validity in the argument that the arrangements in place in JLC sectors with regard to Sunday working were unduly burdensome, particularly in sectors in which Sunday is a normal working day.  In its decision, the High Court had particular regard to the absence of consistency across sectors in relation to such matters as to the requirement to pay a Sunday Premium and a confusion between what had been established in statute for universal application and what was being imposed through EROs.</p><p>  In this context, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 provides for a new definition of &quot;remuneration&quot; for the purposes of formulating proposals for EROs.  The proposed new statutory definition will ensure that JLCs will no longer set Sunday premium rates or any other conditions of employment already covered by universal standards provided for in existing legislation.  Workers' entitlements to a Sunday Premium will, of course, continue to be reserved under Section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  To complement the removal of the Sunday Premium from the purview of JLCs, I have requested the Labour Relations Commission to develop a Code of Practice on Sunday Working in those sectors covered by JLCs.  The development of this Code will complement the provisions at Section 14 of the OWT Act and ensure that best practices are operated by all employers for those employees who are currently covered by JLCs and who work in sectors where Sunday working is widely practised.</p></reply>

CSO figures show that the strong export performance is continuing.  On a seasonally adjusted basis, goods exports in July increased by 6% on the June figure.  The statistics also show that the seasonally adjusted trade surplus, at just under &#8364;4 billion, increased by over 12% in July as compared to June; and that exports in July 2012, at almost &#8364;8 billion, showed a 13% increase over the July 2011 figure.  This is the latest in a growing list of positive signs in the international environment.  I am determined, through continued implementation of the Government&#8217;s Action Plan for Jobs, to ensure we can accelerate the transition to a sustainable economy, keep growing our exports and create the jobs we need.  <font color="#212100">Central to the Action Plan is ensuring greater access for Irish companies to real opportunities to break into new markets, grow their exports and create much needed jobs for this economy.  In 2011, jobs in exporting companies started to grow again for the first time after three years of contraction,</font> with 21,800 gross gains in full time jobs in Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland supported companies.  <font color="#212100">The Government is determined to build on this in 2012 by improving supports like the establishment of the new Potential Exporters Division in Enterprise Ireland.  Its role is to stimulate greater activity within companies across all regions and to reorient those demonstrating real growth potential from the domestic to the international market place.</font></p><p><br />  Enterprise Ireland&#8217;s 29 overseas offices and international networks have an important role to play in the internationalisation of its established and start-up client companies, through positioning them to meet the needs of specific international market and guiding them in the right direction regarding market contacts and introductions to potential buyers.  <font color="#212100">On 17 September last, I launched Enterprise Ireland's Annual International Markets Week.  This event is Enterprise Ireland&#8217;s single largest client event and a significant part of Enterprise Ireland&#8217;s strategy to drive Irish exports to support business growth and jobs in Ireland.  During the course of the week, 697 client companies held 2,273 meetings with export advisers to discuss their international growth strategies and help them break into export markets.  This event gives Irish companies the opportunity to discuss and explore their international growth strategies with Enterprise Ireland's team of overseas market advisers and agree specific actions, which Enterprise Ireland will undertake on their behalf in international markets.</font><font color="#212100">Government policy is to build on the strength of our existing markets and diversify into new ones.  Ministerial-led Trade Missions are an integral part of this process, particularly in countries where government-to-government contracts are a prerequisite for doing business and I have first-hand experience of the importance of these Trade Missions for Irish companies seeking to win overseas contracts.</font></p></reply>

The Annual Rate of Valuation (ARV) is decided by the elected members of each Local Authority in their annual budget.  Conscious of the need to minimise the costs that impact on business, the Minister earlier this year asked all Local Authorities to exercise restraint in setting their 2012 ARVs.  Local Authorities have responded positively.  All but one Local Authority froze or reduced its rate this year.  The one Local Authority that increased its ARV was legally required to do so following the extension of a town boundary.  In order to help businesses to be competitive, we must strive to keep all other costs on businesses as low as possible.  The Action Plan for Jobs contains a range of measures designed to achieve cost reductions across the whole of Government and to support business.</p></reply>

Supporting new and existing indigenous and foreign-owned businesses, across all regions, is central to our plans for recovery, growth and jobs.  The Action Plan for Jobs contains a number of measures which are aimed specifically at the facilitation and incentivisation of national enterprise development from start-ups to growth companies.  The action plan is a whole-Government plan with a national focus across all regions.  The Enterprise Development agencies will be at the forefront of implementing the Action Plan for Jobs across all regions and will ensure enterprises can maximise their contribution to economic and jobs growth.  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy document, Horizon 2020, sets out the agency&rsquo;s targets for the 2010-14 period.  These targets include creating 63,000 new jobs in Ireland over that time and securing 50% of these investments to locations outside Dublin and Cork.  The agency has invested heavily in the provision of property solutions tailored to meet the requirements of investors and has developed a network of high-quality Business Parks in locations throughout the Midlands and West regions.  There are a total of 120 IDA-supported companies employing over 17,500 people between both regions reflecting the considerable success that has been achieved in attracting high quality investment to both regions.</p><p>  A total of nearly &euro;15 million was paid to Enterprise Ireland client companies in the Midland and Western regions in 2011, supporting more than 18,000 jobs.  Of the 92 High Potential Start-ups assisted by Enterprise Ireland throughout the country in 2011, four are based in the Midlands region and eight in the West.  As part of our support for early stage entrepreneurs, I announced an investment of &euro;50,000 by Enterprise Ireland in each of four start-up companies in the West Region on 25 September 2012.  In addition, the Taoiseach announced the &euro;200,000 Competitive Feasibility Fund for the West Region.  Support of up to 50% of eligible expenditure up to &euro;25,000 per project is available and 17 October is the application deadline.  Following Exporting Awareness Events last March and May in Athlone and Galway respectively, further Get Export Ready Workshops were held in Athlone in April and in Galway in June and July 2012, with another event planned for 23 October 2012 in Tullamore.  Community Enterprise Centres located in both regions were approved funding under the Community Enterprise Centre Business Development Funding.  This programme supports funding of the creation of, or maintenance of, a business development function within the enterprise centres concerned.  </p><p>  In 2012, County and City Enterprise Boards in the Midlands and Western regions have allocated approximately &euro;900,000 in support of over 100 Micro Enterprise Projects.  The Micro Finance Loan Scheme, which was launched last week, will initially facilitate &euro;40 million in additional lending to businesses employing not more than ten people over the next five years, with provision for the scheme to be extended to provide an additional &euro;50 million of lending over a further five years at that point.  Start-ups, sole traders and existing micro-enterprises will be eligible to apply for a loan under the Scheme.  In addition, the Credit Guarantee Scheme will also facilitate &euro;150 million per annum in additional lending for SMEs who, because of a lack of collateral or because of the sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing traditional bank credit.  I am confident that the activities and initiatives being delivered by the Enterprise Development agencies and the County and City Enterprise Boards in both regions will continue to promote investment and employment opportunities among the communities concerned.  These will be kept under review as part of the Action Plan for Jobs of 2013.</p></reply>

Investment aid is intended to promote the economic development of certain disadvantaged areas within the European Union in order to redress regional disparities.  The current Regional Aid Map for 2007-13 was drawn up in accordance with the Commission&#8217;s Regional Aid Guidelines.  The details of the support in terms of aid intensity for each county are available on my Departments website.</p><p><br />  Under the approved map, Kerry, Limerick, Clare, North Tipperary and the Cork Urban Regeneration area retained entitlement to Regional Aid from 2007 to 2013 for small and medium sized firms at the higher aid rates permitted for such firms under the Regional Aid Guidelines. </p><p><br />  The process of Member States agreeing the 2014-2021 Regional Aid Guidelines has begun. The Commission is due to forward proposals to Member States in the coming months documenting the structure and provisions that will form the basis of the revised Guidelines. My Department is leading an interagency group that is currently examining issues around the new guidelines, including which counties could be included in the next map.  The group will be examining all counties without prejudice as to their status in the revised group. </p><p><br />  In accordance with its Horizon 2020 Strategy, IDA Ireland is aiming to create 63,000 direct jobs in 640 investments over the period 2010 to 2014, with 50% of these investments located outside of Dublin and Cork.  The Agency has pointed out that, as it competes for high quality foreign direct investment (FDI), the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services. Ireland has only one Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area, so, in order to achieve regional economic development, IDA prioritises the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass (i.e. sufficient scale of population, skills, infrastructure, companies, business services etc.) and highlights the opportunities provided by other locations on an opportunistic basis, which are within commuting distances of these Gateways. The Gateways in the Mid-West and South West Regions include Limerick and Cork.  With continuing enhancement and improvements in physical and digital infrastructure, an FDI project secured for one Gateway Economic Region has a positive impact on other Gateway Economic Regions and their surrounding areas.</p><p><br />  At the end of 2011 there were 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kerry<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  employing in the region of 1,300 people. IDA Ireland has assured me that it will continue to promote Kerry in response to specific client queries and on an opportunistic basis. Approximately 70% of all FDI secured for Ireland is from the existing base of multinationals.  Accordingly, IDA Ireland has retained strong relationships with its existing client base across the country and will continue to work closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and the broadening of their mandate with a view to continuing re-investment in their sites. </p><p><br />  When IDA becomes aware that one of its client companies is considering downsizing or closing down its activities in Ireland, IDA engages with senior management in the company is question, both at local and corporate level, in an effort to persuade that company to alter its decision.  However, in all cases it is the company who makes the final decision.</p></reply>

This report benchmarks business costs against a range of Ireland&rsquo;s key competitor countries in a number of key areas, such as labour costs, property costs, utility costs and business and professional services.  The report also provides an analysis of cost profiles of the manufacturing and services sectors.  </p><p>  In its most recent Cost of Doing Business report, published in 2011, the NCC identified improvements in Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, particularly in relation to labour costs and property costs.  However, the NCC also advised that further progress is required to ensure that Irish enterprises can compete internationally. </p><p>  Some operating costs for business are largely outside the control of Government.  For example, fuel and energy prices are primarily driven by external factors such as global fossil fuel prices.  However, the Government&rsquo;s approach has been to identify those areas of policy it can influence to bring about cost reductions or provide supports to business.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 includes an extensive range of measures across Government which will help to reduce costs and support job creation.  These include:</p><p>- Reforming the statutory wage setting mechanisms;</p><p>- Reducing the administrative burden on business;</p><p>- Placing downward pressure on insurance costs through the enactment of the Legal Services Bill;</p><p>- Encouraging all professionals to supply quotes in advance to business customers; and</p><p>- Encouraging local authorities to exercise restraint in the setting of commercial rates.</p><p>  The Government is making good progress on implementing the Action Plan for Jobs.  All of the 160 measures for delivery in the first half of the year have been implemented.  </p><p>  The Government will continue to deliver on its commitments in the Action Plan for Jobs, to work towards the objective of supporting an extra 100,000 jobs in the economy by 2016 and making Ireland the best small country in which to do business. </p></reply>

A number of sectors have potential to progress clustering, particularly in the guise of collaborative industry-led networks which seek to identify mutual objectives which if tackled collaboratively, can have a positive impact on the capability of companies to grow and create employment, wherever they are located. Clustering can be geographically focused, but with advanced technologies and communications, it can be sectorally focussed and operate across regions.  Collaboration between companies is a proven method of enhancing economic performance. Benefits of collaboration include: enhanced productivity and income; increased market share; increased innovation and knowledge transfer; and enhanced capability.</p><p>  One of the Action Points (2.4) in the Plan is to support industry-led clustering in key areas of opportunity, based on new models, industry proposals, and newly developed niche market strategies and in July last, I announced a new &euro;2m pilot Clustering Programme designed to promote cooperation between businesses and create more jobs.  The Programme is a joint agency initiative, involving Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Forf&aacute;s.  The goal of this Programme is to support time limited collaborative projects that will achieve measurable benefits to members of the group by addressing the needs of participant companies e.g. sectoral/sub-sectoral development initiatives, supply-chain optimisation, realising economies of scale, exploring export market opportunities and potential convergence opportunities.</p><p>  Projects must involve a minimum of five companies.  The initiative is aimed at a broad range of businesses serviced by the Enterprise Development Agencies.  Clusters will also be encouraged to seek to find members from other jurisdictions, including Northern Ireland.  </p><p>  Clusters are proven catalysts of change and companies engaging in collaborative activities can improve their productivity and compete more effectively in domestic and overseas markets, thereby sustaining and creating much needed jobs across the economy.</p><p>  This pilot programme offers two phases of funding support: Phase 1 Feasibility and Phase 2 Facilitation.  29 applications were received in the first call, which closed on 18 September, of which 22 were for Phase 1 support and 7 were for Phase 2 support. The applications received represent a broad range of companies from across different regions, industry sectors and State Agencies.  Applications are currently being reviewed, by a committee comprising of officials from EI, IDA and Forf&aacute;s, and funding will be awarded to successful applicants in October/November.</p></reply>

Work has already commenced on this Strategy, and initial consultations have taken place with key stakeholders.  I expect the Strategy to be completed by the end of this year.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) is assisting Construction companies to expand their presence in key geographic territories, to target project opportunities in emerging markets in the Middle East and Africa as well as helping them access other international market opportunities.</p><p>  To achieve these objectives, Enterprise Ireland has in place a range of direct supports to assist established client companies including those in the Construction sector.  EI maintains a network of offices to ensure it reaches out to support entrepreneurs and established companies throughout the country.

Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s proposals for 2013 are currently under consideration by the agency and have not yet been finalised. Once finalised Enterprise Ireland will submit these proposals to me and to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, reflecting the close involvement of both our Departments in trade-related matters. The proposed schedule will take account of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU that will place particular demands on Ministerial time during the first half of 2013.   For the remainder of 2012, a number of trade missions are planned that will include emerging markets such as Brazil, South Africa, India and Malaysia/Vietnam as well as to Italy, Japan, the UK and Canada where our exporters are already well established. Their purpose is to bring Irish businesses into direct contact with business opportunities abroad.  Such missions are a valuable support to Irish businesses, in terms of establishing their credibility with and gaining access to the business community in the target market. This is particularly the case in countries where government-to-government contacts are a prerequisite for doing business. These trade missions are an integral part of the work of relevant Government Departments and Agencies to develop and expand Ireland&rsquo;s exports to existing and new markets. They raise Ireland&rsquo;s profile as a world&ndash;class supplier of goods and services and contribute to the generation of incremental sales to foreign markets over the long-term. </p></reply>

This improvement is apparent across all sectors.  However, the International Services sector in particular shows a net increase of 3,752 in the numbers employed in 2011.  It is also worth noting that the net change in the Manufacturing Sector showed only a slight reduction in numbers employed in 2011 in comparison to losses of almost 38,000 sustained in the previous three years.</p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs identifies a number of key targeted sectors in the Manufacturing and Services areas with the potential to create significant sustainable employment.  The Action Plan identifies the challenges facing each sector and sets out the measures required to ensure these sectors achieve their potential.  Ensuring that all of the measures in the 2012 Action Plan - and in the Action Plans for subsequent years - are implemented will provide the best means of ensuring that employment opportunities are maximised in each sector.</p><p><b>Full-Time Job Gains and Job Losses in Enterprise Agencies assisted companies</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>-</b></th><th><b>-</b></th><th><b>                                 2008</b></th><th><b>                                   2009</b></th><th><b>                                   2010</b></th><th><b>                                    2011</b></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Job Gains</td><td><div>10,240</div></td><td><div>6,794</div></td><td><div>8,167</div></td><td><div>9,042</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Job Losses</td><td><div>-20,327</div></td><td><div>-28,711</div></td><td><div>-14,289</div></td><td><div>-9,423</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Manufacturing</b></td><td>Net Change</td><td><div>-10,087</div></td><td><div>-21,917</div></td><td><div>-6,122</div></td><td><div>-381</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Job Gains</td><td><div>8,856</div></td><td><div>5,099</div></td><td><div>8,932</div></td><td><div>8,625</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Job Losses</td><td><div>-7,055</div></td><td><div>-12,735</div></td><td><div>-7,429</div></td><td><div>-4,873</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>International Services</b></td><td>Net Change</td><td><div>1,801</div></td><td><div>-7,636</div></td><td><div>1,503</div></td><td><div>3,752</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Job Gains</td><td><div>2,764</div></td><td><div>1,011</div></td><td><div>1,536</div></td><td><div>2,085</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Job Losses</td><td><div>-1,169</div></td><td><div>-1,976</div></td><td><div>-1,672</div></td><td><div>-1,257</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Financial Services</b></td><td>Net Change</td><td><div>1,595</div></td><td><div>-965</div></td><td><div>-136</div></td><td><div>828</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Job Gains</td><td><div>1,624</div></td><td><div>1,058</div></td><td><div>1,753</div></td><td><div>1,286</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Job Losses</td><td><div>-1,800</div></td><td><div>-3,903</div></td><td><div>-2,412</div></td><td><div>-1,046</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Other Sectors</b></td><td>Net Change</td><td><div>-176</div></td><td><div>-2,845</div></td><td><div>-659</div></td><td><div>240</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Overall</b></td><td>Net Change</td><td><div>-6,867</div></td><td><div>-33,363</div></td><td><div>-5,414</div></td><td><div>4,439</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

In addition, Government is making sure that Enterprise Ireland continuous to administer the Development Capital Scheme and the Innovation Fund.  This is real evidence of Government getting involved in filling gaps in the market and supporting viable businesses. </p><p>  We are making solid progress on this crucially important agenda and have already put place a number of measures that will make a practical difference in making it easier for businesses to grow and create jobs.   We will redouble our efforts in the coming year with the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 to ensure that we deliver all possible support to business and relieve as much pressure as possible from business at this difficult time.</p></reply>

The quality of transitions will determine the quality of a worker's career and the smooth functioning of the labour market. </p><p>  Ireland has a comprehensive body of employment rights legislation which has among its objectives the protection of employees and the quality of transitions between different contractual arrangements. Specific areas covered by employment protection legislation include: </p><p>- Protection of part-time work</p><p>- Protection of fixed-term work </p><p>- Protection of temporary work</p><p>- Protection of persons engaged by temporary work agencies. </p><p>- Working time;</p><p>- Payment of Wages;</p><p>- Holidays;</p><p>- National Minimum Wage;</p><p>- Unfair Dismissal;</p><p>- Redundancy Payments;</p><p>- Protection of Young Persons;</p><p>- Transfer of Undertakings.</p><p>  In general, Irish legislation mirrors the broader EU social protection framework in this area. The increase recorded in the August Live Register in the movement of unemployed persons into casual or part time work does facilitate labour market entry.  Opportunities for up-skilling and further career development are essential to advance the inclusive growth objective and to provide individuals with the necessary means to maintain their employability and make transitions work. </p></reply>

I travelled to Waterford in June last to meet the members of the South-East Forum and I was heartened to hear of the progress being made.   </p><p><br />  Foremost amongst these has been that Enterprise Ireland has supported the establishment of the <i>Eishtec</i>   Call Centre in Waterford city, where employment had reached 230.  This is a very significant achievement and other recent initiatives by Enterprise Ireland in the region included the approval of 14 high quality projects under their competitive feasibility fund, 12 companies being been approved for Graduate Placement. 5 Community Enterprise Centres having been approved for funding for full-time business development managers and a high take-up of the Enterprise Ireland Innovation Voucher scheme in Waterford.</p><p><br />  The two local County Enterprise boards, in the city and county, have created 59 new jobs and the South East Regional Authority has secured EU funding for a number of enterprise and innovation-focussed projects.</p><p><br />  F&Aacute;S training services having provided training for about 5,000 people and that Agency is also undertaking a wide range of other training initiatives.  Several tourist initiatives are underway in the region and Science Foundation Ireland has funded 8 research awards to Waterford Institute of Technology.</p><p><br />  Other developments include the first phase of the &#8364;23 million Belview Strategic Water Supply Scheme which was officially opened in February 2012. This will facilitate industrial development and job creation in Kilkenny and the South East. The total investment for this phase of the scheme is &#8364;13m. In March 2012, McDonald&#8217;s Ireland and Dawn Meats announced that Dawn Meats had been awarded a 5 year &#8364;300 million contract to process up to 18,000 tonnes of Irish beef annually for McDonald&#8217;s. The deal has led Dawn Meats to invest &#8364;14.5 million in a new purpose built, state of the art, beef processing facility in Carroll&#8217;s Cross, Co Waterford, creating 65 new jobs. This investment is supported by Enterprise Ireland. </p><p><br />  I look forward to on-going co-operation and collaboration between all the various stakeholders across the South East region to pursue the Action Plan recommendations. </p></reply>

This legislation provides for certain statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions. </p><p>  The State provides a number of mechanisms through which these statutory employment rights can be vindicated and enforced. These are provided through the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), The Rights Commissioner Service, The Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT), The Equality Tribunal and the Labour Court.</p><p>  NERA seeks to secure compliance with employment rights legislation through the provision of education and awareness as well as through routine and complaint driven inspection of employers&rsquo; employment records.  NERA also undertakes enforcement activity.  Where an employer has been identified as being in breach of the legislation NERA will request that the employer rectify the breach.  Where such a breach involves underpayment of wages due to an employee NERA will seek rectification for the employee by seeking payment of the monies due. Where an employer fails or refuses to rectify the breach or repay monies due NERA may initiate a prosecution. </p><p>  Where people have concerns that workers may be exploited or are receiving less than their statutory entitlements the matter should be reported to NERA for investigation.</p><p>  In other cases complaints may be made to Rights Commissioner Service, the EAT, the Equality Tribunal or the Labour Court depending on the nature of the complaint and the relevant legislation. The relevant body will convene a hearing where both parties will be afforded the opportunity to present their case and the relevant body will issue a determination or recommendation.</p><p>  It has to be acknowledged that the system that has developed over the years has become complex and in some cases involves long delays. However, I have commenced a root-and-branch reform with the objective of establishing a world-class Workplace Relations Service.  I am happy to report that significant progress has been made to date in that regard.  </p><p>  In addition to reforming the structures and processes, I also intend to provide for enhanced compliance measures and a new mechanism for enforcing awards of the Adjudicators and of Labour Court Determinations. </p><p>  The mechanisms I have outlined above relate to people who are legally entitled to work in the state. A situation where an individual, whose immigration status prohibits him or her from working legally in the State, takes up employment and is thus working illegally is different. In such cases both the employer and the employee may be committing an offence.  As the Deputy will be aware, from a recent High Court case, this may prevent a worker in such circumstances from seeking to benefit from the rights laid down in statute. </p><p>  While NERA, and other authorities, could pursue convictions regarding an employer in breach of certain employment legislation and employment permits legislation, in cases where the employment is illegal, and may succeed in securing penalties on the employer, they are not in a position to seek redress for the employee in such circumstances.  This is because a contract may be unenforceable if it is drawn up for an illegal purpose or in an illegal manner, or if the contract is prohibited by statute whether expressly or implicitly. </p><p>  On Friday 31st August 2012, Mr Justice Gerard Hogan of the High Court reversed a Labour Court award on the basis that person concerned had no standing to invoke the protection afforded by employment legislation since any contract of employment was an illegal one in the absence of an employment permit which he did not have. Justice Hogan therefore held that the Labour Court could not lawfully have made the awards as the employment contract was substantively illegal.</p><p>  The issue raised by the High Court judgment is one which has important policy and legal implications in the area of Employment Permits and also in terms of Employment Rights.</p><p>  As Justice Hogan noted in his judgement, &ldquo;the Oireachtas must, of course, regulate the labour market by specifically deterring illegal immigrants from taking up employment, as failure to do so could have serious medium term implications for both employment and immigration policy&rdquo;. The relevant provisions of the Employment Permits Acts of 2003 and 2006 hold that where an employee, who was required to hold an Employment Permit, has failed to do so then he or she is guilty of an offence. Furthermore, while an employer may also be guilty of an offence in this matter, Justice Hogan points out that the legislation provides for a defence with regard to an employer but fails to do so with regard to an employee.</p><p>  As I understand it, this lack of defence affects the Courts&rsquo; scope to interpret the statutory provisions and compels the Court to hold that the legislation has created an absolute offence so far as an employee is concerned. Importantly, Justice Hogan found that it must therefore be taken that the Oireachtas intended that a such a non-national employee automatically commits an offence if he or she does not have a work permit irrespective of the reasons for that failure and that this has implications so far as the civil law is concerned, in that such a contract of employment must also be taken to be void.</p><p>  The question which now arises is to what extent illegal immigrants should be dissuaded from working illegally in Ireland by virtue of there being a statutory offence to do so, versus, to what extent certain employment rights shall protect vulnerable migrants who find themselves unwittingly in such employment positions. </p><p>  The Deputy will recognise that this question requires careful consideration as the applicability of rights in one context can have far reaching consequences beyond that originally intended.</p><p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that I am very concerned by the facts of this case and I will be meeting the individual concerned this week. My Department is treating the matter with the utmost importance and various policy options are currently being considered with a view to an early response.</p></reply>

Regular meetings of the Transport Sectoral Council are held, where transport issues, including investment, are discussed. The next Transport Sectoral is due to take place on 5 October 2012.</p><p>  In relation to the A5 cross-border roads project, as the Deputy will be aware in 2006 the previous Fianna F&aacute;il led Government gave a commitment to co-fund the construction of the A5.  However, they made no provision to meet the costs of the A5 post 2012 in either the Four Year Plan or the Infrastructure Investment Priorities Plan 2010 to 2016.  Given that &pound;400 million sterling was due to fall between 2013 and 2016 and given the current state of the country&rsquo;s Exchequer, it was not feasible to provide this level of funding in the coming years.</p><p>  Therefore at the NSMC Plenary meeting on 8th November 2011, Ministers noted that the provision of further funding by the Irish Government for the A5 road was being deferred but that the Irish Government will provide &pound;25m per annum in 2015 and 2016 towards the project.  At the subsequent June 2012 NSMC Plenary meeting, it was noted that the N.I. Executive had announced an investment package of major roads including two sections of the A5 project.  In addition it was noted that the Irish Government remains committed to the completion of the co-funded A5 project which is of strategic importance to the North West Region and the island as a whole, but that the Government is not in a position to making funding commitments for the period past 2016 in advance of its consideration of the next capital review framework.  The NSMC Plenary did approve a funding implementation plan for the A5 project to the end of 2016 which incorporated the &pound;50m committed by the Irish Government.</p></reply>

are designed to offset the additional costs that arise for officers when they are temporarily posted abroad.  These arrangements are common to Foreign Services throughout the world.  The system operated by the Department is in line with that used by many other countries and has three main components.</p><p>Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) is designed to defray costs associated with living in cities where the cost of living is higher than in Dublin, based on data provided by an independent external consultancy.  Because the COLA is linked to salary and notional net take-home pay it has been reduced in line with salary reductions in the civil service and with increases in taxation in recent years.</p><p>Local Post Allowance (LPA) provides assistance towards the additional indirect costs arising from the representative role of officers.  This allowance, which varies according to marital status and grade, is payable at all locations abroad.

As the Presidency approaches, the issues that will be high on the EU agenda are becoming clearer, and across Government, Ministers are working to identify their key priorities.  These will be outlined in detail in the Irish Presidency programme that will be published in December 2012.  As Presidency, the Irish Government is focusing on measures to boost Europe's global competitiveness, stimulate sustainable economic growth and, above all, to promote jobs.  This will be delivered through high-level political engagement and dedicated work to reinforce the EU legislative agenda.</p><p>  Our Presidency will be about delivery and implementation.  The Government will seek agreement on those aspects of the Multiannual Financial Framework that remain outstanding following the Cypriot Presidency and will take forward the necessary implementing legislation to cover the 2014-2020 period.  The EU should be fit for purpose and properly resourced to that end.  We will work to ensure that.</p><p>  It will be critically important for Ireland and for the future development of the EU that reform of the Common Agriculture Policy and of the Common Fisheries Policy is advanced.  Progress should also be made on initiatives such as Horizon 2020 (the EU's future framework programme for research and innovation) which will be crucial for the EU's economic development.  This week the Government will meet the College of Commissioners in Brussels to discuss Ireland's Presidency programme and how priority issues across a range of sectors will be advanced.</p></reply>

But that time is not unlimited.&rdquo;  This is consistent with the serious, patient and protracted efforts of the United States Government over many years, working closely with the European Union and the Governments of Russia and China, to engage Iran in a diplomatic dialogue to resolve the serious concerns surrounding Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme - concerns which are shared by Ireland, by the EU, by the wider international community, and by the International Atomic Energy Agency. All recent reporting and analysis of the issue has acknowledged continuing US efforts to discourage any immediate recourse to military action against Iranian sites.</p><p>  The Government, in concert with our European partners, fully support a diplomatic solution to this issue.  Furthermore, the Government has equally and consistently been clear in advocating with EU and international partners that it is only through the path of diplomatic negotiations that the serious issues arising from Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme can be resolved. It is regrettable that thus far Iran has not been willing to engage in negotiations on the issue with the necessary seriousness and commitment. We hope very much that this will change.</p></reply>

Under this concept, each individual State has the primary responsibility for the protection of its citizens.  It must ensure their safety and security and work to prevent atrocities such as genocide, ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity and war crimes &ndash; atrocities which have caused the concept of &ldquo;responsibility to protect&rdquo; to be developed in the first instance.  Any objective appraisal of what has occurred in Syria over the past eighteen months will conclude that the Syrian Government has failed utterly in this basic responsibility.  I pointed out in my address to the UN General Assembly on 28 September that the Assad Government is guilty of wholesale slaughter of its own people.  I also made clear that, while the violence is indiscriminate and on an appalling scale, it is not confined to one side.</p><p>  If the concept of &ldquo;responsibility to protect&rdquo; is to have any meaning or relevance for the Syrian people, it is incumbent on the UN Security Council, as the body charged with the maintenance of international peace and security under the UN Charter, to act with one voice in seeking to promote the earliest possible ceasefire and initiation of a political process leading to transition.  That is why I also made clear in my address to the General Assembly that what is now needed, above all else, is a strong Security Council resolution which will authorise targeted sanctions.  This must include a comprehensive arms embargo, against all those who are responsible for violating the human rights of the Syrian people.  That is what the Syrian people want from us, and what they have a right to expect.</p><p>  There must also be full accountability for human rights abuses.  To prevent further atrocities now, and to save lives now, we must make it clear that atrocities will not go unpunished.  That is why Ireland supports the call by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, by Switzerland and others for the Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.  We will continue working to build up strong cross-regional support within the UN context for such a referral.</p><p>  The Government will continue to work closely with the UN and international partners to bring about the earliest possible end to the suffering which the Syrian people have endured for too long and to ensure that there will be accountability for the many crimes and atrocities which have been perpetrated against them.</p></reply>

However, for certain once-off or short-duration projects, it is more productive and cost-effective to re-hire retired staff who already have the relevant expertise and experience than to go through a time-consuming and relatively expensive recruitment, induction and training process.  Where it occurs, retired staff are usually re-hired on a pension abatement basis, which means in effect that they continue to receive their pensions and are paid correspondingly reduced salaries by the Department.  A small number of temporary posts in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are currently filled by retired senior civil servants as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>GRADE</b></div></th><th><div><b>POSITION HELD</b></div></th><th><div><b>DURATION</b></div></th></tr><tr><td>1 Assistant Secretary</td><td>Head of Task Force in connection with Ireland&#8217;s Chairmanship of the OSCE, 2012</td><td>Contract from 7 January 2011 to 31 December 2012</td></tr><tr><td>1 Deputy Secretary</td><td>T&aacute;naiste&#8217;s Special Representative in connection with Ireland&#8217;s Chairmanship of the OSCE, 2012</td><td>Contract for a maximum of 30 weeks spread over the twelve months of 2012</td></tr><tr><td>1 Assistant Secretary</td><td>Passport Appeals Officer</td><td>3-year contract from 20 January 2012 to deal with appeals as and when they arise (based on per diem payments)</td></tr><tr><td>1 Assistant Secretary</td><td>To assist in the preparation of files for the National Archives</td><td>Contract for a maximum of 10 weeks spread over the twelve months in 2011 and 2012 </td></tr><tr><td>1 Counsellor</td><td>To assist in preparations for the Irish Presidency of the European Union in January &#8211; June 2013</td><td>From 1 May 2012 until 30 June 2013</td></tr></table></p><p>The Department also occasionally avails of the services of retired civil servants to sit on promotion competition interview boards or to investigate complaints under the <i>Positive Working Environment</i> policy.  In addition, a retired Assistant Secretary was appointed to the independent Irish Aid Expert Advisory Group in July 2010 for a term of three years, for which a fee of &euro;2,000 is payable annually.

However, I would point out that if an individual is in receipt of certain disability payments, they may be allowed to do work or training and keep their payment or part-payment on the grounds that it is considered rehabilitative or therapeutic.  People with disabilities are, in general, liable to pay tax on their incomes in the same way as everyone else.

In addition, parents/guardians and persons who care for dependent relatives may also qualify for some of the relevant tax credits, which are set out as follows:</p><p><b>Incapacitated Child Tax Credit</b> - can be claimed by a parent in respect of a child who is permanently incapacitated either physically or mentally from maintaining himself or herself and had become so before reaching 21 years of age or finishing full-time education or full-time training for a trade or profession.  <i><font color="#0000FF">(Leaflet No. IT18 - Incapacitated Child Tax Credit</font></i>).</p><p><b>Note:</b> One Parent Family Tax Credit may also be claimed by a single parent (whether widowed, separated, deserted, single or divorced) with an incapacitated child.

Taxable rents from such property are generally computed on the full amount of the rent arising, after deducting allowable expenditure, irrespective of whether the rent has or will be received in the State.  However, where an individual is not domiciled here taxable rents are computed on the basis of the actual sums received in the State, without deduction.</p><p>  Taxable foreign rents form part of the property-owner&rsquo;s total taxable income and are subject to tax at the applicable rates in force when the charge to tax arises, currently 20% and 41% for income tax and 25% for corporation tax.  They are also subject to the Universal Social Charge in the hands of an individual. Depending on the circumstances, the owner may be entitled to relief for tax paid on the rent in the country in which the property is located.</p><p>  The self-assessment system applies in the normal manner to persons who receive rent from foreign property.  As such, they are required to pay any tax and submit their annual tax return in a timely manner and are subject to the general self-assessment provisions relating to non-compliance and the audit of annual returns.  I am also advised that Revenue's overall approach to the taxation of foreign rental income is underpinned by close consultation and cooperation with other agencies and other EU Member States and Revenue receives information on the ownership of foreign property from other countries under Mutual Assistance Agreements. Data sharing on this matter is on a continuous and on-going basis.</p></reply>

Any estimates provided are calculated on the basis that each change mentioned in the question is taken in isolation.  <i>Reducing tax relief on pension contributions to the standard rate.</i></p><p><br />  I assume the Deputy is referring to individual pension contributions, the tax relief on which is allowed at the taxpayer&#8217;s marginal tax rate &#8212; the standard or higher rate of income tax as appropriate in each case.  A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level.  An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans &#8212; retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts &#8212; by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers.</p><p><br />  There is, therefore, no statistical basis for providing definitive figures.  However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, it is estimated that the full-year yield to the Exchequer from confining tax relief to the standard rate of 20% in respect of pension contributions to occupational pension schemes, retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts and confining tax relief for the Public Service pension related deduction to the standard rate of 20% would be approximately &#8364;560 million.</p><p><i>Reducing the Standard Fund Threshold from &#8364;2.3m to &#8364;622,500</i></p><p><br />  The Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) is the maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes which was introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2006 to prevent over-funding of pensions through tax-relieved arrangements.  The SFT was reduced in Budget and Finance Act 2011 by over 50% to a level of &#8364;2.3 million with effect from 7 December 2010 with transitional arrangements to protect the capital values of the pension rights of individuals where these exceeded the reduced SFT on that date.</p><p><br />  There is currently no underlying data available to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners on which to base reliable estimates of the savings from a further reduction in the SFT to the level indicated in the question.  Information on the numbers and values of individual pension funds or on individual accrued benefits are not generally required to be supplied to the Revenue Commissioners by the administrators of pension schemes and personal pension arrangements.  For these reasons, the estimated savings included in respect the Budget and Finance Act 2011 change in the SFT were quite conservative, based as they were, on incomplete data and using very broad assumptions.</p><p><br />  My Department has been engaging with representatives of the pensions industry with a view, among other things, to gathering private pensions-related data which may be of value into the future in estimating the costs of potential changes in the pensions&#8217; tax area.  These engagements are ongoing.</p><p><i>Reducing the annual earnings limit from &#8364;115,000 to &#8364;75,000</i></p><p><br />  I assume that the Deputy is referring to the current annual earnings cap of &#8364;115,000 which operates to limit the level of tax-relieved personal pension contributions in any one year.  The annual earnings cap acts, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits of annual earnings, to put a ceiling on the annual amount of tax relief an individual taxpayer can obtain on pension contributions.  A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level.  An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans &#8212; Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) &#8212; by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers.  There is, therefore, only a limited statistical basis for providing definitive figures.</p><p><br />  However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, the Revenue Commissioners inform me that the combined estimated full year yield to the Exchequer from reducing the current annual earnings cap of &#8364;115,000 to &#8364;75,000 in respect of individual contributions to occupational pension schemes, RACs and PRSAs would be about &#8364;113 million.</p><p><i>Reducing the maximum tax-free lump sum payment allowable at retirement to &#8364;122,500</i></p><p><br />  The following arrangements currently apply to retirement lump sums paid under pension arrangements approved by the Revenue Commissioners.  Lump sum amounts up to &#8364;200,000 are paid free of tax.  They are also paid free of USC. The portion of a lump sum between &#8364;200,001 and &#8364;575,000 is taxed on a ring-fenced basis at 20%.  This means that no tax credits or other tax reliefs can be set against this portion of the lump sum.  No USC is chargeable.  Any amount of a lump sum in excess of &#8364;575,000 is taxed at the individual&#8217;s marginal rate of tax (credits and other tax reliefs are available).  In this instance, USC is chargeable on the excess.  These amounts are lifetime amounts with prior lump sums aggregating with later lump sums.</p><p><br />  I assume from the Deputy&#8217;s question that he is proposing that retirement lump sums in excess of &#8364;122,500 be taxed as outlined above.  As there is no general requirement for data on the number of persons who are receiving payments of retirement lump sums of less than &#8364;200,000 to be returned to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners, I am not in a position to provide definitive figures on the Exchequer impact of reducing the tax-free retirement lump sum amount from &#8364;200,000 to &#8364;122,500.</p><p><br />  As an exercise that might provide some indication of the scale of the savings involved, it is estimated that just under 10,500 individuals in the public service would be on salaries of over &#8364;82,000 and less than &#8364;133,500 which, under existing pension scheme arrangements generally applying across the public service, would deliver retirement lump sums of between &#8364;122,500 and &#8364;200,000.  If it is assumed that these individuals would retire in line with retirement trends from the public service in a normal year (about 2.5%), then the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums in excess of &#8364;122,500 at 20% could be approximately &#8364;2m in a full year.  I have no data on which to provide a similar estimate in relation to the private sector.  I should point out, however, that one significant difference between public sector and private sector pension schemes is that private sector schemes invariably allow scheme members the option of commuting part of their pension fund for a tax-free lump sum. This option is not available to members of public sector schemes.  Depending on the impact of any tax charge on retirement lump sums, the option to commute part of a pension fund may no longer be exercised by private sector pension scheme members or may be exercised in a manner that reduces the value of the lump sum taken to minimise or avoid any immediate tax charge.</p></reply>

Therefore it is not possible to introduce measures which will direct insurance companies to price in a particular way in response to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) Test-Achats ruling prohibiting gender-differentiation in insurance.   The background to this matter as you are aware is that in its decision of 1st March 2011 the ECJ declared invalid, with effect from 21 December 2012, Article 5(2) of the council directive 2004/113/EC of 13 December 2004.  The effect of this ruling is that all private insurance contracts concluded for the first time from 21 December 2012 as well as any  agreements between parties to extend contracts from that date are prohibited by law from differentiating by gender on price or benefits. </p><p>  The Department of Justice and Equality is responsible for making the necessary legislative amendments to the Equal Status Act to ensure that they reflect the judgement of the European Court of Justice. The Minister for Justice and Equality expects to announce shortly the details of legislation to amend the Equal Status Acts to reflect this ruling.</p><p>  In practice, the impact of unisex insurance premium rates may vary depending on the product, reflecting the take-up by each gender and the corresponding risk profile.  However, the exact movement in premiums after 21 December 2012 is difficult to predict.</p><p>  The Government is aware of the concern of many people that insurance premium costs may increase and as a result the Government agreed on 5 June 2012 that the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation would consider what actions their respective Department might take to address the potential adverse consequences of this ruling. This matter is still being examined as always. In the meantime the best advice to the customer is to shop around.</p></reply>

Neither the Central Bank nor the Department of Finance has a statutory function in relation to interest rate decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time. </p><p><br />  However, notwithstanding that, I have received the following input from the covered banks in response to your question:</p><p><b>PTSB:</b></p><p><br />  I am informed by PTSB that it does not have a significant amount of business loans and therefore this question has little relevance to that institution. </p><p><b>AIB:</b></p><p><br />  AIB doesn&#8217;t wholly fund itself via the ECB and so reductions in ECB rates don't necessarily lead to a reduction in funding costs for the bank. As part of the restructuring of the bank AIB is required to reduce its levels of ECB funding in exchange for retail / business deposits and historical wholesale market funding. In the case of business loans, most business loans in AIB reference EURIBOR or a form of EURIBOR (e.g. AIB's Business Loan Rate (BLR) is an average of 3 month's historic 3 month EURIBOR fixings). A liquidity premium and margin to cover cost of risk, operational costs and funding costs, is then added to this reference rate to arrive at a total interest rate for the customer. AIB keeps these rates under constant review.</p><p><b>IBRC:</b></p><p><br />  The majority of IBRC&#8217;s commercial loan book references money market interbank offer rates &#8211; for Euro based loans, rates are set at a margin above EURIBOR and for sterling based loans interest rates are set as a margin above LIBOR.  Changes in money market Interbank offer rates (i.e. LIBOR or EURIBOR) are applied to individual loan accounts in accordance with the contractual interest reset dates agreed with the borrower. Typically interest rates on IBRC commercial loans are scheduled to reset every month or every three months.</p><p><b>BOI:</b></p><p><br />  Business lending by Bank of Ireland (BoI) is not linked to ECB rates and therefore BoI has not passed on recent ECB rate reductions on its standard variable rate small business loans. BoI sets interest rates on standard variable rate business loans with reference to BoI&#8217;s cost of funding.  </p><p><br />  Prior to 2008, the Bank&#8217;s cost of funding was directly linked to official interest rates (e.g. Euribor). When official interest rates moved, it was appropriate to pass on the benefit or cost of that movement to borrowers through the banks standard variable rate. Since 2008, BoI&#8217;s cost of funding has become disconnected from official market interest rates due to:</p><p><br />  &#8211; the intense competition for customer deposits: as a result deposit rates have not reduced in line with reductions in official interest rates, and;</p><p><br />  &#8211; the increased cost of issuing stable term wholesale funding, reflecting distressed market conditions, the reduced credit rating of BoI and the Sovereign and heightened concerns regarding the overall euro area.</p><p><br />  The result of this disconnection is that the Bank&#8217;s cost of funding is no longer directly linked to official interest rates.</p></reply>

The 30% rate of mortgage interest relief for those who took out their first qualifying home loan between 2004 and 2008 came into effect with the enactment of the Finance Act 2012. The regulations provide for the granting of the relief due to the borrower by the lender within the tax year.   </p><p>  The mortgage lenders provide mortgage interest relief at source to relevant mortgage holders, which are facilitated by on-going electronic data file transfers between Revenue and each of the 132 individual qualifying lenders. To apply the new 30% rate, specific technology developments were required to Revenue&rsquo;s and to each of the lenders&rsquo; computer systems. Revenue's systems were upgraded to implement the 30% rate last December and Revenue has since been communicating with the various lenders in regard to their IT enhancements, but the speed of upgrading has not been uniform across all lenders. To date, the IT upgrades required to give effect to the 30% rate have been completed by all but one of the lenders and these lenders have either implemented the rate or will do so with effect from next month.  </p><p>  Revenue is currently in direct contact with the remaining lender to ensure that the additional 5% due to borrowers is paid within the current year and applied retrospectively. Revenue has received commitment from the lender that the rate will be implemented within the current tax year.   </p><p>  In January 2012, as an interim relieving measure, Revenue advised lenders to grant tax relief at the rate of 25% to those entitled to the new 30% rate of relief, given that the 25% rate was already a feature of the first time buyer mortgage interest relief regime and was not dependent on new IT upgrades taking place.</p></reply>

In the case of the World Bank this amount was USD 36 million; for the IMF it was USD 274 million.  At the same as it cancelled Haiti&rsquo;s liabilities, the IMF also approved a request from Haiti for a three-year Extended Credit Facility. So far, approximately USD 47.9 million has been disbursed under this programme.</p><p>  Ireland forms part of a constituency with Canada at both the World Bank and the IMF and has played a strong role in the development of a consensus on the issue of debt cancellation for the least developed countries.  All of our aid is provided in the form of grants, and not loans.  We have contributed our full financial share of over Euro116m to the two main multilateral initiatives to address debt relief.  We have also worked with our partners in our programme countries to help ensure that the additional money from debt relief has been spent on programmes that benefit the poor.</p></reply>

The research found that customers whose accounts go into an unauthorised overdraft position pay the highest fees. The highest current account costs occur when consumers have high numbers of out-of-order transactions occurring on their account such as unauthorised overdrafts, unpaid direct debits and over-limit or referral fees. Savings can also potentially be made by using electronic transactions in place of manual transactions, where possible, as manual transactions tend to incur higher costs.</p><p><br />  If customers are not satisfied with their current account provider for any reason, including cost of fees, they have the right to switch to a different provider.

Where a NEPS psychologist is not assigned to a school, authorities therein may access psychological assessments through SCPA. Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. </p><p>  It should also be noted that in common with many other psychological services, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for a pupil's initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. I have made enquiries in respect of this case and can inform you that, to date, no request has been made to the assigned NEPS psychologist in relation to the assessment of the child referred to in the Deputies question.</p><p>  It is the responsibility of the school Principal in the first instance to identify and prioritise pupils for assessment under the process described above. I would suggest that the parents of the child in question should discuss the matter with the school Principal who will advise them as to the appropriateness of a referral to or intervention by the school's assigned NEPS psychologist in this instance.</p><p>  Should school authorities have specific difficulties with regard any of the foregoing I would suggest that they contact the relevant local NEPS Office (in this instance NEPS Naas Office, Tel: 045-848504) to discuss the matter.</p></reply>

The purpose of the report, which I requested, was to identify new possible structures to improve initial teacher education in Ireland so that it is comparable with the best in the world.</p><p>  The international panel of education experts recommended that teacher education be provided in six &quot;centres for teacher education&quot;. Currently there are 19 state funded providers of ITE (and three non-state funded) offering more than 40 college programmes in primary and post-primary teaching.  The new collaborations recommended by the international panel will mean that a smaller number of centres for ITE exist, but that they offer education across multiple sectors from early childhood to primary, to post primary to adult education.  These centres for teacher education will also possess a critical mass in terms of research capacity which is not always possible in smaller institutions.  The new configurations will mean strong research bases can be created in each centre.</p><p>  I have asked the HEA to submit a detailed report, before the end of the year, on how to implement the recommendations of the Panel. It is too early at present to set out plans for individual colleges.  I will consider the implementation plan from the HEA, when received.</p></reply>

While the purchase price of the land is nominal, the development of the land for use as car parking/set down area will incur significant costs.  In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects to meet significant demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years.  The five year programme announced this year is focused on meeting those demographic needs.  In that context, the purchase and development of lands for purposes other than the provision of additional classrooms and other educational accommodation, is not a priority and cannot be considered at this time.  However, this does not preclude the school authorities from acquiring the land and carrying out the development works concerned.</p></reply>

This Government does not plan to review the decision to end the modern languages in primary schools initiative.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware the decision to end the scheme took account of a 2008 Report by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).  The report identified serious issues with curricular overload at primary level.  The NCCA's advice recommended for the present modern languages should not be part of the Primary School Curriculum as an additional and separate subject.  The advice in relation to curriculum overload predated the wake up call on literacy and numeracy triggered by the PISA results.  I am taking that advice on board and with particular regard to the demands on time in school that will result from a heightened focus on literacy and numeracy.</p><p>  The primary curriculum is currently being reviewed by the NCCA in the context of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy.  The &euro;2.5million in savings from this measure will go towards the cost of implementing the new National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy.  The 17% of primary schools at present in the Initiative, who have had even more time demands than others in a crowded curricular space, should as a result be better placed to deliver under the strategy.  Given the priority of literacy and numeracy, I have acted on the 2008 advice about overload and could not justify either the continuation of the initiative in the existing schools or its expansion to all schools even if funding was not an issue.</p></reply>

These changes affect new allowances payable to both existing teachers and to new appointees in the future.</p><p>  Under Budget 2012 teachers appointed before 5 December 2011 are not paid an allowance where they acquire further qualifications after that date.  Allowances for teachers first appointed between 5 December 2011 and 31 January 2012 are payable up to a maximum of &euro;4,226 which was the rate applicable to Honours Primary Degree allowance.  Allowances are not payable to new entrants from 1 February 2012. The only exceptions to this prohibition are principal and deputy principal allowances and, subject to certain restrictions, the assistant principal allowance.  These decisions were taken due to the upward pressure on the cost of teacher allowances. These provisions are outlined in Circular 70/2011 and Circular 3/2012. In light of the recent Government announcement on the outcome of the public service-wide review, the position of teachers who, on 5 December 2011, were undertaking courses will be clarified as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department. All schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012. All schools have now been advised by the NCSE of their SNA staffing allocation for the coming school year. Details of the allocations which have been made to each school are available at www.ncse.ie. In making allocations for SNA support for schools, the NCSE considers all of the applications made by schools for  children who have been identified in medical reports as having care needs. The NCSE also reviews any existing SNA provision. In cases where children have diminishing care needs, the NCSE may reduce SNA support for those children.  Where schools have enrolled new pupils with special educational needs who were not considered at the time that the allocations for the 2012/13 school year were made, or where schools are in a position to demonstrate that they cannot cater for the care needs of qualifying children from the level of SNA support which has been  assigned to them, they may apply to the NCSE for additional SNA support or for a review of their SNA allocation.   </p></reply>

The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is currently developing an integrated language curriculum for primary schools in the context of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy. While the focus of this curriculum will be on English and Irish, the integrated approach should help children to transfer skills acquired in one language to other languages and so establish a sound foundation for the learning of a foreign language in post-primary school.   An integrated language curriculum would enable teachers to achieve learning efficiencies by explicitly drawing children's attention to similarities and differences between their languages.</p></reply>

However, the budget measure that requires schools to manage the provision of guidance from within their standard staffing allocation must be seen in the context of the major challenges we have as a Government in trying to shelter public services to the greatest extent that we can in these exceptional times. The net impact on overall teacher numbers in our schools has been minimised to the greatest extent possible. Teacher allocations to post primary schools for the 2012/13 school year have effectively been settled at this stage and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. Decisions on how this is done are taken at school level and I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.</p><p>  A key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target available funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage. All 195 second-level school in DEIS have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools. My Department also provided some limited short-term support to schools through curricular concessions in order to help them manage within their approved teaching allocation. </p><p>  It is established policy that guidance is a whole school activity and under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students. While the school's guidance planning should involve the guidance counsellor(s) in the first instance, other members of school staff and management also have key roles to play. Parents and students must be seen as an essential part of the process. Through this process schools can, for example, consider the following options for maximising the use of their available resources for the provision of guidance: Optimise the delivery of personal educational, career and vocational guidance in class group settings; Enable students to use directly the extensive range of guidance tools available through the internet from relevant websites (e.g. Qualifax, Careers Portal); Enable some of the curriculum elements of the planned guidance programme to be delivered through other teachers such as SPHE staff; Maximise the role of the pastoral care team in schools; and, Ensure that the guidance counsellor has 1:1 time towards meeting the counselling needs of students experiencing difficulties or crisis.</p><p>  The support of the whole school community, parents and the relevant external agencies such as NEWB and NEPS are key to the provision of guidance and support to schools.</p><p>  Psychologists from my Department's National Educational Psychological Service ( NEPS ) also provide a range of supports to schools. These include the promotion of positive mental health among the general student body and assistance in supporting pupils with particular social, emotional or behavioural difficulties.</p><p>  My Department is also aiming to launch the Guidelines on Mental Health for Post-Primary Schools later this year. These guidelines aim to support schools in developing a whole-school approach to mental health promotion and suicide prevention and are of relevance to all members of the school community. In particular, they have been developed to support principals, guidance counsellors, student support teams, and teachers.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-02a.401.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012100200058#WRJ03200"><p>The Government recently approved a number of measures relating to public service allowances for new beneficiaries.  This follows a public service-wide review of allowances and premium payments conducted by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The main measure affecting teachers is the withdrawal of qualification allowances for new entrant teachers.  The Government has decided that the payment of allowances for the basic qualifications required for entry to the teaching profession is no longer appropriate or necessary.  This allowance goes back many years to the time when a distinction was made between teaching colleges and university qualifications.  It is not considered justifiable to incur a permanent cost to the public service pay and pensions bill where a public servant acquires an additional qualification.  The payment of allowances, such as the Gaeltacht and island allowances, are being withdrawn or altered for all new beneficiaries in the public service, including new teachers. These allowances are no longer considered the most appropriate way to meet the business needs of public service employers or the service delivery needs of Irish language speakers.  The Government was mindful of the impact of the abolition of the qualifications allowance on new teachers given that the allowances have come to be viewed as an element of basic pay.  It therefore sought to ensure broad consistency of impact across sectors. In this context, it has been agreed that new entrant teachers will no longer receive qualification allowances but will start on a salary of &euro;30,702 which is equivalent to the fourth point of the existing salary scale.  They will also have the option of being paid a pensionable allowance of &euro;1,592 for supervision and substitution, thereby bringing their starting salary to &euro;32,294.</p></reply>

There continues to be significant debate around the relative importance attached to rankings criteria and on their capacity to fully capture the quality of what is on offer in higher education institutions.

The stimulus package comprises two elements: 1.4 billion euro to fund the proposed new Public Private Partnerships (PPP) programme.  This will come from the European Investment Bank, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, domestic banks and other potential sources of funding.  The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) and the Department of Finance are leading on sourcing this funding and are liaising with my Department in this regard; 850 million euro coming from the proceeds of the sale of State assets and from the new licensing arrangements for the National Lottery, to be used as a project preparation facility for the new PPP programme and to fund additional Exchequer capital projects and other commercial and publicly needed projects.  </p><p><br />  The 1.4 billion euro investment will be directed towards projects that meet key infrastructural needs and are in line with the priorities in the Government's Investment Framework.  These projects will form the first phase of a new programme of PPP's designed to stimulate economic growth and create employment.  As the Phase 1 projects are progressed and as funding permits, projects that could be delivered as part of further phases will be considered.</p><p><br />  Job creation is a critical priority for Government.  This stimulus will help sustain jobs in the construction sector which has been very badly hit during the recession.  The investment in this Phase 1 package is expected to generate significant numbers of jobs: previous analysis of each sector indicates that the investment will generate around 13,000 jobs.  It will also create much needed social and economic infrastructure and aid economic recovery.  The projects selected are from the education, health, transport and justice sectors.  Further information about the stimulus package and about the PPP projects is available on the website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.ppp.gov.ie</font></i>. </p><p><br />  My Department and the NDFA are closely engaged with the relevant line Departments and their agencies to ensure that their projects are progressed promptly.  It is expected that tenders will issue across the sectors in 2013 and 2014.</p></reply>

The Deputy may be aware that the Commission on Public Service Pensions examined the issue of compulsory pension scheme membership in its Final Report on Public Service Pensions in 2000.  It did not recommend any change either in the rules providing for automatic membership of the spouses' and children's schemes or in the refund arrangements for membership contributions.  </p><p>  Public Service spouses' and children's schemes are generally structured on a group insurance basis and the member contribution rates take account of the fact that payment of benefits will not arise in respect of all members.  It is also to be noted there is now a wider range of scheme beneficiaries under the schemes than heretofore.  The Revised Spouses' and Children's Schemes, introduced in most parts of the Public Service in 1984 or shortly afterwards, provide cover for marriages and children born after retirement.  Section 99 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 provides that a benefit under a pension scheme that is provided for the spouse of a person is deemed to provide equally for the civil partner (as defined in the Act) of a person.</p><p>  If contributions to the scheme were to be made voluntary &ndash; or indeed if full refund of contributions was to be permitted if a person was single at retirement, as had been the position before 1984 this would weaken the integrity of the schemes and could undermine fundamentally the financing of the scheme.</p></reply>

Usually, the rehiring of retirees is related to completion of a specific task where their particular skill or experience is required in the short-term.  Situations can arise where a particular issue requires a short-term specialist input in order to complete a task. In many instances the most appropriate and cost-effective way of solving a short-term problem is to bring in someone who has worked in the area and understands the background.  In the vast majority of cases these re-hires are very short-term and project specific. </p><p>In all cases the salary of a retired civil servant rehired by a Department is subject to the pension abatement rules.</p></reply>

The total net Exchequer capital spend to end September amounted to &euro;1.7 billion.  This represents 47% of the total net capital estimate (&euro;3.6 billion) for the year, which means that &euro;1.9 billion remains to be spent.  For the same period last year, capital expenditure of &euro;2.2 billion accounted for 50% of the 2011 net provisional outturn figure of &euro;4.4 billion.  Individual Departments are responsible for the projects and programmes in their areas and further details about spending on projects and programmes can be obtained directly from the relevant Departments.  Given the uncertainties about precise issues of timing, and given the over-arching requirement to manage both capital and current expenditure within the overall allocations, it is too early at this stage to say what the final capital outturn for 2012 will be for each area.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, capital spending has general characteristics which influence the allocation drawdown pattern.  Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year.  Obviously, this affects the phasing and profiling of capital expenditure.  In addition, public financial rules require that payments are only made on foot of matured liabilities, so payments made in the later parts of the year are made on foot of work that has already been satisfactorily completed.  The trend is therefore that the bulk of capital expenditure takes place in the final quarter of the year.</p></reply>

In addition the new arrangements address annual leave anomalies which may have existed in certain sectors of the public service. These standardised leave arrangements are being implemented at sectoral and organisational level across the public service. These arrangements include for example: The abolition of historically based local leave arrangements such as for example festivals and race meetings; Bringing all public service grades with a current leave allowance in excess of 32 days within that maximum (i.e. 32 days) commencing from 1 January  2012; Placing all public service personnel, on recruitment or promotion, on a new standardised annual leave band ranging from a minimum of 22 days to a maximum of 30 days with immediate effect [i.e.14 December 2011].</p><p>  Any issues that might arise in relation to the implementation of the agreement will be dealt with through the procedures laid down in the Croke Park Agreement where appropriate.

This plan identified procurement reform as a key instrument that can assist the public service to deliver services in an efficient manner. </p><p>  The National Procurement Service (NPS) has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service&rsquo;s buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service. These national arrangements have benefits that include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency; and enhanced service levels. In some instances the take up of the NPS arrangements has been low. In order to increase the usage of the NPS arrangements and thereby secure best value for money, the Government decided that it should be mandatory for public service bodies to use specified national procurement arrangements.  </p><p>  Circular 06/12 implements the Government decision by making it a mandatory requirement that public service bodies avail of specified national arrangements put in place by the NPS. The list of categories subject to national procurement arrangements includes: electricity; natural gas; stationery and office supplies; paper; ICT consumables; managed print services; print media advertising;  and, motor vehicles. These national arrangements will secure best value for money and facilitate contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints. </p><p>  In relation to the issue of whether public service bodies have scope to purchase goods and services locally at prices lower than those under national arrangements - the position is that a public service body making such a purchase will need to explain the rationale for not using the NPS arrangement and provide a value for money justification that takes account of the full costs incurred in managing its own procurement process. </p><p>  While the key purpose of Circular 6/12 is to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money, it is worth noting that such aggregation arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money with a minimal negative impact, or indeed a positive impact, on SMEs. While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements, it should not be taken that single supplier frameworks are to be accepted as the norm. The greater use where appropriate of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring ongoing cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions. </p><p>  In relation to managed print services (MPS), the value of this national arrangement is estimated to be &euro;100 million over two years. Given the potential value of contracts under the national arrangement and the fact that suppliers are required to provide all of the print and imaging devices upfront, from their own resources, the view was taken by the NPS that the &euro;10 million minimum turnover requirement was proportionate.  Furthermore, in order to facilitate SMEs, tenderers who did not have the required turnover in their own right were invited to partner with other entities to satisfy this requirement.</p></reply>

Additionally in the course of running recruitment competitions for the public service, the Public Appointments Service (PAS) avails, inter alia, of trained and experienced retired public servants as interviewers and assessors.  At any given time, PAS would have approx 60 active on their database who may be used from time to time for short periods.  For this work, retired members are paid on a fee-per-day basis and are subject to tax and other relevant deductions.  The fees are linked to pre-retirement grades and take account of the principal of pension&rsquo;s abatement.  </p><p>  The Office of Public Works currently has two staff members retained under the abatement principle for a period up to the end of November, 2012.

The aim of Pathways to Work is to ensure that, as the economy recovers, as many of those new jobs as possible are filled by people who are on the Live Register.</p><p>  Pathways to Work places a particular emphasis on supporting those who are long term unemployed.  It has an objective of ensuring that at least 75,000 of those who are currently long-term unemployed will move into employment by 2015.  It also aims to reduce the average time spent on the Live Register from 21 months, to less than 12 months by the end of 2015.</p><p>  The establishment of the new integrated National Employment and Entitlement Service under Pathways to Work will transform the nature and level of engagement between our employment services and those who are unemployed.   It will also provide better targeted services to both job seekers and employers.  </p><p>  The labour market activation measures outlined in Pathways include over 85,000 job placement and work experience places to be delivered this year by the Department of Social Protection, and over 450,000 training and education places to be delivered by the Department of Education and Skills.  </p><p>  There are also financial supports available to employers who recruit a person who is long term unemployed.  These include Revenue&rsquo;s &ldquo;Job Assist&rdquo; scheme and the Employer&rsquo;s PRSI Exemption scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection.  As part of the Action Plan process, I have been actively promoting these schemes to employers in recent months, with the support of business representative bodies.  </p><p>  We must continue to do all we can to facilitate the return to work of those who have lost their jobs.  I am currently preparing the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government and will be exploring further measures which can be taken to transform our economy and support job creation.  </p></reply>

Reducing administrative burdens   has the potential to deliver cost savings and efficiencies for businesses which will assist them in growing employment. This is a key focus for my Department and its Offices and Agencies.</p><p>  Significant progress has been made by my Department, with a reduction in administrative burdens of 24.8% already achieved in the areas of Employment Law, Company Law and Health &amp; Safety Law; this amounts to annual savings for business of almost &euro;207 million.  Details of all the initiatives making up this total are available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.djei.ie.</p><p>  Successful initiatives resulting in significant savings include: In Company Law, savings of &euro;82 million per annum have already been realised, more than &euro;33 million of which are due to the work of the Companies Registration Office (CRO), as companies can submit their annual returns online via the CRO website and can now use digital signatures for the B1 Form and Accounts; The audit exemption threshold has been increased to the maximum level permitted under EU law.  This will achieve potential additional savings for Irish SMEs of approximately &euro;2.8 million annually; In Health &amp; Safety Law, a total of &euro;123 million in annual administrative savings for business has been delivered by the HSA via two key projects: the BeSMART online tool for preparing the Risk Assessment and Safety Statement (&euro;59m), and the SMP20 Guidelines (&euro;64m), which assist construction firms with fewer than 20 employees in establishing and maintaining an effective safety management system.</p><p>  The reform of the State's Workplace Relations Services, that I set in train last year, will, among other matters, deliver a simplified two-tiered structure comprising a single body of first instance, the Workplace Relations Commission, and a single body of appeal, in effect an enhanced Labour Court. This new structure will provide a better service for both employees and employers, with fewer delays and reduced administrative burdens. Already there has been some significant early progress, including the development of a single complaint form for all workplace relations complaints, the establishment of a single contact portal, Workplace Relations Customer Services, to handle all complaints and enquiries, the launch of a single website, www.workplacerelations.ie, containing all relevant information on employment rights and industrial relations and the commencement of a Pilot Early Resolution Service which will seek to resolve disputes without recourse to adjudication or inspection. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to this new structure.</p><p>  My Department also coordinates the cross-Government measurement and reduction of administrative burdens towards the 25% target by the end of 2012.  A project to measure the burden imposed by regulation under the responsibility of seven Departments and Revenue was initiated in September 2011.  Following completion of its measurement exercise, each participating Department must then set out how it will achieve the remaining reductions necessary to reach the target and report to Government with its Simplification Plan. Revenue&rsquo;s report on its administrative burden reductions, which has reached the 25% target, has been published on its website.</p><p>  The current overall reduction is just over 15% which includes the 24.8 % achieved by my Department, the 25% achieved by Revenue and a 30% reduction achieved by the CSO.</p><p>  A further initiative, which will be of benefit to small businesses, in particular, has been the launch of businessregulation.ie.  This new website provides a single online source of information on regulations and how to comply with them. Business will no longer have to search multiple Government websites to find out their obligations.  </p><p>  Work is continuing to identify new areas where administrative burdens on business can be reduced and in this regard the High Level Group on Business Regulation has prioritised a number of areas for attention in its 2012 Work Programme. These areas are currently being considered and will be published in the Group&rsquo;s annual report later this year.</p></reply>

The role involves extensive out of hours working and a high degree of individual responsibility for decision making in an often unsupported environment. The nature of industrial dispute intervention by an IRO is a dynamic and unpredictable activity, not amenable to structure in the normal sense of working time organization. The employer receives a commitment on the part of the officer to prioritise his / her work demands, often at short notice, over any other aspect of their time. The employer receives delivery of extensive additional hours working without additional remuneration. It is considered that the degree of individual responsibility undertaken by HEO&rsquo;s in the role exceeds that normally undertaken by officers of the grade.</p><p><div style="padding-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px">(2)  <b>Is the allowance cost effective/represent value for money?</b></div></p><p>It is not practicable to envisage the delivery of a conciliation system based on overtime working or on the basis of a &lsquo;time in lieu&rsquo; arrangement. The operation of an allowance based system ensures maximum productivity from available resources and removes issues around availability of officers from the challenge of providing a responsive service to parties in dispute. In the view of the Commission, the allowance at current rates represents good value for money.</p><p><div style="padding-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px">(3)  <b>Other Pertinent Issues (e.g. why duties cannot form part of grade/post; impacts/risks if duties/responsibilities not undertaken) </b></div></p><p>The Industrial Relations Act, 1990 commits the State to the provision of a Conciliation Service. That service consistently resolves 80% of all disputes referred to it. Access to the service is on a voluntary basis and the parties demand and expect that service delivery will be structured in a manner that responds to the pressures under which the parties operate. Conciliation Service delivery is consistently acknowledged by the Minister and the parties as fundamental to the effective working of our industrial relations system and any diminution or restriction of the service would have significant impacts in terms of dispute activity leading to days lost due to industrial action in the economy. The nature of service delivery requires that the HEO officers are willing and mandated to make decisions and take responsibility for the trajectory of dispute negotiations in an often unsupported environment. It is considered that the degree of such responsibility demanded of HEO IROs is beyond what would normally be demanded of officers in the HEO grade.</p><p><b>Labour Inspector Allowance</b></p><p><div style="padding-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px">(1)  <b> What does the employer receive in return for the allowance?</b></div></p><p>The Labour Inspectorate of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers.</p><p>Labour Inspectors deliver an enforcement and information service in relation to employer obligations and employee rights/entitlements/protections falling due under a wide-ranging body of employment legislation and under Employment Regulation Orders and Registered Employment Agreements. The enforcement authority and powers in this regard, in respect of which the Inspectors are warranted and certified, are provided for in various legislative enactments.</p><p><div style="padding-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px">(2)  <b>Is the allowance cost effective/represent value for money?</b></div></p><p>Yes.

The latter two premises were surplus to State requirements and have been sublet for many years.</p><p>  Carrisbrook House was acquired by AnCO in 1969 on a 65 year full repairing lease commencing on 1st August 1969 and expiring on 31st   July 2034.  There is no provision for lease breaks and the rent is due for review every seven years. </p><p>  The Industrial Development Authority acquired assignment of the lease in 1976. Since the relocation of IDA to Wilton Park House in 1985, the Carrisbrook House offices were leased to a number of tenants on a cost-neutral basis to the Exchequer until early 2008 when a major tenant exercised a lease break and vacated the premises.  The Israeli Embassy is currently the only occupant of the premises, on a sub-lease which expires in 2025, with lease break provisions in 2015 and 2020.  Since the departure of the major tenant in May 2008, six floors in Carrisbrook House have been vacant. The total cost of vacant space in Carrisbrook House in 2012 is estimated at &euro;1.3 million, inclusive of rent, rates and service charges.</p><p>Forf&aacute;s also holds the lease on Knockmaun House, Lower Mount Street, Dublin 2, which the agency inherited on its establishment.  This lease, which was negotiated by the IDA, commenced on 6th July 1979 and expires on 5th   July 2014.  The premises is held on a full repairing lease for 35 years, with no provision for lease break and is subject to a five yearly rent review. </p><p>  These premises were sublet on a cost-neutral basis to the Exchequer until April 2009 when one of the tenants availed of a lease break and surrendered their portion of the building amounting to half of one floor. The remainder of the building (4.5 floors)  remains occupied.   The total cost of vacant space in Knockmaun House in 2012 is estimated at &euro;200,000, inclusive of rent, rates, and service charges.</p><p>  Forf&aacute;s has been actively seeking to market the vacant space in both Carrisbrook House and Knockmaun House since they became vacant.  Due to the downturn in the property market and a surfeit of vacant office accommodation in Dublin, these efforts have proven unsuccessful to date.  However, Forf&aacute;s continues to market the availability of the offices. </p><p>  The Secretary General of my Department has also written to the Office of Public Works, advising them of the availability of this office space.  The IDA have also been asked to bring the availability of this accommodation to the attention of prospective clients. To date, neither body has identified a requirement for the accommodation. </p></reply>

In implementing this Strategy, the Agency has pointed out; however, that as Ireland competes for high quality investments, the concept of scale is crucial. Leading global corporations require a significant population, a pool of qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services. Ireland has only one Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area, so, in order to achieve regional economic development, IDA Ireland prioritises the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the areas of critical mass (i.e. sufficient scale of population/skills/infrastructure/companies/business services/etc.) and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.</p><p>The East Region has one Gateway (Dublin) and a number of large towns including Arklow in County Wicklow.

Subsequently, the European Standardisation Bodies, CEN-CENELEC and ETSI, following a mandate from the EU Commission, developed harmonised standards for the manufacture of data-enabled mobile phones compatible with a new common charger. This voluntary European standard (EN 62684) was published in December 2010 and was subsequently adopted as an Irish Standard, I.S. EN 62684, in March 2011. The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) contributed to the development of these standards through its representation at the European Standardisation Bodies and as the national standards body. It is important to highlight that these are voluntary standards and the NSAI has no role in monitoring or enforcing them.</p><p>  I further understand that this sector is regulated the Radio Equipment and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment Directive 1999/5/EC of 9 March 1999 which was transposed into national legislation by the European Communities (Radio Equipment and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment) Regulations 2001 (S.I. 240 of  2001). This legislation falls under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and is enforced in Ireland by the Commission of Communications Regulation (ComReg).

She was recently invited by the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection to outline the business of the forthcoming EPSCO and to brief the Committee on her priorities for the forthcoming EU Presidency in the first half of 2013. </p><p>The main topic of political discussion at Employment and Social Affairs Council on 4 October will be the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy and the need to strengthen attention to employment issues within economic governance. The focus will be on lessons learned from the second European Semester cycle in 2012. </p><p>  Discussion at the EPSCO Council this week will be on the basis of a paper prepared by the Cypriot Presidency as well as the input provided by the Council&rsquo;s preparatory bodies &ndash; the Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee. The Commission has also made proposals for more regular and structured contacts with Member States to take place following its presentation in November of the 2013 Annual Growth Survey. </p><p>  A strong EU employment agenda represents a pathway towards economic recovery and a way out of the current social crisis. The EU institutions, governments, trade unions, employers, and civil society interests need to work together to build this pathway. This calls for stepping up coordination, surveillance and peer pressure to deliver on National Job Plans. Whilst labour market, skills issues, and social policies are a Member State competence within the EU, other Member States in the Union have an interest in ensuring that deficiencies are tackled, and reforms implemented. </p><p>  The discussion on the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy at the EPSCO Council on 4 October will be complemented by a parallel discussion at the ECOFIN on 9 October. It is anticipated that refreshed arrangements for the conduct of the third European Semester cycle will then be reflected in a Presidency Roadmap which is likely to be adopted by the General Affairs Council in December.</p></reply>

Some missions may include initiatives or the signing of agreements relating to joint venture collaboration with Ireland on a range of activities such as research, innovation, or the provision of education services. Participation on missions is arranged so that the interests of those travelling relates with the individual mission objectives.      In a substantial number of trade missions, representatives from the scientific community are represented in the form of Science Foundation Ireland or other research/educational establishments (e.g. SFI is travelling to Brazil for the trade mission in October). Enterprise Ireland notifies all relevant Government Departments and state agencies of upcoming trade missions and always seeks to involve parties relevant to each trade mission based on the specific trade mission market and sector focus. Individual institutions, such as third level colleges and universities, can opt to participate where this would be of benefit to them.  </p></reply>

The goal of the Action Plan for Jobs is to support the retention of jobs in the economy and the creation of new ones.  The aim of Pathways to Work is to help to ensure that as many of those new jobs as possible are filled by people from the Live Register.  </p><p>  The Action Plan takes a whole of Government approach to improving the operating environment for business.  It is an annual process and, each year, specific measures will be identified to support the objective of adding 100,000 net new jobs to the economy by 2016.  </p><p>  The aim of Pathways to Work is to develop a new approach to engaging with people on the Live Register, particularly those who are long-term unemployed.  The establishment of the new National Employment and Entitlement Service will transform the nature and level of engagement between the employment services and the unemployed.   It will also provide better targeted services to both job seekers and employers.  </p><p>  Pathways to Work includes the objective of ensuring that at least 75,000 of those who are currently long-term unemployed will move into employment by 2015.  It also aims to reduce the average length of time spent on the Live Register from 21 months to less than 12 months over the same period.  </p><p>  The labour market activation measures outlined in Pathways to Work include over 85,000 job placement/work experience places to be delivered this year by the Department of Social Protection, and over 450,000 training and education places to be delivered by the Department of Education and Skills this year.  </p><p>  Given the scale of the problems this Government inherited, turning around the economy cannot be achieved overnight.  That is why we have set challenging, but achievable, targets and timeframes for delivery under the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work. </p></reply>

This report benchmarks business costs against a range of Ireland&rsquo;s key competitor countries in a number of areas, such as labour costs, property costs, utility costs and business and professional services.  The report also provides an analysis of cost profiles of the manufacturing and services sectors.  </p><p>  In its most recent Cost of Doing Business report, published in 2011, the NCC identified improvements in Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, particularly in relation to labour costs and property costs.  However, the NCC also advised that further progress is required to ensure that Irish enterprises can compete internationally. </p><p>  Some operating costs for business are largely outside the control of Government.  For example, fuel and energy prices are heavily influenced by external factors such as global fossil fuel prices.  However, the Government&rsquo;s approach has been to identify those areas of policy it can influence to bring about cost reductions or provide supports to business.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 includes an extensive range of measures across Government which will help to reduce costs and support job creation.  </p><p>  A range financial and non-financial supports and incentives are also available from Government Departments, Offices and Agencies to support employment creation in all sectors. These include schemes such as Revenue Job Assist, the Employers' Job PRSI Incentive Scheme and the Job Expansion Fund.  Details of financial supports for business are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.enterprise.gov.ie.</p></reply>

Also, recent jobs losses which have occurred in the FDI sector in Ireland are largely the result of the continuing restructuring process that is on-going in Ireland and other developed economies, driven by competitive pressures and technological change.  This can result in jobs at the lower end of the value added scale being either phased out completely or relocated to lower cost locations.</p><p>However, the most recent report from the National Competitiveness Council, <i>&#8220;Ireland&#8217;s Competitiveness Scorecard 2012&#8221;</i>  , has pointed out that Ireland has become significantly more cost competitive. In terms of international measures, the World Economic Forum (WEF) rankings showed Ireland&#8217;s position improving two places to 27th last September, while the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook released in May showing Ireland&#8217;s headline position recovering back into the top 20 (up from 24th) and 8th out of the 24 EU countries featured.  </p><p><br />  Our current policies are geared to bring about a transformation of the Irish enterprise sector to ensure that we are in a position to avail of the opportunities that will arise as the global economy returns to growth.  </p><p><br />  The Action Plan for Jobs aims to transform the operating environment for business in order to support enterprise growth and job creation.  The Government will achieve this objective by systematically removing obstacles to competitiveness, putting downward pressure on business costs, promoting innovation and trade, supporting new and existing businesses to develop and expand, and by deepening the impact of foreign direct investment in Ireland.  The Government has identified, in the Action Plan, a number of key sectors where Ireland can gain competitive advantage in global markets.  The Plan has also set a target of supporting the creation of 100,000 net new jobs over the period 2012 to 2016, with the longer term objective of having two million people at work by 2020 as part of our goal of making Ireland the best small country in which to do business.  </p><p><br />  We are reforming supports to small businesses, we have published the National Research Prioritisation Exercise, and we have launched the Succeed in Ireland scheme to help identify and encourage companies that might set up in Ireland.   </p><p><br />  In addition to the wide-range of programmes being delivered by the Enterprise Agencies, I am also focusing on other measures to address the challenge of access to finance being faced by SMEs.  Last Thursday, I launched the new Microfinance Loan Fund and I will shortly be launching the Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme.</p><p><br />  We are making solid progress on this crucially important agenda and have already put place a number of measures that will make a practical difference in making it easier for businesses to grow and create jobs.   We will redouble our efforts in the coming year with the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 to ensure that we put in place policies that respond in a meaningful way to the many challenges faced by business on a daily basis.</p></reply>

The international economic environment is therefore a key influencing factor in our economic performance.</p><p>  Notwithstanding a difficult trading environment last year, Enterprise Ireland client companies achieved &euro;15.2 billion in export sales last year &ndash; the highest level ever recorded.  This demonstrates the strengths that Irish companies possess when it comes to selling their goods and services abroad.    </p><p>  At a domestic level, we need to continue to build on the competitiveness gains we have made in recent years and build a strong foundation to support employment creation and retention.  </p><p>  Through the Action Plan for Jobs, the Government is systematically removing obstacles to competitiveness, putting downward pressure on business costs, promoting innovation and trade, supporting new and existing businesses to develop and expand, and deepening the impact of foreign direct investment in Ireland. The Government has also identified, in the Action Plan, a number of key sectors where Ireland can gain competitive advantage in global markets.The positive impact of the Government&rsquo;s policies on job creation are beginning to show.  2011 saw a net increase of 6,000 jobs in IDA-supported companies and a number of major foreign direct investments have been announced so far this year which have the potential to support a further 6,000 jobs as the projects come on stream.  Employment in Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s client companies stabilised in 2011 after 30,000 job losses in the period 2007 to 2010.  In the first eight months of 2012, a total of 4,669 job commitments over the next three years have been secured, linked to Enterprise Ireland approvals to client companies.</p><p>  Overall, we are seeing a stabilisation in the level of private sector employment, particularly in areas targeted by the Action Plan for Jobs.  For example, employment in the tourism sector increased by 6,300 in the period June 2011 to June 2012.  Employment also increased in Agriculture and the ICT sectors, underscoring the shift in our activity away from the old, failed economy based on property, banking and debt, to a new sustainable economy based on enterprise, exports and innovation.</p></reply>

For strategic skills or labour shortages in designated occupations in key economic sectors, Government policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and in response to employer demand. The various schemes that give effect to such policies were introduced following enactment of the Employment Permits Act, 2006.</p><p>In early 2009, the Department undertook a review of employment permit arrangements to ensure their continuing relevance to the needs of the Irish labour market. As an outcome of this review, more stringent eligibility criteria were implemented for prospective new entrants to the work permit schemes from 1 June 2009 onwards. The main features of the new measures included:</p><p>-  expanding the ineligible list of occupations for which permits can be issued;</p><p>- increasing by 50% the fees charged at renewal stage for new permits issued after 1 June 2009, and</p><p>- reduction in the number of occupations for which Green Cards are issued.  </p><p>  The Employment Permits Act 2006 allows for regular review of Ireland&rsquo;s economic migration policies and my Department keeps these policies under review, in line with the emerging needs of the labour market, on an on-going basis.</p><p>  Other EU countries may also review their policies in this regard depending on the factors pertaining to their respective economies.</p></reply>

However, while upward only rent reviews are one of a number of factors which are causing pressure on the commercial and retail sectors at the present time, there are other factors influencing decisions of individual retailers to cut jobs.  The retail sector has seen a disproportionate fall in activity due to the fall in consumer confidence and a reduction in discretionary spending by the Irish consumers. </p><p>  The Government recognises the importance of the Retail sector to the economy.  It is employment-intensive and covers every community in the country.</p><p>  Combined with wholesale, the sector employs 258,000 people in Ireland &ndash; that is almost 15% of our total workforce.  Recognising its importance to the economy, the Action Plan for Jobs includes a number of specific measures aimed at supporting employment in the retail sector in 2012.  These actions are for delivery across a number of Departments and agencies and include a renewed focus on prompt payments, an assessment of the potential for future development of the retail sector, the introduction of a statutory code of practice for grocery goods undertakings and providing support to retail firms seeking to internationalise.</p><p>  Other more general measures in the Action Plan will also help to support employment the retail sector including:</p><p>-  improved access to finance for businesses;</p><p>- the enactment of legislation to reform the statutory wage setting mechanisms; and</p><p>- acceleration of the programme of revaluation of commercial premises, which will provide a basis for the adjustment in commercial rates. </p><p>  Initiatives which the Government introduced as part of the Jobs Initiative in May of last year will also continue to help support employment in the retail sector.  These include the halving of Employer&rsquo;s PRSI on earnings up to &euro;356 per week and the reduction in the 13.5% VAT rate to 9% on certain goods and services.</p></reply>

As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I have set-out an approach which is focused on economic recovery, by delivering improvements in competitiveness, ensuring companies have access to the finance they need to grow and by prioritising innovation as a key driver of success which will lead to jobs and export growth.</p><p>  My Department and the relevant State Agencies under its remit, have a clear focus on the potential and opportunities that exist and can be created. Enterprise development Agencies, Enterprise Ireland, IDA and Science Foundation Ireland,  provide a spectrum of innovation and technology development programmes that deliver  financial, technical and experiential support to help companies become more innovative, encourage and support competitiveness, and help them grow their sales and exports in order to create a climate in which  sustainable employment will grow and expand. It is my view that Innovation and the use of technology will be among the core drivers of job creation in Ireland&rsquo;s key sectors during 2012 and into the coming years.</p><p>  A wide range of programmes are being delivered by the Enterprise Agencies - Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland  and Science Foundation Ireland, to promote research &amp; development and innovation and give Irish enterprise a competitive edge in the global market place.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland, the agency responsible for the development and promotion of the indigenous business sector, is focused on the growth of world-class Irish companies to achieve strong positions in global markets. Enterprise Ireland provides research, development and technological innovation support relevant at all stages of company development, enabling companies to progress from undertaking an initial research project to higher level innovation and R&amp;D activities. Enterprise Ireland funds the undertaking of R&amp;D to support significant in-company projects which have the potential to develop new processes, products and services.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland has a range of programmes and soft supports focusing on research, development and innovation to facilitate and support businesses to compete sustainably in international markets. Information on all supports for research and development is available on the websites of Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards.</p><p>  In addition, Enterprise Ireland is engaged in efforts to extract maximum value from Ireland&rsquo;s research system &ndash; the objective is to work with companies to secure commercial purpose, leading to jobs and sales, for technologies and ideas developed in Irish research institutions. Enterprise Ireland also operates a range of supports to help companies engage with third level researchers to undertake collaborative research for the benefit of the company. Larger collaborative research projects involving groups of companies are also supported.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland are engaged in a number of specific opportunities to assist the SME sector to avail of its support programmes.</p><p>  For example, through the Enterprise Europe Network which includes Enterprise Ireland and the Chambers of Commerce of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Sligo and Waterford, Enterprise Ireland produced a new on-line directory of innovation supports to assist companies and their advisers in sourcing the various forms of support required to promote innovation and R&amp;D.  This new directory was promoted through a series of workshops and seminars held in the various regions.  The new directory is now available through the internationally co-ordinated Enterprise Europe Network website.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland has appointed a panel of 38 Advocates whose role is to assist companies in formulating projects to develop their business through innovation and R&amp;D.  This follows on from previous successful Advocate programmes which have assisted companies to identify their best options for development of new products, processes and services in order to grow sales into new international markets.</p><p>  The Industry Research &amp; Development Group (IRDG) Innovation Network, supported by Enterprise Ireland, has been undertaking a range of successful seminars around the country including seminars on R&amp;D Tax Credits (including a workshop on Audits), an event devoted to Services Innovation in Waterford and promotion of collaboration through the &ldquo;Supporting Business In The Mid-West&rdquo; seminar held at the University of Limerick.  This seminar was designed to highlight the benefits of collaboration with Higher Education Institutes for businesses in the Mid-West.</p><p>  The Irish Software Innovation Network (ISIN), funded by Enterprise Ireland and managed by the Irish Software Association (ISA), offers a free matchmaking and knowledge-brokering service to help software companies to identify and engage with relevant third-level research institutes.</p><p>  The Construction Information Technology Alliance (CITA), funded by Enterprise Ireland, aims to leverage Building/Business Information Modelling (BIM) to facilitate integrated project delivery and reduced costs in construction industry.</p><p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs Enterprise Ireland is actively working with IDA Ireland to attract companies to avail of R&amp;D tax credits for the first time.  The preliminary work involves the development of an updated R&amp;D tax credit brochure, which will be jointly issued by the two agencies later this year. The next stage will involve a series of agency workshops which will promote an understanding and use of &ldquo;R&amp;D tax credits&rdquo;.</p><p>  Research and development support programmes and initiatives will continue to be delivered by the enterprise agencies in support of Irish businesses in order to drive growth, sustainability, exports and job creation.  My department and its enterprise agencies will continue to promote the application of research &amp; development and innovation to gain competitive advantage and to build on the strengths that have emerged from the investment to date in Science Technology and Innovation.</p></reply>

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice. The first two involve the enhancement of the website    and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears. </p><p><br />  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders. This advice will be provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main recognised accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.</p><p><br />  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &#8364;250 to an accountant of the borrower&#8217;s choosing for the provision of this advice.</p><p><br />  An operating protocol for the provision of this advice has been agreed between the main recognised accountancy bodies and the lenders. The general scope of the advice will be limited to the borrower&#8217;s principal private residence. </p><p><br />  The advisory framework has commenced with practising accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.  </p><p><br />  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as requested by borrowers. While the advisory framework will be monitored on an on-going basis, it is not intended to conduct a formal review of the scheme before the due date of  2013. At this time, other interested parties who meet the criteria in terms of qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc., may be considered for inclusion.   </p><p>The accountancy bodies have notified their members about the new service and a panel is available on a county by county basis on the website <i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i></p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 90,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement, for which the Government has provided &euro;436m in 2012.</p><p>  To qualify for rent supplement a person must be residing in private rented accommodation or accommodation for homeless persons or in an institution (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for rent supplement. A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and the person is deemed by a local authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support. In all other cases, a person who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by a housing authority. </p><p>  Only when the person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support, does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement. Rent supplement is not payable while a housing needs assessment is being undertaken. There has been no policy change to the eligibility criteria in 2012.</p></reply>

QCIs are paid as supplements to weekly social welfare benefits and allowances in recognition of the need for greater incomes among benefit-dependent households with dependent children. The current full rate of payment is &#8364;29.80 per week per dependent child having increased in recent years after a considerable period of being frozen in value. The estimated expenditure on qualified child increase in 2012 is around &#8364;675 million. </p><p><br />  QCI payments do not of themselves constitute a specific social welfare scheme and entitlement to the appropriate primary adult payment must be established in the first instance.  </p><p><br />  Social welfare payments consist of a personal rate with increases for qualified adults and children depending on the household composition. In order to be regarded as a qualified child the child must be ordinarily resident in the State (except where EU rules provide otherwise), not be in legal custody, satisfy the age condition attaching to the particular payment and normally reside with the claimant. Where children continue in full-time education, payment of the QCI can continue up to 22 years of age or up to the end of the academic year in which the child reaches 22 in the case of long-term payments as well as short-term payments that have been in payment for at least 156 days.  A full rate QCI is payable where a qualified adult increase is also awarded or for those claimants who are parenting alone.  A reduced rate QCI is payable for children in cases where the claimant&#8217;s spouse/partner&#8217;s income exceeds a certain limit. The upper income limit is currently set at &#8364;400 a week.  </p><p><br />  Child benefit is a universal payment that assists parents with the cost of raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty. The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around &#8364;2 billion. Child benefit payment is non means-tested and non-taxable and is payable to the parents or guardians of children. There is no specific requirement for an applicant to be in receipt of child benefit payment in order to qualify for payment of a qualified child increase.</p><p>In cases where the circumstances so warrant, arrangements may be made for a qualified adult, or another person, to receive a specified amount of a social welfare payment, including the amount payable as a qualified child increase, on behalf of the claimant, most usually where it is likely that the amount of benefit payable would not otherwise be used for the subsistence of the family unit. Details in relation to calculating a split payment are included in DSP operational guidelines available on the DSP website at this address </p><p><br />  The application of the guidelines allows for the investigation of specific circumstances and if the Deputy wishes to have a particular case considered, he can arrange to have it brought to the attention of my Department for consideration.</p></reply>

The employer referred to in this instance does not meet the definition of insolvency for the purposes of the scheme.     </p><p>  The entitlements covered by the scheme include wages, holiday pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of minimum notice due under the Minimum Notice &amp; Terms of Employment Acts, 1973-2001, and certain pension contributions.  Various other statutory awards made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT), Rights Commissioners, etc., are also covered by the Scheme.</p><p>  The scheme does not cover pension entitlements but it does cover pension contributions which had been deducted from employees and not paid into the pension scheme and employer contributions due to the pension scheme where these contributions fall within a period of 12 months prior to the date of insolvency.</p><p>  Occupational pension schemes in Ireland are normally established under Trust Law and have a set of guidelines called a trust deed which sets out the rules that govern how the scheme is operated. The pension entitlements of all members of the scheme will be set out in the trust deed. A mandatory entitlement to preserved benefit was introduced in the Pensions Act 1990 which came into force on the 1 January 1991. Unfortunately in this case the person&rsquo;s employment terminated before the Pensions Act came into force and is not covered by the provisions of the Act.</p><p>  The trustees of the pension scheme will be able to inform the person concerned as to what benefit, if any, he is entitled to under the rules of the scheme. If the person has difficulty in ascertaining who the trustees of the scheme are, he should contact the Pensions Board who will be able to provide assistance.</p></reply>

In addition when companion passes are taken into account there are an estimated &euro;1.2 million people with an entitlement to free travel. </p><p>  A new public services card (PSC) has been designed to replace other cards within the public sector such as the free travel pass and the social services card of my Department and to make it easy for providers of public services to verify the identity of customers. The PSC will be used by Government departments and agencies to meet their own business needs for identity authentication.  It is intended that this will include transport operators supporting the free travel scheme.  The PSC will include photo identification and signature and will encompass other security features which will considerably reduce the potential for forging cards and fraudulent use.  </p><p>  The roll out of the card has commenced and the Department is currently running a pilot registration process involving a cohort of pensioners who already have given data to the Department in connection with their application for an All-Ireland Free Travel Pass, including their photograph.  The Department has written to this group requesting their permission to use this data to register them for the free travel variant of the public services card and asking them for their answers to a number of security questions.  These questions will allow their identity to be verified in the event that they have to contact a helpdesk for assistance.  This is in line with industry best practice and serves as reassurance to customers against identity theft.  </p><p>  You will appreciate that this is a significant project to implement, however, and will have to be carried out in phases over the next few years having regard to the resources available.  It is hoped to be in a position to commence the issue of the free travel variant of the PSC, specifically designed for our customers who have entitlement to free travel, during 2013.</p></reply>

There are approximately 33,500 customers in receipt of a basic weekly SWA payment for which the Government has provided &#8364;160 million in 2012. </p><p><br />  Basic weekly SWA payments are generally paid to customers who are awaiting a decision, or a decision following an appeal for a social welfare payment, or to those who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. While it was never the intention that basic SWA would be paid on a longer term basis there are approximately 9,600 customers in receipt of the payment for more than one year. Customers in this category include asylum seekers who do not have access to primary social welfare payments or those who are ill but do not qualify for a payment under the Department&#8217;s primary illness related schemes.  There is no basis in social welfare legislation to deem this scheme as a long term payment for recipients of the payment for periods in excess of one year.  </p><p>A key objective of the transfer of the Community Welfare Service from the Health Service Executive to my Department on 1 October 2011 was to provide a streamlined, consistent and enhanced service to the customer.

One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processes these without delay and the other on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.

In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%).  </p><p>  Any changes to the PRSI system to extend the full range of social insurance benefits to self-employed persons would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.   </p><p>  The recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund as at 31 December 2010 looked at the break-even contribution rates required to provide invalidity pensions and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for self-employed workers.   The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 3.7% effective rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus the invalidity pension and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.</p><p>  I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year and one of the issues that the Group is currently considering is the issue of providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  The Advisory Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Group has been considering the issue of social insurance coverage for the self-employed and will submit its report once its examination of the various questions has been completed. </p><p>  Any proposals to extend additional cover to the self-employed will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the finding of the Actuarial Review that the self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &ndash; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  </p><p>  Self-employed individuals may, however, establish entitlement to assistance-based payments such as the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for assistance-based payments, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p></reply>

One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processes these without delay and the other on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.  Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September and will be closely monitored and managed to ensure it achieves its objectives. However, it will take a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level. The allocation of available resources to this task continues to be monitored.</p></reply>

As the Department currently funds approximately 30% of the private rented sector it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review and reflect current market conditions. There are approximately 90,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million in 2012. </p><p>  Revised maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012 and are in place until June 2013.  These limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available. The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.  </p><p>  All new rent supplement applications are subject to the revised limits and as existing claims came up for review or when an existing lease expires, are assessed using the new limits. Approximately 37,300 rent supplement claims have been awarded in 2012, representing over 41% of total claims in payment, indicating that accommodation can be secured within the existing rent limits. Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met; there will no incidence of homelessness due to these changes.</p><p>  It is essential that rents are allowed to stabilise from a natural balance of supply and demand, rather than as a result of a rent control funded by the taxpayer. The Department will continue to monitor rent levels throughout the country but at this stage I have no plans to alter the current approach, in terms of introducing legislation to impose rent controls on residential properties.  </p></reply>

Each week, over 1.4 million people receive a social welfare payment and, when qualified adults and children are included, over 2.2 million people benefit from weekly payments.  Some 600,000 families receive child benefit payments in respect of over 1.1 million children each month.  The day to day activities of the Department included (full year 2011): </p><p>- 2.2 million applications processed; </p><p>- 87.6 million scheme payments made; </p><p>- 982,000 control reviews;</p><p>- 6.8 million telephone calls answered; </p><p>- 34,000 social welfare appeals finalised;</p><p>- 153,000 PPS numbers allocated. </p><p>  Most of the related schemes and services have been, or will be, addressed under the programme for Service Delivery Modernisation.</p><p>  Each project under the modernisation programme is focused on business process improvements in the relevant business area with major changes to how staff work and interact with customers, and supported through new technology solutions on the department&rsquo;s modern integrated technology platform.  Each of these projects is rigorously assessed, governed and implemented based on specific business requirements and its contribution to the overall strategic objectives of the department.</p><p>  Benefits have been achieved over time, not only in improved customer service but in administration of schemes through integrated systems; reduced system &lsquo;downtime&rsquo; (1.21% in 2011 compared to 2.13% in 2009); agile response to required change including budget changes under the Social Welfare Act; enhanced work flow to maximise resources; integration with payment and reconciliation systems; ability to take on increased workload without commensurate increase in staff resources; more efficient and flexible communication products such as automated customer communications and use of text messaging; use of integrated scanning technologies to support end-to-end processing of claims; authenticated online services; support for major service initiatives such as moving customers from payable orders to electronic payment mechanisms; agile development environment to support introduction of new schemes such as the early child care supplement; robust infrastructure that supports on-going system improvements through a monthly release cycle; parallel project development; enhanced certification processing to support customer communications and control functions such as child benefit Irish residency certificates, and changes to continuing eligibility, residency and employment; improved overpayment and debt management; and ability to deliver new functionality such as statements of customer contributions and a new PRSI refunds application.</p><p>  Examples of benefits achieved include:</p><p>- There has been a significant increase in claims activity in local offices since mid-2008.  The number of claims processed in 2008 increased by 88% (216,000 additional claims) and a further 43% in 2009 (198,000 additional claims), with activity falling slightly through 2010 and 2011/12.  </p><p>-  In 2011 there was in excess of 500,000 claims processed in local offices nationally &ndash; this was double the level of activity in 2007.  </p><p>-  It should be noted that a similar number of claims (500,000) were also closed in local offices in 2011, giving a total &lsquo;claim churn&rsquo; of over 1 million customers in 2011.</p><p>-  Average processing times for jobseeker allowance and jobseeker benefit claims have stabilised at 5 weeks and 2 weeks respectively, lower than peak processing times in 2009. </p><p>-  Some 95% of state pension contributory claims are paid by due date.</p><p>-  Average processing times for family income supplement has remained at 17 weeks over the last two years.</p><p>-  The department received 1.4 million claims for various non-weekly schemes such as child benefit (144,386 claims received, roughly half in respect of new births), household benefits, treatment benefits and supplementary welfare allowance.  The average processing time for circa 80% of these claims is now 1 week and almost all of the remainder are processed within a month.</p><p>  There are some schemes which are receiving particular attention. For example, processing times for carers allowance and invalidity pension which amounted to 3% of received claims in 2011 are not acceptable.  Increased demand by individuals for these schemes has put pressure on the administration of the department to service this demand, resulting in a requirement to increase productivity.  To this end major service delivery modernisation projects have taken place in these business areas over the last 2 years to improve the efficiency of their administration.  These projects involve the deployment of information technology solutions and associated business processes.  The new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customers by optimising performance and providing improved customer service.  However, change of this magnitude needs time to build and bed in and it is expected to be a number of months before the backlogs are reduced to an acceptable level.</p><p>  The department&rsquo;s modernisation programme is a fundamental part of government&rsquo;s public service reform agenda and in this regard the department is currently undergoing another period of major transformation moving from a passive transaction focused model of income support to a proactive model which is customer centric and progressive.  The integration of the community welfare service, and employment and community services of F&aacute;s was made possible through the investments in modern technology over the preceding years.  Change on this scale also requires substantive changes for staff and these initiatives are being delivered under the auspices of the Public Service Agreement (PSA) and with significant input from staff who are required to make major changes to how they work.</p><p>  Expenditure on all the Department&rsquo;s SDM related projects in the period since commencement, some eleven years ago, amounts to just over &euro;82m at the end of 2011.  It is expected that expenditure on the service delivery modernisation programme in 2012 will amount to some &euro;4.8m. Further information in relation to the Department&rsquo;s modernisation programme, including costs, are provided in the department&rsquo;s annual report which can be found on the website www.welfare.ie.  </p><p>  I am satisfied that the investments made in the modernisation of systems and processes represent good value for money and have positioned the department to best meet the needs of customers. </p></reply>

All applicants for carer&rsquo;s allowance, regardless of nationality, must satisfy this condition.  In determining whether or not a person is habitually resident here a deciding officer is required to consider all the circumstances of the particular case including;</p><p>- the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country;</p><p>- the length and purpose of any absence from the State;</p><p>- the nature and pattern of the person&rsquo;s employment;</p><p>- the person&rsquo;s main centre of interest, and</p><p>- the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances.</p><p>  These five specified factors have been derived from European Court of Justice case law. </p><p>  HRC legislation is therefore set out in national legislation, not European legislation although our legislation must respect European law.  In particular, EU legislation prohibits discrimination between nationals of EU Member States in the context of freedom of movement of workers and their access to social security or social assistance entitlements.  Therefore, national legislation cannot provide advantages to non-resident Irish nationals on temporary visits here without extending the provisions to all EU nationals under the same conditions.							</p><p>  The Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council is meeting on the 4th October.  Any proposals for legislative change coming before the Council would have already been subject to a process of negotiation and examination at various Council committees etc.  There is no scope for raising HRC in this context. </p></reply>

Subsequently, the <i>Programme for Government</i>   undertook to review the situation with regard to NHAs and the future of turf-cutting on such sites will be considered as part of that review. </p><p><br />  It is intended that the review will be completed prior to the commencement of the 2014 turf-cutting season.  The outcomes of the review and the proposed approach to the future of turf-cutting within these sites will be discussed as part of the Government&#8217;s ongoing dialogue with the European Commission regarding compliance with EU law in this area. For example, while NHAs are designated under national law, they are recognised as areas of environmental sensitivity for the purposes of peat extraction within the terms of the EU Environmental Impact Assessment Directive. </p><p><br />  The outcome of the review of NHAs may also be relevant in relation to the possibility of relocating turf-cutters from raised bog Special Areas of Conservation (SACs). </p><p>In relation to SAC raised bogs, my Department is in the process of developing a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan and has recently published a document outlining the proposed approach to the development of the plan on my Department&#8217;s website at   .</p><p><br />  There will be no changes to policy in relation to cutting on SAC raised bogs pending the conclusion of the SAC Management Plan, including necessary involvement of the European Commission.</p><p><br />  I also intend to elaborate an overarching policy on peatlands in a proposed National Peatlands Strategy, which my Department will be preparing in consultation with the Peatlands Council.</p></reply>

The Court of Justice of the European Union has considered this issue on a number of occasions and has recognised that such disclosure would undermine the purpose of infringement investigations and procedures, and would breach the confidentiality which the Commission and Member States are entitled to in the context of such investigations and procedures.</p></reply>

These arrangements involve the groups moving to nearby bogs, with the group from Clara Bog having commenced turf cutting at the relocation site in Killeranny, County Offaly, in June last. Progress has also been made with a view to the relocation of qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation in County Kildare in a similar manner.</p><p>  24 qualifying turf cutters have been accommodated at the relocation site in Killeranny.

This cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme now comprises a payment of &euro;1,500 per year, index linked, for15 years or, where feasible, relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs where they can continue to cut turf.  Those wishing to relocate can avail of the financial payment or the delivery of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum while relocation sites are identified and prepared.

The review will provide the basis for the sustainable grazing of commonages, to avoid both overgrazing and under-grazing. It is envisaged that farmers will be allocated a minimum and maximum stocking level for each commonage townland by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Farmers will be able to farm freely once these stocking levels are observed and the land is maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition.</p><p>  The carrying capacity of all commonages will be expressed at Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) level and will prescribe the sustainable carrying capacity in ewe equivalents per hectare.  This will reflect any known recovery delivered since the original commonage plans were prepared.</p><p>  Specifically in relation to Co Galway, 25 farmers in the complex referred to by the Deputy are participants in the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) farm plan scheme, which is managed by my Department.  Compensation for each destocked ewe (below the polluter pays level of 5 ewes/ha over the whole farm) is &euro;39.75.  Off-wintered ewes receive &euro;50 per annum.  In addition, my Department covered the cost of preparing the NPWS farm plan.  Due to budgetary constraints, my Department's NPWS farm plan scheme was closed to new applicants in April 2010.</p><p>  In the complex in question, my Department is also making top-up payments to REPS and AEOS farmers for these additional restrictions.  These farmers were required to amend their existing plans to reflect additional grazing requirements.  For the five years of the scheme, REPS/AEOS farmers are paid &euro;2,000 by my Department for each year in which they have fully met the destocking and off-wintering provisions of their plans (which will run until the end of 2013).  Application forms for the Year 4 top-up payments will be distributed to farmers in the coming weeks.</p><p>  In September 2011, I announced an additional compensation measure for out-of-contract REPS farmers in the complex referred to by the Deputy whose plans were completed after the closing date for applications to AEOS 2.  These payments of up to &euro;4,000 per farmer ran until the 15th May 2012.  It is anticipated that out-of-contract farmers in this area will be accepted into the AEOS 3 Scheme announced last week by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></reply>

The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.</p><p><br />  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&#8217; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.</p><p><br />  The National Broadband Plan contains a commitment that my Department will undertake a full mapping exercise in respect of high speed broadband deployment.  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  Until that process is complete, the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known.

It is necessary that both these processes are finalised before the mapping exercise begins, as they will critically inform the investment plans for telecommunications service providers over the coming years.</p><p><br />  I have already emphasised to industry the importance of my Department securing full cooperation from all the commercial operators in completing this aspect of the Plan&#8217;s implementation.</p><p><br />  As regards current broadband speeds, the Communications Regulator, ComReg, publishes on its website, , details of broadband packages available in all counties, including County Kerry.  The Companies referred to by the Deputy may wish to access this information to ascertain if better broadband services than they currently have may be available to them.</p></reply>

In 2011 ICES reiterated its previous advice that all anthropogenic mortality (e.g. recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pollution) affecting production and escapement of eels should be reduced to as close to zero as possible until there is clear evidence that both recruitment and the adult stock are increasing.  In 2011, glass eel recruitment has fallen to 5% of their 1960-1979 level in the Atlantic region and less than 1% in the North Sea area, and showed no sign of recovery.</p><p>  In Ireland, recruitment has been declining at many monitoring sites since the mid-1980s, for example in the 2000-2011 period, the glass eel catch in the Shannon was at 2% of the pre-1980 numbers.  In summary, recruitment of glass eels and elvers remained low during the 2009 to 2011 period both in Ireland and across Europe. </p><p>  In Ireland it is anticipated that there will be a considerable decline in silver eel production, as indicated by recruitment history, yellow eel stock indicators and modelled projections for index stocks.  As part of Ireland&rsquo;s eel management regime, every three years, a review of the status of eel stocks is conducted, this coupled with input from stakeholders, supports the decision making process on the future of the commercial and recreational eel fishery.  Inland Fisheries Ireland has just completed a full public consultation on the future of the commercial and recreation eel fishery; the recommendations from this review are being finalised. </p><p>  Inland Fisheries Ireland has made a number of reports on eel stocks available on its website including The National Eel Stock Recovery Plan, The Status of Eel Stocks in Ireland and The Implementation of the Eel Management Plan for Ireland.</p><p>  The review of eel stocks in Europe is a shared concern involving many countries on a pan European basis and it is likely that a summary of all European reviews will not be available for some time.</p></reply>

In Ireland&rsquo;s case only two operators are included.  The methodology used takes the cheapest offer from these two companies and not the cheapest offer in the market.  I am advised that there are currently an estimated 30 pre-paid mobile packages available to Irish consumers, some of which are cheaper and the assessment does not therefore reflect the actual range of pre pay offers available.  In addition to the prepay option, mobile consumers can also avail of post paid options and it should be noted that Irish prices in this basket were below the EU average.</p><p>  ComReg&rsquo;s website Callcosts.ie, provides a useful source of information to consumers where they can compare prices of different operators.  Consumers can input their usage requirements and see the cheapest available in the market based on their usage.  I am also aware that ComReg has, in recent months, promoted the ease at which consumers can switch mobile operator and that there is no retail charge for consumers who wish to switch.  Furthermore, the Digital Agenda for Europe scorecard reports that the number of days required to switch between operators in Ireland is among the lowest in the EU.</p></reply>

The EirGrid project is of strategic national importance in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s economic infrastructure.</p><p>  Electricity interconnection improves security of supply, promotes further competition in the electricity market which in turn exerts downward pressure on electricity prices.  Interconnection also facilitates the penetration of wind generation and the East West Interconnector will facilitate export of surplus electricity generation output.</p><p>  I do not have a statutory function in the setting of energy prices, whether in the regulated or unregulated market.  Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  </p><p>  Prices in the retail business and residential electricity markets are now fully deregulated.  Since 1 October, 2011 residential gas customers supplied by Bord G&aacute;is Energy are the only segment of the electricity and gas markets where prices are still regulated by the CER.  Prices in the electricity and gas markets, with the exception of residential gas customers supplied by Bord G&aacute;is Energy, are wholly commercial and operational matters for the suppliers concerned. Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and gas markets, both wholesale and retail, are characterised by vigorous competition regulated by the CER.</p><p>  The domestic retail electricity market is a competitive market and consumers are able to switch their business between suppliers, who in turn purchase their power on the all island wholesale market, the Single Electricity Market (SEM).  Overall electricity prices in Great Britain are lower than those in Ireland and, as might be expected in this situation, there has been strong interest from traders on the interconnector in importing power into Ireland from Britain.  The interconnector in these circumstances is capable of carrying additional power into Ireland from a lower cost market, to the extent of 500MW, with that capacity representing more than that of an average modern power station.  The interconnector therefore means that there can be even greater competition for existing generators operating in the SEM leading to additional downward pressure on the wholesale prices otherwise charged by generators.</p><p>  It is difficult in the deregulated electricity market to identify the precise impact of the downward pressure on prices brought about specifically by the interconnector, as against the impact of any other factors at play in the wholesale and/or retail market.  Accordingly, the impact on the price charged to any single household customer in the residential segment of the retail electricity market cannot be estimated.</p></reply>

The terms of reference for this more extensive research are currently being drawn up by a steering group including representatives from the EPA and my Department.</p><p>  The outcome of the further research to be commissioned by the EPA will assist in a robust scientific based assessment of any future application proposing the use of this technology.</p><p>  I can confirm that until there has been time to consider the second stage of the EPA research, the use of hydraulic fracturing in exploration drilling will not be authorised.</p></reply>

They consist of carrier-neutral duct and fibre rings linking the main commercial and public buildings to &ldquo;co-location centres&rdquo; where service providers locate their telecommunications equipment and access the network.  These state-of-the-art facilities are available to service providers to enable them offer high-speed broadband to their retail customers without having to build their own networks.</p><p>  The Newcastle West MAN was constructed at a cost of approximately &euro;1.008m, as part of the Shannon Broadband Phase II MANs Project.  My Department contributed 90% of the cost of the MAN and the remaining 10% was funded by the Local Authority through Shannon Broadband Ltd.  There were eight Phase II MANs built in this region: Abbeyfeale, Banagher, Birr, Kilrush, Nenagh, Newcastle West, Roscrea and Templemore.</p><p>  The MANs are owned by the State and are operated and managed, on behalf of the State, by a Managed Services Entity (MSE), e|net.  The company provides telecoms services to licensed telecoms operators, who then offer telecoms products and services to businesses and individuals.  e|net manages and maintains the MANs on an on-going basis and promotes the use of the MANs among telecoms operators, for the benefit of businesses and individuals in MANs locations.</p><p>  The Newcastle West MAN is currently active and providing telecommunications services to business users and individuals in Newcastle West.  The number of businesses and individuals availing of the MAN in Newcastle West is a matter for individual telecoms operators.</p><p>  I must also emphasise that the MANs are a long term investment and the networks will be available for generations to come, as well as facilitating the current demand for digital based business.  I envisage that greater use will be made of the MANs in the coming years to provide bigger broadband to more businesses and citizens, as demand increases for online services and cloud computing services.</p><p>  The National Broadband Plan, which I launched on 31st August, aims to build on initiatives such as the MANs by driving further investment in the provision of high speed broadband.</p><p>  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &ndash; specifically: 70Mbps &ndash; 100Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015; At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% (and potentially as much as 35%) of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.</p></reply>

The process allows for the referral to the Circuit Court, by the landowner affected, of a proposal to include a right of way and where the court is satisfied that no right of way exists, the planning authority may not include it in its development plan. Section 14(7) provides that &quot;the inclusion of a public right of way in a development plan shall be evidence of the existence of such a right unless the contrary is shown&quot;.</p><p><br />  The question of whether a public right of way exists is therefore ultimately a matter for the courts to determine.</p><p><br />  Ireland's Waymarked trails and the majority of other walking routes are &#8220;permissive access routes&#8221; that have been developed with the landowners&#8217; agreement; they are not public rights of way. Accordingly, the recent ruling regarding rights of way is not expected to have any significant impact on the existing network of permissive access routes currently available to walkers.</p><p><br />  With regard to access to the countryside, an Expert Group reported to the relevant Minister in May 2007. It did not set out specific recommendations but examined existing legislation and explored the implications of introducing legislation, such as granting a right of access to recreational users. It was determined that the best way forward was to develop permissive access with the agreement of landholders.  The consensus approach adopted is underpinned by the principle of mutual respect between landowners and recreation users, with the acceptance of the rights of landowners regarding access to their land and the need of recreation users to have reasonable access to the countryside. The report by the Expert Group on &quot;Legal Issues of Land Access for Recreational Use&quot; is available on my Department&#8217;s website.</p></reply>

In this instance, the closed period was due to start on 15 October 2012 but will not now commence until 1 November 2012.</p><p>  I took these complementary decisions early in September to provide certainty to farmers so that they could plan ahead to minimize the impact of an emerging fodder crisis by facilitating extended autumn grazing, and to optimize the management of manure disposal on their farms.</p><p>  The commencement of the closed periods has been deferred by two weeks.

This Programme is given effect by the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for the Protection of Waters) Regulations 2010.</p><p><b></b>The setback distance for the application of chemical fertiliser to land in the vicinity of a watercourse was increased to 2 metres in 2010 following a review of the first Nitrates Action Programme. This was on the recommendation of the independently chaired Expert Advisory Group that was appointed to advise on measures to be included in the current Programme. The prescribed distance of 2 metres is in line with similar requirements in England and Northern Ireland.</p><p><br />  On the advice of the Expert Advisory Group, exemptions from prescribed buffer distances for the spreading of organic fertiliser or soiled water were also introduced following this review. The Group considered that the fixed buffer zone approach was not the most efficient in achieving the required protection of drinking water sources and that provision should be made for a case by case examination. Setback distances may only be decreased where a local authority has completed a technical assessment of conditions in the vicinity of an abstraction point. The technical assessment must be carried out in accordance with guidelines issued by the Environmental Protection Agency.</p></reply>

Any difference between the rent and prevailing interest rate is reflected in the capital outstanding on the property, i.e. if the rent charged in any period is greater than the prevailing mortgage interest due on the local authority&rsquo;s share the purchase price of the outstanding equity will be reduced accordingly.Local authority mortgage holders &ndash; including those who purchased under shared ownership &ndash; also benefit from extremely keenly priced interest rates which currently stand at around 1.5% below average variable rates available in the market.

The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.</p><p>  The Rental Accommodation Scheme is specifically targeted at households who are in receipt of Rent Supplement from the Department of Social Protection, generally for over 18 months, and who have been assessed as having a long-term housing need. An applicant must adhere to these qualifying conditions in order to be eligible for the Rental Accommodation Scheme.</p><p>  Earlier this year the Government announced its decision in principle to support proposals to transfer responsibility for households in receipt of rent supplement, but with an established long-term social housing need, from the Department of Social Protection to the housing authorities. Housing authorities will provide this service using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). The detail of the proposed transfer and any standards or criteria to be introduced are in the process of being developed and agreed through an established Steering Group, chaired by my Department, and a number of specific working groups.</p><p>  The proposed reform of the rent supplement scheme constitutes a major development in the provision of housing services and will require careful planning and consultation with interested parties. I hope to be in a position to announce further details of the new arrangements before the end of the year. It is envisaged that the roll - out of HAP will commence in 2013.</p></reply>

I allocated a further &euro;250,000 for spending on necessary extensions and adaptations to houses. It is a matter for Wicklow County Council to apportion the approved funding between the various town councils. At a meeting with my Department on 26 September, representatives of both Wicklow County Council and Bray Town Council requested an additional allocation of &euro;117,000 to fund certain retrofitting works undertaken at a number of houses in Oldcourt Estate. The request for additional funding is being considered in the context of any savings which might arise from an under-spend by any local authority of their 2012 allocations.</p></reply>

For that reason annualised data sets for the period 1992 to 2007 inclusive are not available.</p><p><br />  However, the Housing Agency&#8217;s Housing Needs Assessment 2008 and 2011 reports break down the categories of housing need, including in respect of homelessness, for all 88 housing authorities nationwide. These are available on my Department&#8217;s website at .</p><p><br />  . This statutory assessment of housing need, carried out every three years by all housing authorities, only counts homeless persons where an application has been made to a housing authority.</p><p><br />  The extent of homelessness in the Dublin region, where numbers are most pronounced, was reviewed and updated using the now fully operational Pathway Accommodation &amp; Support System (PASS) and crosschecked against each of the Dublin local authorities&#8217; housing management data systems to give an accurate figure of the known homeless population in Dublin. Following extensive cross checking and quality control to remove duplications and ensure accuracy of all data entries, the confirmed extent of homelessness in the Dublin region as at September 2011 was 1,891 persons. PASS, which commenced operation in the Dublin region in 2011, is being extended nationally on a phased basis with work currently underway in other regions. The PASS system will in future provide good quality, timely, data on homelessness nationally as an evidence base for all homelessness services.</p><p><br />  On 6 September 2012, the CSO published its special Census report, <i>Homeless Persons in Ireland</i> and it indicated that 3,808 persons were either sleeping rough or in accommodation designated for the homeless on the night of 10 April 2011. The rough sleeper count was 64, with 59 of those people located in Dublin.  It is not tolerable that anyone should sleep on the streets but it is important that the homeless figures released are not confused with the number of people sleeping rough.

Regeneration seeks to rebuild damaged communities by improving not just the physical environment in which people live but also by investing in the social and economic life of the areas.  This holistic, multi-agency approach ensures that regeneration is sustainable, beyond just the initial construction phases, and generates long-term advantages. The Regeneration Process in Limerick seeks to reinvigorate and revitalise communities that have witnessed considerable neglect and breakdown over decades by acting as a catalyst for more integrated, responsive and effective public service provision and enhanced resident participation in matters that affect them.  Over the past five years, a robust framework has been put in place to facilitate consultation with stakeholder groups including householders, residents&rsquo; associations, community organisations etc. on wide-ranging issues relating to the development and implementation of social and physical regeneration strategies.</p><p>  Supporting Social Inclusion and Regeneration in Limerick (SSIRL) is a collaborative programme of investment in support of social objectives which aims to strengthen social inclusion practice, introduce best practice to improve the quality and impact of services and to facilitate and enable all citizens to participate in and drive regeneration and revitalisation across the city.  It is co-funded by Government Departments/State Agencies, Atlantic Philanthropies and the University of Limerick.  My Department will be working closely with all concerned to deliver this innovative project in Limerick. The outcome of the project will inform policy in relation to, inter alia, the most appropriate consultative arrangements to ensure the successful implementation of regeneration in Limerick.</p></reply>

Foreign Delegates Allowance cost &euro;84,014 to date in 2012; however expenditure under this allowance will cease, as it has been abolished under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Review of Allowances in the Public Sector. 2012 expenditure includes additional foreign travel undertaken at both at EU and international level arising from increased activity and workload in the lead up to Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU which commences on 1 January, 2013.

My Department's role is to ensure that there is an adequate legislative and financial system in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation. </p><p>  Accommodation for Travellers is provided across a range of options including standard local authority housing, which is financed from my Department's capital allocation for social housing, private housing assisted by the housing authority or voluntary organisations, private rented accommodation and through their own resources.  My Department also provides funding for Traveller-specific accommodation such as group housing schemes and halting sites.</p><p>  The Government remains committed to meeting the accommodation needs of Travellers.  Since 2005, over &euro;187m has been expended for the provision of new, and refurbishment of existing, Traveller-specific accommodation.  This is in addition to expenditure on standard local authority housing and other housing supports.  The results of this substantial financial commitment are reflected in the significant reduction in the numbers of Traveller families on unauthorised sites, despite continuous increases in the numbers of Traveller families nationally.</p><p>  The National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee (NTACC) is a statutory body established for the purposes of providing advice on all matters relating to housing for Travellers.  While the matter of a Traveller-led accommodation agency has been examined, no firm proposals have been put forward for consideration by the NTACC.  A proposal for a statutory Traveller accommodation agency, as set out in the 1995 Report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community, was considered by my Department.  However, it was subsequently decided not to establish such an Agency and I have no plans to review the matter at this time.   </p></reply>

Such plans enable stakeholders, including developers, local authorities, financial institutions, NAMA and residents to collaborate in determining how best to pursue resolution of problematic sites.  The process also entails working with stakeholders in identifying the best long-term solution for developments in terms of their configuration, use of vacant buildings and ownership.  Such solutions also take account of the best interests of residents.   </p><p>  The first Annual Progress Report of the NCC, published by my Department on 5 July, confirmed that, through the use of the SRP process, 211 estates have now been completed and issues are now resolved.  On a further 523 estates, plans are now in place and in many of these cases work has commenced and significant progress will be achieved over the coming months.  I anticipate that this progress will be reflected in the 2012 National Housing Development Survey now underway.  The results of this Survey are expected later this year and will update the position on Site Resolution Plans. </p></reply>

It is their duty to ensure as far as is possible, and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register.   </p><p>  In the normal course, voter registration is an ongoing process in which those entitled to be registered apply to their registration authority for inclusion in the Register of Electors.  The new register comes into effect each year on 15 February.  The draft register is published in November each year in preparation for the coming into effect of the register on the 15 of February following.  The public is invited to check the draft during this period so that people can make sure that they are correctly registered.  Any errors or omissions in the draft should be brought immediately to the attention of the registration authority.  Claims for the addition or deletion of names are ruled on by the county registrar who is a legally qualified court officer.  The ruling is made in public and any person may attend and give evidence. </p><p>  Provision is also made in electoral law for inclusion in the supplement to the register.  If a person is not included in the register of electors currently in force but considers that he or she qualifies for registration - for example if they have come of age to register or if they have changed address - the person may apply for entry in the supplement to the register which is open year round subject to certain practical limits in the weeks before a polling day.  The closing date for the supplement to the register for the forthcoming referendum is Tuesday, 23 October 2012. </p><p>  The detailed requirements regarding the inclusion of persons in the supplement are set out in section 15, and Part 2, of the Second Schedule to the Electoral Act 1992.  An applicant for inclusion in the supplement to the register must apply directly to his or her registration authority.  The application must be signed by the applicant in the presence of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from the applicant&rsquo;s local Garda station who must first be satisfied as to the person's identity before signing, dating and stamping the form.  The Garda may request photographic or other identification.  Where the applicant establishes in writing that he is unable to progress the application in this way, the form can be signed by the applicant in the presence of an official of the registration authority who is satisfied as to his or her identity.  Again, photographic or other identification may be required.  If neither option is viable due to physical illness or physical disability, the application form must be accompanied by a medical certificate. </p><p>  Student campaigns which encourage people to register to vote are to be welcomed.  However, it is important that the requirements of electoral law are met.   </p></reply>

On the basis of a value for money review, it was clearly established that the vast majority of the money allocated to PwDI was being spent disproportionately.  The largest proportion of PwDI&rsquo;s annual budget was spent on the operation of its office headquarters and on administration rather than on the creation of projects which would directly benefit people with disabilities.  This was an untenable situation that could not be allowed to continue as the conclusions of the VFM report show that people with disabilities were benefiting very little from the allocation in real terms. </p><p>  It is my wish to ensure that people with disabilities directly benefit from any money allocated to this sector.  With this in mind, I just recently oversaw the finalisation of a major Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in the Department of Health to ensure that existing funding allocated for people with disabilities is spent to best effect.  I am also interested in hearing what people with disabilities have to say on issues affecting them.  I have established and am personally chairing a new National Disability Strategy Implementation Group to develop and progress disability strategy.  The new group includes representation from a number of disability stakeholder organisations, also three former members of PwDI and a number of people with disabilities who are able to bring their lived experience directly to bear on the very important work of this high level group.  This ensures the voice and perspective of people with disabilities will continue to be heard in a more focused and cost effective way.</p><p>  At my request the National Disability Authority held the first National Disability Forum event in June 2012.  This event, which is hoped will be held on an annual basis, was primarily about listening to the views of individual people with disabilities, their families and carers in relation to the key policy areas and service developments that impact on their lives.</p><p>  The Government must ensure that funding is allocated for maximum provision of services for people with disabilities, having regard to overall resource constraints which affect all sectors at this time.  Specialist disability services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings.  The integral role of the non-statutory, voluntary and community groups is of particular relevance to the provision of health and personal social services to people with a disability.  These agencies provide a very significant and broad range of services in partnership with and on behalf of the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p></reply>

The various sections of the Charities Act are subject to implementation through commencement orders.  Sections that it was possible to commence in advance of the establishment of the Charities Regulatory Authority, as provided for under the Act, have been commenced. The remainder will be commenced following the establishment of the Authority. </p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the full implementation of the Charities Act, including the establishment of the Authority, had to be examined in the context of the comprehensive review of expenditure, which took place last year.  Arising from this review, and in the context of the need to reduce Government spending, I took the view that it was not possible to proceed with the full implementation of the Act at this time given the likely scale of the financial and staffing resources then envisaged, and that this should be deferred.  In light of this decision my Department is currently examining options for resource efficient ways of making progress towards the objectives of the Charities Act.</p><p>  It should be recalled that there is, at present, a range of regulatory oversight measures that can apply to charities.  Many charities are already subject to scrutiny by various State Bodies.  The Revenue Commissioners have granted charitable tax exemptions to almost 8,000 charities and have significant powers to ensure that such charities comply with tax law.  A full list of these charities is available to the public at www.revenue.ie.  Many charities are companies limited by guarantee and, as such, are also subject to the provisions of company law and are generally required to provide certain information to the Companies Registration Office under the Companies Acts.  This information can then be accessed by the public.  Such charities would also potentially be subject to scrutiny by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  Charities that take the form of a trust are subject to the provisions of trust law. And, of course, any business entity is subject to general criminal and fraud legislation. </p></reply>

I understand there is no blanket policy here in operation in relation to persons classified as Latvian aliens, as the circumstances of each case may be different.  In general, the holder of a Latvian alien passport is treated much in the same way as a non-EEA national.  They do not enjoy the same rights of free movement as the holders of a full Latvian passport.  However, they are not debarred from seeking Irish citizenship and, over the years a number have become naturalised while others have obtained Irish residence and registered with the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</p></reply>

This would apply to mortgage finance as to other forms of finance and it may well have been a key basis for the advance of the loan in the first instance. My understanding is that this is also the normal position in other comparable legal systems so that the insolvency procedure and any discharge of debt has no alleviating effect on the liability of the guarantor to the creditor. </p><p><br />  This position under existing Irish law and internationally, is reflected in the Personal Insolvency Bill 2012 as currently drafted. A debtor&#8217;s entering into one of the new debt resolution processes does not prejudice the legal right of a creditor to seek payment from the guarantor under the guarantee. However, I am conscious of the difficulties which can arise with respect to guarantees in the context of insolvency processes, for all parties concerned and so I will give this matter consideration as work progresses on the Bill. However, I am sure that the Deputy will agree that this is a complex matter. </p><p><br />  In relation to the query as to State assistance, if the Deputy is enquiring as to whether some form of assistance, financial or otherwise, might be provided for guarantors, such as family members and others close to an insolvent debtor, who are affected by the debtor&#8217;s financial difficulties because they have personally guaranteed the loan of the debtor, I do not believe that such a proposition arises for the State.</p></reply>

I am further informed that both areas are subject to regular patrols by local uniformed personnel, augmented by uniformed and plain clothes units from the District Headquarters in Ashbourne, together with the Divisional Traffic Unit and the Regional Support Unit as required.</p><p>  Local Garda management closely monitors such patrols, and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in these areas to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources to provide the best possible Garda service to the public. While the situation is being kept under review, Garda management is satisfied that a full and comprehensive policing service is being delivered to the communities in the areas concerned and that the current structures in place deliver an effective and efficient policing service.</p><p>  The Deputy be aware that the Garda Commissioner has put Operation Fiacla in place in order to address incidents of burglary, aggravated burglaries and related offences throughout the country. Operation Fiacla is intelligence driven and specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda Region to target suspect offenders.  I am informed that over 1,700 persons have been arrested and that almost 1,000 persons have been charged in the first six months of the Operation, reflecting the substantial efforts being made by the Garda&iacute; to tackle those involved in burglary and property crimes.</p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also places great emphasis on the importance of the partnership between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the community in preventing and detecting crime, and maintaining a safe environment for everyone.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to invest time and energy in these partnerships and relationships to the benefit of all. In this regard, last week the Garda Commissioner launched the second national public awareness week this year under the 'Garda Supporting Safer Communities Campaign&rsquo;. This important campaign highlights a range of key issues, in particular burglary prevention. The primary objective of this Garda Community Safety Campaign is to engage with, and raise awareness within communities of initiatives aimed at preventing crime, reducing the fear of crime and promoting community safety.</p><p>  Insofar as the number of arrests made in the specific areas referred to are concerned, I am informed that this would require a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources to compile due to the fact that persons arrested in these areas will, in general, be brought to either Navan or Ashbourne Garda Stations, which are both District Headquarters and have full custody facilities. Separate figures for the numbers arrested in the specific areas referred to by the Deputy are not readily available.</p></reply>

It is the Revenue Commissioners who are responsible for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products and they have advised as follows.  Revenue has adopted a comprehensive tobacco strategy which is published on Revenue&#8217;s website <i>www.revenue.ie.</i>    The strategy includes a number of programmes, which are designed to complement each other in targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for contraband tobacco in Ireland. Key elements include developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, development of analytics and detection technologies, and ensuring optimum deployment of resources at point of importation and within the country, in order to intercept the contraband product and to prosecute those involved.</p><p><br />  With regard to the level of penalties for illicit importation and sale of tobacco products, the threat to tax revenues from criminal activity in the cigarette market is viewed very seriously, and substantially increased penalties were introduced in the Finance Act 2010 as a deterrent.  The penalties for the smuggling of tobacco products are contained in Section 119 of the Finance Act 2001 as amended and the penalties for the illegal sale of unstamped tobacco products are contained in section 78 of the Finance Act 2005, as amended. In 2012 to date a total of 81.1m cigarettes with a retail value of &#8364;36.6m and 3,338kgs of tobacco with a retail value of &#8364;1.2m have been seized by Revenue. In addition, 41 convictions were secured for cigarette smuggling and a further 52 convictions were secured for illegal selling of unstamped tobacco products. </p></reply>

This year Cosc has provided grants totalling &euro;241,820 to 59 successful applicants throughout the country. In 2011 &euro;298,153 was granted to 58 different groups from the scheme. Guidelines devised by Cosc in 2011 in relation to the grant scheme aim to encourage a shift from a focus on activities only relating to the victim to an inclusion of a focus on the perpetrator and bystander whilst also ensuring that information on support services continues to be made available to victims/survivors.</p><p>  The bystander approach aims to both engage individual members of society in challenging the social norms that allow sexual and domestic violence to occur and to encourage individuals to assist victims of such violence rather than isolating them. One example of this approach has been a partnership between the Union of Students of Ireland and Cosc over the last two years to increase awareness of domestic and sexual violence among students attending third level institutions. The purpose of this campaign was to make students as bystanders more aware of intimate partner violence in the college setting and to intervene where relevant. There have been three stages to date in this work: an awareness raising art work competition, distribution of colourful wristbands with a slogan and website details for more information, and the circulation of a free postcard, visually based on the winning piece from the art competition, containing information about abusive relationships and the helplines to contact. The theme of the campaign could be summarised by one of the slogans used &quot;If you see something, say something&quot;.</p></reply>

This allocation of resources is constantly monitored in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  The Garda Commissioner is currently engaged in an assessment of the potential for improved efficiencies in the structure and organisation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of the preparation of the draft policing plan for 2013, which under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 is due to be submitted to me by the end of October this year. The objective is to provide the most effective policing service possible, within available resources, across the country, including rural areas such as referred to by the Deputy.  While I expect that the policing plan for 2013 will contain proposals for the further rationalisation of Garda stations and Districts, it would be premature, in advance of its submission, to speculate on specific measures which it might contain.</p></reply>

This, I understand, will be done in compliance with Section 5 of the Solicitors Act 1954 which provides for the Society to make regulations which are necessary for the carrying out of its functions and requires that such regulations be laid by the Society before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are made.  </p><p>  The new regulation has been made by the Law Society on foot of the recommendations made in the &quot;Conveyancing Conflicts Task Force Report&quot; published by the Law Society in July. The Task Force had been set up to review existing guidelines and regulations relating to solicitors acting for both parties in conveyancing transactions. The Report, which is publicly available on the Law Society's website (www.lawsociety.ie), details the arguments that were put forward both in favour of and against the introduction of this regulation and explains the reasons behind the decision to propose its adoption. It sets out how the Task Force undertook extensive consultations with members of the solicitors profession and other relevant interested parties and stakeholders and took account, inter alia, of the November 2012 joint HSE and UCD report concerning the &quot;Abuse and Neglect of Older People in Ireland&quot;. The Task Force also researched and reviewed the regulatory regimes in other jurisdictions and analysed judicial and academic commentary relevant to all issues considered. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 provides, in section 3 (2), that every regulation to be made under the Bill, which will establish a new independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority to regulate both solicitors and barristers, shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas subject to a 21 day period for a possible resolution for annulment. The scope and application of this and other regulatory provisions are among those matters I am considering in preparation for the Bill's Committee Stage.</p></reply>

As such, many organisations request the attendance of this vehicle at various events throughout the country.  Because of its importance, it is necessary to strike a balance between making the vehicle available to the public on appropriate occasions, and ensuring that it is properly maintained and preserved.   When requests for the vehicle&rsquo;s attendance at community events are received, my Department, following consultation with the Military, will determine whether the application can, or cannot be acceded to and will advise the applicant accordingly.  The following conditions are required as a minimum when evaluating these requests: The event is for a charitable or non profit cultural or community purpose; The event is of regional or national importance; The location / site is acceptable; The attendance of the vehicle at the event would be in the public interest.</p><p>  The availability of Military equipment and personnel, and the costs involved in transporting and securing the artifact when it is away also have to be considered when deliberating on a request.  In that context, it should be noted that the vehicle must travel with a Military party for transport and security reasons and the Military must remain present for the duration of the event.  The personnel involved have other Military duties which may take precedence over the display of the vehicle.  A list is provided below of the events where Sliabh na mBan has been on display following the completion of its extensive refurbishment in February, 2012  .</p><p>  I am aware that my Department and the Military are currently drawing up proposals for Sliabh na mBan to be placed on public display for certain periods in the Curragh Museum.  This would provide an opportunity to members of the public to view this artifact with a minimum risk to its maintenance and preservation and at a low cost to the Defence Forces: 6th   May &ndash; Vintage Motor Show &ndash; Clonmel; 3rd   June &ndash;Vintage Motor Show &ndash; Longford; 15th   August &ndash; Commemorative Coin Launch in Collins Barracks, Cork; 18th/19th   August &ndash; Beal na mBlath Commemoration; 8th   September &ndash; Newbridge 200 Celebrations.</p><p>  Sliabh na mBan was also on display in military barracks at a number of official/military occasions and commemorations.</p><p>  Following prior arrangement, visitors also viewed the vehicle in the Curragh Camp. </p></reply>

In order to make the necessary savings it was proposed to make technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers whose farming enterprises are situated primarily in DAS areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme, which are defined in the governing EU legislation as follows: To ensure continued agricultural land use and thereby contribute to the maintenance of a viable rural community; To maintain the countryside; To maintain and promote sustainable farming systems which, in particular, take account of environmental protection measures.</p><p>  Processing of high volume application schemes, such as the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and the Single Payment Scheme, require significant hands-on from the management teams and a willingness and ability to focus resources on the varying priorities that arise throughout the process.  One very important element of the process is dealing with the many and varied enquiries from applicants, by telephone, letter, email or on-line.  The 2012 processing campaign is currently well advanced, with the necessary arrangements in place to deal with farmers&rsquo; queries.  The record number of applications submitted on-line in 2012 has further contributed to the smoother processing of applications.</p><p>  While changes were introduced in respect of the minimum stocking density requirements, specific provision was made for those farmers who had a stocking density less than 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to a recognised agri-environmental measure.  The principles of force majeure/exceptional circumstances were also provided for in the process. Provision was also be made for new entrants to farming.</p><p>  All 10,046 applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, were written to formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in such an agri-environmental measure resulted in the lower stocking density.  The Department is currently working on those applicants who applied for derogation, good progress has been made to date with many already paid.  All applicants are being advised, in writing, of the success or otherwise of their application.  Those unsuccessful applicants are being afforded the opportunity of appeal to the DAS Derogation Appeals Committee.  This Committee, to be chaired by Padraig Gibbons, is to be constituted shortly, to adjudicate on those further appeals from farmers dissatisfied with Department decisions on their derogation applications.</p><p>  Payments under the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme started issuing, on schedule, on 26 September 2012 and, to date, payments worth in the region of &euro;159 million have issued; these payment levels are very much in line with previous years.

The Egyptian market is also open to fattening cattle under 20 months and slaughter cattle under 30 months. The question of when trade will resume to these countries is dependent on a number of factors, including commercial factors such as price and demand. </p><p>  In relation to transport issues, Ireland has strict animal welfare rules in relation to the approval of ships for transport. These rules are designed to protect the welfare of livestock during transport. The process of approval involves an initial detailed documentary check to confirm that certain structural, stability and other standards are in compliance with our legislation. If this documentary check is in order, an on-site inspection of the ship is carried out by a Marine Surveyor and a Veterinary Inspector from my Department. While no ship has completed the approval process to date, two ships have recently been inspected as part of the approval process. </p></reply>

The scheme will build on the success of both the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and both AEOS 1 and 2 in delivering an annual income to farmers in return for farming to high environmental standards. A maximum payment of &#8364;4,000 per annum will apply to individual applicants under the re-opened scheme. As the average payments in the past have been lower than the maximum, I am confident that up to 6,000 new participants can be accepted into the scheme. </p><p><br />  I received EU approval for the advance payment of the 2012 Single Farm Payment. This will enable payment to issue immediately following 15 October and will represent the early payment of some &#8364;600 million to farmers.  </p><p><br />  I also fully appreciate the value and importance of the other scheme payments to farmers and I remain committed to ensuring that the maximum numbers are paid at the earliest possible date, mindful, of course, of the over-riding necessity to ensure compliance with the governing EU requirements. Payments worth some &#8364;159 million under the Disadvantaged Area Scheme have been issued since 26th September last. This funding will provide a boost to the rural economy and will benefit all areas of the country. REPS payments in respect of 2011 are up to date. A total of &#8364;64 million has been paid out to-date and these payments are continuing on an on-going basis. AEOS payments are well advanced and are being issued as quickly as possible. To date &#8364;23 million has been paid. My intention is to ensure that payments in respect of 2012 are made on the earliest possible date.</p></reply>

The Committee includes representatives from Bord Bia, Teagasc, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Enterprise Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department. The HLIC also engages regularly with various private sector groups with a key role in FH2020. Implementation of many of the key measures needed to achieve the growth figures set out in the report is a matter for private sector actors including industry and individual farmers.</p><p>  As a high level strategic vision, the Food Harvest 2020 report does not contain implementation plans related to specific sites, including Natura 2000 sites. However, my Department and the HLIC are acutely aware of the need to ensure that appropriate assessment and strategic environmental analysis are considered, in line with the relevant EU Directives, and carried out where required, in the course of achieving the targets set out in the report. </p><p>  The HLIC committee recognised that the broad strategic targets in the report could be achieved in a variety of ways and determined that an independent environmental analysis should be commissioned of various possible scenarios through which the targets set out in the report could be achieved. The results of this analysis will inform the implementation of measures by all relevant actors, including those in the private sector. An independent team of experienced consultants with expertise in both agriculture and environmental assessment has been procured by my Department to carry out this work. The team has presented a detailed interim report to the HLIC and is due to present its final report by the end of October.</p><p>  The analysis is in line with the strategic environmental assessment process. It includes the likely impacts of achieving the targets on: biodiversity; flora/fauna; water (including groundwater quality); soil; air quality; landscape; and climatic factors (including impacts on greenhouse gas emission levels).</p><p>  My Department is considering if the analysis should include an appropriate assessment under the Habitats Directive, and in this regard are engaged in discussions with the European Commission.</p></reply>

The objective of the review was to deliver a policy which would ensure an economically and biologically sustainable fishery. I received over 20 sets of proposals and comments in relation to herring stocks management. It was very clear from these documents that there was no agreement within the industry as to how the future herring fishing opportunities should be managed. I asked my Department to examine the proposals received and to prepare for me a number of options, which as far as practically possible, took the views of stakeholders into account while delivering proper and effective management.  </p><p>  On 22 December 2011, I published a draft policy document on the matter which I believed meets the objectives to the greatest extent possible. I consulted and met industry regarding the draft policy and again there was no consensus.  Having considered all views and having regard to the sustainability of the fisheries, I came to a decision which I believe provides for the proper and effective management and conservation and rational exploitation of the herring stocks. On 8 June 2012 I published a policy, based on giving access to each of the fisheries to those with recent track record in that particular fishery.  The track record involves vessels having landed a minimum of 5 tonnes of herring in 2009 or 2010 or in 3 of the 5 years during the period 2006 to 2010.  In addition, there are some very limited specified  circumstances where an earlier track record may be taken into account.</p><p>  These are the criteria under which future herring authorisations will be granted and I believe that these track record criteria are objective, transparent and non-discriminatory.  The only exception to track record relates to small vessels in the Dunmore area for the Celtic Sea fishery where a small scale local fishery is permitted in line with the Rebuilding/Management Plan for the fishery. The policy also provides for a modest restricted quota for smaller vessels without a track record in both the Celtic Sea and Area VIa.</p><p>  The decision made was based on a clear, detailed and objective assessment of the fisheries in recent years.  This policy is intended to ensure the long term sustainability of the herring fisheries by limiting participation in the main fisheries to those vessels which have participated in the fishery, in the 5 years prior to the commencement of the review, even at a low level.  I set down this fishing boat licensing aspects of this policy in Policy Directive 1 of 2012 which I issued to the Registrar of Sea Fishing Boats on 19 September 2012.</p></reply>

I am very conscious that farmers need money in their hands because of the poor summer and because of cash flow problems that some are experiencing at the moment and I am responding to these pressures within the funds available to me.</p><p><br />  Last week I announced the re-opening of the Agri-Environmental Options Scheme, AEOS, to new entrants.<i></i>  I am providing &#8364;20 million for the AEOS scheme which will open shortly for applications. The scheme will build on the success of both the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and both AEOS 1 and 2 in delivering an annual income to farmers in return for farming to high environmental standards. A maximum payment of &#8364;4,000 per annum will apply to individual applicants under the re-opened scheme. As the average payments in the past have been lower than the maximum, I am confident that up to 6,000 new participants can be accepted into the scheme.</p><p><br />  I received EU approval for the advance payment of the 2012 Single Farm Payment. This will enable payment to issue immediately following 15 October and will represent the early payment of some &#8364;600 million to farmers.</p><p><br />  I also fully appreciate the value and importance of the other scheme payments to farmers and I remain committed to ensuring that the maximum numbers are paid at the earliest possible date, mindful, of course, of the over-riding necessity to ensure compliance with the governing EU requirements.  Payments worth some &#8364;159 million under the Disadvantaged Area Scheme have been issued since 26th September last. This funding will provide a boost to the rural economy and will benefit all areas of the country. REPS payments in respect of 2011 are up to date. A total of &#8364;64 million has been paid out to-date and these payments are continuing on an on-going basis. AEOS payments are well advanced and are being issued as quickly as possible. To date &#8364;23 million has been paid. My intention is to ensure that payments in respect of 2012 are made on the earliest possible date.</p></reply>

Under the CAP reform proposals, the EU Commission has proposed to exclude from receipt of Single Farm Payment those whose annual direct payments are less than 5% of the total receipts they obtain from all non-agricultural activities or, if their agricultural areas are mainly areas naturally kept in a state suitable for grazing or cultivation, they do not carry out a minimum level of activity to be established by each Member State. The exclusion is not proposed to apply to farmers who received less than &euro;5,000 in direct payments in the previous year.</p><p>  There is substantial opposition from Member States to the Commission proposals particularly the intention to take account of receipts from non-agricultural activity.  Many Member States have put forward alternative proposals to create a negative list comprising, for example, golf courses and airports, that would be excluded from payment. Other Member States have argued for a definition of active farmers that focuses on farming activity as measured through stocking density, crop production, etc. At this point it is too early to speculate on the final solution that may emerge.</p></reply>

The Deputy may be aware that the Biofeuels Obligation Scheme was introduced in 2010 by the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to contribute to achieving the renewable transport target under the Renewable Energy Directive.  The Scheme currently obliges that the amount of biofuel brought to the market is not less than 4.166% of the relevant disposal of petroleum road transport fuels.  In 2011, the biofuel obligation resulted in 145 million litres of biofuel being placed on the market.  The rate of obligation will increase over time and by 2020 it will require suppliers of road transport fuels to make certain that even higher volumes sold are biofuel.

The Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara are working closely together and with the affected farmers to render as much technical assistance as possible under the circumstances. The Marine Institute already provide a monitoring and forecasting service in relation to these naturally occurring algal blooms. I am also aware that personnel from both agencies have visited the affected sites to help assess and catalogue the impacts of the bloom on the oyster stocks and to gather as much environmental data as possible with a view to gaining a greater understanding of the dynamics of such an occurrence.</p><p>  They will collate and analyse the data gathered which will hopefully lead towards the development of better future mitigation and management measures in the event of future outbreaks occurring. My Department is working very hard, within the constraints of the relevant EU Directives, to streamline the aquaculture licensing system which in turn will allow operators to spread their stock, and hence their risk, over a greater number of locations so that the detrimental effects of any future blooms might be reduced. </p><p>  In conclusion, I should point out that the effects of the Karenia mikimotoi bloom have no implications with regard to human health issues and that Irish oysters should continue to enjoy a strong quality reputation in the market place and thus continue to attract premium prices, which in turn should help to mitigate the impact of the stock losses.</p></reply>

While the Department was successful in maintaining all three support programmes despite the budgetary constraints that the Government is facing, it was necessary to revise certain payment rates and subvention levels under each programme. </p><p><br />  The ECCE programme provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  Approximately 95% of children in the year before school are availing of the free pre-school provision at this time.  The ECCE programme is being maintained on a universal and free basis but a reduction of &#8364;2 per week was made to the capitation rates paid to providers from September 2012.  However, to give some flexibility to childcare services to manage this modest reduction, the staff to child ratio for the pre-school element of childcare will increase from a ratio of 1:10 to a ratio of 1:11. </p><p><br />  The ECCE programme, which will be evaluated and developed as resources permit, continues to provide a guaranteed source of income, payable in advance of each term, to participating childcare services, and is considered a very beneficial support for the private childcare sector at this time of economic difficulty. </p><p><br />  The CCS programme enables community-based childcare services to provide childcare at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income families.  From September 2012, the higher subvention rate payable for full day care, under this programme, of &#8364;100 per week has been reduced by &#8364;5 to &#8364;95.  Parents in receipt of a social welfare payment but who do not have a medical card entitlement qualify from September 1, 2012 for a payment of &#8364;50 per week for full day care. </p><p>The CETS programme was introduced in September 2010.   The eligibility criteria under which trainees and students qualify for the programme is determined by F&Aacute;S and the Vocational Educational Committees (VECs).  From 1 September 2012, the CETS<b></b>programme provides &#8364;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places to participating childcare services for qualifying F&Aacute;S and VEC students for the duration of their course.  Students on part-time courses are funded on a pro rata basis.  This had been the only category of parents who paid no contribution to the cost of their childcare requirements.  Childcare services providing F&Aacute;S and VEC places will, from 1 September, be allowed to charge a weekly fee of not more than &#8364;25 per full-time childcare place. </p></reply>

T he HSE registers and inspects  non-statutory voluntary and private children&#8217;s residential centres against these standards.  A copy of the standards is available on my Department's website at <i>www.dcya.ie</i>.</p><p><br />  The process of assessing standards of care in the centres is undertaken by a HSE inspector who visits the centre and  gathers information through interviews and meetings with the centre management, staff members and young people, analysis of case files and centre records and contact with guardians, social workers and other professionals as appropriate.  Centres are thoroughly inspected and where an inspection report identifies non-compliance with a regulation, the centre will not be registered and re-registered again until compliance has been achieved.</p><p><br />  All young people who have had a care history with the HSE are entitled to an aftercare service based on their assessed needs. Section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991 places a statutory duty on the HSE to form a view in relation to each person leaving care as to whether there is a &quot;need for assistance&quot; and if it forms such a view, to provide services in accordance with the legislation and subject to resources.  The basis of an aftercare service is an individual needs assessment which identifies a young person&#8217;s need for accommodation, financial support, social network support and training and education.  The level of support required will vary for each individual from advice to accommodation to further education, employment or training and social support.  The core eligible age range for aftercare is 18 years to 21 years.  The HSE policy allows flexibility for this to be extended up to the age of 23 years to  complete a course of education.</p></reply>

Under the 1995 Child Care Regulations , the HSE is required to consider a child's need for assistance in accordance with the provisions of Section 45, two years prior to the child  leaving care.</p><p><br />  All young people who have had a care history with the HSE are entitled to an aftercare service based on their assessed needs.  The core eligible age range for aftercare is 18 years to 21 years.  The HSE policy allows flexibility for this to be extended up to the age of 23 years to  complete a course of education.</p><p><br />  Some 90% of children in care are in foster care and a large number of these remain living with their foster families, supported financially by the HSE, on reaching 18 years of age.  Many of these young people continue in education and training as planned.  This remains a key component of aftercare for young people when they leave care. </p><p><br />  The basis of an aftercare service is an individual needs assessment which identifies a young person&#8217;s need for accommodation, financial support, social network support and training and education.  The level of support required will vary for each individual from advice to accommodation to further education, employment or training and social support.  </p><p><br />  The HSE National Aftercare Service is underpinned by a National Policy and Procedures Document which was developed in cooperation with the key stakeholders, including the voluntary sector agencies representing children in care and those involved in aftercare provision and my Department.  The policy  commits to promoting and achieving the best outcomes for young people leaving care and in ensuring consistency of support to these young people. </p><p><br />  An intra-agency National Aftercare Implementation Group, comprised of NGO groups representing aftercare, child advocacy, foster care and other groups, was established by the HSE to monitor progress in implementing the national policy.  This group aims to provide a standard, intra and inter-agency approach to the delivery of aftercare services in partnership with the wider voluntary and statutory sector.  Discussions are ongoing on the development of a joint protocol between the HSE and the County and City Managers Association Housing sub group to improve the provision of appropriate and supported accommodation for care leavers.  The experience in implementing the National Aftercare Policies and Procedures and the involvement of a range of important stakeholders in this process provides an opportunity to further improve policy and legislation in this area.</p><p><br />   The Deputy will be aware that I am currently examining options, in association with the Attorney General, to strengthen legislation to make explicit the HSE's obligations in the provision of aftercare.  I have asked Gordon Jeyes, National Director for Children and Family Services in the HSE to prepare a  report on aftercare.  This report will include, <i>inter alia</i>, the key findings of the group, examples of best practice, assessment criteria and effective aftercare supports. This report will guide the development of policy to underpin the strengthening of legislation for services in this important area.</p></reply>

This programme requires that staff members acting as preschool year leaders hold a child care qualification equivalent to FETAC Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ).   A higher capitation rate is available to sessional playschool services participating in the ECCE programme in which all child care workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the programme. Staff working with children under the ECCE programme, as preschool assistants, are not required to hold an educational qualification.  </p><p>  Pobal, which administers the child care support programmes on behalf, of my Department compiles an Annual Survey of the Early Years Sectors which provide information in relation to the level of qualifications of practitioners in the child care sector.  According to Pobal's Annual Survey of the Early Years Sector 2011, there are in the region of 4,300 child care services participating in the ECCE programme and approximately 3,280 of these services responded to the survey.  Of this number, some 2,920 provided information on the level of training/qualifications of some 17,000 staff working with children. The results, which did not distinguish between those working with children enrolled for the ECCE programme and other children in the child care service, show that 96% of these services have a least one staff member qualified to FETAC Level 5 or higher, 75.2% have at least one member qualified to FETAC Level 6 or higher and 34% have a least one member qualified to HETAC Level 7 or higher.  The number of services with one staff member qualified to HETAC Level 8 and above and HETAC Level 9 above is 22.3% and 3.2% respectively. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware my Department has commenced work on Ireland&rsquo;s first-ever Early Years Strategy and in the terms of reference, as approved by Government, I expressly included the need to consider &ldquo;a robust system of regulation and inspection&rdquo;, for the new Early Years Strategy. Part of this will include improving access to quality reliable information on services and performance.  I have asked the recently&ndash;established Expert Advisory Group to prioritise a review of this matter.</p><p>  The employment of suitably qualified staff is a matter for each individual child care service. It is expected that in time a register of staff qualifications will be developed and providers should encourage staff to record the relevant details of their qualifications there.</p></reply>

It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure they are safe whilst in the care of the organisation. The Government has committed, as a priority, to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I published the Heads of the Children First Bill   in April 2012. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that organisations and professionals who work with children have a statutory responsibility to report reasonable concerns about the abuse or neglect of children in their care to the HSE Child and Family Services.</p><p>  I asked the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to consider the Heads of the Children First Bill and make recommendations.  I received their comprehensive Report in July and  I thank the Committee for its work on this matter. My Department is currently considering the broad range of submissions to, and recommendations of the Joint Committee, including those submissions pertaining to the issue of childminders.</p><p>  Preschool services are regulated under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No.2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.   &quot;Childminder&quot; is defined in the  Regulations as &quot;a person who provides a childminding service as defined in the Regulations&quot;.  A &quot;childminding service&quot; is defined in the Regulations as &quot;a preschool service which may include an overnight service offered by a person who single-handedly takes care of preschool children, including the childminder's own children, in the childminder's home for a total of more than 2 hours per day, except where the exemptions provided in Section 58 of the Child Care Act 1991 apply.&quot;</p><p>  Services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Pre-School Inspectorate of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services as well as childminders taking care of more than three preschool children from different families in the childminder&rsquo;s home.  Childminders taking care of not more than three preschool children from different families are not covered by the Regulations, recognising parental choice to place children with friends and neighbours, and the challenges of the over-regulation of the more informal arrangements chosen by parents.  As a result of this exemption it is not possible to provide a figure for the number of childminders currently providing childminding services.</p><p>  The National Guidelines for Childminders, compiled by the National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee which oversees the development of an integrated child care infrastructure throughout the country, provide guidance to childminders on good practice, and assist them to decide whether they are subject to the Regulations, as well as providing other useful information on the role of the childminder in the provision of child care services.</p><p>  The 2006 Regulations replaced the earlier Regulations, introduced in 1996, and made a number of improvements to the regulatory environment, including the introduction of a requirement for all staff and students working in a preschool service to have been Garda vetted.</p><p>  As is the case with all regulatory requirements, the Child Care Regulations set the minimum standards which services are legally required to comply with.  However, my Department is proactive in monitoring, promoting and developing the highest standards of care and education throughout the sector, including the regulatory environment, given the important role which these services play in this crucial phase of children&rsquo;s lives.</p><p>  My Department also has begun work on Ireland&rsquo;s first Early Years Strategy which I envisage will be a creative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s Early Years sector aimed at providing a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to age six.   One of the issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the new Strategy is the development of the childminding sector as a fully-integrated component of early childhood care and education, in particular for the under-one age group.</p></reply>

In line with the Programme for Government, my Department has made a significant commitment to maintaining the universal free preschool year.  About 65,000 children, that is approximately 95% of children in the year before school, are availing of the free preschool provision at this time.   </p><p>  In 2011, the ECCE programme cost approximately &euro;163 million.  Additional funding has been made available for 2012 when the cost of the programme is expected to rise to &euro;175 million to cater for changing demographics and provide for the increased number of children in the relevant age cohort. </p><p>  I am aware of the need to further develop the early childhood care and education sector and it is my view that it could be extremely helpful to some children if the free preschool provision were extended to a second year.  This could be particularly beneficial for certain children with special needs who currently can avail of the preschool year on a pro-rata basis over two years.  However, any development that involved further provision of preschool would require considerable additional funding and given the financial constraints under which the Government is currently operating it is not possible to provide for any enhancements to the programme at this time. </p><p>  However future developments relating to early years care and education will be considered during preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy 2012.</p></reply>

The necessary legislation is being prepared by my Department as a priority. It is anticipated that the Bill will be published and enacted in the course of this session. It is my intention that the Child and Family Support Agency will assume statutory responsibility for services for children and families in January 2013. </p><p>  The commitment to establish a new Child and Family Support Agency is at the heart of the Government's reform of child and family services.  The establishment of a single agency, underpinned by legislation and incorporating key children and family services, will provide a focus for the major reforms already underway under the National Director for Children and Families, Gordon Jeyes.  This reform programme contains a number of critical elements:</p><p>- The continued and urgent implementation of a comprehensive change programme to improve the quality and consistency of child welfare and protection services;</p><p>- The commitment to introduce legislation to place Children First on a statutory basis:</p><p>The establishment for the first time of a dedicated budget for children and family services, providing transparency and accountability for - the use of resources to meet national priorities;</p><p>- The transition of existing HSE child protection and welfare and services into the new Agency;</p><p>The merger of the existing Family Support Agency with a budget of over &euro;26 million into the Child and Family Support Agency;</p><p>- Consideration of the potential for further rationalisation of services for children under the new Agency.</p><p>  The new Agency will assume responsibility for Children and Family Services, currently provided by the HSE, and the Family Support Agency.  It will have a workforce of approximately 4,000 staff, and a combined existing budget of over &euro;590 million. The Agency will be headed by Gordon Jeyes, as the Chief Executive designate, who will be supported by a senior management team. The recruitment of this team is at an advanced stage. </p><p>  The new Agency and the wider transformation of children's services represents on the of the largest, and most ambitious, areas of public sector of reform embarked upon by this Government. My Department is working closely with staff representatives and I am very happy to say that the establishment of the new Agency has received the support of unions and a broad range of professional organisations.  </p></reply>

Its core focus is on identifying ways of addressing costs throughout the industry, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law. Bilateral meetings have taken place with each insurer where they have brought forward their own ideas for cost savings in the market.  These ideas are the subject of ongoing deliberation and policy analysis within the Department.</p><p>The Forum also facilitates participating parties to consider certain issues related to the implementation of Universal Health Insurance (UHI). The future delivery of health services under UHI will require competing insurance companies driving efficient, cost effective delivery of high quality health care.  The Forum will allow the insurance companies to consult with my Department on many significant changes on the road to the full implementation of UHI.   </p></reply>

It is expected that these negotiations will conclude shortly and provide additional savings in the cost of medicines. In addition, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012 will introduce a system of reference pricing and generic substitution for prescribed drugs and medicines.

Unfortunately, it has become necessary for the HSE to suspend certain products from its list of reimbursable items.  These include glucosamine, omega-3 triglyceride products, orlistat, and gluten-free products.</p><p><br />  Glucosamine is indicated for the management of symptoms of osteoarthritis.  The National Centre for Pharmoeconomics (NCPE) have assessed the cost-effectiveness of glucosamine on two occasions and concluded that it did not offer value for money to the HSE.  However, glucosamine products are available over the counter without prescriptions.</p><p><br />  Omega-3 triglyceride products (e.g. Omacor) have been identified both nationally and internationally as not being cost effective or being of lesser benefit to patients. However, these products are also available over the counter without prescriptions, as is Orlistat.</p><p>Gluten-free products have become more widely available in supermarkets in recent years and tend to be significantly cheaper than products sold through community pharmacies.  A Supplementary Welfare Allowance Adult Diet Supplement may be awarded by the Department of Social Protection to eligible persons.  Persons wishing to apply for this allowance can do so by completing an application form which can be downloaded at the following link:   .  Separate application forms are available for children. For persons who are not awarded a Diet Supplement, monies spent on gluten-free foods can be taken into account for tax purposes.</p></reply>

This Act was amended in 2006 by the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act, 2006 (No. 22 of 2006) to provide a clear definition for "diagnosed positive for Hepatitis C". I am satisfied that the present legislation is fair and reasonable and I have no plans to amend it.</p><p>  For this reason I do not think a meeting would be beneficial at this time but I will of course review any new information which becomes available in relation to this matter.  My officials spoke to the person who has made this request and explained the rationale for the State's position on this issue.  Her question has also been replied to in previous representations and Parliamentary Questions.  While I am sympathetic to the small number of women whose case she represents, and who have tested negative for Hepatitis C, it is estimated that up to 16,000 women in Ireland were exposed to potentially infectious batches of Anti-D. Approximately 1,000 of these women were infected with Hepatitis C and were therefore eligible to apply to the Tribunal for compensation. However, extending eligibility to those who have tested negative for Hepatitis C would have significant implications for the compensation scheme overall.</p></reply>

It set out 10 priority recommendations and many of these are already being taken forward. Areas of ongoing collaboration include - child protection, cancer research, health promotion, suicide prevention, radiotherapy services, paediatric congenital cardiac surgery and a range of initiatives under the Interreg IVA funding initiative.  The  Study was published on the websites of the Irish Department of Health and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  in Northern Ireland  last December. </p><p>  At a departmental level co-operation between  the two jurisdictions  is active and ongoing.  "Transforming Your Care: a Review of Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland." also recommends co-operation on a number of key issues. My officials are liaising with their counterparts in the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  in Northern Ireland on how to progress these issues. </p><p>  With specific reference to Paediatric Cardiac Surgery, Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Crumlin, Dublin 12 has since 2009 been assisting the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust in providing Paediatric Congenital Cardiac Surgery Services to patients from Northern Ireland. Crumlin cared for 9 such patients in 2011 and this year it is expected that over 20 such cases will be carried out Crumlin.</p><p>  There have been two meetings between the Department of Health and the Department of Health and Social Services and Public Safety and contacts are continuing with a view to determining as soon as possible how best an all Island service might be established and how soon this could be realised if it is determined, through consultation, to be the optimum solution.</p><p>   I am committed to working together with my Northern colleagues on issues of common concern and benefit. This is of particular relevance  in the current time when both jurisdictions are implementing change and pushing forward  health reform.</p></reply>

It is an important stepping stone towards the introduction of universal health insurance which is the ultimate destination of the Government's reform programme.  As a first step on that journey, hospitals will be aligned within groups on an administrative basis. Each Group will have a single consolidated management team with responsibility for performance and outcomes, within a clearly defined budget and employment ceiling.</p><p>  In June 2012, the Minister announced the appointment of Professor John R Higgins to work with the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) in the role of Chair of a Strategic Board to assist the Department of Health in the design and establishment of Hospital Groups. As Chair, he will have a key role in progressing the creation of Hospital Groups initially and, ultimately, Independent Hospital Trusts.    The Project Group led by Professor John Higgins has carried out a comprehensive consultation process with all acute hospitals and other key advocacy groups which have requested an opportunity to be consulted. In addition, a significant number of submissions have been received by the Project Group. The consultation process has continued through the summer and will conclude later this month.</p><p>  Criteria for the formation of Hospital Groups and proposed groups arising from these criteria will be identified by the Project Group. A Strategic Board is being established to consider the findings and proposals of the Project Group prior to their submission to the Minister and, subsequently, to Government. The submission to Government is planned to take place before the end of the year.</p><p>  The Board will also have an ongoing role in overseeing the implementation of proposals in relation to Hospital Groups approved by Government. It is scheduled to have its first meeting in early October.</p><p>  No decision has been taken yet in relation to what hospital group Mayo General Hospital Castlebar will belong.  The final decision on potential Groups will be a matter for the Government to decide.</p></reply>

In July 2011, I announced changes to the remit of the NTPF - namely that it would move from working to largely outsource treatments for those waiting longest to working with hospitals in a performance improvement capacity to improve access to scheduled care.  The NTPF has been aligned with the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) and is now targeting waiting lists strategically and incentivising hospitals to manage their waiting times proactively.  The NTPF capability is a core part of the SDU's performance improvement role in holding public hospitals to account.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the Disability Act does not create an office which exists independently of the person who holds office and, accordingly, the ODAO is not a corporate body.

The DNA rate is calculated by taking the number of missed appointments (DNAs) as a rate of the sum of the total number of attendances and missed appointments.  While hospitals returned activity, including DNA data across 2011, this data was not compiled / processed by BIU due to the roll out of the Outpatient Data Quality Programme.</p><p><b>Table 1.

The main area of waste resulting from patients not attending scheduled clinics is the effort invested in the pulling and preparation of health care records (charts) and the smaller, albeit significant cost, of processing appointment letters and associated costs such as postage, text messages, etc.</p><p>In situations where patients do not attend, for the most part, staff are occupied attending to other patients in the outpatient area (as many clinics are over-booked) and thereafter, return to their other duties in the general hospital, such as ward work, theatre work and medical administration work such as the typing and processing of medical notes and charts.</p><p>Most importantly, however, is the effect of DNAs on outpatient waiting lists and wait times.  In 2010, almost 600,000 appointments were missed by patients on hospital waiting lists.  Current outpatient waiting lists do not exceed 400,000 patients.  It is clear, therefore, that the already limited capacity for the system to attend to all patients on the waiting list in a timely manner is being impacted further by these missed (and therefore wasted) appointment slots which prevents this slot being utilised by another patient still waiting for his/her appointment.</p><p>I am determined to do all that is possible to minimise this waste and reduce waiting lists.  If a patient finds they cannot attend the appointment they have been given I would appeal to all such patients to inform the clinic concerned as soon as they know they cannot attend.</p></reply>

However, <i>A Vision for Change</i> recommended that CAMHS should be provided for all up to the age of 18 years.  The implementation of <i>A Vision for Change</i> is a work in progress and transitional arrangements apply as CAMHS current service provision is expanded to facilitate the provision of services to 16 and 17 year olds.</p><p><br />  The 2010-2011 audit of CAMHS indicates that of the 55 teams in place during the measurement period (November 2010), 12 teams accept referrals of children over 16 years, 4 teams consider new referrals of children over 16 on a case by case basis, and 39 teams do not accept any new referrals of children over 16 (but continue to see open cases beyond their 16th birthday).</p><p><br />  As mental health disorders increase in frequency and severity above the age of 15 years, it has been estimated that increasing the age range of CAMHS to 18 years, doubles the cost of providing the service.  The allocation of an additional 150 posts to CAMHS teams as part of the &#8364;35m package provided for mental health in Budget 2012, should help progress the expansion of CAMHS to all up to 18 years.  The National Recruitment Service of the HSE is currently working to recruit the necessary personnel and the posts are at various stages in the recruitment process.  It is hoped that the bulk of the appointments will be made by the end of the year.</p><p><br />  The Deputy may also wish to note that the HSE has recently finalised &quot;<i>Access Protocols for 16 and 17 year olds to Mental Health Services</i>&quot; and these have been approved by the Management Team and will come into affect from 1st January next. <b><i></i></b>In an effort to ensure that children are treated in an age appropriate manner, the new protocol provides that from 1<sup>st</sup> January 2013, CAMHS will accept referrals of all new cases of children up to their 17th birthday, and from 1st January 2014, CAMHS will accept referrals of all new cases of children up to their 18th birthday.</p></reply>

Local offices may operate a discretionary budget which covers a wide range of items ranging from mobility aids to communication aids.  It is possible that some individuals have received orthopaedic footwear in the past from this source.

The basis for this provision is in the Health Act, 1970 and is subject to specific eligibility criteria as follows: Medical Card holders; and Long-Term Illness Card holders, where the medical/surgical aid is deemed appropriate and specific to their diagnosed illness or disability.  Individuals who do not come under the criteria outlined are considered on a case by case basis.  Assessments are carried out by a range of multi-disciplinary staff.</p><p>  Approval of the items is based on detailed information received and with the assistance of local prioritisation guidelines to ensure that people with the most urgent assessed needs have their needs met first, within a set monthly budget.  All professionals providing community based services will be aware of the prioritisation criteria and will provide any necessary and urgent items of equipment following appropriate assessment, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

These community meetings are being held (or have already taken place) in every county in Ireland before the year end.Like the sponsorship of the Navy/Notre Dame game, these have been supported by the &euro;5 million earmarked this year for 'The Gathering Ireland 2013' in direct funding from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. </p><p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland estimates that each additional visitor to Ireland arising from 'The Gathering Ireland 2013' will generate direct revenue of &euro;470 per visitor so the target number of visits would generate over &euro;150 million in additional tourism exports.  Already, the specific Gathering events that have been pledged by communities, organisations, businesses and tourism providers are set to deliver visitor numbers in 2013 in excess of that threshold based on funds allocated to-date.</p></reply>

Over the same period they received funding of &euro;620,000 from my Department for the development of a Greenway within Westport Town.</p><p>In 2012 the National Cycle Network funding scheme was launched. Mayo County Council submitted only one proposal under this funding scheme, for a Greenway route in Castlebar. This project requested &euro;725,000, and following a competitive process has been allocated this amount.</p><p>Also in 2012 Mayo County Council applied to my Department under the Active Travel Towns Programme for &euro;225,000 for the town of Ballina to construct an 8.8km leisure cycling and walking loop route (Belleek Loop), and for &euro;60,000 for the town of Louisburgh to provide a 1km Greenway link by upgrading an old disused off road track between Old Head and the town. There was considerable interest in the programme and significantly more proposals were submitted than funding was available. Both proposals were unsuccessful in securing funding.  An assessment panel considered all the applications submitted and selected those applications which best met the objectives outlined in the funding call. The Belleek Loop proposal was considered worthwhile in its support for active travel, leisure cycling and tourism, however, the assessment panel considered that it lacked sufficient focus on urban modal shift and focused instead to a great degree on leisure cycling. It therefore did not fully meet with the objectives of the Active Travel Towns programme and was not ranked high enough for inclusion in the final selection. The Louisburgh Greenway proposal was ruled out because the population size of the town fell outside the terms set for the programme.</p><p>In addition to the above, it should also be noted that Westport Town is a Smarter Travel Area (along with Limerick City and Dungarvan) and that significant on-going investment in sustainable transport infrastructure, including Greenways, is taking place in these towns.  </p><p>There are currently no funding streams open within the Department suited to applications for Greenway route development, and therefore no such applications being considered.</p><p>The table below summarises funding for Greenway type infrastructure within Co. Mayo from my Department. F&aacute;ilte Ireland are currently funding two significant Greenway projects, linking into the Great Western Greenway, and I understand they have further applications from Mayo County Council seeking funding to construct Greenways.  Accordingly, I have referred the Deputy&rsquo;s question to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Project Summary</b></th><th><b>Funded requested (&#8364;)</b></th><th><b>Funded received / allocated  (&#8364;)</b></th><th><b>Project Status</b></th></tr><tr><td>Great Western Greenway - 42km mainly off road route from Westport to Achill.
