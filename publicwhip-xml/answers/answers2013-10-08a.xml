The level of resources being devoted to supporting children with Special Educational Needs has been maintained at &euro;1.3 billion.  These resources have been protected despite the ongoing severe financial position.  The ongoing commitment of my Government to protect frontline supports for children with special educational needs is an acknowledgment of the important role played by SNAs in ensuring that children with special needs can progress and develop and be included, where appropriate, in mainstream school settings.</p><p>  This level of spending has been protected despite the ongoing severe financial position.  There has been no reduction in the number of SNA posts in the 2013/14 school year.  As budget considerations are ongoing, I am not in a position at this point to anticipate any future budgetary or expenditure provisions.</p></reply>

Our overall primary school enrolment has been growing rapidly in recent years and this is going to continue.  In managing the resource consequences of this, it is important that decisions on school provision and organisation are based on a rigorous evaluation of requirements and needs, not just at a local level but also at both regional and national levels.  A Value for Money review of Small Primary Schools has been recently presented to me.  The report's contents will be carefully considered with my Government colleagues prior to its publication.</p></reply>

The decisions in relation to such matters will be announced at budget time.  A particular challenge in the education sector is on ensuring we have school places and teachers for the thousands of additional pupils entering our schools each year. </p><p>  The Government will endeavour to protect frontline education services as best as possible.  However, the context for any discussion about PTR and class sizes is the requirement to bring our overall public expenditure into line with what we can afford as a country.  The challenge will be to ensure that the resources that can be provided are used to maximum effect to achieve the best possible outcome for pupils.</p></reply>

However, the alternative was to adjust the PTR staffing allocations.  Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students.  This operates at local school level.</p><p>  The representative organisations for School Principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation.  This approach puts a greater emphasis on group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle and maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support.  The budget decision sheltered the impact for all DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations &ndash; a fact which is often overlooked in this debate.</p></reply>

The assessment of income from the same starting point is deemed to be fair and reasonable because this approach eliminates any distortion which might arise from different spending decisions in different households.  In the interest of equity, I have no plans to change this arrangement.</p><p>  I understand that the independent Student Grant Appeals Board dealt with an appeal from the student referred to by the Deputy on 24th September 2013 and upheld the original decision of the awarding authority.  The student was notified of this decision on 25th September 2013.</p></reply>

Student Universal Support Ireland has implemented a number of initiatives recommended by an independent review of the process.  These include direct information sharing with Government bodies and other agencies including the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection and the CAO. </p><p>  I understand that these links have significantly reduced the number of documents required from students in processing grant applications and that SUSI is now some months ahead of its processing position at this time last year.  The grant renewals process has also been very successful to date.  I am assured by CDETB that SUSI is continuing to develop and improve its services and will deliver a much-improved service to students in 2013.</p></reply>

My colleague Minister Howlin has highlighted the importance of ensuring that the public sector is achieving maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement. A recent circular (D/PER 16/13) places emphasis on the need for all public bodies to achieve value for money when procuring goods and services. In addition, given the financial constraints within which we must all now work, cost reductions and savings can go some way to helping Exchequer funded bodies, such as schools, manage within reducing financial budgets.  </p></reply>

Students from welfare dependent families receive the special rate of grant which equates to &euro;164 per week.

The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.</p><p>  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down Syndrome who are in the Mild General Learning Disability (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD.</p><p>  The NCSE policy advice did not recommend that an exception should be made for children with Down Syndrome who are in the Mild GLD range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.</p><p>  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down Syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs.</p><p>  The NCSE has established a Working Group to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report. I understand that the Working will report its findings before the end of Spring 2014.</p></reply>

This is expected to be completed by each school as early as possible in the 2013/14 school year but in any event by no later than the end of the second term of the 2013/14 school year.Under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, all schools must have a code of behaviour which has been drawn up in accordance with guidelines issued by the National Education Welfare Board. These NEWB guidelines specifically require all schools to have an anti-bullying policy within the framework of their overall code of behaviour. The new anti-bullying procedures are underpinned by this legal framework.</p></reply>

However the alternative was to adjust the PTR staffing allocations. Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. This operates at local school level. The representative organisations for School Principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation. This approach puts a greater emphasis on group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle and maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support.</p><p>  The budget decision sheltered the impact for all DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations &ndash; a fact which is often overlooked in this debate.</p></reply>

The results in Irish and Mathematics differed from previous years due to a significant increase in the number of candidates taking the Higher Level papers and due for example, to a greater weighting (40%, up from 25% for the examinations in 2012 and 2013), being allocated to the oral component for Irish, and the recent allocation of bonus points for Higher Level Mathematics.</p><p>  The State Examinations Commission (SEC) was established as an independent agency in 2003 to deal with all operational issues relating to State Examinations. There was concern about errors in some Leaving Certificate papers, particularly in Mathematics.  These errors were the subject of a report provided to me by the SEC in August.  The SEC has set out a number of measures which, when put in place, are intended to minimise the risk of errors in the future.  The SEC will brief me on the outcome of these measures in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Teaching is a valued and important profession and I am glad that the Agreement has been accepted by three of the four trade unions representing teachers and lecturers in Ireland. I would again ask ASTI to examine the costs to their members of remaining outside the Agreement and to reflect further upon this matter, particularly given that the non-implementation of the Agreement will have the greatest impact on young, newly-qualified teachers. </p></reply>

These Guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated. The aim of the Guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes.</p><p>  The publication of these Guidelines followed a survey of schools conducted in 2011 by the Department. This had a 99% response rate at primary level, and showed that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme. At second level, the response rate was lower, at 44%. Of those which did respond, 88% of those in the VEC sector and 73% of those in the Community &amp;amp; Comprehensive sector operated a book rental scheme. </p><p>  I believe these results show that we have a good foundation to build on across the country. I hope that schools that are not yet operating book rental schemes will be encouraged to use the Guidelines to introduce them. If they do, it will result in substantial savings for parents. Schools which already have rental schemes can save parents up to 80% of the cost of buying new books.</p><p>  A special &quot;Guide for Parents&quot; was also published, to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them. I have been very clear in my support for book rental schemes. All of us who are parents know how expensive textbooks can be and what a burden it places on already hard pressed families at the start of every school year.</p><p>  I am pleased to see the high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary level and I believe that these Guidelines will encourage this practice across all schools in our education landscape. </p><p>  I also published a Report on Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools and the Allocation of Textbook Grants by the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills in May 2012. This report presented four policy options to encourage schools to establish textbook rental schemes. None of the options are ideal, each one involves a trade-off of advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>  The Department has not routinely gathered information on the number of schools operating book rental schemes. However, the Department will collect this information this year as part of the annual enrolment data returns from primary and post-primary schools.  I will continue to monitor the number of schools operating book rental schemes, and if it proves necessary consider further steps to encourage schools to do so.</p></reply>

There are currently 852 schools, comprising 658 primary and 194 second-level schools are participating in DEIS, with an overall enrolment of almost 167,000 young people. These schools are eligible for a range of additional supports including additional funding to assist them in working to improve attendance, retention and educational outcomes for their students with lower pupil-teacher ratios for those schools with the highest levels of disadvantage. </p><p>  In the current climate my Department's main focus is to retain, where possible, key resources in the schools targeted under the DEIS initiative. To this end resources in DEIS schools have been protected, with no overall changes to DEIS-related staffing levels or DEIS funding in 2013. </p><p>  I can inform the Deputy that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or where a NEPS psychologist is not available to a given school through a panel of private practitioners maintained under the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) which is administered by NEPS.</p><p>  NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. </p><p>  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention. This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. This process has been embedded by NEPS psychologists in the Primary sector with the production by the Department of Special Educational Needs &ndash; A Continuum of Support guidance and resource materials which has been distributed to all schools since 2007/8. In late 2010 similar support documentation was produced in relation to Emotional and Behavioural difficulties in the Primary sector and in relation to a formal Post-Primary Continuum process.</p></reply>

The Plan outlines the major school projects that are planned to proceed to construction over the duration of the Plan. The primary aim at the core of the Five Year Plan is focussed on meeting demographic demands to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers. </p><p>  Further to the Five Year Plan, my Department is committed to publishing a detailed annual programme in relation to individual major school projects commencing construction. In December 2011, details of 56 major school building projects to commence construction in 2012, the first year of the Plan, were published. In December 2012, details of 50 major school building projects were announced to commence construction in 2013, the second year of the Plan. </p><p>  Details of the building projects to commence construction in 2014 will be announced later on this year. In addition, the allocation of further funding under the Government's &quot;investment in Infrastructure &amp;amp; Jobs&quot; package, announced in June this year, will enable a further 28 school projects, providing state of the art classrooms and facilities, to be progressed to construction.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the biggest initiative ever undertaken to reduce the reliance on rented prefabs in schools.. Under the Prefab Replacement initiative 2012 (Phase 1),  my Department provided funding of in excess of &euro;42 million for the replacement of over 458 prefab units in 170 schools with permanent accommodation. A further &euro;15 million has been allocated under Phase II of the Prefab Replacement Initiative, that was announced in June this year, for the replacement of over 115 prefab units in 46 schools.  This funding will be used to replace prefabs with permanent classroom and resource rooms accommodation.</p><p>  Details of all school capital works funded by my Department may be viewed on my Department website and this is updated on a regular basis.</p></reply>

I have ring-fenced &euro;500,000 to support implementation of the Action Plan this year.  Work on the implementation of the actions is progressing well. Some weeks ago, I launched new National Procedures on Anti Bullying which will be adopted and implemented by all 4,000 primary and post primary schools.</p><p>  I have also made available funding for anti-bullying training for parents which is being run jointly by the National Parents Council (primary and post primary).  Earlier this year, an awareness raising initiative on cyber bullying targeted at young people took place and will continue in 2014.  My Department supported the Stand Up! Awareness Week Against Homophobic &amp;amp; Transphobic Bullying in second level schools which took place in March.  Two pieces of research suggested in the Plan around children with special needs and social media are also being progressed.

Governor Brown was on a private visit to Ireland, and was accompanied by his wife, Anne Gust, and his sister, Kathleen Brown.  Our discussions were informal and covered a range of issues including the economic challenges for Ireland and California, as well as the challenges for other EU economies and the Eurozone. I briefed the Governor on Ireland&rsquo;s successful EU Presidency, which yielded a mandate to open negotiations on an EU-US Trade Agreement.  The Governor highlighted his work in addressing climate change, which is an important issue for the State of California.</p><p>  The Governor and I also discussed the economic relationship between Ireland and California. Several Californian multinational companies operate in Ireland, creating valuable employment which is extremely beneficial to our economy. Likewise, California is an important centre for Irish business.  There are more than 50 Irish companies with offices there and, each year, a further eight to ten Irish companies - mostly in the technology sector - establish new operations in California.</p><p>When I was in California earlier this year, I visited Orange County, San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and Los Angeles, where I met a range of companies that provide employment in Ireland. I attended jobs announcements at Yahoo! and McAfee, which  resulted in a total of 260 new jobs for Ireland.  Our discussions also reflected the strong cultural and community connections between the US and Ireland.  This led to a conversation about the Governor&rsquo;s Irish Heritage, and our ongoing initiatives to engage with the Irish Diaspora, including the Global Irish Economic Forum, which was held in Dublin Castle last week.</p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains a roster of observers for election monitoring missions. We aim to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for both elections and constitutional referendums.</p><p>  The Department  carried out a review of the election observation roster earlier this year.  Following a call for applications, and an appraisal process against published criteria, 200 individuals with a strong mix of skills and experience were selected to serve on a new roster, which came into effect on 15 May 2013.</p><p>  Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  They have also been involved in missions organised by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Carter Centre.

Documentary proof in respect of identity and entitlement to citizenship are required for all passport applications.  These requirements are outlined in the passport application form notes that accompany each application form.  Details are also available on the Department's website  .For first-time adult applicants, there are standard requirements to prevent identity theft of our citizens and to safeguard against passport fraud.  These are:</p><p>(i) the long form version of their civil birth certificate;</p><p>(ii) photographic ID such a copy of a person's driving license, passport from another country;</p><p>(iii) documentary evidence to show the use of an applicant's name i.e. payslips, bank statements etc.; and</p><p>(iv) evidence of residency at an applicant's address i.e. utility bills, official State correspondence etc.</p><p>  In terms of citizenship, the evidence of a naturalisation certificate will establish that the person is an Irish citizen.  Accordingly, this document is required for any passport application, which is submitted by the person in question.  At this stage, it would be important for this person to submit a complete and witnessed application to the nearest Passport Office.  The details of her application can then be assessed in terms of its compliance of the Passport Act, 2008.  In the event of any difficulties or shortcomings with her application, the Passport Service will provide direct assistance to her to help her finalise her application to passport issue.</p><p>  In conclusion, it should be noted that the identity and anti-fraud measures, which are currently in place, are geared towards preserving the good reputation of the Irish passport abroad.   This, in turn, greatly helps to ensure the safe passage and wellbeing of Irish citizens as they travel worldwide.  Accordingly, the Passport Service reserves the right to verify the authenticity any aspect of a submitted application and its supporting documentation with the relevant authorities either in Ireland or abroad.</p></reply>

Development education, and public information and engagement, have been, and remain, key elements of the aid programme, as set out in the Government's new Policy for International Development, <i>One World, One Future</i> . The policy states that Irish Aid will work for a deep public understanding and engagement with the aid programme and our development policy. It recognises that an engaged and active public is vital to ensure long lasting and sustained commitment to addressing global poverty and inequalities. Ireland's development education funding supports activities which build a stronger understanding of global development issues, strengthen public awareness of the reality of the issues involved in our commitment to development cooperation, and promote a stronger sense of global solidarity.  </p><p>  The Policy reaffirms the priority given to development education.  In particular, we recognise the importance of a more strategic approach to development education and have been working to target funding effectively at key areas and to strengthen the focus on results from this investment.  The core priorities for development education include initial teacher education; online access to development education resources; capacity building for the development education sector; and a programme with third level students in Irish universities. </p><p>  We also prioritise development education initiatives at post-primary level. Last week, I launched the new WorldWise Global Schools Programme (2013-2016), which strengthens our support for second-level schools.  It focuses on promoting the knowledge, values and critical analysis skills that are central to development education throughout our post-primary school network.   </p><p>  For each of the last two years, 2011 and 2012, the Government has provided &euro;3.2 million through Irish Aid for development education.  This year, we are providing &euro;3.5 million.

It was drawn up on the basis of a very extensive public consultation process, and reaffirms Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for multilateral efforts in the fight against global poverty and hunger.  We recognize that, increasingly, global challenges require integrated, global solutions, based on the experience of the lives of people and communities in developing countries.  The policy commits the Government to continuing to channel some 30% of our Official Development Assistance (ODA) through multilateral organisations.</p><p>  Last year, 2012, Ireland provided some &euro;99.6 million in contributions to EU development cooperation programmes, while &euro;59.2 million was channelled through UN development agencies and bodies.  Through Irish Aid, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provided some &euro;27.8 million in funding to World Bank-managed trust funds for work in developing countries.  The Department of Finance provided a further &euro;23.4 million.  Full details of all the programmes supported, both by Irish Aid and the Department of Finance, can be found in the Annual Report by the Minister for Finance to the Oireachtas on Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the IMF and World Bank.    Multilateral organisations play a vital role in building international agreement on key development challenges. We take the clear view that all development work, including that of the multilateral organisations we support, should be framed explicitly in the context of sustainable development, inclusive economic growth, poverty reduction, country ownership and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  Our new development policy states that we will work with all our partners, Governments, NGOs, multilateral organisations and others, to ensure that they adhere to the standards of accountability and transparency that we have set for our bilateral assistance.</p><p>  As a member of the multilateral bodies involved, Ireland is represented in their governance arrangements.  We welcome, and are participating fully in, the ongoing process of reform within the UN, World Bank and the IMF to ensure they can adequately meet the development challenges of a changing world.  We are engaging strongly in systematic assessments of the organizational effectiveness of multilateral organisations through our membership of the Multilateral Organisation Performance Assessment Network (MOPAN), a network of 17 donor countries.  We have also committed in our new development policy to reviewing the range of our funding for multilateral organisations to ensure that it is as effective as possible and that it is fully aligned with our objectives for international development.</p></reply>

Delivering ODA as untied aid to developing countries is the best way to ensure that the recipients themselves are in the driving seat and that all development resources, both external and internal, coherently pursue common objectives.  Untying also means that more aid is spent in developing countries themselves. This helps create much needed employment. </p><p>  The OECD estimates suggest that when overseas aid is tied to the procurement of goods and services from the donor country, its effectiveness and efficiency is significantly diminished. Because of this, they recommend that donor countries untie the bulk of their aid to Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and to Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs).  Food aid and Technical Co-operation are not covered by the recommendation, although many countries, including Ireland, do untie these categories of aid.   In 2010 donors reported that 24 per cent of bilateral aid (US$ 26 billion) was still tied.  </p><p>  Ireland's aid is 100 per cent untied and the OECD has recognised that we are one of only four countries enjoying this distinction.  The high quality of our aid programme has been recognised by successive OECD reviews and by other independent assessments on aid quality such as the Commitment to Global Development index and the Real Aid Index.</p><p>  Ireland's new policy for international development, <i>One World- One Future</i>, approved by the Government earlier this year, once again reaffirmed our commitment to maintaining a high quality aid programme and to untied aid, in particular. It stipulates that our aid is &#8220;<i>not conditional on acquiring goods and services from Ireland&#8221;.</i></p><p>  Ireland has consistently supported the strengthening of the OECD recommendation on untying aid and the inclusion of untied aid as a key measure of aid quality against which donor progress on aid and development effectiveness should be measured.  The commitments that donors made at the 2011 Busan High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness include accelerating progress and improving transparency on aid untying.  Ensuring that these commitments become part of the post-2015 development framework was one of the priorities for the Irish Presidency of the EU - and this is successfully reflected in the EU Council Conclusions of June this year on the Post 2015 Framework.  </p><p>  A number of students from Ireland's Key Partner Countries and from other developing countries study in Ireland, before returning to their own countries, as part of our overall programme of capacity building. Ireland also provides funding to allow students undertake studies in their own countries or the region. A very small proportion of Ireland's ODA is made up of specific costs associated with international refugees during their first 12 month of stay seeking asylum in Ireland, in line with the OECD Development Assistance Committee's ODA reporting directives.</p></reply>

This commitment was expressed and enhanced  by the publication earlier this year of our new Policy on International Development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo; which clearly sets out our vision for a sustainable and just world, and our goals and areas of focus for the coming years. It also reaffirms the centrality of the aid programme to our foreign policy.   </p><p>  The new policy states clearly our commitment to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for ODA when economic circumstances permit. </p><p>  Over the past two years, the Government has broadly stabilised the budget for development assistance &ndash; allocating &euro;629 million on ODA in 2012 and &euro;622 million in 2013.   These very significant allocations of public funds clearly demonstrate how we consolidated the development assistance budget - a major achievement in light of the very difficult fiscal conditions facing the Government. Equally importantly, our aid programme remains one of the best in the world and our leadership on the hunger and nutrition agendas continues to be acknowledged internationally.  The Estimates process for Budget 2014 is now in its final stages and is being framed in the context of the Government&rsquo;s overall fiscal consolidation strategy. The Departmental budget allocations for 2014 will be a matter for Government decision and will be announced in the Budget Statement next week. </p></reply>

In that regard I am assured that Revenue is very conscious of the challenges that exist for some taxpayers in meeting their tax obligations in a timely manner. Its debt management caseworkers will always seek to work proactively with taxpayers and viable businesses that engage positively to agree mutually satisfactory arrangements to overcome temporary cashflow difficulties in preference to deploying enforcement options. However, where a business or taxpayer fails to meaningfully engage with Revenue, then I am fully supportive of the deployment of the necessary collection and enforcement measures to secure the taxes and duties due to the Exchequer.   One of the enforcement powers available to Revenue to ensure timely tax collection is Attachment. This power is covered in legislation under Section 1002 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended. Section 1002 allows Revenue to either directly remove funds from any account held by a financial institution (including credit unions) in the name of a defaulting taxpayer, or, to instruct any third party that owes a debt to the defaulting taxpayer to pay those funds directly to Revenue.</p><p>  I am informed by Revenue that it never deploys its enforcement powers, including Attachment, without giving the taxpayer every opportunity to engage and agree solutions. Debt management caseworkers always afford a defaulting taxpayer at least one opportunity to agree a mutually satisfactory arrangement before any enforcement activity is commenced. The enforcement process only commences when the caseworker has exhausted all other options to encourage voluntary compliance.</p><p>  Finally, Revenue is always conscious that the use of Attachment Orders can have adverse consequences for taxpayers and the power is normally only deployed where other enforcement options have failed to secure the outstanding debt. For example, during 2012 Revenue only issued Attachment Orders in less than 3,000 cases out of a total of almost 30,000 cases enforced. I am assured by Revenue that it has strict guidelines in place, including authorisation at a senior level, to ensure Attachment is only used in appropriate circumstances.</p></reply>

NAMA advises that individuals and groups who have an interest in a property that is related to a NAMA loan should make contact with the owner of the property.  NAMA advises also that, where it is made aware of potential purchaser interest in a debtor&rsquo;s property, it will work to facilitate engagement between the interested party and the debtor.

However, where an Irish-based supplier sells goods to private customers in other EU Member States, and the value of supplies to a particular Member State exceeds the relevant threshold for that Member State, then the Irish supplier must register and account for VAT in that Member State on those supplies. Similarly, suppliers in other Member States who supply goods to private customers in Ireland in excess of our threshold must register for VAT in Ireland and account to Revenue for the VAT on those supplies. The threshold is &euro;35,000 in Ireland and as high as &euro;100,000 in some Member States.   The Revenue Commissioners are fully aware of the potential for tax evasion as a result of eCommerce and online trading generally. Revenue&rsquo;s overall approach to managing compliance is to undertake a range of targeted interventions that are most appropriate for dealing with the specific risks presented in individual cases &ndash; including those trading online.  Their work is also supported and enhanced with appropriate technology, including their Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling (REAP) risk identification system and the capture of data from multiple sources.  One of these sources is trading information received from merchant acquirers, which contains indicators of cases involved in internet trading.</p><p>  Revenue's extensive range of measures and activities, designed to address shadow economy activity, includes exploiting the potential of new and emerging technology towards the identification of tax evasion associated with online trading and business activity. </p></reply>

However, I can put forward a specific example for the information of the Deputy.  The calculations presented are based on a single individual who takes up employment at the average annual salary in the construction sector, i.e. &euro;40,459 for 2013, based on the latest information available.  Before taking up the employment, the individual was entitled to the full rate of Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance at &euro;188 per week.  No other secondary benefits, which the individual may have been entitled to, have been included for the purpose of these computations.  Furthermore, it is assumed that the individual is not in receipt of a medical card and therefore does not benefit from the concessionary Universal Social Charge (USC) rate.  The following tax credits have been included in the computation:</p><p><table><tr><th>Tax Credit</th><th>Amount</th></tr><tr><td>PAYE tax credit</td><td>&euro;1,650</td></tr><tr><td>Personal tax credit:</td><td>&euro;1,650</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th><b>Tax Liability 2013 </b></th><th>-</th></tr><tr><td>Earnings</td><td> &euro;40,459 </td></tr><tr><td>USC</td><td>(&euro;2,151)</td></tr><tr><td>PRSI</td><td>(&euro;1,618)</td></tr><tr><td>Income Tax</td><td>(&euro;6,400)</td></tr><tr><td>Total Deductions</td><td>(&euro;10,169)</td></tr><tr><td>Net Pay</td><td> &euro;30,290</td></tr></table></p><p>Additional tax revenues of &euro;10,169 per annum (including Income Tax, USC and PRSI) would be generated over a full tax year in such a case.  In addition, savings of &euro;9,776 per annum would be achieved in relation to Jobseekers payments.

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  The Health Levy was introduced in the Health Contributions Act, 1979 and was payable on all reckonable income and subject to certain exemptions.  The Health Levy was collected along with PRSI contributions by the Revenue Commissioners.  Under the legislation, it was paid into the Social Insurance Fund and transferred from there to the Minister for Health, where it was appropriated to the Health Vote as an appropriation-in-aid.</p><p>  The Income Levy was introduced along with a suite of revenue raising measures in Budget 2009 in response to the economic downturn and in order to assist in stabilising the Exchequer finances.  Payment of the Health Levy and the Income Levy did not confer any entitlement or specific benefits to an individual.  However, individuals in general do benefit from the services provided by the State.  Likewise, individuals that are subject to the USC charge do not accumulate entitlements or specific benefits.</p><p>  The poverty traps under the Income Levy and Health Levy systems were related to the annual exemption thresholds that applied of &euro;15,028 and &euro;26,000 respectively.  These thresholds meant that if an individual&rsquo;s income was below the relevant exemption threshold they were not subject to charge.  However, as soon as an exemption threshold was exceeded, the charge was due on all income, not just the income in excess of the exemption threshold.</p><p>  The Health Levy was payable at 4% on an individual&rsquo;s entire income including the portion below the threshold.  Thus, what is often described as a &ldquo;step effect&rdquo; was experienced at income levels bordering the threshold.  It led to circumstances where an increase in gross pay for a person with an income just below the threshold, resulted in a reduction in net take home pay, thereby creating a poverty trap.  The step effect in the Health Levy system was very severe.  A &euro;1 increase in annual pay could lead to a net reduction of &euro;20 in net pay per week or about &euro;1,040 per annum.</p><p>  The Income Levy was payable at 2% on an individual&rsquo;s entire income including the portion below the threshold.  Although, a less severe step effect than that experienced for the Health Levy, it still could result in cases where a &euro;1 increase in annual pay could lead to a net reduction of just under &euro;6 in net pay per week or about &euro;300 per annum.  The introduction of the USC has reduced the severity and number of step effects in the taxation system.  Although, there is currently a step effect in the USC structure at &euro;10,036 per annum, the income level at which one becomes liable for USC, the impact is lower.  Furthermore, the Government increase to the exemption threshold for USC from &euro;4,004 in 2011 to &euro;10,036 per annum in 2012, acted to remove 330,000 from any liability to the USC.</p></reply>

Negotiations with the airlines were not successful and the Minister for Transport Tourism and Sport, Mr Leo Varadkar T.D., advised against reducing the Air Travel Tax to zero.</p><p>The impact of the Jobs initiative can be seen by the increase in employment levels, particularly in the accommodation and food services sector.  A policy paper, published with the November 2012 Medium Term Fiscal Statement, found that the 9% reduced VAT rate appeared to have the desired impact both in terms of price pass through and by contributing to employment gains, with an additional 3,000 jobs in quarter 1 2012 relative to quarter 2 2011 in the labour intensive food and accommodations services sector of the economy.  Further to this, the CSO website shows a 13% increase in employment from June 2011 to June 2013 in the food and accommodations services sector.</p><p>The Jobs Initiative also included a number of current and capital expenditure measures, among which there are a number of measures aimed at retraining the workforce.  While the details of the expenditure on these measures are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Brendan Howlin T.D., I would ask the Deputy to note that, my colleague the Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton T.D., with responsibility for JobBridge, the National Internship scheme , recently announced that the number of internships, originally planned at 5,000 has now exceeded 20,000.  Indecon Economic Consultants undertook an evaluation of the JobBridge scheme in 2012 (published in April 2013) and their report found that 61.4% of the JobBridge survey respondents were in employment within 5 months of finishing their internships.</p><p>Under education measures, the Springboard scheme as announced in the Jobs Initiative had initially provided for 5,900 places. During 2011 and 2012, over 10,000 people enrolled on programmes under the Springboard scheme.  The scheme has been extended further with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Ruair&iacute; Quinn T.D. announcing in June this year, another 6,000 places under the third Springboard allocation.  Further rollouts of the springboard scheme will be considered in the context of the findings of an on-going evaluation.</p><p>A temporary 0.6% stamp duty levy on pension fund assets was introduced in the Finance (No.2) Act 2011 as a measure to fund the Jobs Initiative.  This was estimated to yield &euro;470 million a year for 4 years.  The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that receipts amounted to &euro;463 million in 2011 and &euro;483 million in 2012.  This is broadly in line with the amounts anticipated to be collected in those years.  &euro;517 million was collected in 2013 to date, due to an increase in the capital value of pension funds.  The forecast for 2014 will be set out in the Budget next week.</p><p>Finally, with regard to concerns that the monies raised from the Pension Levy will be used for other purposes, I wish to advise the Deputy that it will only be when the levy has ended and the accompanying expenditure and revenue measures have also ceased that it will be possible to analyse the situation.  At any given point before then, it would not be surprising if the income and expenditure did not match.</p></reply>

The Central Bank has informed me that this requirement does not prevent solutions being offered where it can be demonstrated that there is a clear rationale to extend payments beyond age 70.  In general, however most borrowers can expect income levels to drop at retirement.  In determining whether a proposal constitutes a sustainable solution, the Central Bank has informed me that the lender will need to evaluate both actual and prospective affordability for the distressed borrower, as well as the capital implications for the credit institutions in terms of their prudential responsibility to minimise losses.</p><p>  While the Central Bank is not mandating any particular model of restructuring and while sustainable solutions will be arrived at on a case-by-case basis, there are some fundamental principles that must be respected.  These include: An affordability assessment of the borrower based on both their current and prospective future servicing capacity for all borrowings; A realistic valuation of the borrower&rsquo;s assets, in particular their property, and the use of an appropriate interest rate when discounting future income flows, which should take account of the lender&rsquo;s cost of funds.  The Central Bank has advised that its supervisory audit of compliance with these principles, to be completed in November, will assess compliance with these principles, including through analysis of a sample of modifications.</p></reply>

The Central Bank&rsquo;s statutory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) protects borrowers experiencing arrears in relation to their primary residence.  The focus by Government is primarily on formulating and implementing appropriate measures to assist those homeowners who are experiencing genuine difficulty with the mortgage repayments on their principal home.  In that regard, the &lsquo;Keane Report&rsquo; made a number of key recommendations and the Government is now actively progressing the implementation of those recommendations.  However, some of these initiatives will also be of assistance in addressing significant &lsquo;buy to let&rsquo; mortgage arrears and over indebtedness.  For example, the Central Bank&rsquo;s performance targets for the main mortgage banks apply to the buy-to-let sector as well as principal dwelling homes.</p><p>  The Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategy process, overseen by the Central Bank, requires lenders to develop and implement appropriate resolution strategies and implementation plans for &lsquo;buy to let&rsquo; mortgages as well as mortgages on the debtor&rsquo;s primary home.  The Central Bank has advised me that the Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code) contains protections for personal consumers who are experiencing arrears on loans, other than loans secured on a primary residence, including buy-to-let mortgages (a consumer being defined as a natural person acting outside his or her business, trade or profession).  Such protections require lenders, inter alia, to provide information to borrowers and to seek to agree an approach that will assist borrowers in resolving their arrears situation.  The Code also requires that the level of contact and communications from lenders, or any third party acting on its behalf, is proportionate and not excessive and imposes limits on the number of unsolicited communications which a lender can make in any month.</p></reply>

As regards Finance Act 2013, this is the means by which measures announced in the Budget and relating to taxation are implemented. The Act also implements associated Revenue-related measures The scope of Finance Act 2013 was set out in the Finance Bill 2013 Explanatory Memo and subsequently also by me in my Second Stage D&aacute;il speech. The limited number of amendments at Committee and Report Stages were extensively debated in the D&aacute;il at the time and are therefore on the Oireachtas record also.</p><p>  To address specific Finance Act 2013 measures yet to be implemented:</p><p>- A scheme of accelerated capital allowances entitled &#8220;Incentives for certain aviation services facilities&#8221; was provided for in section 31<i>.</i>  This scheme provides accelerated capital allowances for the construction and refurbishment of certain specialist buildings and structures for use in the maintenance, repair, overhaul or dismantling of commercial aircraft. This is subject to approval from the European Commission. When this approval is received, the section will be commenced.</p><p>- The extension of the Employment and Investment Incentive from 2013 to 2020 was also announced, pending the receipt of the necessary approval from the European Commission.</p><p>- Finance Act 2013 introduced legislation to enable the Revenue Commissioners to make regulations to implement the Inter-Governmental Agreement with the USA to provide for reporting and exchange of information under FATCA.  Regulations are currently being drafted in consultation with the US authorities and industry bodies, and will be implemented in advance of the first withholding date for FATCA which is currently scheduled to be 1 July 2014.</p><p>- The Living City Initiative is a pilot project which provides certain tax incentives to make it more attractive for people live in historic and culturally significant city centre Georgian houses. The initiative also offers incentives for retailers and small businesses in those areas. In respect of the Living City Initiative, Section 30(1)(a) inserted the following new Sections: </p><p>- S372AAA - Interpretation (Chapter 13) );  </p><p>- S372AAB - Residential accommodation: allowance to owner-occupiers in respect of qualifying expenditure incurred on the conversion and refurbishment of Georgian houses;</p><p>- S372AAC - Capital allowances in relation to conversion or refurbishment of certain commercial premises.  It is intended to commence these provisions once a cost benefit analysis has been finalised and EU State Aid approval has been received. </p><p>- As regards Film Relief, Section 21 of Finance Act 2013, amended various sections of S481 (1), (2) and (3).The new provisions will ensure that the tax reliefs will accrue to the producers rather than investors and result in tax savings for the Exchequer. It is intended to commence this provision once EU State Aid approval has been given.</p><p>  Finally, I would note two Budget-related measures:</p><p>- In my Budget 2013 speech, I announced that changes to give effect to the commitment in the Programme for Government to cap taxpayers' subsidies for pension schemes which deliver pension income of more than &euro;60,000 will be put in place in 2014. It remains my intention to address these issues in Budget 2014.</p><p>- Sections 19, 20 and 21 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 are not yet operational.  Per the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (Section 1) (Specified Date) Order 2012, 1 July 2014 is appointed as the day on which sections 19, 20 and 21 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) come into operation.  These sections relate to the &#8220;local adjustment factor&#8221; which, once commenced, will allow local authorities to vary the rate of tax in their area by 15% above or below the national central rates.  These sections have a later implementation date because it is not operationally possible to introduce this local adjustment factor until 2015 and it is also preferable that local councillors have a specific electoral mandate to vary the rate of the tax, which will be possible following the local elections in 2014.</p></reply>

One of the eight principles which underpin the Framework is that of &quot;Wellbeing&quot; which means that each student's learning experience should contribute directly to their physical, mental, emotional and social wellbeing and resilience.</p><p>  This principle is complemented by a number of the Junior Cycle's 24 'Statements of Learning', including a requirement that each student &quot;is a confident and competent participant in physical activity and is motivated to be physically active&quot;. This is supported by other statements that require students to promote their own wellbeing, and to understand the importance of food and diet in making healthy lifestyle choices.</p><p>  Schools will be required to ensure that all students are given the opportunity to meet these commitments. But in line with best practice internationally, schools are being given the flexibility and autonomy to achieve this, within their own unique context. Schools are best placed to know the specific needs of their pupils. </p><p>  Schools may choose to incorporate the new short courses in P.E. and SPHE that are currently being developed by the NCCA, into their junior cycle programme, either for certification purposes (which was not available previously) or not for certification.  Alternatively, they may choose not to opt for the new course and may instead continue to use existing courses or choose other approaches to meet the requirements in this area. Schools may also decide to provide the P.E. and SPHE short courses in addition to their existing programmes.</p><p>  My Department remains committed to supporting the overall 'Healthy Ireland' agenda. Physical education and physical activity, health and well-being are important elements in primary and post primary curricula. My Department also continues to support a range of initiatives to complement curricular provision in this area. These include initiatives such as the Active School Flag, extra-curricular activities, the 'sport for all day', and physical education teacher professional networks. Almost 1,200 schools have registered to participate in the Active School Flag initiative.</p><p>  If the work of schools in encouraging a 'Healthy Ireland' is to be effective it has to be complemented by the efforts of parents, communities and wider society. This is one of the key messages in the 'Get Active' Framework which was recently launched by the Taoiseach. The &quot;Get Active&quot; Framework, which is a collaboration between my Department and other Departments, provides a blueprint for schools, local communities and other stakeholders on how to work together to ensure that all individuals are supported in being active and in enjoying physical activity.</p><p>  My Department will shortly release the results of the second Lifeskills survey which was conducted in 2012. This is a follow on from a previous survey carried out in 2009. The findings of the 2009 Lifeskills survey, like the 2009 Children's Sport Participation and Physical Activity Survey, found that the majority of schools did not timetable 2 hours of PE per week.  This second Lifeskills survey will provide important data on a number of areas including the extent to which schools are promoting healthy eating among pupils and are encouraging them to be physically active.  These data assist in policy deliberations and are part of the reason that Wellbeing has been prioritised as a Principle in the new Framework for Junior Cycle</p></reply>

Supports across a range of services, including mental health services, health and personal social services, education and housing services will be available.</p><p>  The RISF has to determine and publish its approved services and the criteria by reference to which it will make decisions in respect of applications. I understand that the RISF is working on these issues while also progressing the practical arrangements of recruiting staff and establishing an office.</p><p>  I am anxious that the Fund is operational as quickly as possible. However, the Deputy will appreciate that the Fund must determine its services and criteria at the outset. I am not therefore in a position today to specify a date on which the RISF will be operational.</p></reply>

However, the state of the public finances is such that tough decisions had to be made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.</p><p>  For this reason it is the responsibility of Government to take into consideration all areas of public services when formulating Budget 2014.

Under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students.</p><p>  Since September 2012 guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. In this way principals have discretion to balance guidance needs with the pressures to provide subject choice. A framework document was published jointly by the Post Primary Management bodies and the NAPD (National Association of Principals &amp;amp; Deputies) in September, 2012 to provide guidance for school management in the allocation of teaching hours to guidance counselling in post-primary schools in the context of the decision in Budget 2012 to withdraw the provision of ex-quota guidance hours to schools. This should be of assistance to schools in terms of how they maximise guidance provision.</p><p>  My Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations. All 195 second-level school in DEIS have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools (23:1 in fee-charging schools). </p><p>  My Department also has existing arrangements in place for providing short-term support to schools that are dealing with particularly acute incidents that arise due to tragic accidents, bereavements etc.. Five schools were supported in this manner in the 2012/13 school year.</p></reply>

At that meeting it was clarified that pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05.</p><p>  It was also explained that pupils with Down syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability. </p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities. </p><p>  My Department requested that the NCSE consider the issue of whether Down syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, in the context of its preparation of comprehensive advice on how the educational system supports children with special educational needs in schools. </p><p>  The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category. </p><p>  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down syndrome pupils who are in the Mild General Learning Difficulty (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD. </p><p>  The NCSE policy advice did not recommend that an exception should be made for children with Down syndrome who are in the mild general learning difficulty range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.</p><p>  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down Syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs. </p><p>  The NCSE has established a Working Group to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report.  </p><p>  Following our meeting of 25th June, 2013, I wrote to the group concerned on 29th July, 2013 to set out my Departments position in this regard and to reiterate that the NCSE considers that the concerns raised in relation to this issue can be addressed via the development of a new allocation model which will take into account children's individual learning needs, as opposed to diagnosis. </p></reply>

My Department provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to an appropriate education. </p><p>  These supports include an allocation of additional teaching support as well as additional resource teaching and Special Needs Assistant (SNA) care supports which may be allocated to schools by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in respect of qualifying pupils. </p><p>  Some children may be fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports. Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and/or care assistance. In respect of children who cannot be accommodated in mainstream education, they may be enrolled in special classes or special schools where more intensive and supportive interventions are provided. </p><p>  The extent of supports required for any child in a particular class setting or school will depend on their disability categorisation and the extent of care needs that they may have. As such, schools have access to a full range of supports to facilitate the enrolment of pupils with special educational needs. </p><p>  I wish to explain also that the Board of Management of each school, including Special Schools, is required to prepare a code of behaviour in accordance with Section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. </p><p>  To assist schools in formulating such a code, the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) has developed guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour  The Act also requires that a school Code of Behaviour shall specify the standards of behaviour that shall be observed by each student attending the school, the measures that may be taken when a student fails or refuses to observe those standards and the procedures to be followed before a student may be suspended or expelled from the school concerned. </p><p>  Schools may also seek advice from their local National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) psychologist, from their NCSE Special Educational Needs Organiser, or from the National Behavioural Support Services, as to how children with behavioural needs can best be supported in schools. </p><p>  My Department also recently published new Guidelines for Schools on Supporting Students with Behavioural, Emotional, and Social difficulties, which are available on my Departments website at www.education.ie. </p><p>  In circumstances where a child has been suspended or expelled, Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of a Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school,  expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.  In such circumstances the parent of the child concerned may lodge a Section 29 appeal against the decision of the school to expel or suspend and to have this case heard by an independent appeal panel. </p><p>  Finally, I can advise that the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB may offer assistance and advice on securing a school placement if necessary. The contact details for the NEWB is National Educational Welfare Board, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7, phone number  01-8738700.</p></reply>

Schools have autonomy on how to deploy the resource between language support and learning support depending on their specific needs.  The new single allocation for the General Allocation Model (GAM) and language support (EAL) is based on the number of classroom teaching posts in each school in the previous school year.  The new arrangements since September 2012 also provide for over 370 additional permanent teaching posts to be given to schools with high concentration of pupils that require language support (EAL).</p><p>  The arrangements for the current school year are set out in Department Circular 0013/2013 which is available on the Department website.  The full list of all the relevant schools are included as part of Circular 0013/2013.  In addition, the staffing appeal process at primary level includes the provision whereby schools with high concentration of pupils requiring English as an additional language (EAL) can apply for additional temporary language support posts.  These EAL allocations are made on the basis of appeals by schools to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board.  Details of the appeals process for the 2013/14 school year are also available in Circular 0013/2013 referred to above.</p></reply>

These new procedures have been developed following consultation with the relevant education partners and replace guidelines that were issued to schools in 1993.  The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils.  They place a strong focus on education and prevention strategies to deal with bullying behaviour including, in particular, cyberbullying and identity based bullying such as homophobic and transphobic bullying.  The procedures make clear that the focus of any prevention and education awareness measures in schools about cyber-bullying should be on educating pupils on how to stay safe while on-line and also on developing a culture of reporting any concerns about cyber-bullying.</p><p>  The procedures also recognise that parents and pupils have a role and responsibility in helping the school to prevent and address school-based bullying behaviour and to deal with any negative impact within school of bullying behaviour that occurs elsewhere.  The new procedures represent the conclusion of just one of the 12 essential actions set out in the Action Plan on Bullying published earlier this year.  Other actions, including awareness raising campaigns in relation to cyberbullying and homophobic bullying, are already underway.  My officials have also met with Facebook to see how we can collaborate to help schools to deal with incidents which arise.  Facebook is now working with the second level school management bodies and a new escalation channel has been put in place for second level schools.  It is also important to recognise that use of the internet and cyber-bullying is a wider societal issue and schools cannot solve all the ills of the world.  Everyone, including parents, pupils and wider society, has a role to play in preventing and tackling cyber-bullying.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that the 5 year School Investment Plan announced in March 2012, provides for a &euro;2 billion school capital investment programme, of which over &euro;1.5 billion is being allocated to the funding of major school building projects, with the balance needed for the additional accommodation scheme, the prefab replacement initiative, the Emergency Works Scheme and the acquisition of sites.  The Plan outlines the major school projects that are planned to proceed to construction over the duration of the Plan.  The primary aim at the core of the Five Year Plan is focussed on meeting demographic demands to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers.  The plan will provide over 100,000 permanent school places, of which over 80,000 will be new school places.</p><p>Further to the Five Year Plan, my Department is committed to publishing a detailed annual programme in relation to individual major school projects commencing construction.  In December 2011, details of 56 major school building projects to commence construction in 2012, the first year of the Plan, were published.  In December 2012, details of 50 major school building projects were announced to commence construction in 2013, the second year of the Plan.  Details of the building projects to commence construction in 2014 will be announced later on this year.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware of the biggest initiative ever undertaken to reduce the reliance on rented prefabs in schools.. Under the Prefab Replacement initiative 2012 (Phase 1), my Department provided funding of in excess of &euro;42 million for the replacement of over 458 prefab units in 170 schools with permanent accommodation.  A further &euro;15 million has been allocated under Phase II of the Prefab Replacement Initiative, that was announced in June this year, for the replacement of over 115 prefab units in 46 schools.  This funding will be used to replace prefabs with permanent classroom and resource rooms accommodation.  A total of eight schools in County Kildare will benefit from this initiative.</p><p>Also in June this year, the allocation of further funding as part of the Government's &quot;investing in Infrastructure &amp;amp; Jobs&quot; package, will enable a further 28 school projects to be progressed to construction.  This investment will enable 18 primary schools, including a school in County Kildare, and 10 post-primary schools to be replaced or refurbished with state of the art classrooms and facilities for over 12,000 students.  Details of all school capital works that have been funded by my Department may be viewed on my Department website and this is updated on a regular basis.</p><p>For the Deputy's convenience, a list of the major new schools/extension projects that were completed in County Kildare, between 2010 and to date in 2013 is outlined as follows.</p><p><b>Major school building projects in County Kildare completed from 2010 to date in 2013</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>School Name</th><th>Roll No.</th><th>Project</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Scoil Phadraig, Ballylinan, Athy</td><td>17064U</td><td>New 12 classroom school</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>SN Aine Naofa, Ard Cloc, Straffan</td><td>17674B</td><td>New 16 classroom school + 4 special education tuition rooms</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Scoil Bhride NS, Rathangan</td><td>18018S</td><td>12 classroom extension, ancillary accommodation and refurbishment works.</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>Sc U&iacute; Fhiach, Maynooth</td><td>20058T  </td><td>New 16 classroom school </td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>Scoil Brid, Naas</td><td>20114D</td><td>8 classroom extension and 4 special education tuition rooms </td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>Me&aacute;nscoil Iogn&aacute;id Ris, Naas</td><td>61710C</td><td>Extension/refurbishment</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>Scoil Phadraig Naofa, Athy</td><td>16705E</td><td>New 26 classroom school</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>Scoil Bhride NS, Kill</td><td>17662R</td><td>New 32 classroom school </td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>Athy Model NS </td><td>06209J</td><td>General Purpose Room </td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>Scoil Choca Naofa, Kilcock, </td><td>11976K</td><td>11 classroom extension, G.P. room, ancillary accommodation and refurbishment of existing accommodation</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>Caragh NS, Naas</td><td>18654A</td><td>15 classroom extension, GP room and ancillary accommodation</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>Scoil &Aacute;th &Iacute;, Athy </td><td>20192A</td><td>General Purpose Room </td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>Scoil na Naomh Uilig, Rickardstown, Newbridge (Phase II)</td><td>20271T</td><td>12 classroom extension</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>Scoil Bhride, Nurney</td><td>16345A</td><td>New 8 classroom school</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>Scoil na Naomh Uilig, Rickardstown, Newbridge (Phase 1)</td><td>20271T</td><td>New 16 classroom school </td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>Presentation Convent, Maynooth</td><td>00779U</td><td>8 classroom extension</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>Scoil Bhride, Athgarvan</td><td>13350B</td><td>4 classroom extension, GP room &amp;amp; associated works</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>Athy Community  College </td><td>70650L</td><td>New school, PE Hall &amp;amp; Autistic Unit</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The level of resources devoted to supporting children with Special Educational Needs has been maintained at &euro;1.3 billion this year.  This includes provision for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs), over 10,300 Learning Support and Resource Teachers, provision for over 740 Special Classes attached to mainstream schools at reduced pupil teacher ratios, enhanced capitation for special schools and special classes and provision for assistive technology support.</p><p>  The level of investment being provided will ensure that provision can continue to be made to provide for the educational requirements of children with special educational needs, enrolled in all schools, to ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to have access to educational facilities in line with their requirements.  The policy of my Department is that children with special educational needs should be included in mainstream placements with additional supports provided.  All schools and all school places are therefore available for children with special educational needs to be enrolled to. Supports will continue to be allocated to schools to support pupils with special educational needs.</p><p>  SNA support will continue to be allocated to schools to ensure that all children who qualify for access to SNA support for the current school year will receive access to such support.  To date the NCSE has allocated 10,480 SNA posts to schools.  The remaining posts are available for allocation throughout the school year for new assessments of disability, new entrants, or emergency or late applications, in accordance with the terms of the SNA scheme.  Additional resource teaching support will continue to be allocated to schools. In line with my decision in June to authorise the NCSE to maintain the level of resource teaching allocations to be provided for students with special educational needs for the current school year to the 2012/13 levels, 5,284 whole time equivalent resource teaching posts have been allocated to schools at this point. Further resource teaching posts will be allocated when the NCSE has processed applications received to 20th September, 2013.</p><p>  In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.  Some 740 Special Classes are being provided for mainstream schools for the current school year.  This includes 118 new special classes which have been opened this year.  The provision that is being made for special educational needs support will ensure that special needs class requirements at primary and second level, including in County Kildare, can continue to be fully met this school year.</p></reply>

In 2011, 14 projects encountered delays or ended prematurely due to insolvency events related to a main contractor.</p><p>In 2012, the contract for one school building project ended prematurely due to the insolvency of the main contractor and one school building project was terminated due to the contractor's default.  To date in 2013, there have been no school building projects which have ended prematurely.</p><p>Details in respect of each of these projects are listed in the table.</p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (D/PER) has responsibility for implementing national policy on public procurement, particularly in relation to construction procurement. The Capital Works Management Framework developed by D/PER, allows for various bond and guarantee options designed to protect the Contracting Authority/Employer from issues such as contractor insolvencies. These options include retention deductions, performance bonds and parent company guarantees. The majority of major projects in the Education Sector operate using a combination of a performance bond and retention deductions. On occasion a parent company guarantee may also be sought.</p><p>Retention deductions allow the Contracting Authority to retain a proportion of the value of work done as security for the cost of remedying defects which become evident before the end of the Defects Period, should the Contractor fail to rectify them.</p><p>A performance bond is issued by a guarantor or surety (authorised to do guarantee business) to guarantee that in the event of a Contractor's default, proven losses under the Contract can be recouped. In essence, the guarantor undertakes to be answerable for losses (up to the limit of the Bond) suffered by the Contracting Authority if the Contractor's obligations are not performed in accordance with the Contract; this includes a situation where the Contractor becomes insolvent during the Contract. The value of the bond required for a project is determined at tender stage according to guidelines issued by D/PER, having due regard to the estimated cost of the project.</p><p>The Public Works Contracts contain clauses which deal with a contractor's default such as an insolvency event. When a contractor becomes insolvent, all costs incurred by the Contracting Authority/Employer on foot of the contractor's default, can be offset against monies held on the contractor plus costs up to the value of the performance bond. The circumstances surrounding each insolvency event varies from project to project.

The meeting afforded them an opportunity to articulate their views on a range of issues concerning their schools.</p><p>  A number of fee charging schools have made contact with the Department and the level of engagement to date varies from school to school.</p><p>  Where the authorities of a school approach the Department about entering the Free Education scheme it is because they are concerned about the future viability of the school and wish to explore all options in considering the future of the school.</p><p>  I have made it clear that the Department will engage constructively with any fee charging school that is considering how best to secure its future. I expect that a minority of fee charging schools will wish to engage with the Department in planning for their future.</p><p>  Any approach to the Department will be considered on an individual school by school basis, taking account of the significance of the provision concerned in terms of diversity and overall demand for school places in the locality served by a school.</p><p>  In December 2011 I announced that an analysis of fee income in the 55 fee charging schools would be carried out. This was in order to inform future policy decisions about the nature and extent of exchequer funding provided to fee charging schools.</p><p>  The report &quot;Fee Charging Schools - Analysis of Fee Income&quot; was published in January 2013, is an analysis of the funding position of the 55 schools which charge fees; it is not an audit. It shows the funds available to these schools through charging fees, which are not available to secondary schools in the Free Scheme.  The Report shows that fee charging schools have a discretionary income of &euro;81.3m that would not be available to similar sized schools (i.e. size as determined by enrolment) in the Free Scheme.</p><p>  The Report is available on the Department's website at </p></reply>

Of this initial cohort, 95.89% sat the Junior Certificate Exams in 2008 or 2009 and 89.49% sat the Leaving Certificate Exams in 2010 or 2011.   This is based on the sixth published report, by the Department of Education and Skills, on school retention in Ireland, which consists of a detailed analysis of the records held in the Department's Post-Primary Pupils Database for the cohort of entrants to the first year of the junior cycle in the years 2005 and 2006, who sat the Leaving Certificate Examinations in the years from 2010 to 2012.  It is also important to note that while the analysis allows for movement of pupils between schools it does not enable the tracking of those who leave State-aided schools including publicly funded fee-paying schools and move to non-aided second-level education providers.</p><p>  There is currently no national data available on retention of pupils at primary level.</p><p>  Enhancing attendance, progression, retention and attainment are central elements of DEIS, the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. DEIS is part of a continuum of interventions delivered by my Department to address educational disadvantage including early school leaving from preschool through second-level education. This includes Second-Chance education and training and access measures to increase participation in further and higher education for the minority of our young people who, for various reasons, leave education early without the knowledge and skills they need to support them in later life. A further element of this continuum is the ongoing development of provision for pupils with special educational needs.</p><p>  It is particularly encouraging to see the retention rate in DEIS schools increase substantially, from 68.2% for the 2001 cohort to 80.1% for the 2005 cohort. The retention rates of pupils who entered the first year of the junior cycle in 2005 and 2006, which coincides with the introduction of DEIS, represents the first cohort of students to have DEIS resources available to them throughout their second level education.</p><p>  The National Educational Welfare Board, under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, has developed a new Integrated Model of Service Delivery called 'One Child, One Team, One Plan'.  This plan will integrate the overall Educational Welfare Service with the key DEIS supports of the Home School Community Liaison Service and the School Completion Programme. The overall objective it to provide for earlier response rates and assist in achieving better outcomes for children at risk of early school leaving. I am informed that a comprehensive practice model testing phase is planned before it is mainstreamed as the practice for all schools in 2014.</p><p>  At third level the Higher Education Authority, which is responsible for the collection of data on student progression, is currently working on an analysis of retention rates in the universities and institutes of technology. This has only recently become possible due to a full population of SRS (Student Record System) data becoming available for a period spanning five years. The HEA does not have information for the 2012/2013 or 2011/2012 academic years and is currently collating data for the 2010/11 academic year which it is hoped will be available by the middle of November.</p><p>  There are a range of factors that impact on participation and progression in higher education including economic, social and cultural issues, prior academic attainment and teacher and parental expectations. The most recent report by the HEA on retention entitled, 'A study of Progression in Higher Education', was published in 2010 and is available on the HEA website.</p><p>  Higher education institutions have a wide range of supports in place to improve retention of students in their institutions. The HEA study and other research has also highlighted that undergraduate first years are most at risk of non-progression. The new National Forum for the enhancement of Teaching and Learning that I established late last year is looking at the undergraduate student experience in first year and how that may be improved on a system wide basis. Their work should improve quality outcomes for students at that difficult transition period.</p><p>  The work of the Transition reform group chaired by the Secretary General of my Department should also contribute to improvements in students' quality outcomes. A key commitment has been made by the higher education institutions to reduce the number of level 8 programmes offered through the CAO and broadening them. This should help school leavers better navigate the entry routes into higher education system when making the important choice about what programme to undertake. They will also be exposed to a broader first year experience. This change when implemented should help to reduce the number of school leavers making the wrong choice about what course of study to undertake and help to reduce non-progression and completion.</p></reply>

These new procedures have been developed following consultation with the relevant education partners and replace guidelines that were issued to schools in 1993.</p><p>  The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils. They include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour.</p><p>  The procedures also include important new oversight arrangements that involve the school Principal reporting regularly to the Board of Management and a requirement for the Board to undertake an annual review of the school's anti- bullying policy and its implementation. Confirmation that the annual review has been completed must be provided to the parents association and published on the school website.</p><p>  All schools are now required to immediately commence the necessary arrangements for developing and formally adopting an anti-bullying policy that fully complies with the requirements of the new procedures. This is expected to be completed by each school as early as possible in the 2013/14 school year but in any event by no later than the end of the second term of the 2013/14 school year.</p></reply>

In 2013, the Castle was originally scheduled to open from 30<sup>th</sup> May - 25<sup>th</sup> September but the closing date was extended to 29<sup>th</sup> September to coincide with the holding of the Maynooth festival.</p><p>  The opening and presentation of the Castle to visitors is undertaken by a number of seasonal guides operating under a roster system.  Due to budgetary and staffing constraints, the presentation of the Castle, like many other OPW heritage sites, is generally confined to the summer tourist season. Regretfully, no changes can be made to the existing arrangements while the current economic conditions prevail.</p><p>  While heritage sites are administered by the State on behalf of all citizens, there are limitations on what can be achieved. The OPW would like to have all of its heritage sites open throughout the year but this simply is not possible. The current difficulties can only be addressed if local communities get actively involved with the OPW in the presentation of sites.  In 2012, I introduced a strategy whereby local communities could work with OPW in making heritage sites more accessible to the public, and I sought expressions from interested parties.  Earlier this year, I again sought applications from local communities to participate in such a scheme. Community groups in the Maynooth area, who are interested in promoting their local heritage, should be encouraged to make an application.</p></reply>

Under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, pay reductions for public servants including public health doctors on annual salary rates in excess of &euro;65,000 are calculated by reference to the full time equivalent salary and applied on a pro rata basis to those who work less than full time hours. The reduced pay rates are calculated and applied in this way which is consistent with the legislation governing the conditions of employment of part-time workers. Accordingly, the reduction in the rate of pay for full time and job sharing public servants is the same and any change in this relationship would create an inequity in the rate of pay for those doing similar work.</p></reply>

The stimulus package comprises two elements:</p><p>- 1.4 billion euro to fund the proposed new Public Private Partnerships (PPP) programme. The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) and the Department of Finance are leading on sourcing the private funding required and are liaising with my Department in this regard;</p><p>- 850 million euro coming from asset receipts, to be used as a project preparation facility for the new PPP programme and to fund additional Exchequer capital projects and other publicly needed projects.</p><p>   The PPP programme will provide schools, roads, health centres, justice facilities and the development of a major third level facility in Grangegorman. Details of all projects and progress to date included in the Stimulus Package are published on the PPP website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.ppp.gov.ie</font></i>  .</p><p>  It has been the Government's consistent position that funds released from asset disposals should be used to support job creating initiatives in the economy. Funding for enabling works for these PPP projects has already been agreed with departments. Some development works are already underway and up to 50 million euro is expected to be spent next year. The bulk of the funding for PPPs will come from the private sector and will be spent as projects commence construction. Work is on-going to identify suitable projects as other funding becomes available. </p><p>  As you know job creation is a critical priority for Government. Investment in the projects included in the Stimulus Package is expected to generate approximately 13,000 direct, and many more indirect jobs spread out across the country. At this early stage in the process, most of the employment impact has been in the technical and advisory areas. Further appointments are pending and employment benefits will be evident as the projects progress through the tendering phase and construction gets underway. The indicative timetable for the projects suggests construction is expected to commence on the first roads project by the end of 2013 and on the accommodation projects by Q4 2014.  </p><p>  Although not part of the new PPP programme, as part of the on-going monitoring of employment on current PPPs, the latest figures from the Schools Bundle 3 project indicate 4,079 man-months of full time equivalent employment have been engaged up to the end of August.  </p><p>  We will also be introducing social clauses into capital works projects in so far as possible to help support new jobs and youth employment. Already a pilot is underway on the schools programme which requires that 10% of the aggregate number of person weeks carried out on the site to be undertaken by those who are recruited from the ranks of the long-term unemployed and 2.5% of the aggregate number of person weeks carried out on the site to be undertaken by apprentices.</p></reply>

The General Scheme has been referred to the Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform Committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.  It is anticipated that the Bill will be published by end year.  In this Bill it is proposed that restrictions in relation to the &ldquo;cooling off&rdquo; period should be focused and targeted on the specific conflict of interest expected to arise in a lobbying situation. </p><p>  The legislation will require certain designated public officials or office holders to apply to the Lobbying Registrar for approval to take up a position involving lobbying of former colleagues (e.g. principals, peers or subordinates) in the public body in which they previously worked (or in a further public body to which such colleagues have subsequently transferred) during a period of one year subsequent to having left the public service. </p><p>  This approach allows the Lobbying Registrar to permit, for example, the take up of employment but to impose restrictions in relation to engagement in certain activities rather than a blanket ban.  This approach seeks to deliver on the policy objective of regulating this area while adopting a fair and proportionate approach on a case by case basis.</p><p>  It should also be noted that the cooling-off period proposed is limited to one year rather than the two year period included in the Programme for Government.  This revised approach reflects a review by my Department of the duration of similar provisions in other jurisdictions which highlights that the introduction of a two-year restriction for a relatively wide body of public officials would fall into the upper-end of the international norms in this area (notwithstanding that there are significantly longer cooling&ndash;off periods in force in some jurisdictions).   The one-year period also aligns with the current post-public employment restriction in place under the Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour.  </p><p>  The relevant OECD principles also highlight the requirement for countries to consider establishing restrictions for public officials leaving office to address other potential conflict of interest situations that could arise.  As the Deputy is aware, it is planned that these other elements of the Programme for Government commitment which also arise from the recommendations contained in the final report of the Mahon Tribunal will be addressed through the reform of the legislative framework for ethics which is currently being progressed by my Department.</p></reply>

My own Department is responsible for the policy that applies in relation to civil servants and political activity. This is set out in Circular 9/2009, available on www.circulars.gov.ie.</p><p>  There are clear restrictions on the majority of civil servants participating in political activity.  While there are some exceptions to this - including clerical staff with the approval of the Department, craft workers, state industrial and manual grades and grades below clerical grades - they are limited. </p><p>  In the civil service there has been a long tradition of political impartiality. This approach is reflected in the Code of Standards and Behaviour for Civil Servants. The Code, at paragraph 4 states, that civil servants in the performance of their duties:</p><p>a. must conscientiously serve the duly elected Government of the day,  the other institutions of State and the public;</p><p>b. must advise and implement policy impartially and, in particular, be conscious of the need to maintain the independence necessary to give any future Minister or Government confidence in their integrity, and</p><p>c. should not display partiality whether as a result of personal or family ties or otherwise.</p><p>  The rationale for restricting civil servants in relation to politics and political activity is to ensure that a civil servant does not do anything that could give rise to a perception that his or her official actions are in any way influenced or capable of being influenced by political motives. </p><p>  It is my view that this policy remains relevant and worthwhile for civil servants to safeguard the fundamental principles of civil service impartiality and independence.</p><p>  I understand that there is no comparable restriction on political activity in other sectors of the public service.</p></reply>

This represents a key element of the Government&rsquo;s response to the economic situation and the need to continue to deliver important services, in the face of increased demands and reduced staff numbers and budgets.</p><p>  This phase of reform has included a very strong focus on implementation and delivery of reform, and substantial progress has been made in areas such as reducing costs, improving efficiency and enhancing service delivery.  </p><p>  The final report on progress under the Croke Park Agreement concluded that it facilitated significant cost savings, amounting to &euro;1.8 billion over its lifetime, comprising of almost &euro;1 billion in pay savings and over &euro;800m in non-pay efficiency savings, while also ensuring the delivery of a large number of reforms across all sectors of the Public Service.</p><p>  The  Haddington Road Agreement, which came into force on 1 July, sets out the basis for a further contribution of &euro;1 billion by the public service pay and pensions bill to our fiscal recovery, through a series of equitable and sustainable measures.  These measures will allow for the creation of a more streamlined and unified public service. </p><p>  The Agreement also represents the largest productivity deal in the history of the State and will deliver an unprecedented increase in productivity across the Public Service through the provision of almost 15 million additional working hours by public servants.  This will help deliver long term and sustainable increases in productivity by reducing the requirement for paid overtime hours and agency costs and allowing management to maintain services against the backdrop of decreasing staff numbers, without any impact on services.  </p><p>  It should be noted that the Agreement is not a short-term measure, rather it is a three-year agreement which will deliver long term sustainable reform in the Public Service, building on the significant change already delivered.</p><p>  Almost two years since the Public Service Reform Plan was published, work is now underway to develop a renewed wave of reforms to build on progress to-date and refresh the current reform plan.  The Renewed Plan will address next steps for the existing reform areas set out in the current Public Service Reform Plan, as well as the identification of some new areas for reform.</p></reply>

Firstly the matter of seeking to enforce the payment of an award made by one of the employment rights bodies and secondly on this not succeeding, the potential to have recourse to the Insolvency Payments Scheme for payment of that award. </p><p>  I am fully aware of the difficulties that can be experienced by individuals who have had awards made in their favour by employment rights bodies, including the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT), in enforcing those awards where employers fail or are not in a position to pay such awards.  </p><p>  Under the current system of enforcement, the holder of an EAT award or their trade union may seek to enforce the award themselves through the Circuit Court or they may seek<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  the assistance of the Minister to have this process carried out on their behalf. This involves the use of the Enforcement Services Unit of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) to have such awards enforced if appropriate through the civil courts. </p><p>  I acknowledge that the system of enforcement of awards that has developed over the years has become complex and in some cases involves very long delays. In this context and in relation to industrial relations and employment rights generally I have initiated a root-and-branch reform with the objective of establishing a world-class Workplace Relations Service. </p><p>  I believe that for a workplace relations system to have credibility it must be supported by proportionate, effective and efficient compliance and enforcement measures. The current system of enforcement of employment rights awards is cumbersome, expensive and not fit for purpose.  For this reason, I am proposing to make provision in the Workplace Relations Bill for a range of enhanced compliance measures, including the use of Compliance Notices, Fixed Charge Notices and a new mechanism for enforcing awards of the WRC Adjudicators and Labour Court Determinations.  These measures will provide for more proportionate, efficient and effective enforcement of employment law. </p><p>  Under the new reformed system, if the decision of a WRC adjudication officer (at first instance) or a determination of the Labour Court (on appeal) remains unimplemented, the complainant may apply, in the former case to the Workplace Relations Commission or, in the latter case, to the Labour Court, for a binding and enforceable Determination Order directing the respondent to comply within a specified period.  A Determination Order made by the WRC or Labour Court may be enforced by either civil proceedings or criminal prosecution, or both. </p><p>  I am satisfied that the measures which I propose to introduce will provide successful complainants with an accessible and inexpensive means whereby respondents can be compelled to honour the award of the WRC Adjudication Service or of the Labour Court, as the case may be.</p><p>  Where an employer is legally insolvent (liquidation, receivership, bankruptcy etc.) the employee may be entitled to seek redress<font color="#FF0000"> </font>from the State under the Insolvency Payments Scheme which is operated by my colleague, the Minister for<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  Social Protection. I am aware that there are some cases including the present case, where employers have ceased trading without engaging in a formal insolvency or winding-up process and where the company may have closed owing certain payments or statutory awards to its former employees.  Whilst it will not be possible to address the issue of so-called 'informal insolvency' through the workplace relations reforms which I have commenced, as it raises issues concerning insolvency law and the operation of the Insolvency Payments Scheme, I am informed by the Minister for Social Protection that the legislative position with regard to these types of situations is currently being reviewed by her Department with a view to establishing what, if anything, can be done to progress payments to individuals where no liquidator or receiver has been appointed. </p><p>  Any queries concerning such issues under the Insolvency Payments Scheme including policy, are fully within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton T.D and should be made directly to her.</p></reply>

The Committees themselves have continued to exist and remain in existence as currently constituted pending the making of the Establishment Orders required to give effect to the recommendations contained in the Labour Court Report.</p><p>  The Report owes its genesis to Section 41A of Industrial Relations Act 1946 (inserted by Section 11 of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012) which provides that reviews of each JLC be carried out by the Labour Court, as soon as practicable after the commencement of the Act, and at least once every 5 years thereafter. </p><p>  The Labour Court appointed Ms Janet Hughes to assist with the review of the 10 existing JLCs.</p><p>  The review assisted the Labour Court's  deliberations as to whether any JLC should be abolished, maintained in its current form, amalgamated with another JLC or its establishment order amended and the Labour Court is required to make recommendations to me to this effect.</p><p>  The Labour Court submitted its report of the review and recommendations in relation to the 10 existing JLCs to me last April. The report is detailed, comprehensive and complex and required careful examination and consideration. </p><p>  In publishing the Report and outlining the legal steps necessary for implementation of the Labour Court's recommendations, I have been particularly mindful of issues arising as a result of the recent Supreme Court ruling in relation to Registered Employment Agreements (the <i>McGowan </i>  case).</p><p>  With the exception of the Agriculture JLC, implementation of the recommendations regarding the scope of the other nine JLCs will be given effect by way of Ministerial Order. As the Agricultural Workers JLC was established under primary legislation (the Industrial Relations Act 1976), an amendment to the Establishment Order requires amending primary legislation. I anticipate that the Establishment Orders necessary to give effect to the recommendations regarding the other nine JLCs will be made over the coming weeks.</p><p>  At the conclusion of this process there will be eight JLCs remaining - and this will drop to seven when the legislation required to implement the recommendation relating to the Catering JLCs is enacted - leaving slightly over half the number that operated at the beginning of the reform process which I pursued on coming to Office. This latest development sits squarely within the context of the change required to improve Ireland's competitiveness by enhancing wage flexibility while also ensuring protection for vulnerable workers.</p></reply>

EI&rsquo;s overseas offices are reviewed annually as part of the organisation&rsquo;s operational planning process to ensure that the trade and commercial opportunities for Irish companies are maximised.</p><p>EI works very closely with other Government Departments and Agencies with an overseas presence, including in the context of the delivery of the &lsquo;Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy&rsquo; strategy, and the work of the Export Trade Council.</p><p>Where possible EI is co-located with Embassies, Consulates and other agency footprints, including IDA Ireland and Bord Bia, to minimise the overall cost of Ireland&rsquo;s overseas network for example, 22 of EI&rsquo;s 30 locations overseas are co-located. Where EI (in a small number of circumstances) is not co-located with another agency or body, this is primarily due to the location being a key business/commercial centre (rather than being the political centre where embassies are typically located).  All EI&rsquo;s overseas offices collaborate closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade team in Dublin and in relevant overseas Irish Embassies and Consulates. Furthermore, Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland following the signing of a memorandum of understanding, can facilitate companies to take part in each others trade missions on a case by case basis.</p><p>EI&rsquo;s overseas network and international team are critical resources which EI is seeking to maintain at current agreed staffing levels to support Irish companies increase sales from Ireland and to sustain and grow jobs in Ireland.</p><p><bu>Table 1: Enterprise Ireland HPSUs 2008-2012</bu></p><p><table><tr><th>Cohort Year</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th></tr><tr><td>High Potential Start-ups Supported</td><td>72</td><td>73</td><td>80</td><td>93</td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>HPSU Funding Paid(1)</td><td>&euro;20,359,632</td><td>&euro;21,665,199</td><td>&euro;20,862,588</td><td>&euro;20,764,962</td><td>&euro;16,301,768</td></tr><tr><td>Average cost</td><td>&euro;282,773</td><td>&euro;296,784</td><td>&euro;260,782</td><td>&euro;223,279</td><td>&euro;168,059</td></tr><tr><td>High Potential Start-ups Ceased Trading(2)</td><td>17</td><td>13</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>1</td></tr></table></p><p>( )The HPSU funding period is taken to include all approvals within five years of the initial HPSU approval.

Employers who pay statutory redundancy payments to their employees are entitled to a rebate of a portion of that payment from the State if the date of dismissal by reason of redundancy is before 1 January 2013.  </p><p>  In Budget 2012 the level of the rebate was reduced from 60% to 15% and in Budget 2013 the Government decided to remove the redundancy rebate to employers in respect of redundancies where the date of dismissal is on or after 1 January 2013.</p><p>  Where an employer can prove that he/she cannot afford to pay a statutory redundancy payment, the State makes a lump sum payment directly to the individual and a debt is raised against the employer which the State will endeavour to recover.  The Budget changes have no impact on the level of these payments.</p><p>  Rebates to employers and lump sums paid directly to employees are paid from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).  I am very concerned about the deficit in the SIF.  One of the factors which influenced the Government&rsquo;s decision to reduce the level of the rebate initially and to remove it in Budget 2013 was the increasing cost of rebates.</p><p>  While the SIF is constituted primarily from employer contributions, the taxpayers&rsquo; contribution is also significant.  I do not see why this country should continue to borrow money to plug the hole in the SIF in order to compensate often profitable companies for the cost of making their employees redundant in Ireland and, in some cases, transferring their employment abroad.</p><p>  The continuation of the rebate payment was not sustainable in the current economic climate.  While this may cause difficulties for employers it should be noted that redundancy rebate payments to employers are not common in many EU and other jurisdictions.  The current arrangements bring Ireland more closely into line with practice in other countries and it is not proposed to review the matter.</p><p>  As the number of redundancy claims received by the Department has reduced in recent years it is not possible to attribute all of the decrease in expenditure on redundancy rebates to the Budget changes.  However, it is worth noting that expenditure on redundancy rebate payments decreased from &euro;373.3 million in 2010 to &euro;188.3 million in 2011 and to &euro;167.4 million in 2012.</p><p>  I am not aware of any evidence that the removal of the redundancy rebate is acting as a barrier to employers taking on permanent employees.</p></reply>

Under these arrangements a Jobseeker customer may engage in voluntary work within the State without affecting their entitlements provided they continue to satisfy the statutory conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work.  </p><p>  The aims of the Voluntary Work Option are twofold, namely: i)- to encourage voluntary organisations to involve jobseekers to the greatest extent possible in their activities by creating new opportunities for voluntary work; and ii)- to inform jobseekers of their freedom to involve themselves in voluntary work and to encourage them to do so.</p><p>  Examples of voluntary work in which jobseekers may engage include helping the sick, elderly or persons with a disability or assisting youth clubs, church groups, sports groups, cultural organisations and local resident associations.  Voluntary groups may be locally or nationally organised and may include community groups.</p><p>  Details of the Voluntary Work Option arrangements are published on the Department&rsquo;s website and, in order to ensure that the profile is raised, all staff involved in the administration of the Jobseeker schemes were recently reminded of these arrangements and of the operational procedures under which they operate.</p></reply>

An integrated pension scheme is one where the State pension is viewed as part of the total pension package promised to employees on retirement. </p><p>  Integration is used as a means of taking into account the benefits payable under the social welfare system to calculate the amount of occupational pension required, so that the combined pension from both sources is at the level set in designing the scheme and to calculate the level of contribution payable by the employee towards the cost of their occupational pension.</p><p>  The rationale for integrated schemes is to make retirement schemes as efficient as possible, .i.e. to take account of total income after retirement, and to allow for the fact that almost all members are likely to qualify for a State pension to which the employee and the employer have contributed. </p><p>  If an employee wishes to make additional contributions to his/her normal contributions, he/she may do so if the rules of the particular scheme permits such contributions to be made.  If the scheme rules do not permit AVCs to be made, then a Standard Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) must be offered by his /her employer for the purpose of making AVCs.</p></reply>

Medical assessors carry out desk assessments of medical evidence/reports supplied by doctors/patients in order to provide a medical opinion for the guidance of deciding and appeals officers.  In the case of appeals, the opinion of a second medical assessor will be sought on the evidence provided by the claimant and his/her medical practitioner(s).  All assessments are carried out in accordance with the accepted guidelines of the Irish Medical Council. Medical assessors are fully qualified and experienced practitioners and must have at least 6 years satisfactory experience in the practice of medicine since registration with the medical council.  Many of the medical assessors have specialist post-graduate qualifications and all have received special training in human disability evaluation. The medical assessors have an on-going commitment to continuing medical education to ensure that standards are maintained and enhanced. </p><p>  In addition to satisfying the medical criteria for eligibility, applicants for invalidity pension must satisfy contribution criteria. To qualify for invalidity pension applicants must have at least:</p><p>- 260 (5 years) paid PRSI contributions since entering social insurance</p><p> - 48 contributions paid or credited in the last complete tax year before the date of claim </p><p>  PRSI paid in classes A, E and H count. The last complete tax year is the year before claim.</p><p>  In addition, where a claimant has no reckonable contributions paid or credited for two consecutive years, that person is not entitled to the payment of invalidity pension until 26 subsequent qualifying contributions have been paid.</p><p>  A completed application form for invalidity pension must be submitted to the department in order to have eligibility checked and a formal decision made on entitlement.</p></reply>

The term for participants on CE has been set at two years maximum for those under 35 years of age by the Department.  The person concerned has completed two years on Merchant&rsquo;s Quay CE scheme as a support worker.  As she is under 35 years of age, she has reached the maximum duration of entitlement; unfortunately it is not possible in the current climate to grant her a further extension.</p><p>  It should be noted that the training on CE is carried out on an independent and external basis to CE work experience; therefore her continuance on training is not dependent on her CE continuance.  As CE participants are encouraged to engage in further training and education to enhance their progression opportunities, it is common practice that participants may wish to engage in additional further training or may be mid-way through external training programmes on their CE finish date.

The term on CE cannot be determined by the training plan of an individual.</p><p>  During her term on CE the person concerned has completed the Certificate in Addiction studies with NUI and MQI in Sept 2013, and she has also completed some general training through the scheme.  However, there is no record of her undertaking or planning to undertake a diploma in drug counselling and intervention studies through the CE scheme or as part of her progression plan.

It is acknowledged that the fundamental problems facing defined benefits schemes are due to the requirements to fund increasing life expectancy as well as the impact of the recession which has resulted in lower than expected investment returns. </p><p>  The trustees of pension schemes are required to maintain sufficient assets in a pension scheme to meet the scheme liabilities in the event of the wind up of a pension scheme and to assess the funding position of the scheme on an annual basis.  If the scheme fails to satisfy the Funding Standard the trustees are required to submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board indicating how scheme funding level will be restored.  The Pensions Board provides support to the trustees of pension schemes in maintaining sustainable pension provision.</p><p>  I am considering a wide range of options in relation to pensions policy, including defined benefit provision and will be discussing those options with my Government colleagues in the near future.</p></reply>

Eligibility requirements include that the individual be in receipt of a qualifying Social Welfare payment or signing for credits of 78 days within the last 6 months.  JobBridge has been launched in this targeted way to allocate scarce exchequer resources effectively, while ensuring that it does not replace or displace the normal operation of the labour market, which is an essential element of Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  </p><p>  According to the Department&rsquo;s records, the individual named by the Deputy is a casual worker since beginning their Jobseekers Benefit claim on 3rd  June, 2013 and currently has 36 qualifying days.  The Department is not in a position to make exceptions to the eligibility criteria. </p><p>  A total of 707 individuals have participated on JobBridge internships in County Donegal since the scheme came into operation, of whom 198 are currently on internships. </p><p>  230 individuals have participated on JobBridge internships public sector organisations in County Donegal since the scheme came into operation, of whom 67 are currently on internships.  Of these 163 finishers to-date, 5 progressed to employment with their host organisation.</p><p>  Overall, the Indecon independent evaluation of the JobBridge scheme found that 61.4% of former interns had progressed into employment within 5 months of completion of a JobBridge internship.  Given the embargo on public sector recruitment progression rates into employment directly with the host organisation is lower for those interns who complete their internship in public sector organisations. However the Indecon evaluation found that there is, nevertheless, a high rate of employment (41.2%) among participants who completed their internships in public sector organisations but subsequently secured employment in other organisations.  This indicates that public sector internships provide jobseekers with valuable opportunities to gain relevant and transferable work experience.</p></reply>

The Minister becomes a preferential creditor against the assets of an employer in respect of most amounts paid under the scheme.  EAT and Rights Commissioner awards are made against the employer.

Each application for any social welfare scheme, including the illness schemes, is assessed on its own merit in terms of qualifying criteria and contribution history.   Where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, the means tested assistance payment may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions including a means test. In order to provide for sustainable pensions and to facilitate a longer working life, the Government decided to increase State pension age in three separate stages.  This decision to reform State pension was taken in the context of changing demographics and increasing longevity. Accordingly, in 2014, the State pension age will be standardised at 66. This will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028. This will see the abolition of the State pension transition payment from 2014. </p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that significant numbers of people are on social welfare schemes well in advance of State pension age. For example, in 2012, 11,130 people were awarded State pension transition and of these, 12.5% (1,390) came from employment with some 50% (5,635) coming from another social welfare payment including illness related schemes, indicating that quite a number of number of people are already in the social welfare system in advance of State pension age.  </p><p>  With the changes to State pension, social welfare support will continue to be available and targeted at those most in need.</p></reply>

Under Pathways to Work 2013, the Department is developing proposals for the extension of activation interventions, such as profiling and personal engagements, to customers of the Department who are not on the Live Register, including lone parents.  These proposals are due to be finalised by the first quarter of 2014.</p><p>  The Department is in the process of introducing a series of reforms to the one-parent family payment (OFP) scheme.  These reforms are predicated on activation and on getting people back into the workforce once their children have reached an appropriate age.  A wide range of supports and services are presently available to lone parents who are clients of my Department and who pro-actively engage with the Department&rsquo;s activation process.</p><p>  The recently introduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance transitional arrangement caters for OFP recipients who lose their entitlement to the OFP payment from July, 2013, onwards, who have a youngest child aged under 14 years, and who are entitled to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) payment.  These customers are exempt from the JA conditionality that requires them to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  They are also exempt from having to prove unemployment and can work part-time without restrictions and still receive the JA transitional arrangement payment &ndash; subject to a means test.  The exemptions from the full JA conditionality will remain in place until a recipient&rsquo;s youngest child reaches the age of 14 years.  At this point, should they continue to claim the JA payment, they will be subjected to the full JA conditionality.</p><p>  Recipients of either the JA or JA transitional arrangement payment may qualify for other social welfare income support benefits at the same time as their primary payment.  They can also avail of a wide range of education, training, and employment supports, and are entitled to apply, subject to qualifying conditions, for subsidised child care through both the community childcare subvention (CCS) programme) and the childcare education and training support (CETS) which are administered by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (D/CYA).  In addition they can apply for the after-school child care scheme should they take-up employment, increase their days of employment or commence certain employment programmes. This scheme is also funded by the D/CYA but jointly administered by my Department and the D/CYA.</p><p>  Lone parents can also qualify for the family income supplement (FIS).  FIS is an income support payment for families on low income that incentivises them to retain or increase their hours of employment.</p><p>  I must point out that, in 2011, One Family received funding of &euro;34,946 from my Department for its &lsquo;New Futures&rsquo; programme for the 2011-2012 period.  This funding came from the activation and family support programme (AFSP) that is managed by my Department.  The objective of the AFSP is to provide funding towards the development of training and education initiatives (mainly in conjunction with other organisations and agencies) aimed at assisting social welfare income support recipients to enhance their employability through education, training and personal development opportunities, and to improve their quality of life.  In 2012, One Family obtained funding of &euro;33,720 from my Department for its &lsquo;New Futures &ndash; Securing A Career&rsquo; programme for the 2012-2013 period, and it is my understanding that a request for further funding for its &lsquo;New Futures Plus&rsquo; programme for the 2013-2014 period is presently being examined by officials in the Department.  </p></reply>

The legislation for designation of European Capitals of Culture from 2020 to 2033 is being considered at present by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament.  In fact, during Ireland's Presidency of the Council of the European Union in the first six months of this year, I obtained the political agreement of the Council on the new Capitals of Culture legislation.  At present, the Lithuanian Presidency is leading negotiations with the Parliament on behalf of the Council.  </p><p>  Although the legislation is not yet finalised, it is expected that it will provide for Ireland to host the European Capital of Culture in 2020, along with Croatia.  This will mean that a public call for applications from interested cities will be made over the coming months.  A committee of experts will be appointed under the legislation, which will examine the applications and make recommendations.  The question of which institution will make the designation is still the subject of negotiation between the Council and the Parliament.  </p><p>  In addition, I introduced a new initiative of Irish City of Culture with Limerick as the inaugural Irish City of Culture in 2014.  Limerick will deliver a programme of cultural events and engagement in arts and culture by the citizens of Limerick and beyond.  It will bring artists, arts organisations, local authorities and civic groups in the city and county together in a calendar of events which will showcase all that the city has to offer.  I believe that the initiative will generate a legacy both locally and nationally.  I anticipate that the be further Irish City of Culture designations and that other Irish cities will be interested in applying for such designations in due course.</p></reply>

In other words, all of the potential environmental impacts of the proposed use of hydraulic fracturing would have to be assessed to ensure that there would be no significant environmental impact, prior to the grant of any permission for the use of this technology.</p><p>  I have also made clear that such an environmental impact assessment would be informed by the findings of further research to be commissioned by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and that no decision would be made on any proposal for the use of hydraulic fracturing in exploration drilling in Ireland until there has been time to consider the outcome of this further EPA research.</p></reply>

Fixed grants are allocated towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying Building Energy Rating (BER) assessment.</p><p>  To ensure the transparent use and administration of Exchequer funding, the SEAI is committed to delivering processes and systems which are clear and efficient, and which operate in a manner that is fair to all applicants. The following 2 scheme rules explicitly state that:</p><p>(a) Grant approval must be in place before any works commence; and</p><p>(b) Once accepted, the grant remains valid for 6 months from the date of issue of Grant Offer notification<i>.</i></p><p>  A grant offer, once accepted, remains valid for 6 months from the date of issue of grant offer notification<i>.</i> It is not possible to apply for a grant after the works have been completed and, therefore, a homeowner cannot reapply for a grant if the works have already been carried out. In relation to the late submission of paperwork under the scheme, grants cannot be paid if the paperwork is not submitted on time and within 6 months from the date of grant offer, as per the terms and conditions of the scheme.</p><p>  It is not possible to make exceptions to the rules of the scheme as to do so would be to alter the terms of the scheme and create a precedent for any other parties who have found themselves ineligible.</p><p>  Queries in relation to individual applications are an operational matter for the SEAI and a dedicated hot line can be reached at 1800 250 204. In addition, the SEAI has recently established a specific email address for queries from Oireachtas members, which can be sent to  and will be dealt with promptly.</p></reply>

The objective of the Regulations is to protect ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources, primarily through the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers.  Good agricultural practice involves the land spreading of slurry as early as practicable in the growing season in order to maximise the uptake of nutrients by crops and to minimise pollution risks to water courses and groundwaters.  In accordance with the requirements of the Nitrates Directive, the Regulations include provisions regarding periods when the land application of certain types of fertilisers is prohibited. In addition, the Regulations prohibit such application at any time of the year when the ground is frozen, waterlogged or heavy rain is forecast.  In view of the prolonged period of favourable weather that has prevailed this summer, an extension to the spreading periods for organic fertilisers is not proposed.</p></reply>

At the end of the transition period, the Act provides that only a prospective declaration may be made.  The Act commenced on 1 July 2013, with the transition period running to 30 September 2013.  From 1 October 2013, the Act provides only for a prospective declaration to be made, to close an evasion loophole, costing approximately &euro;55m per annum, which existed through the use of retrospective declarations.  Extensive public notice of the Act's coming into force was given over the period since 1 July, and I have said that postal applications postmarked on or before 30 September will be regarded as having been received by the deadline.  </p><p>  As precision is needed in taxation measures to provide certainty to those liable to pay the tax, the Act does not allow discretion to extend the deadline beyond the 3 month transition period provided. I do not consider it appropriate to introduce amending legislation at this stage to extend the deadline as there will have been persons who were liable for and paid arrears of motor tax on or after 1 October 2013 and an extension of the deadline to facilitate persons otherwise liable for arrears would be disadvantageous for persons who have paid arrears liable.  It would not have been possible to facilitate declarations of non-use online during the three month transition period, given the requirement for retrospective declarations to be witnessed by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. However, the facility to make prospective declarations of non-use is now operational at , the operation of which is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p><p>  Finally, there should be no ambiguity in relation to farm and vintage vehicles which are required to be taxed if they are being used in a public place.  Other than the provisions in relation to making an off-road declaration, the Non-Use of Motor Vehicles Act 2013 makes no change to motor tax liability in respect of any class of vehicle.  Both farm and vintage vehicles carry a concessionary rate of tax, with owners of agricultural tractors paying &euro;102 per annum, and rates of &euro;56 per annum for vintage vehicles and &euro;26 per annum for vintage motorcycles.</p></reply>

This Scheme amalgamated and replaced previous Schemes operated under the White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity. Applications under this new Scheme were invited from community and voluntary organisations that operate at a national level with evidence of a nationwide membership. This Scheme ceased at the end of 2010 and a new three year funding Scheme was announced in December 2010 and commenced in July 2011.  Guidelines for the current Scheme were prepared and published on the website of the then Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and these guidelines indicated that funding would be provided for core operating costs comprising staffing costs, administration costs and ongoing running costs and that priority would be given to organisations providing key services to the disadvantaged.</p><p>  Mountain Rescue Ireland successfully applied for funding under both the 2007 Scheme and also the current Scheme that commenced in July 2011. Under the current Scheme, funding of &euro;70,000 was provided in 2012, and funding of almost &euro;66,000 was allocated in 2013, towards core costs to Mountain Rescue Ireland. The Department&rsquo;s understanding is that this is used to cover costs of insurance but the contract between my Department and Mountain Rescue Ireland does not specify that the funding must be used for insurance costs, only that the funding must be used for core costs.</p></reply>

Under the Directive, Member States are required to report annually to the European Commission the results of a sampling programme for both petrol and diesel, including any breaches of the environmental specifications of the fuel. The Commission collates the data received and publishes annual reports, which can be viewed on the Commission's website:</p><p>  For Ireland's national sampling programme, a total of 101 petrol samples and 94 diesel samples were collected from service stations in 2012 by Inspection Services Limited on behalf of my Department. The samples were analysed by the State Laboratory. The results found that the samples were broadly compliant with the Directive, with just 6 petrol samples and 4 diesel samples found to exceed environmental specifications. The results were submitted to the Commission on 30 June 2013.  In addition to the national sampling programme, the Irish Petroleum Industry Association (IPIA) contracts an independent laboratory to sample and analyse fuel and the results of that analysis are also included in Ireland's report to the Commission.  If a consumer suspects that fuel offered for sale has been laundered or that their vehicle has been damaged as a result of unintentionally using laundered fuel then this should be reported to the office of the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

Of this, some &euro;149 million related to measures to improve the quality and standard of the social housing stock, including the regeneration of disadvantaged social housing estates and flat complexes, estate-wide remedial works schemes, funding for extensions and adaptations to properties to meet the needs of tenants with a disability, and a retrofitting measure to improve the energy efficiency of older stock. The allocations were based on the level of contractual commitments on approved projects, the work programmes submitted by local authorities and the level of progress and outputs achieved under each of the measures under SHIP over the course of the year.</p><p>In March 2013, I announced a capital provision of &euro;275 million for allocation to 34 city and county councils in respect of my Department&rsquo;s SHIP for 2013. Of this, some &euro;121 million related to a range of measures aimed at improving the overall quality of the social housing stock.  In July I announced details of a &euro;50 million energy retrofitting measure for the period 2013-2015 which targets grants at older houses and apartments which lack adequate insulation and draught proofing. Some &euro;10 million has been allocated for spending in the current year.

My Department funds a network of twenty two Volunteer Centres. It also provides funding to Volunteer Ireland, the national volunteer development agency.  The focus of Volunteer Ireland is to create an enabling environment for volunteering, to develop an ethos of volunteerism across all sectors of society and to be an independent and legitimate voice for volunteering.  The 22 Volunteer Centres act as &lsquo;brokers&rsquo; between potential volunteers and organisations seeking volunteers. The centres are linked by a common database and a common best practice approach. They also work with organisations to develop their volunteer management capacity and carry out Garda vetting for smaller organisations.  My Department intends to review the current policy on Volunteer Centres having regard to the need for a sustainable, nationwide approach to supporting and promoting volunteering. In this regard, my Department currently has under consideration a status report commissioned from Volunteer Ireland on volunteering and volunteering infrastructure in Ireland.</p></reply>

The findings of this first report are clear and robust, and a stark reminder of the need for a comprehensive global response to climate change.  The report was developed and published in an international context and has no specific implications that are unique to Ireland. Through the EU, Ireland is contributing constructively to the on-going negotiations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change aimed at finding agreement on a new climate treaty in 2015. Our contribution is strengthened by the steps we are taking to develop progressive national policy and legislation. On completion of the current Programme for the development of national climate policy and legislation, I will publish the final Heads of the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill early in 2014.</p></reply>

The Programme includes contracts under construction and to commence to the value of over &euro;75 million in Waterford County during the period of the Programme.   </p><p>  The Waterford Grouped Towns and Villages Sewerage Scheme is included in the Programme as a Scheme to Start construction during the life of the Programme. The Scheme provides for the construction of new or upgraded wastewater treatment and collection systems in Ardmore, Ballyduff/Kilmeaden, Cappoquin, Dunmore East, Kilmacthomas, Stradbally and Tallow. Waterford County Council is advancing the scheme on the basis of separate contracts for the collection systems and a single Design Build and Operate (DBO) Contract for the Wastewater Treatment Plants in the towns and villages. </p><p>  Insofar, as the collection networks at the various locations are concerned, the upgrading works to the Ardmore, Ballyduff/Kilmeaden, Cappoquin, Kilmacthomas and Stradbally sewerage collections systems are substantially completed under the current Water Services Investment Programme (2010-2013). The Upgrading of Tallow Sewerage Collection network was carried out between September 2007 and February 2008 and was, therefore, substantially completed during the life of the 2007 &ndash; 2009 Water Services Programme. The upgrading of the Dunmore East Collection System Contact has recently commenced. </p><p>  Wastewater arising in Tallow received primary treatment prior to the upgrading of the sewerage collection system there. The majority of the wastewater in the village receives primary treatment in a septic tank located at the north of the village and treated wastewater is discharged to the River Bride. Woodview Housing Estate has a separate septic tank and wastewater from this is passed through a reed bed system before discharging to the River Bride. The upgrading of the collection network that was carried out in 2007/2008 did not alter these treatment processes. Therefore, the wastewater arising in Tallow still receives primary wastewater treatment prior to discharge to the River Bride. </p><p>  It is proposed to install a new secondary wastewater treatment plant in Tallow under the Design Build and Operate (DBO) Wastewater Treatment Plant Contract for the Waterford Grouped Towns and Villages Sewerage Scheme project. This secondary wastewater treatment plant will replace the current primary treatment systems for Tallow. </p><p>  I understand that Waterford County Council has tendered for the DBO Contract for the seven towns and villages and it is currently assessing the tenders received.</p></reply>

The availability of indigenous, sustainable power is a valuable national asset and is vital for achieving energy security, emissions reductions and economic renewal through job creation. </p><p>  The Seventh Schedule of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) categorises any installation for the harnessing of wind power for energy production with more than 25 turbines or having a total output greater than 50 megawatts as strategic infrastructure.

The objective of the study is to obtain evidence upon which to evaluate the appropriateness of the existing guidelines in relation to noise impacts and , if considered necessary, suggest changes.  It will take account of the following key contextual issues:   </p><p>- The evolution of wind turbine technologies since the current Guidelines were published in 2006;</p><p>- Experience to date in the application of the current Guidelines;</p><p>- Research relating to wind turbine noise issues, including an examination of international practice, since the current Guidelines were adopted;</p><p>- Ireland's binding targets in relation to renewable energy update and penetration. </p><p>  SEAI awarded the contract for carrying out the study to Marshall Day Acoustics in July 2013.  Marshall Day have significant international experience in this field and have previously participated in reviews of the wind farm noise guidelines for the Australian and New Zealand Governments.  This study will form a key input into the review of the statutory guidelines. </p><p>  My understanding is that this study will take into consideration practices pertaining in Denmark, Germany and Australia.  I also understand that the EPA's Noise Guidance Note (NG4 -2012) will also be referenced in the study. </p><p>  The indicative timetable for the publication of the draft statutory guidelines is Quarter 4 2013.  The draft guidelines will - like all other new or revised guidelines - go out for extensive public consultation for a period of 6 weeks to 2 months, to allow for publication of the final guidelines in 2014.  Once the consultation period is closed, the submissions received on the draft guidelines will be considered and taken into account in the final form of the guidelines. </p></reply>

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants in the private rented residential sector.<b></b></p><p>  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 was published on 19 July 2012.  The Bill builds on what has been achieved by the Residential Tenancies Act and the PRTB, and provides for the further development of the rental sector into the future.   </p><p>  The Bill was passed by the D&aacute;il in July 2013 and second stage in the Seanad concluded on 24 September 2013.  Among the main issues addressed by the amending legislation are:</p><p>- the extension of the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act to Approved Housing Body tenancies; </p><p>- the Board of the PRTB to be reduced from 15 to 12 members;   </p><p>- the separation of the governance and quasi-judicial functions of the Board; </p><p>- the merger of the PRTB and the Rent Tribunal;   </p><p>- the simplification and streamlining of the mediation process;   </p><p>- the introduction of a new procedure to enable the PRTB to deal effectively with tenants who do not pay rent during the dispute process.   </p><p>  While the Bill addresses a wide range of issues, there are some other aspects still under development which I hope to bring forward for consideration during the Bill's passage through the Seanad.  In particular, I am keen to progress the commitment in the <i>Programme for Government</i> to introduce a tenancy deposit protection scheme and I intend to provide for the establishment of such a scheme at Committee Stage of the Bill in the Seanad. </p><p>  Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, made under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.  These Regulations were further amended by the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) (Amendment) Regulations 2009. </p><p>  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these Regulations.  Responsibility for enforcement rests with the local authorities, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department. </p><p>  The primary responsibility for the management of any waste, including costs for removal or disposal, lies with the holder of the waste; the holder of the waste is the natural or legal person in possession of the waste or the producer of the waste.  The Waste Management Act 1996 imposes a general duty of care on holders of waste. A person may not hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution.  It is the responsibility of the relevant local authority to deal with any instances of illegal disposal of waste in their functional area and take the appropriate enforcement action. </p><p>  Section 12 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, as amended by section 100 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, requires a landlord of a dwelling to provide receptacles suitable for the storage of refuse outside the dwelling, save where the provision of such receptacles is not within the power or control of the landlord in respect of the dwelling concerned - this could arise for example where it is a function of a management company to provide such a service. </p><p>  In addition, the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008 provide that each house must have access to suitable and adequate pest and vermin-proof refuse storage facilities. </p><p>  The purpose of these provisions is to ensure that facilities are available to tenants to enable them to store refuse appropriately between collections and not in such a way as to attract pests or vermin or become a hazard or eyesore to the general public.  However, the presentation of refuse for collection, the manner in which it is presented and any charges imposed for collection are the responsibility of the tenant, who is the holder of the waste.  Any incidents of illegal waste activity should be reported to the relevant local authorities, who have significant enforcement powers available to them under the Waste Management Act 1996 including the power to make bye-laws regarding the presentation and collection of waste.   </p><p>  Following the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, local authorities have a strengthened, updated legislative and regulatory framework available to them which provides for the issuing of Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices where landlords are in breach of their obligations under the Regulations. Fines for continuing non-compliance with the Regulations have also been significantly increased; the maximum fine has increased from &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000 and the fine for each day of a continuing offence has increased from &euro;250 to &euro;400.   </p></reply>

The Partnership had an interim contract, through Pobal on behalf of the Department, under the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP) which succeeded the LDSIP in 2010.  In April 2010, the Board of Pobal decided to cease its LCDP contract with DICP in light of major concerns about, inter alia, weaknesses in financial controls and procedures, and non-compliance with Programme accountability requirements.  Since then, my Department, in conjunction with Pobal, has ensured that LCDP services for the communities in the Inner City area have continued to be delivered in a coordinated manner through Pobal.  Funding in excess of &euro;1.4m has been committed under the LCDP to Community Development groups in the Dublin Inner City Area in 2013.</p><p><i>Putting People First - Action Programme for Effective Local Government</i> sets out a range of reforms aimed at improving the delivery of services for the citizen, achieving greater efficiency and effectiveness and enhancing the role of local government in local and community development.  The vision and focus underpinning the Government's decision is to achieve a more joined-up approach to service delivery at local level, with responsibility for what is being done - and being spent - in the area of local and community development devolved to local level.  This will be underpinned by new local governance arrangements that will seek to enhance involvement by citizens and communities in the design, implementation and targeting of services.   </p><p>  The delivery structure for the LCDP in the Dublin Inner City Area will fall to be considered in the context of the new arrangements to give effect to the Local Government reform agenda.   </p></reply>

These requirements flow directly from the requirement for Government finances as a whole to be managed in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact, established under the <b>Maastricht</b> Treaty, and the associated limitation on budget deficits.</p><p>  The local government sector must not impact negatively on the General Government Balance (GGB) in any one year.  The downturn in the economy and substantial pressures on Government funding generally require a sharp focus in all sectors, including local government, to ensure effective control and management of public finances. </p><p>  In order to stay within the overall GGB limit, it is necessary for local authorities to maintain both their current and capital accounts broadly in balance.  The only restriction on local authorities is that, in aggregate, capital income equals capital expenditure in the year.  Balance is only required at an overall level and this allows considerable scope for authorities to draw on their existing capital reserves as an element of their overall investment programme.  The precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed in order to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities.</p><p>  It is a matter for every local authority, including town councils, to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process, having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources within the GGB limits as set out.   </p></reply>

As a result of that engagement, I am pleased to say that the Commissioner has confirmed to me that there are now 134 whole-time equivalent staff (130 civilians and 4 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na) assigned to the GCVU, some 41 of whom have been redeployed from elsewhere in the public service since the end of March 2013. Some of these redeployed staff have only recently completed their training in the vetting process, and the full impact of their work will be seen in the coming weeks. Furthermore, I have also recently received sanction for the redeployment of 40 additional staff to the GCVU. This brings the total number of staff in that service to over 170 which, when compared to the average staff allocation of 78 at the Unit over the past two and a half years, represents an increase of 117%.</p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current average processing time for applications is now approximately 9 weeks from date of receipt. However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion. Nevertheless this is a significant improvement on the processing time of 14 weeks which existed in July this year. In the interest of fairness and equity, Garda vetting applications are processed in chronological order based on the date of receipt in the GCVU and all organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.</p><p>  Development of an e-Vetting solution is also underway. This will facilitate the processing of all applications in an e-format, thus removing the time-consuming current process of manually managing all applications received.  The initial phase of testing this e-vetting system will take place in the fourth quarter of 2013.  When this is achieved, this system will streamline the overall vetting process in this jurisdiction, and further contribute to reductions in processing times for all vetting applications.</p></reply>

The Deputy will also be aware that judges are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. </p><p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy,  I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that judicial review applications that can be heard in less than one day are given a hearing date within 3 weeks of the parties informing the court that they are ready to proceed. Applications requiring longer than one day are given a hearing date within 3 months of the parties notifying the court that they are ready to proceed. I am also informed that where it is brought to the attention of the High Court that an application for judicial review relates to a sentencing case the court expedites the hearing of the judicial review.</p><p>  In addition, new court rules for judicial review proceedings were introduced by S.I.  691 of 2011 which, inter alia, require an application for judicial review to be made within 3 months of the date of the decision that is to be reviewed.  This rule has enabled the High Court to reduce the time that elapses between the making of a decision, such as a decision to impose a sentence, and the completion of the judicial review process.</p></reply>

Furthermore, in July 2012, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na created a link from the Garda website to YouTube to promote a video on bicycle security which had been developed as a joint initiative by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Dublin City Council.

In the context of current budgetary constraints a matter of particular concern is the extensive costs which would fall on the Exchequer on the provision of a guardian <i>ad litem</i> service for children in family law proceedings. I do however acknowledge that circumstances arise where it may be in the best interests of a child that the assistance of a guardian <i>ad litem </i>  be available to a court to assist it in the determination of a dispute under the 1964 Act.</p><p>  In the context of planning for the potential implications of the constitutional amendment resulting from the Children referendum, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, together with other relevant departments and agencies including the Department of Justice and Equality, is currently considering how best to ensure that the voice of the child can be conveyed in relevant proceedings, including proceedings under the 1964 Act. This is a matter I hope to address in the Children and Family Relationship Bill presently under preparation in my Department.</p></reply>

Part 2 of the Act makes persons convicted of a range of sexual offences subject to notification requirements.  These provisions extend to persons who enter the State having been convicted abroad of the same range of sexual offences.</p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as of 3 October 2013, there were 1,303 persons subject to the requirements of Part 2 of the Act.</p><p>  The Act makes relevant provisions in relation to the notification of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about the conviction or release from custody of offenders. Under Section 14 of the Act, following conviction for a relevant offence, the Courts Service issues a certificate of conviction to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Section 9 provides that the Irish Prison Service will notify An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at least ten days prior to the release of a person who is subject to notification requirements under the Act.</p><p>  A sex offender is required to notify his or her name and home address to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within 7 days of becoming subject to the notification requirement. This notification period applies whether the person is resident in the State or was convicted of a relevant offence in another jurisdiction and subsequently enters the State.  Furthermore, a person who is subject to the notification requirements of the Act who intends to leave the State for a continuous period of 7 days or more must notify the Garda&iacute; of that intention and, if known, the address of the place outside the State where he or she intends to reside or stay. Return to the State must be notified within the same time frame.</p><p>  Offenders who are subject to the notification requirements are monitored by the Sex Offender Management and Intelligence Unit (SOMIU) at the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.  The Unit is supported by Garda Inspectors nominated in each Garda Division throughout the State.  I am informed that the nominated Inspector in each Division has access to all necessary resources within his/her Division to assist him/her in carrying out his/her duties.  Where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na becomes aware that an offender subject to the notification requirements has breached those requirements, appropriate action is taken, including circulation through PULSE of their information, as well as inquiries to identify their current whereabouts.  I am confident that the appropriate level of monitoring is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all breaches of the requirements which come to notice are pursued.</p><p>  In addition, at time of sentencing the Court may order post release supervision of a person in accordance with Section 26 and such supervision is carried out by the Probation Service.  Such persons are assessed while in custody by the Probation Service using a validated risk assessment instrument. The risk and needs identified in the assessment inform the development of the case management plan, which is then monitored and supervised by the Probation Service in the community.</p><p>  I am further advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na receives notifications regarding convicted sex offenders who travel to this country.  When SOMIU receives such a notification, it is recorded on the Garda PULSE system and the relevant nominated Divisional Inspector is notified as a priority.</p><p>  I am also informed that when the Garda authorities become aware that a convicted sex offender has left or is intending to leave the State, the Sex Offender Management and Intelligence Unit ensures that the relevant law enforcement agency in the country of destination is advised via Interpol.  In addition, a Memorandum of Understanding between the Irish and British Governments on the sharing of information on sex offenders between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and British police forces, including the PSNI, is in place since 2006 and an Agreement for Sharing of Personal Data in relation to the Investigation of Sexual Offences and the Monitoring of Sex Offenders between the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was signed in 2008. I am advised that there are excellent working relationships surrounding the monitoring of the travel arrangements of the persons in question.</p></reply>

Furthermore, I have also recently received sanction for the redeployment of 40 additional staff to the GCVU.

In preparing that plan, the Commissioner reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda stations, both in terms of opening hours and possible closures. In addition, all Divisional Officers were asked to assess the level of activity in each Garda Station in their area.</p><p>  The Commissioner determined as a result of that review that a number of Garda stations should be closed and concluded that the communities covered by the areas in question could be better served by having Garda&iacute; patrolling the areas rather than being confined to a specific premises. I fully agree with the Commissioner's determination in that regard.</p><p>  The revised structures will continue to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na community policing philosophy through the clustering of services at policing hubs. The centralisation of services will facilitate the introduction of an enhanced grid patrolling system that will be operational and intelligence led.  This patrol system will ensure that a high visibility and community oriented policing service continues to be delivered throughout the country.</p></reply>

This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. </p><p>  In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) after 1 January, 1994.  A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern defence forces.</p><p>  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.</p><p>  The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:</p><p>- Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service. </p><p>- Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years.</p><p>- Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.</p><p>  Due to the robust nature of many military operations and their attendant physical training regimes, personnel are exposed to a unique range of challenging environments. In these circumstances it is vital that the age and health profile of personnel be such as to ensure that operational capability and effectiveness are not compromised. </p><p>  In 1990 the Gleeson Commission commented on the unsatisfactory age and fitness profile of the PDF.  Thereafter an in depth study of the Defence Forces by Price Waterhouse Consultants in 1994, who had been engaged by the Efficiency Audit Group (EAG), expressed severe criticism of the age profile of the Defence Forces.  The present terms of enlistment arose from such criticism.  One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of PDF personnel.  </p><p>  With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by PDF members in those ranks.</p><p>  A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter.  In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the PDF. The Deputy will appreciate that as deliberations under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this time.   </p></reply>

The service dates back to a time where the provision of medical services for the families of enlisted personnel was included in Defence Forces Regulations.  Following the introduction of free public hospital care for all citizens in the 1970's, the entitlement to medical services for military families was formally removed from Regulations in 1987 and the family section of the Curragh Military Hospital closed at this time. However, the Curragh Families Clinic was retained because of the difficulty in obtaining doctor and pharmacy services in the Curragh area at the time<font color="#FF0000">. </font> This is no longer the case.  </p><p>  The service is an anomaly in that it is a benefit which is only available to a relatively small number of families resident within the Curragh Camp and surrounding areas.  Similar services are not provided to families of enlisted military personnel at any other location in the State.  A further anomaly arises in that new personnel deployed to the Curragh in recent times do not receive the benefit of free family care.  </p><p>  A number of reviews, undertaken in the period since 1990, have recommended that the Clinic be closed.  The decision to discontinue the operation of the clinic has been made having regard to those reviews, equity considerations and the cost of the service. </p><p>  I would like to emphasise that the families affected will have the same rights of access to public health services as other families of enlisted personnel.  Also, existing services are being maintained for a period of three months to allow families make arrangements to transfer to local GP's and apply for medical cards or GP visit cards if required.  If any patient requires assistance in finding a new GP or applying for a medical or GP visit card this can be provided by staff in the clinic during the transition period.</p></reply>

These groups provide services which complement a variety of dedicated services provided or funded by the HSE. The Family Support Agency (FSA) also has an important role to play in this context.  There are 106 family resource centres around the country, and they aim to combat disadvantage by supporting the functioning of the family unit by offering services and supports to children and families. The FSA also provides funding to voluntary and community organisations providing marriage, relationship, child and bereavement counselling services. These services aim to support people in dealing with difficulties they are experiencing in their relationships and to help children whose lives have been affected by parental separation. </p><p>  The important thing to acknowledge and address is that if a child is in need of care and protection and is unlikely to receive it at home, then the HSE has a duty to ensure they receive appropriate care. In cases where parents are unable to cope due to illness or other serious problems they may agree to their children being taken into the care of the HSE on a voluntary basis, under Section 4 of the Child Care Act, 1991. While the HSE has care of the children in such instances it must consider the parents' wishes as to how the care is provided. The HSE is obliged to provide care for these children for as long as their welfare requires it. </p><p>  A child protection social worker assigned to a child placed in a care setting has a duty to prepare and regularly review the care plan for the child. Intrinsic to this process is ensuring that the wishes of the child and his or her family are considered, that access and contact is facilitated between the child, parents and siblings (unless there is a court agreed reason not to do so), and that full engagement takes place with the child and their family with a view to planning the child&rsquo;s return home. A significant amount of work takes place between social workers and parents to create a situation where a child could return home, including referrals for parent(s) for relationship counselling, substance misuse or mental health issues.</p><p>  In addition to social work services, HSE Children and Family Services also provide a broad range of family support services. These include family centres, community psychology, child care work and family support work e.g. counselling and parenting skills.</p><p>  The Child and Family Agency will take on the crucial roles played by Children and Family Services and the FSA, and will continue to provide supports and assistance to ensure that children, where possible, are allowed to grow and develop within a supportive family environment.</p></reply>

I have received a large volume of representations on behalf of the applicants involved and I and my officials have actively been trying to assist those affected. </p><p>  Following queries I initiated through diplomatic channels the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation has confirmed to the Irish Embassy that new legislation came into force on 3rd July 2013 which requires a child to be on the national adoption database for twelve months before that child is deemed eligible for intercountry adoption and may be placed on an international adoption database. The previous period was eight months. I understand the purpose of the amendment is to extend the period during which possibilities for domestic adoption are considered.</p><p>  The Adoption Act, 2010, provides for adoptions from countries that have ratified the Hague Convention on adoption and from countries where there is a bilateral agreement in place. During the drafting of the Act a considered and detailed transitional process to deal with the change from previous legislation to the new Act was put in place. The transitional measure contained in Section 63 of the Adoption Act, 2010, allows applicants with a valid declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt who had commenced the adoption process at the time of the commencement of the Act to continue with that adoption, from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country. Such applicants were thus afforded an additional three year period to complete these particular adoptions from non-Hague countries, and must complete the process by the 31st October 2013. The Adoption Authority has advised that the time period to complete the adoption process in Russia is generally less than a year and a large number of applicants with Section 63 declarations have successfully adopted from Russia during the period of validity of these Section 63 declarations.</p><p>  The issue that has arisen is that the changes introduced by the Russian authorities mean that a small number of Irish applicants will not be able to conclude their adoption of a Russian child by 31 October 2013.  </p><p>  In an effort to assist I have been using diplomatic channels to seek solutions for the applicants involved. These diplomatic channels have been used to fully outline the difficult situation these applicants have been put in following the change in Russian procedures and to explore possible solutions. The Irish Ambassador to Russia met with the Deputy Foreign Minister Titov in Moscow on 10th September 2013. The Ambassador has highlighted the concerns of the specific applicants. He has also outlined the position and noted our desire for a degree of flexibility in relation to the implementation of the changes recently introduced, which has affected a small number of Irish applicants who were at an advanced stage in the adoption process. </p><p>I also recently met with the Embassy Attach&eacute; from the Russian Embassy to Dublin who was representing the Russian Ambassador to highlight the current difficulties the sudden change in Russian legislation has created. This meeting was positive and the Attach&eacute; indicated that officials from the Ministry of Education in Moscow are aware of the issues and are examining them closely.    </p><p>  On October 3 2013  the Irish Ambassador in Moscow met Mr Vladimir Kabanov, Deputy Head of the Department for Children's Rights at the Ministry for Education and Science. The Ambassador was informed that the amendment to the law applies to all cases that had not applied to the Court to finalise their adoptions by the date of 2 July 2013.  It was agreed that the Ministry for Education and Science will verify the status of the Irish families in the Russian adoption system The Embassy is assisting in this process.   </p><p>  Amongst the representations I have received is a proposal to amend the Adoption Act, 2010 to address this situation.  As the Act is drafted on the basis of the incorporation of the Hague Convention and the minimum set of standards outlined therein, the implications of amending the Adoption Act, 2010 must be carefully examined.  Issues also arise in confining any such amendment to the cases immediately affected by the recent changes in Russia.  Nevertheless, these legislative issues are receiving consideration by my Department in parallel with the ongoing engagement with the Russian authorities.</p><p>  Further meetings are scheduled for this week to examine the options available to progress this matter further.</p></reply>

The scheme will enable the health services to offer 1,000 graduate nurses positions for two years, at a time when job opportunities in the public service are very limited. Under the Haddington Road Agreement it was agreed that participants will be paid 85% of the first point of the new entrant scale in the first year and 90% in the second. Therefore it supports the retention of recently qualified graduate nurses and midwives within the Irish health system and enables them to gain valuable work experience and development opportunities post-graduation.</p><p>  The educational component of the scheme will comprise a two year part-time three module Certificate Graduate Education Programme that will be Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland approved and academically accredited.  This formally accredited programme will have currency for accreditation for prior learning by Higher Education Institutes when graduates wish to undertake further study and progress towards a Masters Level Award at a later stage in their career.</p><p>  To date 115 staff nurse/midwife graduates have commenced employment. A significant number of candidates are currently going through the recruitment and clearance process or are awaiting their registration with An Bord Altranais and will commence work on receipt of this.</p></reply>

Open Enrolment Regulations, made under the Health Insurance Acts, provide for maximum waiting periods for eligibility for payment under a health insurance contract, excluding payments resulting from injury or accident, in respect of first entry to health insurance and in respect of pre-existing medical conditions. They also provide for persons whose cover has ceased for less than 13 weeks to become insured again without affecting their position as regards waiting periods served, provided the same level of cover is involved. The maximum waiting periods that an insurer may apply under the legislation is as follows:</p><p>- 26 weeks, in respect of a person who is under the age of 55 years;  </p><p>- 52 weeks, in respect of a person who is of or over the age of 55 years and under the age of 65 years;</p><p>- 104 weeks, in respect of a person who is 65 years and over. </p><p>  These Regulations are important for a number of reasons. Firstly, open enrolment and lifetime cover provides that, except in limited circumstances specified in legislation, health insurers must accept all applicants for health insurance and all consumers are guaranteed the right to renew their policies regardless of their age or health status. Secondly, the provisions on waiting periods help to support community rating. Under community rating, everybody is charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan, irrespective of age, gender and the current or likely future state of their health. This system requires &lsquo;intergenerational solidarity&rsquo;, where younger people pay more for health insurance than the level of risk they present would demand, while older people pay less as a direct consequence. So younger and  healthier people effectively subsidise older and less healthy people, on the understanding that these younger people will themselves be subsidised by later generations when they reach old age and/or suffer ill health. </p><p>  The provision of waiting periods can help to discourage individuals from only taking out health insurance later in life, thus minimising the strain placed on the community rating system and ultimately benefitting the entire pool of insured persons in the community, rather than the risks and costs on a person by person basis. In addition, the provision of waiting periods can also provide an important tool for insurers to combat practices where someone could potentially take out a health insurance policy to avail of a particular treatment and then cancel the policy once treatment had been received, without either penalty or sustained contribution to the community-rated model.</p></reply>

An inter-departmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, is working to develop detailed proposals for the operation of a new statutory scheme and is due to report back to Government in October.</p><p>  The Government also decided in June that payments should temporarily continue to be made by the Health Service Executive to those persons currently in receipt of the Mobility Allowance for a further number of months, pending the commencement of new statutory provisions, on the basis that this would prevent hardship, and, on an interim basis, alleviate stress, anxiety and uncertainty among a vulnerable group in society.</p><p>  The Government is very conscious of the needs of people with a disability who have relied on the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant to support their independence and will take all of this into consideration when making a decision on future arrangements.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government includes provision for the extension of BreastCheck to women in the 65-69 age group, in keeping with EU Guidelines on effective screening for breast cancer.  A business case from the HSE National Cancer Screening Service for the age extension of BreastCheck has recently been submitted to my Department and is currently being examined.  In all, the National Cancer Screening Service delivers three population based cancer screening programmes:  BreastCheck, CervicalCheck and BowelScreen.  BowelScreen is the first cancer screening programme for both men and women.</p><p>  In relation to prostate cancer, the Board of the National Cancer Screening Service undertook a review of available evidence in relation to the potential effectiveness of introducing a national population-based prostate cancer screening programme.  It found that current evidence is insufficient to recommend a population based screening programme as such screening may not improve survival or people's quality of life.</p><p>  However, the National Cancer Control Programme has established rapid access prostate cancer clinics in the eight designated cancer centres to ensure that men who have urological symptoms and/or abnormal PSA test results are seen in a timely way by urologists, and that appropriate diagnostic tests are carried out and multi-disciplinary treatment is planned as necessary.</p></reply>

As part of this plan a  Rebuild Steering Group was established and is supported by a design team. </p><p>  The Group identified the Scope of Works (11 projects), indicative timescales and the estimated cost required to restore services to the hospital.  Emergency capital funding has been made available to fund the projects which include, inter alia;</p><p>  - Gynae Department restored;</p><p>  - Temporary cardiac investigations area completed;</p><p>  - Interim kitchens/staff canteen are in place and in operation;</p><p>  - Interim Emergency Department and Radiology Department including two mobile DR (X Ray) trailers are in place and providing service;</p><p>  - Planning permission submitted for culvert works;</p><p>  - Option appraisal and detailed design completed for temporary outpatients. </p><p>  In parallel there is an ongoing process regarding settling the insurance claim to cover the extensive damage.  This claim will fund a significant part of the identified costs but is very much work in process.  Any deficit in costs, not covered by the insurance claim will be met (subject to the normal scrutiny) by the Health Service Executive.  It will be some time before the insurance claim is completed and final costs are known.</p><p>   I am satisfied that every possible resource has been made available and will continue to be made available to Letterkenny General Hospital to implement the scope of works identified by the Rebuild Steering Group. </p></reply>

This policy requires the health service to reduce its workforce to 98,938 wholetime equivalent employees (WTEs) by the end of 2013. </p><p>  The total number employed in the public health sector at the end of August 2013 was 100,578 WTEs, a decrease of 928 WTEs from the 2012 outturn of 101,506 WTEs.  </p><p>  The Incentivised Career Break Scheme which was rolled out in the HSE earlier this year was a targeted measure to contribute towards the reduction in employment numbers required.  To date, around 360 staff have been given approval to avail of the scheme.  The HSE has been asked to review the scheme to establish whether there is potential for more staff to be released, in light of the additional capacity available under the additional working hours provisions of the Haddington Road Agreement.</p><p>  A targeted Voluntary Redundancy Scheme in the HSE and in organisations funded by the HSE has also been approved.  It will be implemented on a rolling basis as areas and functions to be targeted are identified, e.g. as hospital groups are brought into being.

The implementation of <i>Healthy Ireland</i> is being overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy.  A key feature of the development of <i>Healthy Ireland</i> is the engagement and collaboration across Government Departments and other public sector bodies.  Such collaboration continues to be a significant feature of the implementation strategy.  Critical to this success is an active, central Government policy driven approach where Healthy Ireland's actions are systematically embedded into the policies and programmes of relevant Government Departments, local authorities and statutory agencies.  It is equally important that there is active engagement at local level, empowering and supporting people to be as healthy as they can be for as long as possible. </p><p>  The development of an implementation plan requires cross-departmental input and progress is currently being focused on a number of key actions including:</p><p>- the establishment of a Health and Wellbeing Directorate in the HSE,</p><p>- the establishment of a Health &amp;amp; Wellbeing Programme Office in my Department,</p><p>- the development of a National Plan for Physical Activity,</p><p>- an awareness campaign on tackling the problem of childhood obesity,</p><p>- the development of an implementation plan for positive ageing,</p><p>- the development of branding guidelines,</p><p>- the development of an outcomes framework, and</p><p>- the development of a research and data plan.</p><p>These processes are underway.</p></reply>

It is highly destructive and has devastating effects on individuals, relationships, families, communities and society in general.  Recent trends indicate that levels of illicit drug use remained stable in Ireland between 2006/7 and 2010/11.   However, polydrug use is increasingly becoming the norm among those who take drugs.  The use of two or more substances, often including alcohol, presents substantial risks to those involved, as well as increased challenges for treatment personnel.  Moreover, there is clear evidence in relation to the harms caused by alcohol use and misuse to individuals and to Irish society.</p><p>  Proposals are currently being finalised on foot of the recommendations in the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy 2012.  These proposals cover all of the areas mentioned in the report, including legislation on minimum unit pricing, controls on alcohol advertising and sponsorship and any attended impact on the revenue streams of organisations; labelling of alcohol products; measures on access and availability of alcohol and a social responsibility levy on the drinks industry.  The Cabinet Committee on Social Policy has considered these proposals and it is intended to bring forward a finalised package of proposals for consideration by Government very shortly.  In the meantime, work on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation is continuing.</p><p>  The levels of usage of some prescription medicines, in particular benzodiazepines and z-drugs, are also a matter of concern.  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is preparing amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1988 which will include the introduction of measures to address the problem of the illicit trading and supply of benzodiazepines and z-drugs and other updates to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations.  The proposed draft Regulations constitute a major amendment to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations.  The Government is committed to maintaining the integrated partnership approach which is a hallmark of the National Drugs Strategy.  To this end, I will be meeting with representatives of the statutory, community and voluntary sectors and the Drug and Alcohol Task Forces in the coming weeks in order to strengthen and consolidate this approach, including at the local level.</p></reply>

The STCW convention allows for maritime administrations to issue national certification for domestic waters, but any certification for vessels on international voyages must comply in full with the STCW provisions.</p><p>  My Department has published two Marine Notices to facilitate skippers and fishermen to attain an STCW qualification that would enable them to work in the wider marine sector.  The first, Marine Notice 2 of 2009, sets out the process whereby certain fishermen can convert their existing qualifications to obtain the necessary Certificates of Competency to allow them to take up employment on stand-by, seismic survey or oceanographic research vessels.  The second, Marine Notice 3 of 2009, gives details of how skippers holding particular Irish qualifications for fishing vessels can convert these to Certificates of Competency for certain merchant shipping qualifications.  A skipper&rsquo;s relevant experience will also be taken into account in this process.  In addition, my Department is also considering at this time the possibility of introducing new provisions to enable the employment of persons with particular fishing vessel qualifications to work on certain domestic cargo vessels operating exclusively within the State.</p></reply>

I have commend the work that Mr Murphy is doing in terms of promoting the &ldquo;Sli na Slainte&rdquo; walking initiative.</p><p>  Mr Murphy proposes the use of signage on buses, trains and Luas stops/stations that would incorporate the Sli na Slainte logo.  These signs would advocate walking 30 minutes every day.  While I fully support the intention of such a campaign, given the undeniable benefits of walking from a health and environmental perspective, it is the case that this campaign fits more under the umbrella of a health initiative than a public transport initiative.  Nevertheless I did meet with Mr Murphy and a representative of the NTA to assess the potential of assisting in this initiative.  The NTA indicated that they cannot accommodate the &ldquo;Sli na Slainte&rdquo; symbol and message on bus stop information panels, due to space restrictions, bilingual requirements and overall legibility of the information sign.</p><p>  In relation to bus shelters, where more space is available for information panels, the NTA intends providing local area maps with transport information as well as local area destination information.  As part of the local area map, the Authority will be including a walking distance indicator from the bus shelter location, in a style that is in keeping with the overall mapping.  The NTA have undertaken to meet with Mr Murphy along with their graphic designers to examine design options to also incorporate  a version of this health message on the bus shelter information panels.  I understand that this engagement is to take place shortly.</p></reply>

Given the limited funds available, the decision was taken that the main priority to 2016 is to protect investment made to date, to maintain safety standards and to progress affordable projects such as Luas Cross City which add value to the existing network.  </p><p>In early 2011 arising from its statutory remit, the NTA published a &ldquo;Draft Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2011 &ndash; 2030&rdquo; .  That Draft Transport Strategy identified that Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) schemes could play a significant role in the provision of public transport in the Dublin region. </p><p>  Subsequent to the publication of the Draft Transport Strategy, the Authority published, in October of last year, a report titled &ldquo;Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) - Core Dublin Network&rdquo;.  That report identified two key BRT routes: Blanchardstown to N11 (UCD); and Malahide Road (starting at Clongriffin) to Tallaght.</p><p>  In addition, it identified that while a third corridor - the Swords/Airport to City Centre corridor - would require a rail-based solution in the longer term, a BRT scheme along this corridor could cater for the projected transport demand in the short term.</p><p>  The Authority is currently progressing initial designs for the three BRT schemes including the Swords /Airport Corridor, with the objective of reaching the stage of public consultation on route options later this year or early next year.  In terms of progression to possible construction, the current capital programme up to 2016 only has funding for design and planning costs and does not include any funding provision for construction.</p><p>  I have asked my officials to prepare a Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport which will inform future investment plans and in particular the next capital plan from 2017. This  work, which will include a review of Metro North as well as other projects such as BRT, is underway. This plan will address the needs of the Swords /Airport Corridor and establish overall priorities having regard to available funding.</p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, given the funding constraints I face, my priority is on maintaining and modernising existing infrastructure rather than building new infrastructure.</p></reply>

The study asked Member States to comment on the effectiveness of the Directive and its possible extension to include light goods vehicles and cars in the scope of vehicles requiring speed limiters to be fitted.   Ireland has taken the position, expressed through the Road Safety Authority, that there is currently no justification to extend the scope of this Directive to other categories of vehicles.  While I accept that younger drivers contribute disproportionately to road collisions, I am not convinced that the mandatory introduction of speed limiters would be either effective or practical.</p></reply>

Indications are that there are unlikely to be difficulties in reaching an agreement with Ontario so far as the Irish side is concerned, although, of course, any agreement must be mutually accepted.  The RSA is continuing to pursue these matters with a view to reaching an agreement as soon as practicable.</p><p>  In addition, the RSA asked the Irish Embassy to forward the material on the Irish licensing system which they prepared for the authorities in Ontario to all the other licensing authorities in Canada.   The RSA has recently been informed that progress has been made with the authorities in Newfoundland and Labrador, who have examined the Irish licensing system and are satisfied that progress can be made.  The RSA has now received material from the authorities in Newfoundland and Labrador on their licensing systems, which are now being studied.</p></reply>

In 2007 in order to inform tourism policy on wind farm developments F&aacute;ilte Ireland undertook significant research amongst both overseas and domestic visitors, to determine visitor attitudes towards wind farms. This research was repeated in 2012, to determine any changes in visitor attitudes over that period. This research is about to be published as a position paper by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and allows an evidence based approach to be taken to the evaluation of the potential tourism impact of wind farm applications in Ireland by the National Tourism Development Authority.    </p><p>  As part of this research visitors were asked to comment on a variety of preferences in relation to the number, size, and location of wind farms. The results indicate that visitors prefer wind farms with larger turbines, but in smaller numbers, to offset the size of the individual farms. Inland sites, away from immediate accommodation views are seen as more acceptable for visitors compared to coastal locations, which are less favoured for the development of wind farms. </p><p>  Visitors were also asked to comment on their likelihood to return to an area should further wind farms be built. The most widely held view is that this would not impact the likelihood of returning to the area, with a slightly greater majority saying that this would have a positive rather than a negative impact. However importantly 24% (a slight increase on 2007 at 21%) did state that this would have a negative impact on their likelihood to return to the area in the future. It is considered that potential impacts such as this could possibly be avoided or mitigated if future wind farms are designed and located appropriately to take visitor preferences in to consideration. </p><p>  It is based upon these visitor preferences that F&aacute;ilte Ireland advocates for the appropriate design and siting of wind farms in Ireland on behalf of the tourism industry.</p></reply>

There has also been significant investment in rolling stock, on upgrading the Kildare route and opening new routes such as Cork Commuter route, Navan Phase 1and Phase 1 of the Western Rail Corridor. </p><p>  The priority for our public transport network must be to aim for a better return from the existing public transport system, through targeted investment, better use of existing resources and by using smart technology to make public transport more responsive and user friendly. The limited funding available over and above this priority will only be provided for projects which are affordable, meet overall transport objectives and deliver the best return in terms of economic recovery and job creation. Moreover the ability to operate profitably and without the need for any subsidy would also be a key consideration for any new projects.</p><p>  In addition to capital investment, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann also received a total allocation of &euro;127m in 2013 for Public Service Obligation (PSO) services. The Board of CI&Eacute; are also pursuing a range of measures to address the financial position, including cost reductions across the three operating companies, so that the CI&Eacute;&rsquo;s rail and bus services can be provided efficiently and cost effectively over the Plan period.</p></reply>

Competition for funding under the 2012 calls was very high with 4.25 times the budget being applied for through the Multi Annual Call and for the Annual Call the budget was oversubscribed by 2.09 times.</p><p>  It is expected that a further Call will be announced in December 2013 and my Department will engage again with its agencies to examine the scope for submitting further applications. </p><p>  In addition to Ten -T funding, &euro;18.15 million in co-funding under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) 2007-2013 has been allocated in respect of two rail projects in the BMW region, namely for the elimination of speed restrictions and new rolling stock.</p></reply>

The sport sector's contribution to the economy includes sports tourism, ticket sales, subscriptions and the cost of playing sport, together with the purchase of sports equipment and an economic value of time given by volunteers.     </p><p>  The &quot;Assessment of Economic Impact of Sport in Ireland&quot; published in 2010 shows that there is a very significant return on Government investment and expenditure on sport in Ireland. Based on figures for 2008, it estimated that overall Government expenditure on grants, capital investment and other sport-related expenditures amounted to &euro;618.3 million. However the Government sector as a whole received a total of &euro;922.4 million in revenues from taxes on sport-supported expenditures and incomes, in addition to revenues from sports facilities. </p><p>  Sports clubs throughout the country have a significant impact on the economy, as they generate &euro;733 million per year from areas including subscription fees, green fees and bar and food revenue.  The vast majority of these clubs, which number approximately 12,000, are conducted on a voluntary basis, which serves to increase the economic gain generated from their operation.</p></reply>

Due to the overall reduction in funding for transport infrastructure the priority to 2016 is to protect investment made to date and to maintain safety standards.   The limited funding available over and above this priority will only be provided for projects which are affordable, meet overall transport objectives and deliver the best return in terms of economic recovery and job creation.</p><p>  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Programme for Government and in particular the commitment that:<i> &quot;We will insist that major capital projects are subjected to proper cost-benefit analysis and evaluation, improving future productivity and growth prospects, and that the value-for-money obtained is significantly enhanced compared to the most recent period.&quot;</i></p><p>  Despite the current financial position, a number of key PPP road projects are being progressed as part of the Government's Stimulus Package, among them, the N17/N18 Gort to Tuam. Subject to the finalisation of funding arrangements for the N17/N18, it is hoped that the project will go to construction in 2014. The development of other national routes, along the Atlantic Corridor remains a longer-term objective of this Government.  The motorway to Gort was completed in 2010 and in 2012 the only national road which commenced construction was the N5 Ballaghderreen By-Pass.</p><p>  In relation to public transport I  recently opened a new rail station at Oranmore.  Other funds are being devoted to improving and integrating the public transport service in Galway with main rail and bus station upgrades, bus lane extensions, provision of Real Time Passenger Information, a city bikes scheme, and a range of projects to promote walking and cycling. Funding is also being provided for the railway safety programme at around &euro;100m per annum which benefits all the network. I have  no plans to extend the Western Rail Corridor as there  are no funds to develop new rail links in any part of the country or to provide subsidies for more  loss making routes.</p><p>  Matters relating to energy and broadband come under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Finally, I have indicated to the House previously, there are no plans to develop a so-called &quot;Western Arc&quot;, or indeed a so-called &#8220;Eastern Arc&#8221;.</p></reply>
