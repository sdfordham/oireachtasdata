I am conscious of the fact that prices have come under pressure over the last year and the difficulties that this is causing for producers.  Having said that, it must be noted that Irish prices have remained broadly in line with EU prices and I note there has been a slight increase recently, reflecting renewed market confidence in Europe and increased demand in China.</p>  <p>  Recently, my Department distributed a &euro;1m direct aid package for pig farmers in Ireland.  This support originates from a package of measures proposed by the EU Commission in response to the significant price deterioration experienced by pig farmers in 2015, the impact of which has been exacerbated by the closure of the Russian market.  Under the aid package agreed at EU level in September of last year, &euro;0.5m was allocated for the pig sector for Ireland.  The Government subsequently matched this funding to provide an overall aid package of &euro;1m. </p>  <p>  My Department also supports Bord Bia&rsquo;s marketing and promotional activities, and the Pigmeat Quality Assurance scheme helps to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and third country markets.  Bord Bia plans to use additional funds to run a targeted Pork promotional campaign this coming Autumn and further campaigns are planned to promote ham and bacon.  Teagasc is also actively engaged in the provision of technical advice to improve the operational efficiency of pig farmers. </p>  <p>  I have also included provision in the RDP for an on-farm capital investment scheme, TAMS II, with an overall budget of &euro;395 million across all sectors, with &euro;35.8 million allocated for 2016.  Amongst the areas identified for initial funding are investments on pig farms for energy, water meters and medicine dispensers.  Other elements of the RDP, such as targeted on farm animal health and welfare scheme will also be of benefit to the pig sector.   </p>  <p>  Finally, I am committed to ensuring that as many alternative markets as possible are open to the Irish Pigmeat sector.  In that regard I will continue to prioritise the opening of new markets such as Vietnam and the Philippines, which serve as valuable alternative markets to Russia for Irish pigmeat exports.  Indeed I will be leading a trade mission to Vietnam and China during the first week in September, during which I will be prioritising the promotion of pigmeat in two of our main export markets.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-13a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071300069#WRB00300"><p>The decision of the UK to leave the EU is one that creates considerable challenges for the agrifood sector.  The UK is by far our largest trading partner.  Last year we exported almost &euro;5.1 billion worth of agricultural products.  This included more than &euro;1.1 billion in beef products and almost &euro;970 million in dairy products.  Ireland is also the UK&rsquo;s largest destination for its food exports - worth &euro;3.8 billion last year.  This bilateral trade takes place on the basis of harmonised EU rules on animal and public health and labelling, without complex certification, quota limits or customs duties and tariffs.  And it is underpinned by the vital support of the CAP budget, to which the UK is a significant net contributor. </p>  <p>  Given these linkages, and as the UK is a net food importer, both countries have a strong interest in maintaining a close agrifood trading relationship. In addition, the resilience of the Irish agrifood sector is well recognised, and this, together with the strong commercial relationships built up over years of trading, will help us to negotiate our way though the challenges ahead. </p>  <p>  It is important also to bear in mind that the precise implications of the referendum outcome will depend on the trade and other arrangements ultimately negotiated between the EU and the UK. These negotiations may take up to two years, and perhaps longer, and over that period existing arrangements will continue to apply. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department has engaged in detailed contingency planning for the possibility of this result, and has published a summary of the key actions we are taking to address the contingencies arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision. </p>  <p>  The most immediate concerns for exporters centre on Euro-Sterling exchange rates.  It should be noted that the fall in the value of Sterling against the Euro, while significant, is not unprecedented.  Nevertheless, a sustained period of currency volatility could be of concern. In that regard, the Central Bank of Ireland has pre-established contingency plans to deal with market volatility surrounding the referendum result. The Bank will engage with the Department of Finance and individual financial institutions regarding potential risks.  Actions by ECB and other global actors will be monitored closely. </p>  <p>  I have also asked the relevant agencies, including Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland, to provide practical guidance to SMEs.  Last week Bord Bia announced a number of measures to support food and drink businesses. These measures cover areas such as managing volatility impacts, providing consumer and market insight, deepening customer engagement and extending market reach, with the aim of helping companies maintain their competitiveness. Similar support is also being provided by Enterprise Ireland.   </p>  <p>  Aside from currency fluctuations, the main areas in which potential impacts are foreseen are in relation to tariffs and trade, the EU budget, regulations and standards, and customs controls and certification, while complex issues also arise for the fisheries sector. </p>  <p>  However, we must remember that our trading relationship with the UK is not altered in any way until the negotiation process that will dictate the terms and conditions of the UK&rsquo;s departure is completed.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime, and as part of our overall contingency planning, I have taken a number of measures to ensure a sensible, coherent approach is adopted, namely:</p>  <p>  -  I have established a dedicated unit in my Department to work on all of the issues that I have mentioned;</p>  <p>  -  I have convened a Consultative Committee of stakeholders, which met for the first time last week, to ensure a full exchange of information as the negotiations proceed;</p>  <p>  -  I am also ensuring that the response of the relevant agencies is fully coordinated through a contact group established under the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee, and </p>  <p>-  The Department will continue to feed into the central Contingency Framework being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-13a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071300069#WRB00500"><p>Our seafood industry has been on a sustained growth path in recent years, with sales growing 53% since 2010 to &euro;890 million in 2015.  Current FAO estimates are that growth in world consumption of fish will require an extra 40 million tonnes of seafood by 2030.  Ireland can capture a significant share of this global seafood opportunity with the right strategy and supporting investment.  FoodWise 2025 recognised this opportunity for the growth of our seafood industry and set out a strategy to realise that growth potential by focussing on the key areas of sustainability, added value, processing scale, human capital, increasing raw material supply and developing our markets.</p>  <p>  In January this year, a new &euro;240 million development programme for Ireland&rsquo;s seafood sector was launched -   the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme.  That Programme will be the primary tool to address the 6 key areas identified in FoodWise.  I was delighted to announce in June the first tranche of &euro;4.3 million in grants to 51 aquaculture and seafood processing enterprises under the EMFF Programme. </p>  <p>  Under that Programme, I am making available &euro;30 million to kick-start growth in our aquaculture sector, which has been stagnant for too long. In December, we published Ireland&rsquo;s first National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development, targeting growth in output of 45,000 tonnes by 2023, aided through 24 specified initiatives.  To complement those efforts, my Department is working to deliver up to 200 licence determinations this year and will initiate a review of aquaculture licensing procedures, as recommended in FoodWise. </p>  <p>  All of these efforts focusing on aquaculture, together with efforts to attract landings of fish by foreign vessels, will help increase the supply of raw material to our growing processing industry to convert to added value consumer foods, food ingredients and functional foods.  I will be making available &euro;33 million Government funding through the EMFF Programme to support the further development of our processing sector through enhanced scaling and value adding.  FoodWise recognises that we need to reduce the level of seafood product which is exported in commodity form from its present 70% level to below 50%.  Adding value to seafood products will make a huge difference to the economic activity and levels of employment in our coastal communities.   </p>  <p>  These efforts are being supported through &euro;2 million investment in 2016 by Bord Bia in promoting Irish seafood internationally and assisting our producers to find and grow markets.  They are being supported by a commitment within the seafood sector to sustainability, with 32 Irish seafood companies fully verified as members of Origin Green, and a further 16 applications in the pipeline.  Between them, these companies will account for in excess of 80% of total seafood export values. </p>  <p>  In these many initiatives to implement the FoodWise strategy and in our financial commitment through the EMFF Programme, Government is clearly stepping up to the challenges and striving to grow our seafood industry.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-13a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071300069#WRB00700"><p>The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 is a major piece of legislation replacing a wide range of Acts relating to animal health and welfare dating back over a century.  The Act provides for major legislative changes relating to animal welfare, putting it on a more pro-active footing and, in particular, placing specific requirement on animal keepers to care for animals rather than merely avoid cruelty.  In addition, the Act enables authorised officers for the first time to intervene before welfare situations become serious instead of waiting for problems to occur as heretofore.  This policy change is reinforced by a system of Animal Welfare Notices.  This means authorised officers are now in a position to provide positive instruction for the care of animals and they only resort to prosecution in serious situations.  Thus the Act assists in the education of keepers of animals and in making them aware of potential hazards as well as providing for the punishment of those few persons who contravene the Act.  This policy is designed to allow early intervention and to prevent small problems escalating into serious issues.</p>  <p>  Since the commencement of the Animal Health and Welfare Act in March 2014, my Department has initiated over fifty prosecutions for breaches of legislation relating to animal welfare, including those taken by my Department, based on field inspections by Department Officers, authorised officers of the ISPCA and DSPCA and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Several prosecutions have been successfully completed and the remainder are at various stages in the court system. </p>  <p>  The offences prosecuted include &ndash;</p>  <p>  -  Causing unnecessary pain and suffering to animals;</p>  <p>  -  Not taking necessary steps to protect the welfare of animals;</p>  <p>  -  Being reckless or neglectful regarding the welfare of animals;</p>  <p>  -  Failure to secure appropriate veterinary treatment;</p>  <p>  -  Failure to comply with notices issued by authorised officers to take specified measures in the interests of an animals&rsquo; welfare, and</p>  <p>  -  Unlawful tail-docking of pups.</p>  <p>  My Department has initiated a programme of training for authorised officers involved in implementing the animal welfare code.  As the Deputy is aware, in addition to Department personnel, authorised officers include members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well as officers of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</p>  <p>  I think it appropriate to place on the record my thanks to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Customs and Excise and officers of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals for their continued co-operation with officers of my Department in implementing animal health and welfare legislation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-13a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071300069#WRB01000"><p>Under the provisions of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958 the regulation of coursing is chiefly a matter for the Irish Coursing Club (ICC) subject to the general control and direction of Bord na gCon, which is the statutory body with responsibility for the improvement and development of the greyhound industry, greyhound racing and coursing.  The ICC has confirmed that it has systems in place to underpin the welfare of animals participating in coursing events.  These include mandatory inspections of hares and coursing venues in advance of the commencement of an event.  Greyhounds involved in coursing are subject to the provisions of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 and the Code of Practice for the care and welfare of greyhounds, published by Bord na gCon.  The ICC has assured the Department that it goes to great lengths to ensure the highest standards are adhered to during coursing.  The ICC's rules and regulations (Rule 106) accommodate the postponement of meetings if the weather is unfavourable i.e. snowfall, frost or waterlogged ground, which may affect the welfare of both greyhound and/or hare.  The ICC has demonstrated it&rsquo;s willingness to cancel/postpone meetings in the face of adverse weather conditions.  By way of example, one coursing meeting was cancelled and one postponed in the 2015/2016 season due to flooding, and this would be a routine practice for all clubs affiliated to the ICC.  During extreme weather conditions, it is also the practice of clubs to provide additional food for hares living on hare preserves protected by coursing clubs.</p>  <p>  A very high proportion (99.33%) of the hares captured for hare coursing were returned to the wild at the end of the 2015/2016 season.</p>  <p>  The systems that are in place are, in my view, effective and are working well.</p></reply>

Discussions have commenced with the European Commission and a formal submission will be made shortly. Any such scheme must comply with the Rural Development Regulation.  This scheme will be additional to the existing supports available to sheep farmers under the BPS, GLAS, ANC and TAMS, will make a vital contribution to ensuring the continuing viability of the sheep sector in Ireland.</p>  <p>  My officials are currently working on the details of the scheme, taking into account consultations with the farm organisations and the discussions with the European Commission.  The Scheme is being developed as an animal welfare scheme and as such will utilise Article 33 of the Rural Development Regulation; all actions or undertakings will have to show a clear connection to improving animal welfare conditions for those flocks within the scheme.</p>  <p>  EU rules relating to the identification of sheep are laid down in Commission Regulation 21 of 2004, which requires the electronic identification of all sheep by 9 months of age at the latest (but before leaving the holding of birth) with a conventional tag and an EID tag/bolus.  Article 4(3) of the Regulation provides for a derogation whereby Member States may chose to allow the identification of lambs slaughtered before the age of 12 months by way of a single conventional tag.  This &lsquo;slaughter derogation&rsquo; was availed of by my Department and has been incorporated into the current National Sheep Identification System (NSIS) which has now been in place for over 4 years.  </p>  <p>  My Department is currently reviewing the NSIS with a view to simplifying and improving the current system and in this context there are a number of factors to be considered.  The benefits of extending EID include improved traceability and significant labour savings for farmers in terms of reduced bureaucracy and record-keeping.  I am also mindful that full EID is also in use in Northern Ireland, Britain and France and that not introducing it here could potentially undermine efforts to access third country markets. On the other hand the extension of EID would involve some additional costs for farmers, which need to be borne in mind. These discussions are separate to the development of the scheme.</p></reply>

The negotiation of access to new markets historically has been a big driver of economic development, particularly in the agrifood sector.  I believe that this will continue to be the case in the future, and will be crucial to the achievement of the objectives outlined in the Food Wise 2025 strategy.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the negotiation of free trade agreements must therefore be informed by the need to make progress in areas where we have offensive interests, and to strongly defend those areas where threats may arise. </p><p>About one-third of all world trade occurs on the EU-US trade corridor, so it is one that is hugely important for Europe and for Ireland.  The US is one of our leading trading partners, and in the agrifood sector we have a large and growing trade surplus with them (exports of &euro;869m last year, compared to imports of &euro;271m). </p><p>In relation to TTIP, Ireland has both offensive and defensive interests.  We see worthwhile opportunities in the US for cheese, powdered milks and sports products, and further opportunities for branded packaged butter, if we can remove some regulatory barriers.  Prepared consumer foods and fish could also benefit from trade liberalisation.</p><p>Beef is a unique sector in that we have both offensive and defensive interests.  In the long term, any significant increase in beef imports to the EU could have adverse effects on the Irish industry.  That was confirmed by a number of recent studies and is an issue we have raised strongly with the European Commission.  We therefore have legitimate concerns about the size, composition and administration of any beef quota offered to the US. </p><p>We should also seek a significant EU quota for beef to the US as part of any TTIP agreement.  Following the re-opening of the market, Irish beef exports now fall under a 65,000-tonne quota for &lsquo;other countries&rsquo; on a first come, first served basis.  This is mainly filled by Latin American countries.  Now that we have gained access for manufacturing beef we stand to benefit greatly from a specific EU import quota in the US, and this can only be achieved through TTIP. </p><p><b></b>A similar, balanced approach informs our view of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Canada, which was concluded in September 2014.  While increased access to the EU market was granted for Canadian beef, greater access to the Canadian market for EU dairy products, notably cheese, was also a feature.  However, I think it is also important to ensure that the cumulative impact of beef concessions under CETA and other trade agreements is closely monitored to ensure that the approach continues to be in the best interests of EU and Irish agriculture<b>.</b></p></reply>

Statistics show that accidents on farms cause more workplace deaths than all other occupations combined.  In the period 2004 to 2013, there were 176 fatal farm accidents which is a shocking statistic.  To date this year there has been 8 fatal farm accidents on Irish farms.  These 8 fatal farm accidents account for over forty percent of all fatal work accidents so far in 2016, while farming accounts for less than 6 percent of the workforce.  While this is a welcome reduction, the rate of accidents on farms remains very high and it is important that the focus on farm safety is maintained.</p>  <p>  Injuries and fatalities are caused in a number of ways but the two highest areas of accidents relate to tractors &amp;amp; machinery and livestock.  So far this year tractors and machinery account for 75% of all fatal farm accidents. </p>  <p>  The current TAMS grant-aid schemes are focused on capital investment items that have a prolonged life span and are of a high cost.  Most personal protective equipment needs to be replaced on a fairly regular basis to ensure that it remains in a functional condition, and most of it costs less than &euro;50 for any one item.  For example traditional style boiler suits can be purchased for less than &euro;20 and items such as goggles, ear defenders, face masks, hard hats, gloves and high-visibility waistcoats can all be purchased for less than &euro;10 each. </p>  <p>  Behavioural change is what is required to prevent many accidents.  It is a case of being aware of the dangers and taking the time to do what is necessary to minimise the risk.  While there are many risks in farming, farming does not have to be a dangerous occupation.  There are plenty of ways to reduce the danger, without spending a lot of money.  Farmers should be encouraged to take time to plan buildings and work.  After all, as farmers, they are the ones who will benefit. </p>  <p>  To conclude, it is important for everyone, to continually highlight the need for farmers to think Safety First in all tasks they perform, no matter the pressure.  No individual action or organisation can solve this difficult problem that impacts so negatively on so many lives each year.</p></reply>

I must clarify for the Deputy that management of wild salmon is the responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources and is administered by Inland Fisheries Ireland while seals come under the responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and management is administered by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS).  I understand that interaction between these two protected species is a complex issue being examined by the aforementioned agencies.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the inshore fisheries sector is also concerned about the interaction between seals and commercial inshore stocks.  In January this year the NPWS accepted an invitation to discuss the seal population with the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF) and I understand that this discussion was viewed as constructive by both sides.  At the most recent meeting of the NIFF on 22nd June, my first meeting with the Forum, the discussion was described as a necessary starting point of an issue that requires further engagement in the future. </p>  <p>  I understand from the Marine Institute that a Seal Fisheries Focus Group was set up to bring together industry, science and NGOs.  Membership of the Group has included scientists from the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Coastal and Marine Research Centre of UCC together with representatives from the Irish Seal Sanctuary and from the Irish sea-fishing industry.  I am advised that the Group meets on an ad hoc basis.  In terms of research priorities on issues concerning sea-fisheries, the Irish Fisheries Science Research Partnership (IFSRP) was set up on an official basis to enhance collaboration and mutual understanding on fisheries science priorities, which are beneficial to the long-term future of the Irish fishing industry.  The IFSRP includes industry representatives such as from the National Inshore Fisheries Forum and scientists from both Marine Institute and BIM and meets on a regular basis throughout the year to discuss scientific work programmes and priorities, including in relation to interactions between seals and sea-fisheries.</p></reply>

Current FAO estimates are that growth in world consumption of fish will require an extra 40 million tonnes of seafood by 2030.  Ireland can capture a significant share of this global seafood opportunity with the right strategy and supporting investment.  FoodWise 2025 recognised this opportunity for the growth of our seafood industry and set out a strategy to realise that growth potential by focussing on the key areas of sustainability, added value, processing scale, human capital, increasing raw material supply and developing our markets.   </p>  <p>  In January this year, my predecessor Minister Coveney launched Ireland&rsquo;s new &euro;240 million development programme for our seafood sector, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme.  That Programme will be the primary tool to address the 6 key areas identified in Foodwise.  I was delighted to announce in June the first tranche of &euro;4.3 million in grants to 51 aquaculture and seafood processing enterprises under the EMFF Programme. </p>  <p>  Under that Programme, I am making available &euro;30 million to kick-start growth in our aquaculture sector, which has been stagnant for too long.  In December, we published Ireland&rsquo;s first National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development, targeting growth in output of 45,000 tonnes by 2023, aided through 24 specified initiatives.  To complement those efforts, my Department is working to deliver up to 200 licence determinations this year and will initiate a review of aquaculture licensing procedures, as recommended in Foodwise. </p>  <p>  All of these efforts focusing on aquaculture, together with efforts to attract landings of fish by foreign vessels, will help increase the supply of raw material to our growing processing industry to convert to added value consumer foods, food ingredients and functional foods.  I will be making available &euro;33 million Government funding through the EMFF Programme to support the further development of our processing sector through enhanced scaling and value adding.  FoodWise recognises that we need to reduce the level of seafood product which is exported in commodity form from its present 70% level to below 50%.  Adding value to seafood products will make a huge difference to the economic activity and levels of employment in our coastal communities.   </p>  <p>  These efforts are being supported through &euro;2 million investment in 2016 by Bord Bia in promoting Irish seafood internationally and assisting our producers to find and grow markets.  They are being supported by a commitment within the seafood sector to sustainability, with 32 Irish seafood companies fully verified as members of Origin Green, and a further 16 applications in the pipeline.  Between them, these companies will account for in excess of 80% of total seafood export values. </p>  <p>  In these many initiatives to implement the Foodwise strategy and in our financial commitment through the EMFF Programme, Government is clearly stepping up to the challenges and striving to grow our seafood industry. </p></reply>

Six plants are currently approved to export.</p><p>By the end of December 2015, Bord Bia estimated that approximately 1,800 tonnes of beef, with an estimated value of &euro;14 million had been exported from Ireland to the US.  This represents an exception ally strong start to this trade, considering that the first exports only went in March 2015 and some of the plants were only approved for export in September.  That amount looks likely to be surpassed in 2016 as, by the end of June, almost 1,200 tonnes had been exported.</p><p>I was delighted to announce last week the decision of the US authorities to extend their approval for Irish beef to include manufacturing beef/beef intended for grinding.

All exporters of dogs are required to provide animal health and welfare certification in respect of compliance with identification requirements, fitness for the intended journey, health status and rabies vaccination requirements.  Once these animal certification requirements are met, dogs, including greyhounds, may be exported internationally.  Exporters of animals are also required to comply with the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1 of 2005 on the protection of animals during transport.    </p>  <p>  While a very small number of greyhounds have been exported to Macau earlier this year, it is nevertheless imperative to ensure that the transport of greyhounds over long distances is conducted in a manner which safeguards the welfare of animals being transported and minimises the risk of transmitting infectious diseases.  Bord na gCon is responsible for the governance, regulation and development of the greyhound industry in the Republic as well as the well-being of greyhounds.  The Bord has developed a comprehensive Code of Practice on the welfare of greyhounds which sets out specific standards that all individuals engaged in the care and management of registered greyhounds are expected to meet.  The code emphasises that owners and keepers take full responsibility for the physical and social well-being of greyhounds in line with best welfare practice.   </p>  <p>  As mentioned in my reply of 8 June, oversight mechanisms in place regarding greyhound exports include inter-agency co-operation, co-operation with fellow members of the International Greyhound Forum and mechanisms relating to intelligence and information which is received from welfare officers during the course of investigations carried out under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.  Where any breaches of welfare standards are identified under that Act, Bord na gCon takes stringent actions and prosecutions ensue in accordance with the Act.   </p>  <p>  Officials of my Department met on 23rd May with representatives of Bord na gCon and the welfare members of the International Greyhound Forum - represented by the ISPCA and Dogs Trust here in Ireland - to consider the issues surrounding the export of greyhounds.  I met with representatives of the ISPCA on 29th June last and, on the specific issue of export of greyhounds to Macau, the ISPCA recalled the positive engagement of the Greyhound Forum on this issue.</p></reply>

Therefore I remain unable to comment one way or another upon the matters raised in it.  I have noted that two deputies have now brought this film to my attention and I will, therefore, certainly consider watching the film if and when the opportunity presents itself.</p><p>I am aware that this documentary raises a number of matters about the use of different natural resources, including fish stocks, in three Atlantic Communities in Ireland, Norway and Canada.  I should point out however that there are numerous sources of information regarding the proper use and management of natural resources and, while I am open to all, when it comes to fisheries management I draw on the expert advice of the Marine Institute.  I also engage in extensive consultations with the fishing industry and other stakeholders, for example the Environmental Pillar, to ensure that I am fully aware of as wide a range of views on our fisheries management arrangements as possible.</p><p>It is important to note with regard to fish stocks and their use as natural resource that, in Ireland, fish quotas are a public resource.  The allocation of fish quotas follows regular, detailed consultations. </p><p>Ireland has successfully resisted pressure over the years to try and force the privatisation of fish quotas through the imposition of what is known as an Individual Transferable Quota or ITQ system.  As Minister responsible, I am determined that our marine resources will continue to be managed for the overall public good.</p><p>I would also like to reference the wider world in which we operate, namely the new European Union Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).  The key objective of the reformed CFP is to ensure that fishing activities are environmentally sustainable in the long term and are managed in a way that continues to deliver economic and social benefits to our coastal communities that are dependent on the sea.</p><p>A key tool of the new CFP is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY).  This should lead over time to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and result in more sustainable fishing patterns. </p><p>The CFP specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY.  The most recent assessment of progress in achieving MSY shows that while challenges remain, there has been steady progress toward the ultimate goal of achieving MSY for all stocks by 2020.  There is no doubt that this objective is challenging.  However, in the Northeast Atlantic area, the move towards sustainability is both widespread and visible.  While in the early 2000s most stocks were overfished, today more than half of the (assessed) stocks are managed sustainably, and this includes many of the largest and commercially most valuable stocks.</p><p>My overarching goal as Minister is to ensure a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector.  These objectives must however be balanced with the need to safeguard fish stocks for future generations.  This will ensure that families dependent on fishing can look forward to being part of a vibrant, productive and resilient Irish fishing industry and can expect to continue to achieve a reasonable return for their efforts and investment.</p></reply>

Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectorial recommendations.  </p>  <p>  Food security is defined by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) as: &ldquo;a situation that exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life&rdquo;.  At national level, food security is addressed through a range of Government policies providing social protection and supports for low income, disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.  At international level, Ireland&rsquo;s development aid programme has a strong focus on food and nutrition, including through funding from my own Department to the UN FAO and WFP (World Food Programme). </p>  <p>  Food Wise aims to grow the Irish agrifood sector in an economic, environmental and socially sustainable manner, building on our strengths in the production of safe, healthy and nutritious food.  Ireland is already one of the EU&rsquo;s most efficient producers of milk and beef, in terms of carbon footprint per unit of output. But under Food Wise we are implementing measures to drive down the carbon intensity of our food production even further, resulting in both economic returns and environmental sustainability.  In that regard I am satisfied that the strategy reflects food security considerations.   </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s agriculture is largely livestock based and, clearly, if we are to build on our strengths, this must be the focus of our objectives on food security. However we are developing our seafood industry and our tillage sector. </p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 promotes the use of DAFM&rsquo;s competitive research funding programmes - FIRM, Stimulus &amp;amp; CoFoRD &ndash; to support research that is heavily focused on sustainability all along the food production and processing chain.  Accordingly, in addition to research to improve the environmental impact of Irish agriculture in terms of climate, water and biodiversity, a number of on-going projects are focused on:</p>  <p>  -  improving grass breeding, utilisation and management so as to support Ireland&rsquo;s low input, grass based livestock production system.</p>  <p>  -  developing alternative native energy and protein feed sources as substitutes for imported grain</p>  <p>-  advancing our understanding of both animal and human digestive processes leading to the development of novel dietary intervention products some of which can be used to assist with hunger alleviation efforts in extreme famine situations.      </p>  <p>  The ambition that Ireland should be a global leader in sustainable food production, building on our natural advantages, is one that I hope is shared by all, and Food Wise is a blueprint for how this ambition can be realised.</p></reply>

In addition, the resilience of the Irish agrifood sector is well recognised, and this, together with the strong commercial relationships built up over years of trading, will help us to negotiate our way though the challenges ahead. </p><p>It is important also to bear in mind that the precise implications of the referendum outcome will depend on the trade and other arrangements ultimately negotiated between the EU and the UK.  These negotiations may take up to two years, and perhaps longer, and over that period existing arrangements will continue to apply. </p><p>Nevertheless, my Department has engaged in detailed contingency planning for the possibility of this result, and has published a summary of the key actions we are taking to address the contingencies arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision.</p><p>The most immediate concerns for exporters centre on Euro-Sterling exchange rates.  It should be noted that the fall in the value of Sterling against the Euro, while significant, is not unprecedented.  Nevertheless, a sustained period of currency volatility could be of concern. In that regard, the Central Bank of Ireland has pre-established contingency plans to deal with market volatility surrounding the referendum result.  The Bank will engage with the Department of Finance and individual financial institutions regarding potential risks<b>.</b>Actions by ECB and other global actors will be monitored closely.</p><p>I have also asked the relevant agencies, including Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland, to provide practical guidance to SMEs. Last week Bord Bia announced a number of measures to support food and drink businesses.  These measures cover areas such as managing volatility impacts, providing consumer and market insight, deepening customer engagement and extending market reach, with the aim of helping companies maintain their competitiveness.  Similar support is also being provided by Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>Aside from currency fluctuations, the main areas in which potential impacts are foreseen are in relation to tariffs and trade, the EU budget, regulations and standards, and customs controls and certification, while complex issues also arise for the fisheries sector. </p><p>However, we must remember that our trading relationship with the UK is not altered in any way until the negotiation process that will dictate the terms and conditions of the UK&rsquo;s departure is completed.  </p><p>In the meantime, and as part of our overall contingency planning, I have taken a number of measures to ensure a sensible, coherent approach is adopted, namely:</p><p>-  I have established a dedicated unit in my Department to work on all of the issues that I have mentioned;</p><p>-  I have convened a Consultative Committee of stakeholders, which met for the first time last week, to ensure a full exchange of information as the negotiations proceed;</p><p>-  I am also ensuring that the response of the relevant agencies is fully coordinated through a contact group established under the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee, and</p><p>-  The Department will continue to feed into the central Contingency Framework being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p></reply>

Furthermore the sector also makes a vital contribution to the economy supporting 34,000 farm families directly in addition to providing several thousand jobs indirectly in rural areas also.</p>  <p>  The new programme for Government commits to the introduction of a scheme for sheep farmers under the Rural Development Programme with a budget of &euro;25 million to be provided in Budget 2017.  The inclusion of this provision in the programme for Government reflects a commitment by the Government to ensuring the continued viability of the sheep sector in Ireland.</p>  <p>  My Department has engaged in extensive consultation with farm organisations and  met two weeks ago with officials of the European Commission to discuss the proposed new scheme in the context of the specific requirements of the Rural Development Programme.</p>  <p>  In light of these consultations and discussions my officials are currently working on the details of the scheme with a view to making a formal submission to the European Commission shortly.  The Scheme itself is being developed in the context of Article 33 of the Rural Development Regulation which provides for animal welfare measures and as such all actions or undertakings will have to show a clear connection to improving animal welfare conditions for those flocks within the scheme.</p>  <p>  It is clear that any such scheme must meet certain specific criteria laid down by the Rural Development Regulation and the options available to my Department in the context of the design of the scheme must reflect that.  This scheme will have to meet the requirements of the Rural Development Regulations in terms of only compensating farmers for any actions undertaken on the basis of costs incurred or income foregone.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in any scheme where farmers must undertake actions, those actions must go beyond the normal standards of husbandry practice before they can be considered as an eligible cost incurred by a farmer and must demonstrate a clear benefit to animal welfare.  Actions within those schemes must be verifiable and controllable.   </p>  <p>  I intend to ensure that the scheme will be made available to as many sheep farmers as possible and that it will provide for participation by both hill and lowland flock owners.</p></reply>

The development of new and alternative markets, given the changing global demographics and emerging economies in Asia and elsewhere, is a crucial component of the Food Wise 2025 Strategy. </p>  <p>  In the medium and long term global demographics will result in strong global demand for meat and dairy products and my role as Minister is to facilitate market access so that Irish exporters can take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. </p>  <p>  My Department engages on an ongoing basis with many third countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Irish Embassies, the industry and the European Commission on various market access issues.  Live cattle exports are an important part of the overall mix and can offer an alternative outlet to farmers for their cattle. </p>  <p>  Last week we had further success with the announcement by the US authorities that Ireland has become the first EU Member State to be allowed to export beef for grinding there.   </p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the need to develop as many market outlets as possible for Irish meat and dairy products.  I will continue to work with stakeholders to raise the profile of the Irish meat and dairy sectors, and the Irish agrifood sector generally, in emerging markets in the Far East, North Africa, the Gulf States and elsewhere. </p>  <p>  As an initial step I intend to lead a trade mission to China, Vietnam and Singapore in September   to further promote Irish food and drink in the region. </p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the need to continuously develop relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build upon the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in the future.  I can assure the deputy that the search for new opportunities in both emerging and more mature markets will continue to be a priority.</p></reply>

The most immediate of these are, of course, the need to deal with the ongoing market difficulties that have affected the dairy and pigmeat markets in particular, and the new challenges posed by the UK decision to leave the EU.</p>  <p>  On the former, I outlined earlier the fact that I have been carefully monitoring developments on the market, and that I have called on the Commission to intervene as required in order to support farmers&rsquo; incomes. </p>  <p>  The Commission will bring forward a further package of measures at the July Council of Ministers, which takes place next week.  At recent Council discussions I have emphasised that our focus must remain on providing real, practical and immediate assistance for farmers, particularly given the additional complications created by the UK decision to leave the EU. </p>  <p>  In addition to intervention, I have called for the deployment of other measures that will provide real benefit for farmers in the short-term.  These include the bringing forward of the delivery date for direct payments.  Last year Member States were also able to pay an advance of 70%, and I have asked the Commission to consider raising this percentage further in 2016.  I have also called on the Commission to consider the deployment of a further targeted aid package, similar to that provided last September.  This gave considerable flexibility to Member States to adopt responses suited to their national circumstances, and I believe such a measure could play a further important role in 2016.  I have also repeated my call for the Commission to help reduce the cost of farm inputs by temporarily removing customs tariffs and anti-dumping duties on the importation of fertilisers.   </p>  <p>  My approach is underpinned by the need to continue to look at all means of assisting farmers, but in doing so to focus on direct and practical measures, and to avoid taking any action that would in any way compromise the ability of farmers to take advantage of the positive long-term prospects on dairy markets. </p>  <p>  I have also taken a very inclusive approach to the challenges presented by the UK decision to leave the EU. I have convened a Consultative Committee of stakeholders - including all of the farming organisations - which met for the first time last week, to ensure a full exchange of information as the negotiations proceed.  I am also ensuring that the response of the relevant agencies is fully coordinated through a contact group established under the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee. </p>  <p>  In addition, I have asked Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland to provide practical guidance to SMEs.  Last week Bord Bia announced a number of measures to support food and drink businesses.  These measures cover areas such as managing volatility impacts, providing consumer and market insight, deepening customer engagement and extending market reach, with the aim of helping companies maintain their competitiveness.  Similar support is also being provided by Enterprise Ireland.   </p>  <p>  Aside from currency fluctuations, the main areas in which potential impacts are foreseen are in relation to tariffs and trade, the EU budget, regulations and standards, and customs controls and certification, while complex issues also arise for the fisheries sector. </p>  <p>  However, we must remember that our trading relationship with the UK is not altered in any way until the negotiation process that will dictate the terms and conditions of the UK&rsquo;s departure is completed.  This will take some time.  In the meantime, my Department will continue to identify the priorities for the Irish agrifood sector with a view to seeking the optimum outcome from the negotiations.</p></reply>

The UK is by far our largest trading partner.  Last year we exported almost &euro;5.1 billion worth of agricultural products.  This included more than &euro;1.1 billion in beef products and almost &euro;970 million in dairy products.  Ireland is also the UK&rsquo;s largest destination for its food exports - worth &euro;3.8 billion last year.</p>  <p>  This bilateral trade takes place on the basis of harmonised EU rules on animal and public health and labelling, without complex certification, quota limits or customs duties and tariffs.  And it is underpinned by the vital support of the CAP budget, to which the UK is a significant net contributor. </p>  <p>  Given these linkages, and as the UK is a net food importer, both countries have a strong interest in maintaining a close agrifood trading relationship.  In addition, the resilience of the Irish agrifood sector is well recognised, and this, together with the strong commercial relationships built up over years of trading, will help us to negotiate our way though the challenges ahead. </p>  <p>  It is important also to bear in mind that the precise implications of the referendum outcome will depend on the trade and other arrangements ultimately negotiated between the EU and the UK.  These negotiations may take up to two years, and perhaps longer, and over that period existing arrangements will continue to apply. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department has engaged in detailed contingency planning for the possibility of this result, and has published a summary of the key actions we are taking to address the contingencies arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision. </p>  <p>The most immediate concerns for exporters centre on Euro-Sterling exchange rates.  It should be noted that the fall in the value of Sterling against the Euro, while significant, is not unprecedented.  Nevertheless, a sustained period of currency volatility could be of concern.  In that regard, the Central Bank of Ireland has pre-established contingency plans to deal with market volatility surrounding the referendum result.  The Bank will engage with the Department of Finance and individual financial institutions regarding potential risks.  Actions by ECB and other global actors will be monitored closely. </p>  <p>  I have also asked the relevant agencies, including Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland, to provide practical guidance to SMEs.  Last week Bord Bia announced a number of measures to support food and drink businesses.  These measures cover areas such as managing volatility impacts, providing consumer and market insight, deepening customer engagement and extending market reach, with the aim of helping companies maintain their competitiveness.

Coillte has developed significantly in the intervening period and currently owns and manages 7% of the country&rsquo;s land, some 440,000 hectares, the bulk of which is under forest, and it operates three business areas &ndash; Coillte Forest, Medite SmartPly and Coillte Enterprise.  Each of the three businesses will have a strong role to play in climate change.</p>  <p>  The Group&rsquo;s core forestry business will play a role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.  The company will continue its programme of reforestation following harvest, thereby contributing to carbon sequestration over the long term.  It will also work with my Department in implementing a viable afforestation model.  I note from the Coillte Annual Report for 2015 that the company continues to play a key leadership role in delivering renewable energy solutions to industry by providing long term, secure biomass fuel supply contracts to large energy users thorough regional biomass supply hubs.  The company&rsquo;s biomass sales business thereby contributes to decarbonising the Irish economy by providing a sustainable and natural substitute for fossil fuels.  The company is also active in other renewable areas which will contribute to renewable energy targets with the company&rsquo;s land solutions business on track to deliver electricity to over 300,000 homes by 2017. </p>  <p>  Medite SmartPly, Coillte&rsquo;s panels manufacturing business, as one of the largest users of power in the country, has an important responsibility to reduce its reliance on traditional energy sources.  Wood-based panels as used in the built environment and elsewhere are an important carbon store in their own right. </p>  <p>  Coillte advise that it will take a leadership position in shaping policy around the role forestry will play in climate change and will be at the forefront of global and European developments.  An example of the company assuming a leadership role in this area was its hosting of the Climate Change and Irish Forestry Conference in Farmleigh House in Dublin earlier this year, on 29 February, 2016.  The conference brought together representatives to address the risks and opportunities that climate change and its mitigation presents to the Irish forest sector. </p></reply>

One of my priorities is to support the provision of lower-cost, more flexible finance.</p>  <p>  The EU Commission has announced some limited flexibility on State aid provisions as part of the response to price volatility, including the possibility of a measure on bridging liquidity gaps.  I should point out that this flexibility does not include the provision of EU funding.  I am working with all the financial institutions, particularly the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), to identify potential solutions to providing working capital finance for farmers with liquidity issues. </p>  <p>  I recently met with the CEOs of the main banks and stressed the need for them to be flexible in the context of increased income volatility.  The banks told me that they recognise and are responding to the challenges facing farmers in this regard.  They all offer options such as moving loans to interest-only repayments and extending overdraft facilities.  They all stated that they are committed to the sector for the long term and are aware its cyclical nature.  I also took the opportunity to question the banks on the relatively high interest rates for SMEs in Ireland compared with those across Europe. </p>  <p>  Partly in response to these relatively high interest rates, my Department has just published a request for tender to procure an ex-ante assessment to assess any current failures in the access to finance market in Ireland.  This is a first step towards the potential introduction of Financial Instruments under the EAFRD Rural Development Programme and the EMFF Seafood Development Operational Programme.   </p>  <p>  Access to finance was discussed at the Dairy Forum in June, with an exchange of views with the main banks now a part of the agenda at each meeting.  Before the meeting I formally launched the Dairy Forum&rsquo;s &rsquo;Financial Management Initiative&rsquo;, a programme of cash flow and financial management training and advice for dairy farmers, which is an appropriate and practical initiative at this time. </p>  <p>  Access to finance was also discussed at last month&rsquo;s meeting of the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee, which heard from representatives of the SBCI and the Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF). Both are now active in the market.  In its last report in January, the SBCI stated that of the 4,619 loans amounting to &euro;172 million drawn down by SMEs, 26% had been accessed by agriculture, which is currently its largest sector.   </p>  <p>  My Department, in cooperation with all the other relevant State bodies, will continue to explore additional funding mechanisms for farmers, the agrifood sector and for SMEs generally.</p></reply>

The purpose of these offences is to target the demand for prostitution.  The first is a general offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of paying for sexual activity with a trafficked person, in the context of prostitution, and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not commit an offence. </p>  <p>  These proposals implement the recommendation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence which called for the introduction of an offence criminalising the purchase of sexual services.  The purpose of introducing these provisions is primarily to target the trafficking and sexual exploitation of persons through prostitution.</p>  <p>  The current inquiry into the legal framework on prostitution being undertaken by the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee in the UK is similar to that undertaken here by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.   I would note that the UK Home Affairs Committee report on Prostitution, referred to by the Deputy, is an interim report which does not make any recommendation on the legislative model which should be followed by England and Wales.  </p>  <p>  In deciding to put forward the proposals provided for in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 I have considered all sides of the debate.  I have considered the experience of those states which have introduced similar measures and those states which have addressed prostitution in a different way. I have also considered the reports and findings of various international organisations.  Both the Council of Europe and the European Parliament have recognised the effectiveness of the criminalisation of the purchase of sexual services as a tool in the fight against human trafficking.  Further research and opinions will inevitably be published during the progress of the legislation and I will continue to examine and consider all new evidence.</p>  <p>  I remain convinced that to target the exploitation associated with prostitution requires targeting those who demand those services. The most direct way of combatting this form of exploitation is to send the message to those who pay for these services, and who ignore the exploitation of the women and men involved, that their behaviour is unacceptable and that their behaviour supports the exploitation of other people.</p></reply>

This is owing, at least in part, to the covert nature of the activity and the understandable reluctance on the part of individuals to identify themselves as sellers or buyers of sex.  Reliable research is also hampered by the involvement of organised crime and other illegal activity around prostitution, in particular where trafficking or sexual exploitation is involved.</p>  <p>  Neither is prostitution a uniform activity.  Much of the available research looks at specific aspects of the sex industry, for example street prostitution or indoor prostitution in isolation, and data cannot necessarily be extrapolated to provide a reliable view of the industry as a whole.</p>  <p>  That said, there are a range of data and research sources available.   The Anti-Human Trafficking Division of my Department publishes annual statistics on human trafficking, including persons trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation, and the Central Statistics Office's quarterly crime statistics provide data on reported offences related to prostitution.  Ruhama produces annual statistics on women affected by prostitution and trafficking who avail of their services.  There have also been several research reports, both national and international, on various aspects of prostitution which have been published in recent years.</p>  <p>  All of this data and research, in addition to a wide range of written and oral submissions, were considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in preparing its Report on prostitution in 2013.  In its Report, the Committee called for the introduction of an offence criminalising the purchase of sexual services.  The proposals contained in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015, providing for two new offences of purchasing sexual services, in the context of prostitution, implement that recommendation. The purpose of introducing these provisions is primarily to target the trafficking and sexual exploitation of persons through prostitution.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 completed all stages in Seanad &Eacute;ireann in January 2016 and was restored to the D&aacute;il order paper on 1 June.  While I will continue to consider all evidence and research that becomes available in developing policy in this area, I do not have any plans to commission research on prostitution prior to proceeding with the enactment of this important piece of legislation.</p></reply>

It is important to note that European Economic Area nationals who are the subject of the EU freedom of movement legislation, of which many thousands reside in the State, are not required to register. </p><p>The categories of non-Irish nationals exempted by law from the requirement to register under section 9 of the Immigration Act 2004 include the following:</p><p>(a) a non-national under the age of 16 years;</p><p>(b) a non-national who was born in Ireland; </p><p>(c) a non-national not resident in the State who has been in the State for a period of not more than 3 months since the date of his or her last arrival in the State:</p><p>(d) a non-national seaman not resident in the State whose ship remains at a port in the State and who does not land in the State for discharge.</p><p>The stamp given to the person denotes the type of permission to remain in the State granted to the person concerned.

A necessary first step in preparation for these commencements is the appointment of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority after which the Authority will appoint its own Chief Executive. I can confirm that nominations to the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority have been received from the relevant nominating bodies as set out in the Legal Services Regulation Act.  The appointment by Government of the relevant nominees, for which initial steps have been taken, will be subject to<i></i>prior approval by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas and I hope to be in a position to proceed with this shortly. In accordance with the Act, the Government will appoint one of the lay members of the Authority, which will also have a lay majority, to be Chairperson.  Preparations are also being made in support of the public recruitment, by the new Regulatory Authority, of its Chief Executive whose terms and functions are similarly set out in the 2015 Act. A start-up support team is being established and a suitable premises is being identified from which the new Authority can commence its operations. </p><p>These are the initial steps that will enable the members and Chief Executive of the new Regulatory Authority to spear-head the coming into operation of the new legal services regulatory regime.  This stage will also include the phased commencement of  Parts of the Act such as those dealing with legal costs, the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, the Roll of Practising Barristers and Pre-Action Protocols.  Under section 7 of the 2015 Act, I will also very soon, by order, appoint a day to be the establishment day for the purposes of the Act.</p><p>Following establishment of the Authority and appointment of a Chief Executive the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced.  The managed commencement of these functions is planned for the Autumn in order to allow adequate time and preparation to ensure their effectiveness and success as crucial components of the new regulatory framework.  It should be noted that, under the relevant transitional provisions contained in the 2015 Act, complaints already made to the Law Society under the Solicitors Acts will be brought to completion under that framework and existing law.</p><p>In support of the planned and managed commencement of the relevant Parts of the 2015 Act proposed, as I have outlined, between now and the end of this year, an allocation of &euro;1 million was made under the Justice Vote for 2016 as set-up support for the new Regulatory Authority.  Any funding advanced from this allocation will be provided on a recoupable basis.  Once in operation, the new regulatory regime will be self-funding by means of a levy on the regulated legal professions under the terms set out in Part 7 of the 2015 Act.</p></reply>

The Regulator's initial priority has been the compilation of the statutory Register of Charities, with a view to underpinning and supporting its investigatory and enforcement functions.  On its establishment date, all charities with a valid CHY number, i.e. with tax exemption status from the Revenue Commissioners, were automatically entered on the Register of Charities. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Regulator that a total of 8,034 charities with CHY numbers were deemed to be registered on establishment day.  Of these, some 3,788 or 47% of the total had declared their information on the Register complete by the deadline of 16 April 2016.  I am further advised that the relevant number now stands at 4,592 or 57% of the overall total. The Regulator anticipates that the rate of completion will continue to increase.  However, charities should be aware that they have missed a statutory deadline which could potentially lead to de-registration of their charitable status. I am advised that the Regulator is about to begin a final phase of contacting these charities in the coming weeks to establish if they are still operating.  Those who fail to respond may be subject to enforcement action later in the year and by not completing their details for the public Register are putting their organisation at risk of financial and reputational damage.</p></reply>

The section specifies that a refund is only available where a transferee obtains a specified qualification within 4 years of the date of execution of the instrument and the other conditions of the section are met.</p>  <p>  I have been advised that due to changes in the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) in 2015, there was a significant increase in the number of applicants for agricultural training programmes. One of the criteria for the Department Agriculture, Food and the Marine 2015 Young Farmer Scheme and 2015 National Reserve (funded through RDP) was that the applicant must be the holder of an approved qualification or have commenced a training programme by December 2015</p>  <p>  A number of Teagasc colleges and centres have commenced additional courses with significantly increased numbers of students.  To date, Teagasc is not aware that the timescale for delivery of its courses is giving rise to difficulties with regard to the 4 year period for refund of Stamp Duty.  Section 159A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act specifies that a claim for a repayment of stamp duty must be made within 4 years of the date of stamping of an instrument by the Revenue Commissioners. This four year rule is consistent with the time limit for claiming refunds of other taxes and I would not be in favour of making an exception in such situations.</p></reply>

Investors from outside the EU are mainly seeking access to the European Single Market and are more likely to choose locations with low corporate tax rates. Intra-EU investments are more likely to be located in countries where the corporate tax is high but where they benefit from other local advantages such as low production costs.</p>  <p>  The research concludes that in addition to maintaining a competitive corporate tax rate, Ireland's attractiveness to FDI would benefit from policies aimed at maintaining cost competitiveness and enabling further R&amp;D investment.</p>  <p>  The Report states that, with everything else unchanged, a reduction of the UK s corporate tax rate by one percentage point from 20% to 19% would reduce Ireland s attractiveness to new FDI projects from non-EU countries by 4.3 per cent.  The report does not state that this relationship would hold true for every 1% drop in the UK rate and does not take account of the effect of the UK leaving the EU, which is clearly a significant factor which will impact on both countries relative attractiveness to FDI.</p></reply>

The VRT rate applicable to both new and used imported cars registered on or after 1 July 2008 is determined by the CO2 emission rating of the car and is no longer related to engine size.  The VRT rate is applied to the Open Market Selling Price of the car, as before 2008.  There are eleven CO2 emission bands with VRT rates ranging from 14% to 36%.  The emissions-based system was instituted in order to incentivise a movement to lower emissions vehicles, and contribute to lowering Ireland's transport related carbon emissions in order to meet EU targets.  The  revised VRT system  rebalances VRT so that consumers would be rewarded for choosing lower CO2 emission vehicles.  Consumers have significant control over their VRT liability (ranging from 14% to 36%) depending on type of vehicle they choose to buy.</p></reply>

It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated entity.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes, such as the Consumer Protection Code, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises.  The Act means that any purchasers of loans books are required either to become regulated themselves by the Central Bank or use a regulated credit servicing firm to service their loans. </p>  <p>  The Act also ensures that a regulated credit servicing firm cannot do something, or fail to do something, which would be a prescribed contravention if performed, or not performed, by a retail credit firm.  It also prevents the owner of credit from instructing a regulated credit firm to perform such an action, thereby further enhancing the consumer's protections.</p>  <p>  New owners must either become regulated as credit servicing firms themselves or use a regulated credit servicing firm to service their loans.</p></reply>

Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.  I raised this threshold from &euro;225,000 to its current level as part of Budget 2016. </p><p>Group B: tax free threshold &euro;30,150 applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer. </p><p>Group C: tax free threshold &euro;15,075 applies in all other cases. </p><p>Transfers and inheritance between spouses are not subject to CAT. </p><p>Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold. </p><p>I have indicated that I see the recent change to the Group A threshold as the beginning of a process.

Early Start is funded by my Department.  Early Start centres are based in 40 primary schools in areas of social disadvantage (DEIS band 1).  In comparison to ECCE centres, Early Start centres are staffed by primary school teachers and a childcare assistant also works with each group.  This teacher led staffing arrangement and comparatively favourable staff to child ratio is intended to support a range of special educational needs associated with concentrated disadvantage.</p>  <p>  As I understand it the teachers in early start units can also avail of the full range of teacher training provided by PDST and the SESS (Special Needs Support Service) and they can access support from the Visiting Teachers Services ( Deaf and Blind) as required.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-13a.230.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071300077#WRK01100"><p>A Transitions Reform Steering Group is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills and has membership from Department of Education and Skills, the National Centre for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), the Higher Education Authority (HEA), the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the Irish Universities Association (IUA) and Institute of Technology Ireland (IOTI) as well as Professor &Aacute;ine Hyland as an independent expert.  The Group has, since 2012, been working collaboratively to develop and agree proposals to improve the transition experience of young people moving from second-level to higher education.</p>  <p>  Three key underlying and unifying principles of the approach taken by the partners have been identified as follows: </p>  <p> - A recognition that good learning outcomes and key competences developed through a high quality student experience at second level provide a firm foundation for successful learning in higher education;</p>  <p> - A simplified, coherent and streamlined approach to system architecture and processes helps to build a bridge for students at the interface between different levels of education;</p>  <p> - Our national examination and our higher education admissions systems must have reliability, validity, integrity, equity, fairness and transparency as their hallmarks.  It is essential that full public confidence in both systems is maintained.</p>  <p>  In April 2015 the Minister for Education and Skills published a report entitled "Supporting a Better Transition from Second Level to Higher Education &ndash; Implementation and Next Steps", which set out a package of reforms developed by the stakeholders involved and which are designed to support students in the transition from second level to higher education.  Those reforms are as follows:&ndash; </p>  <p> - To introduce a new grading scheme for the Leaving Certificate, which will reduce the number of grade bands from 14 to 8 at each level.  Ireland's use of a high number of grading bands is unique internationally.  The use of narrow grade bands may also put pressure on students to achieve marginal gains in examination performance and, as a consequence, focus excessive attention on the detail of the assessment process rather than on the achievement of broader learning objectives.</p>  <p> - Related to the new grading scheme, a revised Common Points Scale is also to be introduced.  Developed by the universities and institutes of technology, the revised scale:&ndash;</p>  <p> - preserves the relative value of achievement at Ordinary level in relation to achievement at Higher level that applies in the current common points scale,</p>  <p> - minimises the use of random selection that may result from too many students achieving the same points score, particularly at Higher level, and </p>  <p> - Encourages the take-up of Higher level subjects at Leaving Certificate by awarding points to the new H7 grade.</p>  <p> - To address any perceived problematic predictability in the Leaving Certificate identified by an independent external evaluation of the examination.  This evaluation, while not sustaining the concerns about predictability, did identify a number of issues for consideration.</p>  <p> - To broaden undergraduate entry reduce the number of undergraduate entry routes, while maintaining the number of student places, to the minimum number necessary for academically appropriate and efficient allocation of places to applicants.  This had been signalled not only as a means to reduce the complexity of choice for second-level students and the level of competitiveness driving the system, but also as an opportunity to offer a much broader experience for undergraduates with specialisation to follow later in their degree.  These developments align with the modernisation of undergraduate curricula and assessment that is underway in institutions across the higher education system.</p>  <p>  Implementation of these reforms: As the Deputy will be aware, a new Grading system and a revised common Points Scale will be introduced for the Leaving Certificate.  These will take effect for entry into higher education from 2017 &ndash; the first overhaul of the points system since 1992.  This new progressive points system is a vital part of the overall Transitions Reform agenda.  The new grading scheme for the Leaving Certificate will reduce the number of grade bands from 14 to 8 at each level will be introduced.</p>  <p>  Under the revised scale, the maximum points available in each subject is 100, and the overall maximum points available, excluding Bonus Points for Maths, is 600.  This is the same as the points available under the current scale.</p>  <p>  All students applying through the CAO from 2017 will be awarded points under the new scale, no matter when they sat the Leaving Certificate.</p>  <p>  Because of the non-linear design and other features of the new points scale, all students regardless of which level they sit, will on average receive slightly less points than under the current system. This means that it is likely that, on average, the points required for entry to particular courses will also be slightly lower from 2017.</p>  <p>  However, it is not expected that this change will be out of line with the natural variation of required points which occurs from year to year in any case.</p>  <p>  The new points system has been specifically designed to fairly reward scholastic achievement and I can assure you that very extensive and detailed modelling and testing has been conducted by the higher education institutions, with the assistance of both the CAO and other technical experts, to ensure that the revised scale is fair and equitable to all students.</p>  <p>  Ongoing research will monitor the implementation of the various elements of the programme of change on a systematic basis, and assess the overall impact of the changes.</p>  <p>  Further detailed information on the new Leaving certificate grading system can be found at www.transition.ie.</p>  <p>  In relation to the issues for consideration identified around the area of perceived problematic predictability in the Leaving Certificate, these are being examined by the State Examinations Commission.</p>  <p>  Finally, the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 recommended that a steering and performance based framework for the system governance of higher education in Ireland was to be put in place.  This framework, sets out the areas of responsibility for setting national priorities of Government and related short to medium term objectives for the higher education system.</p>  <p>  The second Systems Performance Report is currently being drafted by the HEA and it is expected that it will be ready for publication in the coming weeks.  Following on from this, there will be a review of the Systems Performance Framework during 2016 with a revised framework developed for the period ahead.  It is intended to address the issue of broadening undergraduate entry, as part of this next Systems Performance Framework which will be put in place for Higher Education Institutions later this year.</p></reply>

This includes the procurement of books and other library related services.  My Department has no direct role in these matters.  Local authorities must adhere, however, to national and EU requirements when undertaking procurement processes for the delivery of goods and services to public libraries.  These requirements do not preclude Irish companies from tendering for such contracts.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) is working with the Educational Procurement Service (EPS) on a library category procurement under the new Office of Government Procurement centralised model.  As current contracts with library authorities will start to expire from Spring 2017, the LGMA intends to commence the procurement process in the Autumn with a view to ensuring that new contracts are in place by early 2017.  For this reason, it would not be practical to defer the procurement process at this stage.  The LGMA is establishing a working group to oversee the procurement process, however, and this group will consider options for the addition of a social clause as part of the tender preparations.</p></reply>

Prior to my Department&rsquo;s approval of these lease arrangements, the project was assessed by the   local authority who confirmed that there was a very strong need for social housing in the area; that the AHB in question has developed an excellent reputation in the management of their existing units; and that provision of these units for social housing use will not negatively impact the existing tenure mix in the area.    In addition, the A HB also received approval for assistance under the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) towards the cost of the acquisition costs of these units.  The CALF   provides an up-front capital payment of up to 30% of the relevant construction or acquisition cost of a project, facilitating AHBs in raising private finance, including from the Housing Finance Agency (HFA), to acquire or build new social housing units.  The capital advance is repayable by the AHB to the local authority at the end of a payment and availability agreement, usually 30 years. </p>  <p>All applications for CALF are subject to a detailed independent financial appraisal conducted by the Housing Agency on my Department&rsquo;s behalf.  This review includes examination of the   acquisition or construction costs and other details relating to the market rents and availability payments sought by the AHB, in order to ensure that the project is sustainable in the long-term and represents value for money. </p>  <p>The units secured in this particular development represent good value for money and will provide secure high quality social housing for 68 households, including many families currently living in emergency accommodation, in an area of high social housing demand. In addition, as the development includes ground floor units it is suitable for adaptation for people with disabilities.</p></reply>

A planning authority may, when granting a permission under section 34 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended), include conditions requiring the payment of a contribution in respect of public infrastructure and facilities benefitting development in the area of the planning authority.  Development contributions are levied by planning authorities on the basis of a development contribution scheme approved by the elected members which sets out how contributions are to be applied in their respective functional areas.  My role as Minister with regard to development contributions is to provide the necessary statutory and policy framework, within which individual development contribution schemes are adopted by each local authority.  The level of contribution, and the types of development to which development contributions should apply, including any exemptions from charging in specific circumstances if that is deemed appropriate, are therefore determined at local authority level, in accordance with the powers vested in elected members in this regard.   </p>  <p>  Similarly, and as with all local charges, the invoicing and collection of any outstanding development contributions are matters for the planning authority concerned to manage, in the light of prevailing local circumstances and in accordance with normal financial procedures.  Where any payments required in respect of development contributions are not settled, such payments may be pursued by the planning authority through the courts as a contract debt and until such time as amounts outstanding are discharged in full, the conditions of the relevant planning permission are regarded as not having been met with the development concerned being unauthorised.</p></reply>

Gateway provides work placements in local authorities for a period of 22 months to those who are unemployed for more than two years.  </p>  <p>  Gateway assists the personal and social development of long-term unemployed persons by providing quality work opportunities.  The initiative also helps local authorities to fulfil commitments in respect of the activation agenda and to undertake work of benefit to the local community.</p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to close the Gateway scheme.  However, with the ongoing welcome reductions in the live register, I believe that a review of work schemes, including Gateway, will be necessary.  This will ensure that the number and nature of schemes, as well as the conditions governing participation, continue to be appropriate.  I will be considering all of these issues over the coming months.</p></reply>

The JobPath service is delivered by two companies - Turas Nua Limited and Seetec Limited.  The companies deliver services directly and also engage with a range of local subcontractors, including training and employment service providers. </p>  <p>  I understand that the person concerned was referred to JobPath on 19/03/2016 and has been actively engaging with their personal advisor.  The person agreed a personal progression plan on 04/04/2016. Turas Nua advised my Department that this client was not disallowed or hampered from participating in any hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) courses, and has completed Level 1 and Level 2 HACCP as of 27/06/2016.</p>  <p>  On 05/07/2016 the person concerned also enquired about the vocational training opportunities scheme (VTOS).  On 06/07/2016 their personal advisor sought clarification from my Department as to whether or not the person concerned would be permitted to leave the service in order to commence a VTOS course.  My Department confirmed to Turas Nua on 11/07/2016 that JobPath participants are eligible to apply.</p>  <p>  Participants on JobPath receive intensive individual support to help overcome barriers to employment and to find jobs.  Each person is assigned a personal advisor who assesses their skills, experience, challenges and work goals and agrees a &ldquo;personal progression plan&rdquo; that includes a schedule of activities, including relevant training and educational programmes to assist them in finding full-time sustainable employment.  There are no barriers to any participants perusing training, including further education and training courses, providing they are relevant to the agreed personal progression plan.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The 2016 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;2.8 billion.</p>  <p>  It is a fundamental qualifying condition of both schemes that a person must be fully unemployed for four days in any period of seven consecutive days.

In this context the cost associated with moving the jobseeker's benefit scheme to an hours-based system, as outlined by the Deputy, cannot be ascertained.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from more traditional work patterns, resulting in an increase in the number of persons employed for less than a full week.

FIS is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.  There are over 56,000 families with more than 123,000 children in receipt of FIS, an increase of over 70 per cent since 2011.  The estimated spend on FIS this year is approximately &euro;410 million, an increase of around &euro;60 million on last year.</p>  <p>  To qualify for FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria.  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; eligibility criterion has been reduced significantly since the introduction of the scheme in 1984, from 30 hours per week to 19 hours per week in 1996.  It is not possible to estimate the costs associated with replacing the current thresholds for FIS qualification without specifying a) a new hours threshold and b) the &lsquo;sliding scale&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Reducing the &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; requirement would have implications for existing working age schemes.  Under jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance a person may, subject to scheme criteria, work for up to three days and continue to receive support under the schemes.  Introducing a sliding scale would be significantly more complex than the present scheme and could require additional resources to administer.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.  In this context, even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they may qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances.</p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension.  The scheme does not involve the award of credits.  The 2007 Green Paper on Pensions estimated an annual cost of backdating the Homemaker's scheme, at that time, as &euro;150 million (if to 1973) or &euro;160 million (if to 1953).  However it described those estimates as &ldquo;extremely tentative&rdquo; and the passage of time means that the potential cost now would be significantly higher.</p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives may not qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Once weekly earnings exceed &euro;376, the rate of employer PRSI is 10.75%.  The upper threshold for the 8.5% rate of employer PRSI was increased from &euro;356 to &euro;376 from 1 January 2016, to take account of the increase in the minimum hourly wage.  The full year cost of this measure is &euro;6.7 million.</p>  <p>  The increase in the upper threshold to &euro;376 ensures that employers, with employees earning the minimum wage and working a 39-hour week, continue to attract the lower 8.5% rate of employer PRSI, upon implementation of the new minimum hourly wage.  </p>  <p>  Further change, if any, to the threshold for charging the lower 8.5% employer PRSI rate to meet the Programme for Government commitment, is dependent on the level of increase in the minimum wage.  In the absence of this information it is not possible to provide a cost for this measure.</p></reply>

The objective of the scheme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.</p>  <p>  In recent years priority for new applications for funding has been given to schools which are part of the Department of Education and Skills initiative for disadvantaged schools &ldquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rdquo; (DEIS) in line with the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, Better Outcomes Brighter Futures.  The schools and organisations that joined the scheme prior to the introduction of DEIS would have done so under the various educational disadvantaged programmes in place at the time.  These schemes included School Completion Programmes, Giving Children an Even Break, Home School Community Liaison Scheme, Designated Disadvantaged, Early Start and Breaking the Cycle.</p>  <p>  The organisation concerned received funding under the scheme from the academic year 2007/2008 to 2012/2013 and officials in my Department are engaging directly with the management of the Centre regarding their application for the forthcoming academic year.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This service provides flexibility in allowing customers to book guaranteed time slots between 9am and 5pm, Monday to Friday.  It removes the necessity for the smaller number of citizens who need their passports for urgent travel reasons to queue and ensures that waiting times at public counters are minimised.</p>  <p>  From early next year an on-line option for passport renewal for adults will be offered to citizens, whether they are based on the island of Ireland or abroad.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the existing range of service options meets the current needs of passport applicants.

There are few western countries as consistently engaged on this issue as Ireland. I have worked continuously to try and maintain the problems of Palestine on the EU and international agenda, despite a wave of concurrent crises in the immediate neighbourhood, and have urged stronger international actions. We will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  I have myself recently returned from my second extensive visit to the area in just over a year, meeting the parties and trying to urge them to move forward.</p>  <p>  Ireland is also engaged on the ground in trying to combat the effects of the occupation, both through our own humanitarian work and through our support of local NGOs engaged on justice and human rights work, a number of whom are among the signatories of this letter.</p>  <p>  I fully share the frustration of the signatories, of Deputies in the House, and of others, that the process has been completely stalled in recent years, and that there is not a stronger international will to drive it forward.  I have therefore given the Government&rsquo;s full support to the efforts by France in recent weeks to do just that.</p>  <p>  The letter, and the Questions posed by Deputies, make particular reference to the call for trade sanctions upon Israel. We have discussed this question on many occasions, with this NGO, here in the House, and elsewhere.  The essential point remains unchanged: I am opposed to sanctions and, in any event, there is no possibility of obtaining any support for such sanctions at EU level, which is where they would have to be implemented.  I have, however, been an advocate of measures which differentiate clearly between Israel and the illegally occupied settlements.  These include the guidelines adopted on research co-operation which exclude entities based in the settlements from benefitting from funding under the EU-Israel research agreement, and on origin of products to ensure that consumers are not misled as to the provenance of any products emanating from the settlements.</p></reply>

The Programme involves an assessment of 300 locations nationwide including 90 coastal locations, the mapping of potentially significant flood risk areas and the production of flood risk management options and plans.  These draft Flood Risk Management Plans are being published from 15th July 2016 for public consultation and should be finalised by the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  In the context of the CFRAM Programme, the Government announced two pilot Individual Property Protection (IPP) projects on 5th January 2015.  These are community based pilots to inform consideration of a possible mechanism to deliver IPP, as part of a community based approach or scheme and also the potential costs and benefits attached to IPP for areas where a flood defence scheme is not likely to be completed for some time.</p>  <p>  These pilots are: </p>  <p>-  a feasibility study in Thomastown and Graiguenamanagh, where Kilkenny County Council has procured consultants to carry out the study.  The consultants will survey each property to establish potential and appropriate IPP options for the community.  This study is being carried out separately to but in parallel with the CFRAM process under which the assessment of all possible feasible flood defence options for these towns is ongoing, and</p>  <p>-  the potential viability of a scheme for the installation of flood gates for some properties, identified by the community in Crossmolina, as an interim measure to help mitigate any further flood damage pending the completion of the defence scheme for the town is being considered by Mayo County Council (MCC) and the OPW.  The two bodies are working together to progress this as quickly as possible.  MCC has carried out a survey of households in the town and has received expressions of interest from 60 homeowners for the installation of flood gates.

The programmes are not only an important source of funding, but provide a visible demonstration of the European Union's continuing support for the process of peace building and reconciliation.

As such, seagulls, the bird species in question, enjoy protection under this legislation.  The population of herring gulls has greatly declined in Ireland (by about 90%) over the past 40 years, probably due to improvements in managing landfill sites as well as other factors.  Nonetheless there are substantial numbers in some coastal towns and cities, including north Dublin city and county.  Herring gulls can be a nuisance because of noise, mainly in July and early August, and may steal food from people eating outdoors.  In the latter case, the easy availability of food sources from litter or feeding by people may be contributing factors to the bird behaviour of concern.</p><p>Ireland, like all EU Member States, is bound by the requirements of the Birds Directive.  There are circumstances under which Member States can derogate from certain provisions of the Birds Directive in cases where there is no other satisfactory solution.<i></i>The circumstances include: in the interests of public health and safety, in the interests of air safety, to prevent serious damage to crops, livestock, forests, fisheries and water and for the protection of flora and fauna.</p><p>Applications for derogation licences are considered on a case by case basis.My Department has not received an application for such a licence nor has it received any definitive proposal in relation to the control of birds in the context of the area in question.  One of the primary roles of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department is the implementation of EU law in Ireland in respect of nature conservation.  My Department does not undertake control programmes, such as culls for example, in relation to bird species protected under the Directive.  My Department will consider any application for such a licence, having regard to the provisions of the relevant legislation. </p><p>In terms of an application for a licence or a project proposal, the applicant would be required to demonstrate that a demonstrable risk to public health tied to a specific problem exists.  My Department is not a competent authority in relation to matters of public health.  I should point out that this application process is separate to any application received under Section 42 of the Wildlife Acts and, in that regard, my Department has received no application under Section 42.</p></reply>

The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies, including the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  In advance of the Review, submissions were sought from groups or bodies who wished to make a contribution, and the Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) made a submission in this context on which they expanded at a subsequent meeting with officials of the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners and, when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  I have recently met with the IFA and invited them to present their submission at the next meeting of the Working Group, due to take place in September 2016. </p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government has committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small business and family farms.</p></reply>

Some however will require continuing health-funded supports, and  to ensure that the needs of this cohort are met, funding of &euro;7.25 million has been allocated by the HSE in 2016 to provide appropriate services and supports.  Once off funding of &euro;2 million is also being provided for the refurbishment and fit-out of buildings to provide suitable service locations by September, based on an assessment of the physical capacity within existing services to accommodate the additional numbers.  In addition,  I am pleased to confirm that a proportion of the additional &euro;3 million secured for disability services last week will also fund new initiatives to meet the needs of this year&rsquo;s school leavers. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy's specific questions relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.

New and separate grand parenting provisions will be introduced to permit such practitioners to register, on a once-off basis and for a limited period, in the physiotherapists register.  </p>  <p>  My Department is preparing the necessary legislation to give effect to the detail of these decisions which have been communicated to the Physiotherapists Registration Board and other interested parties.</p></reply>

Since 2009 all nursing homes whether public or private are registered and inspected by HIQA. This includes a number of nursing homes operated by religious organisations. However, HIQA's remit does not extend to the regulation of residential centres catering for elderly members of religious orders. Under Section 2 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, premises in which the majority of the persons being maintained are members of a religious order or priests of any religion are offered an exemption to registration. While there are currently no plans to extend HIQA&rsquo;s remit to these institutions, I have had discussions on the matter and will look at it again in the future.</p>  <p>  To qualify as an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, a private nursing home will have to:</p>  <p>  -  be registered and subject to inspection by HIQA;</p>  <p>  -  reach a written agreement with NTPF on the maximum prices that will be charged for care under the Scheme; and</p>  <p>  -  be tax compliant.</p></reply>

This is an extensive surveillance programme aimed at detecting and preventing entry into the food chain for human consumption of food products containing banned substances, such as growth-promoting hormones and residues of authorised veterinary medicines, approved animal feed additives and environmental contaminants in food of animal origin.  The plan, which is approved each year by the European Commission, tests in the region of 19,000 samples per annum.  This includes approximately 3,500 samples for a full range of growth promoting substances, including the substance clenbuterol (sometimes referred to as Angel Dust).  Samples are taken both on-farm and at slaughter plants.   </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, as part of routine testing at farm level under the National Residue Control Programme, a bovine sample taken from a farm in Co. Monaghan tested positive for clenbuterol.  Subsequently twenty-seven further animals on the holding, representing a portion of the overall herd, were found to have positive results and were destroyed.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is fully aware of this investigation and has concluded that there is no risk to public health arising thereof.   </p>  <p>  I would emphasise that this is the only confirmed positive case of clenbuterol in Ireland since 2011 and that the last previous case was in 1999. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the detection of clenbuterol in this case confirms the effectiveness of the National Residue Control Programme which is designed to provide safeguards and reassurance of high quality food both to domestic consumers and to our European and international trading partners.  The range of testing conducted in Ireland exceeds European legislative requirements and the testing itself is carried out at state of the art laboratories capable of testing for the presence of substances at extremely low levels.  Notwithstanding this, and in an effort to provide further reassurance on the issue, my Department will undertake a special project of testing for clenbuterol in addition to the targets already set out in the National Residue Plan. </p></reply>

The UK decision to leave the EU will result in a loss of the UK contribution to the EU budget of between 5 and 10%.  This could have implications for future spending decisions in what is already a very tight budgetary framework, where CAP accounts for some 37% of the EU budget.  The comments of Vice Chancellor Gabriel could perhaps be considered an early manifestation of that pressure.   </p>  <p>  However, there remains a very long road to travel on this issue.  In terms of the current budgetary framework, allocations to Member States in respect of the period up to 2020 are set out in Regulations of the European Parliament and of the Council.  Any changes to these allocations would require new regulations agreed by both institutions, a process which, if even considered, would be likely to take a considerable period of time. </p>  <p>  Alternatively, the contributions of the twenty seven remaining Member States to the budget could be increased in order to ensure that the level of expenditure across all headings is maintained. </p>  <p>Again, it is too early to speculate on the likely outcome, and we must also bear in mind that much will depend on the progress of the exit negotiations between the EU and the UK, a process that may not even commence for some time yet.   </p>  <p>  More generally, I will of course continue to ensure that agriculture&rsquo;s voice is a strong one and is fully taken into account during the mid-term review of the current Multiannual Financial Framework, and in the negotiations for the new, post-2020 Framework which are expected to commence in 2018.  This will be based on the principle that the Common Agricultural Policy makes an important contribution to the achievement of EU priorities in the area of jobs and growth, particularly in rural areas, and should continue to attract the commensurate funding to ensure that this contribution is maintained.</p></reply>

Therefore, in recommending that the number of Atypical Worker Permissions under the new Scheme, which applies to non-officers, be capped at 500, the Task Force was cognisant that any mechanism designed to assist with the employment of non-EEA workers should not impact unduly on the employment of local populations in coastal communities.  The Task Force based the cap on employment data from the Marine Survey Office and BIM and took account of the longstanding sea-fishing boat licence condition that at least 50% of the crew on Irish fishing vessels are EU nationals. </p>  <p>  The Task Force recommended that, during the first three months, the Scheme should be open to existing crew members only.  My Department received a request to extend this three month window.  I understand that the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, which administers the Scheme, extended this window to 30th June 2016.

The new US decision paves the way for industry to undertake the steps necessary for trade to commence.  In relation to market access for the USA, Ireland had initially received a major reputational boost in 2015 as the first EU Member State to gain access to the US market for beef and six plants are currently approved to export.  By the end of December 2015 approximately 1,800 tonnes of beef, with an estimated value of &euro;14 million, had been exported from Ireland to the US.  This represents an exceptionally strong start to this trade considering that the first exports only went in March 2015 and some of the plants were only approved for export in September.  That amount looks likely to be surpassed in 2016, as by the end of June, almost 1,200 tonnes had been exported. <b></b></p><p>The recent announcement by the US on our enhanced access is a huge endorsement of Irish beef and our production and regulatory systems.  Ultimately the volume and value of trade will depend on a range of factors such as currency exchange rates,relative commodity prices and global supply and demand patterns.  However, this recent extension of our access in the US has the capability to be a significant boost to the sector over a period of time.</p><p>US consumption of beef is estimated at 11 million tonnes, approximately 1 million of which is imported.  The potential prize for Irish operators is therefore, subject to the variables already outlined, very significant, particularly in circumstances where grass fed hormone free beef is gaining traction in the market place. </p><p>It complements the other market outlets we have secured in the last two years, the development of which is a key element of our Food Wise 2025 strategy.  There has also been significant progress in facilitating trade in other international markets for Irish beef.  My Department continues to push strongly for market access to other Third Countries and we are currently in the process of trying to secure beef access to other third countries, including China, Korea, Israel, Ukraine and Vietnam.  It is my intention to continue to focus on developing as many third country markets as possible in order to provide exporters as many commercial opportunities as possible in a competitive global market place.</p></reply>

In 2015 Ireland exported an estimated &euro;2.2 billion, or approximately 500,000 tonnes of beef, to almost 80 countries around the globe.  Food Wise 2025 acknowledged that there is a rising global population together with the growing middle classes in a number of rapidly growing economies and changing dietary patterns to incorporate increased protein consumption.  Taken together these provide a great opportunity for increasing the exports of high quality, safe and sustainably produced Irish beef.</p>  <p>  As a member of the European Union, Ireland already has full market access to the 27 other EU Member States for beef and other commodities produced.  Therefore Ireland has ready market access to a population of over 500 million inhabitants, which indeed is one of the many benefits that comes with being a Member of the EU.  The majority of Irish beef exported is to other EU Member States.  According to Bord Bia, in 2015 some 52% of Irish beef exports went to the UK and 36% went to other EU markets.  Recent events in markets close to home have highlighted once again the importance of diversifying our international beef markets.  As an exporting country, accessing new markets is crucial to the long-term sustainability of our beef sector.</p>  <p>  The balance of our beef exports was to non EU markets including the USA, Middle East, Philippines, Hong Kong, Ghana and Switzerland amongst others.  These Third Country markets are increasingly an important alternative outlet for the industry.  My Department engages on an ongoing basis with many Third countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia, the meat industry, Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade and the European Commission on various market access issues.  My Department continues to push strongly for market access to other Third Countries.</p>  <p>  In 2015 Ireland had some notable successes including becoming the first EU Member State to gain beef access to the USA, having a BSE ban lifted by the Chinese authorities and negotiating an extension to our market access to the Philippines, where we are now the second largest supplier of beef.  More recently beef markets in Canada, Oman and the Maldives have also been opened.  Significantly our access to the US market was recently further extended to incorporate manufacturing beef, as a testament to our beef production and regulatory systems.  It is expected that similar extended beef access to Saudi Arabia will be achieved shortly.  We are currently in the process of trying to secure beef access to other third countries including, inter alia, China, South Korea, Israel, Ukraine and Vietnam.  It is my intention to continue to focus on developing as many third country markets as possible in order to provide exporters as many commercial opportunities as possible in a competitive global marketplace.</p></reply>

Current FAO estimates are that growth in world consumption of fish will require an extra 40 million tonnes of seafood by 2030.  Ireland can capture a significant share of this global seafood opportunity with the right strategy and supporting investment.</p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 recognised this opportunity for the growth of our seafood industry and set out a strategy to realise that growth potential by focussing on the key areas of sustainability, added value, processing scale, human capital, increasing raw material supply and developing our markets.</p>  <p>  In January this year, Ireland&rsquo;s new &euro;240 million development programme for our seafood sector was launched.  The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme will be the primary tool to address the 6 key areas identified in FoodWise.  I was delighted to announce in June the first tranche of &euro;4.3 million in grants to 51 aquaculture and seafood processing enterprises under the EMFF Programme.</p>  <p>  Under that Programme, I am making available &euro;30 million to kick-start growth in our aquaculture sector, which has been stagnant for too long.  In December, we published Ireland&rsquo;s first National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development, targeting growth in output of 45,000 tonnes by 2023, aided through 24 specified initiatives.  To complement those efforts, my Department is working to deliver up to 200 licence determinations this year and will initiate a review of aquaculture licensing procedures, as recommended in FoodWise.</p>  <p>  All of these efforts focusing on aquaculture, together with efforts to attract landings of fish by foreign vessels, will help increase the supply of raw material to our growing processing industry to convert to added value consumer foods, food ingredients and functional foods.  I will be making available &euro;33 million Government funding through the EMFF Programme to support the further development of our processing sector through enhanced scaling and value adding.  FoodWise recognises that we need to reduce the level of seafood product which is exported in commodity form from its present 70% level to below 50%.  Adding value to seafood products will make a huge difference to the economic activity and levels of employment in our coastal communities.</p>  <p>  These efforts are being supported through &euro;2 million investment in 2016 by Bord Bia in promoting Irish seafood internationally and assisting our producers to find and grow markets.  They are being supported by a commitment within the seafood sector to sustainability, with 32 Irish seafood companies fully verified as members of Origin Green, and a further 16 applications in the pipeline.  Between them, these companies will account for in excess of 80% of total seafood export values.</p>  <p>  In these many initiatives to implement the FoodWise strategy and in our financial commitment through the EMFF Programme, Government is clearly stepping up to the challenges and striving to grow our seafood industry.</p></reply>

I am conscious of the fact that prices have come under pressure over the last year and the difficulties that this is causing for producers.  Having said that, it must be noted that Irish prices have remained broadly in line with EU prices and I note there has been a slight increase recently, reflecting renewed market confidence in Europe and increased demand in China.  Recently, my Department distributed a &euro;1m direct aid package for pig farmers in Ireland.  This support originates from a package of measures proposed by the EU Commission in response to the significant price deterioration experienced by pig farmers in 2015, the impact of which has been exacerbated by the closure of the Russian market.  Under the aid package agreed at EU level in September of last year, &euro;0.5m was allocated for the pig sector for Ireland.  The Government subsequently matched this funding to provide an overall aid package of &euro;1m. </p>  <p>  At an EU level, I note that the European Commission has recently established a Meat Market Observatory to provide the EU meat sector with more transparency by means of disseminating market data and short-term analysis in a timely manner.  This is due to meet for the first time this week.  The tasks of the group are to take stock of market developments, and to highlight and assess the current market situation for the sake of economic operators and the Commission services, along the lines of the Milk Market Observatory. </p>  <p>  My Department also supports Bord Bia&rsquo;s marketing and promotional activities, and the Pigmeat Quality Assurance scheme helps to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and third country markets.  Bord Bia plans to use additional funds to run a targeted Pork promotional campaign this coming Autumn and further campaigns are planned to promote ham and bacon.  Teagasc is also actively engaged in the provision of technical advice to improve the operational efficiency of pig farmers.</p>  <p>  I have also included provision in the RDP for an on-farm capital investment scheme, TAMS II, with an overall budget of &euro;395 million across all sectors, with &euro;35.8 million allocated for 2016.</p>  <p>  Amongst the areas identified for initial funding are investments on pig farms for energy, water meters and medicine dispensers.  Other elements of the RDP, such as targeted on farm animal health and welfare scheme will also be of benefit to the pig sector.</p>  <p>  Finally, I am committed to ensuring that as many alternative markets as possible are open to the Irish Pigmeat sector. In that regard I will continue to prioritise the opening of new markets such as Vietnam and the Philippines, which serve as valuable alternative markets to Russia for Irish pigmeat exports.  Indeed I will be leading a trade mission to Vietnam and China during the first week in September during which I will be prioritising the promotion of pigmeat in two of our main export markets.</p></reply>

Due to its reputation and significant global footprint, the dairy sector in Ireland retains significant future growth potential.  Last year, Irish dairy products were exported to approaching 130 countries.</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the need to develop as many market outlets as possible for Irish dairy products.  Notwithstanding our successful trade performance, I continue to work with industry to raise the profile of the Irish dairy sector, and the Irish agri-food sector generally, in emerging markets in the Far East, North Africa, the Gulf States and elsewhere.  China is an obvious destination for certain dairy products and in particular for dairy based infant formula and I intend to lead a trade mission there in the Autumn.  My Department, along with Bord Bia, is working very closely with the industry to build on our presence in all of the aforementioned locations.  I am acutely aware of the need to continuously develop relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build upon the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in the future.</p>  <p>  Whilst we are currently experiencing a period of prolonged volatility, most market analysts predict that medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good, with growth in world population and wealth expected to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products.

Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region.  This is where our efforts will be focused for the foreseeable future, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK.  Indeed this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agri-food sector in particular.   </p>  <p>  In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025, I intend to lead a Trade Mission that will visit Vietnam, Singapore and China in early September.  My Department is currently working with Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland to finalise the arrangements for this mission, which will include participants from across the agri-food sector and will feature extensive trade contacts as well as political discussions with my counterparts in the host countries. </p>  <p>  I am also considering a range of other destinations for later in 2016 and for 2017, although no decision has yet been made in terms of content or timing.  Again, markets in Asia, Africa and the Gulf Region are likely to feature prominently in these considerations, and I am of course ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise.</p></reply>

Agri food exports account for 7% of GDP and continue to grow year on year.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation and new EU food information regulations which were adopted by the Council of Health Ministers in December 2011.  However, my Department plays an important role in the enforcement of this legislation under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  Currently my Department is assisting our colleagues in the Department of Health on the drafting of a new Statutory Instrument to bring the labelling of loose pigmeat and poultry into line with the origin labelling rules for packaged meat brought in on April the first 2015.  This will require businesses who sell meat loose in their premises to clearly identify the country of rearing and slaughter of the animal from which the meat is derived.  Once the SI has been finalised my Department will arrange for it to be put on the Technical Regulation Information System for notification to all EU Member States and following on from the obligatory three month stand still period I am confident that the Minister for Health will be in a position to sign the SI, bringing it into force.</p><p>Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators.  The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement.  This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place.  These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b></b>Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied. In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have systems to identify any person who supplies the business with a food, and a system to identify other businesses to which their product has been supplied.  This is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system.  There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail.</p><p>My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants.  Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment.  An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks for product originating in EU Member States and third countries.  Labelling and documentary checks are routinely conducted by the Department.</p><p>The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formally the FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards.  The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States. Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department.  Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the Directorate to ensure compliance. Inspection finding reports are published on the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) is the statutory body with primary responsibility for the development of the bloodstock industry.  HRI has ambitious plans for the development of this sect or which are outlined in its draft strategic plan.  The HRI strategic plan 2016 - 2019 was presented to my Department last year.</p>  <p>  The plan demonstrates that the industry can provide a significant return on investment to the State in terms of employment (particularly in rural Ireland), wealth-creation and the development of a sustainable industry, which will continue to play a significant role in Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  In addition to economic benefits, it will add to the social capital of communities throughout the country, as it has done for generations.</p>  <p>  The overriding objective of HRI&rsquo;s strategic plan however is that by 2020 the industry will be delivering an economic return to the Irish economy significantly beyond the existing levels (current return to the economy is &euro;1.1Billion). </p>  <p>  My Department will work closely with HRI in its implementation and will provide whatever support and encouragement that can be made available in this regard.</p></reply>

Current FAO estimates are that growth in world consumption of fish will require an extra 40 million tonnes of seafood by 2030.  Ireland can capture a significant share of this global seafood opportunity with the right strategy and supporting investment.  FoodWise 2025 recognised this opportunity for the growth of our seafood industry and set out a strategy to realise that growth potential by focussing on the key areas of sustainability, added value, processing scale, human capital, increasing raw material supply and developing our markets.   </p>  <p>In January this year, a new &euro;240 million development programme for Ireland&rsquo;s seafood sector was launched - the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme.  That Programme will be the primary tool to address the 6 key areas identified in FoodWise.  I was delighted to announce in June the first tranche of &euro;4.3 million in grants to 51 aquaculture and seafood processing enterprises under the EMFF Programme. </p>  <p>  Under that Programme, I am making available &euro;30 million to kick-start growth in our aquaculture sector, which has been stagnant for too long.  In December, we published Ireland&rsquo;s first National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development, targeting growth in output of 45,000 tonnes by 2023, aided through 24 specified initiatives.  To complement those efforts, my Department is working to deliver up to 200 licence determinations this year and will initiate a review of aquaculture licensing procedures, as recommended in FoodWise.</p>  <p>  All of these efforts focusing on aquaculture, together with efforts to attract landings of fish by foreign vessels, will help increase the supply of raw material to our growing processing industry to convert to added value consumer foods, food ingredients and functional foods.  I will be making available &euro;33 million Government funding through the EMFF Programme to support the further development of our processing sector through enhanced scaling and value adding.  FoodWise recognises that we need to reduce the level of seafood product which is exported in commodity form from its present 70% level to below 50%.  Adding value to seafood products will make a huge difference to the economic activity and levels of employment in our coastal communities.   </p>  <p>  These efforts are being supported through &euro;2 million investment in 2016 by Bord Bia in promoting Irish seafood internationally and assisting our producers to find and grow markets.  They are being supported by a commitment within the seafood sector to sustainability, with 32 Irish seafood companies fully verified as members of Origin Green, and a further 16 applications in the pipeline.  Between them, these companies will account for in excess of 80% of total seafood export values. </p>  <p>  In these many initiatives to implement the FoodWise strategy and in our financial commitment through the EMFF Programme, Government is clearly stepping up to the challenges and striving to grow our seafood industry.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-13a.597.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071300091#WRY02800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 238 and 255 together.</p>  <p>  I will continue to do everything possible to secure a positive outcome for the agri-food sector from the ongoing negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. </p>  <p>  A TTIP deal is of significant importance for Ireland.  The US is one of our leading trading partners, and we have a large and growing agri-food trade surplus with them (exports of &euro;869m last year, compared to imports of &euro;271m).  The drinks industry currently accounts for over 60% of the value of exports. </p>  <p>  Ireland has significant offensive interests in the TTIP negotiations.  For example, we see worthwhile opportunities in the US for cheese, powdered milks and sports products, and further opportunities for branded packaged butter, if we can remove some regulatory barriers.  Prepared consumer foods and fish could also benefit from trade liberalisation.</p>  <p>  Beef is a unique sector in that we have both offensive and defensive interests.  In the long term, any significant increase in beef imports to the EU could have adverse effects on the Irish industry.  That was confirmed by a number of recent studies and is an issue we have raised strongly with the European Commission.  We therefore have legitimate concerns about the size, composition and administration of any beef quota offered to the US. </p>  <p>  We should also seek a significant EU quota for beef to the US as part of any TTIP agreement.  Following the re-opening of the market, Irish beef exports now fall under a 65,000-tonne quota for &lsquo;other countries&rsquo; on a first come, first served basis.  This is mainly filled by Latin American countries.  Now that we have access for manufacturing beef we would stand to benefit greatly from a specific EU import quota in the US, and this can only be achieved through TTIP. </p>  <p>  A number of key issues in these negotiations arise in relation to hormone treated beef, food standards, GMOs and Geographical indicators.  All of these arose in the Canadian negotiations and were resolved, and should also be capable of being resolved in TTIP. </p>  <p>  It is important to ensure that the principle of equivalence will continue to apply, so that even where food production processes in the EU and US are not identical, they will provide equivalent guarantees regarding the standards of production.  This principle is already enshrined under the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Agriculture, and is also recognised by both sides as the basis for a TTIP agreement.  </p>  <p>  Equally, it is important that both the EU and United States retain the policy space to restrict certain practices and processes on social and ethical grounds and this is also recognised, in principle, by both sides.  For example, the EU Commission has made it clear that it will not allow the importation of hormone treated meat into the EU and this is well understood by the US side.</p>  <p>  Thirteen rounds of negotiations have taken place to date, with the latest taking place in New York at the end of April.  Overall it has been described as a good round, with detailed discussions on all topics, aimed at developing consolidated texts.  The ambition is to see the negotiations finalised this year, but this may not be possible given the pace of negotiations to date, the amount of issues still unresolved, and external factors such as the US Presidential election campaign and the ratification by Congress of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.  The European Commission is also continuing to press for more effective engagement from the US on non-tariff barriers - including sanitary and phytosanitary measures-in the interests of securing a balanced overall deal. </p>  <p>  The fourteenth round takes place this week in Brussels, and I hope that further progress can be made in the interests of achieving a timely conclusion.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-13a.600.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071300091#WRY03100"><p>The decision of the UK to leave the EU is one that creates considerable challenges for the agri-food sector.  The UK is by far our largest trading partner. Last year we exported almost &euro;5.1 billion worth of agricultural products.  This included more than &euro;1.1 billion in beef products and almost &euro;970 million in dairy products. Ireland is also the UK&rsquo;s largest destination for its food exports - worth &euro;3.8 billion last year.  This bilateral trade takes place on the basis of harmonised EU rules on animal and public health and labelling, without complex certification, quota limits or customs duties and tariffs.  And it is underpinned by the vital support of the CAP budget, to which the UK is a significant net contributor. </p>  <p>  Given these linkages, and as the UK is a net food importer, both countries have a strong interest in maintaining a close agri-food trading relationship.  In addition, the resilience of the Irish agri-food sector is well recognised, and this, together with the strong commercial relationships built up over years of trading, will help us to negotiate our way though the challenges ahead. </p>  <p>  It is important also to bear in mind that the precise implications of the referendum outcome will depend on the trade and other arrangements ultimately negotiated between the EU and the UK.  These negotiations may take up to two years, and perhaps longer, and over that period existing arrangements will continue to apply. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department has engaged in detailed contingency planning for the possibility of this result, and has published a summary of the key actions we are taking to address the contingencies arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision. </p>  <p>The most immediate concerns for exporters centre on Euro-Sterling exchange rates.  It should be noted that the fall in the value of Sterling against the Euro, while significant, is not unprecedented.  Nevertheless, a sustained period of currency volatility could be of concern.  In that regard, the Central Bank of Ireland has pre-established contingency plans to deal with market volatility surrounding the referendum result.  The Bank will engage with the Department of Finance and individual financial institutions regarding potential risks.   Actions by ECB and other global actors will be monitored closely. </p>  <p>I have also asked the relevant agencies, including Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland, to provide practical guidance to SMEs.  Last week Bord Bia announced a number of measures to support food and drink businesses.  These measures cover areas such as managing volatility impacts, providing consumer and market insight, deepening customer engagement and extending market reach, with the aim of helping companies maintain their competitiveness.  Similar support is also being provided by Enterprise Ireland.   </p>  <p>  Aside from currency fluctuations, the main areas in which potential impacts are foreseen are in relation to tariffs and trade, the EU budget, regulations and standards, and customs controls and certification, while complex issues also arise for the fisheries sector. </p>  <p>  However, we must remember that our trading relationship with the UK is not altered in any way until the negotiation process that will dictate the terms and conditions of the UK&rsquo;s departure is completed.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime, and as part of our overall contingency planning, I have taken a number of measures to ensure a sensible, coherent approach is adopted, namely:</p>  <p>  - I have established a dedicated unit in my Department to work on all of the issues that I have mentioned;</p>  <p>  - I have convened a Consultative Committee of stakeholders, which met for the first time last week, to ensure a full exchange of information as the negotiations proceed;</p>  <p>  - I am also ensuring that the response of the relevant agencies is fully coordinated through a contact group established under the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee, and The Department will continue to feed into the central Contingency Framework being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p></reply>

Stakeholders regularly present to the committee meetings on their priorities for particular sectors or themes and by the end of this year, the HLIC will have reviewed in detail progress on the five cross-cutting themes and the twelve individual sectors outlined in Food Wise 2025.  So it is very much a live and continuously updated process.  For example, the HLIC convened, following the UK vote to leave the EU, to agree on a coordinated approach for the agrifood sector.</p><p>I launched a first year progress report on Food Wise 2025 entitled &lsquo;Steps to Success 2016&rsquo; earlier today.  Of the 330 detailed actions which were due to commence in 2015 or 2016, 28% have been achieved or substantial action has been undertaken; and a further 67% have commenced and are progressing well.  A detailed report on the status of Food Wise 2025 actions is available on my Department&rsquo;s website together with the first year progress report.</p><p>As a small open economy which exports the vast bulk of its main agricultural commodities, Ireland will always feel the effects of volatility on world markets.  However, there are measures in place to help Irish farmers through these periods.  I believe that moving up the value chain where possible, in terms of the type of products sold and how they are produced, is an important insulation against volatility.  The Food Wise strategy for the sector contains detailed recommendations aimed at improving value added and productivity at farm and food industry level through a focus on sustainability, efficiency, knowledge transfer and innovation.</p><p>I recently met with the CEOs of the main banks and stressed the need for them to be flexible in the context of increased income volatility.  The banks told me that they recognise and are responding to the challenges facing farmers in this regard.  They all offer options such as moving loans to interest-only repayments and extending overdraft facilities.  They all stated that they are committed to the sector for the long term and are aware its cyclical nature.  I also took the opportunity to question the banks on the relatively high interest rates for SMEs in Ireland compared with those across Europe.</p><p>Partly in response to these relatively high interest rates, my Department has just published a request for tender to procure an ex-ante assessment to assess any current failures in the access to finance market in Ireland.  This is a first step towards the potential introduction of Financial Instruments under the EAFRD Rural Development Programme and the EMFF Seafood Development Operational Programme.</p><p>Access to finance was discussed at the Dairy Forum in June, with an exchange of views with the main banks now a part of the agenda at each meeting.  Before the meeting I formally launched the Dairy Forum&rsquo;s &rsquo;Financial Management Initiative&rsquo;, a programme of cash flow and financial management training and advice for dairy farmers, which is an appropriate and practical initiative at this time. </p><p>Access to finance was also discussed at last month&rsquo;s meeting of the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee, which heard from representatives of the SBCI and the Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF).  Both are now active in the market.  In its last report in January, the SBCI stated that of the 4,619 loans amounting to &euro;172 million drawn down by SMEs, 26% had been accessed by agriculture, which is currently its largest sector.</p><p>My Department will continue to engage with the Department of Finance on key agri-taxation policy objectives, including responses to income and price volatility. </p><p>While there are no specific risk management tools included in the Rural Development Programme, risk management is one of the topics <font color="#0A0A0A">covered by Knowledge Transfer Groups</font>.  An<font color="#0A0A0A">imal disease risks are covered by the Targeted Animal Health and Welfare Advisory measure.</font></p><p>Fixed price contracts are increasingly becoming a feature of the producer/processor relationship in the dairy sector, with numerous milk purchasers offering such contracts, which provide producers with the opportunity to lock in prices over the medium term, taking costs of production into account.  Such relationships are a welcome development in terms of their potential to mitigate volatility.</p></reply>

I am guided in this context by the long-term sectorial development strategies as set out in Food Wise 2025 and I am confident that these initiatives, in conjunction with the Rural Development Programme, will lead to continued growth in terms of profitability and efficiency of the sector as whole.  The primary determinant of prices in any market is the relationship between supply and demand.  As with any Minister for Agriculture in the EU, I can have no role in beef prices in Ireland.</p><p>It is a clear objective of mine to ensure that this sector continues to receive the necessary support to address the challenge of profitability within the sector.  In addition to the Basic Payment Scheme, a range of measures introduced under the Rural Development Programme helps to improve efficiency and profitability on farm and to support environmentally sustainable production.  This includes programmes such as TAMS, GLAS, Knowledge Transfer Groups and of course the Beef Data and Genomics Programme. </p><p>The Beef Data and Genomics Programme, or BDGP, has an allocation of &euro;300 million and aims to address the widely acknowledged weaknesses in the maternal genetics of the suckler herd in Ireland, reduce the Greenhouse Gas intensity of Irish beef production and most importantly to make a positive contribution to the future viability of suckler farmers.</p><p>Furthermore, in May I launched the Knowledge Transfer Group Scheme which has been allocated &euro;100 million from the Rural Development Fund for the roll-out of Knowledge Transfer Groups across a range of enterprises, including beef and suckler farmers.  Farmers participating in such groups will receive a payment of &euro;750 per annum.</p><p>As an exporting country, accessing new markets is crucial to the long-term sustainability of our beef sector.<i></i>In 2015 Ireland exported an estimated &euro;2.2 billion, or approximately 500,000 tonnes of beef, to almost 80 countries around the globe and my role as Minister is to facilitate market access and to enable Irish exporters to take advantage of the opportunities that arise.  I was delighted to announce last week the decision of the US authorities to extend their approval for Irish beef to include manufacturing beef/beef intended for grinding (BIFG).  This marks the culmination of over a year of intensive work between my Department and its US counterparts on a range of technical matters to extend access to manufacturing beef/ BIFG.  We are currently in the process of trying to secure beef access to other third countries including, inter alia, China, South Korea, Israel, Ukraine and Vietnam.  It is my intention to continue to focus on developing as many third country markets as possible in order to provide exporters as many commercial opportunities as possible in a competitive global marketplace.</p></reply>

My commitment to this sector is underlined in the Food Wise 2025 report for the industry.  This action plan for the Agrifood sector contains over 400 recommendations and identifies many areas for growth in the tillage sector, particularly in the very important and successful distilling and craft brewing industries.  The report also identifies growth opportunities for expanded production of native malt, high-end health foods and value-added niche foods and ingredients.</p><p>In order to increase the availability of native grown protein crops for inclusion in animal feeds, I introduced a protein aid scheme in 2015, as part of the implementation of the reformed CAP package in Ireland.  &euro;3 million was set aside annually for this scheme and the rate of payment has been increased to &euro;280/ha.</p><p>The Basic Payment and Greening Scheme which is operational since 2015 contains provisions supportive of the tillage sector, notably with regard to crop diversification provisions and requirements for Ecological Focus Areas. </p><p>The Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 contains measures to support the establishment of Knowledge Transfer Groups across the main farming sectors.

A prolonged period of volatility in dairy markets has been in evidence in recent times.  However it is important to remember that the medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good.  How we mitigate the current volatility is the challenge.  Volatility in dairy markets is a global problem, an EU problem and an Irish problem for which there is no single silver bullet.  Fixed price and margin contracts, futures markets and access to increasingly flexible forms of credits are all part of the toolkit that will be required.  In this respect we must continue to work with industry and the financial services sector at a national level to ensure resilience is built into the sector in the current period of volatility and going forward, strengthening our position within the global market.</p><p><i></i>Voluntary supply reduction is one option that has been advocated at EU level by some but I am of the view that this would certainly not be in the best interest of the Irish dairy sector.  Regulating supply in times of price downturns is not an appropriate response because measures taken only within the EU will disadvantage EU farmers and co-ops, will undermine efficient production and will adversely affect the ability of farmers to benefit when the market turns in their favour.  It would be a backward step to consider such measures now<i>.  </i>This is also the shared view of the vast majority of the participants at the most recent meeting of the Dairy Forum on 21 June last where we discussed this issue in some detail.  I do not believe that there is demand from the co-operative sector in Ireland for a supply control measure. </p><p>I am anxious that we must focus on other support measures that can play a role in supporting the sector and it is vital that we continue to work closely with the Commission and all other key stakeholders in this regard.  Having discussed issues with national stakeholders, I am currently working with Commissioner Hogan and other EU Ministers with a view to finding pragmatic, realistic and workable solutions to these ongoing difficulties.</p><p>I believe our focus must remain on providing real, practical and immediate assistance for farmers.  In addition to intervention, I have called for the deployment of other measures that will provide real benefit for farmers in the short-term in particular, the bringing forward of the delivery date for direct payments.  Such a measure will be of immediate assistance to farmers in acting as a source of immediate cash flow and a buffer to ongoing volatility. </p><p>I have also asked the Commissioner to consider the deployment of a targeted aid package, similar to that provided last September.  The September package gave considerable flexibility to Member States to adopt responses suited to their national circumstances, and I believe such a measure, with appropriate flexibility could play a further important role in 2016.</p><p>A number of other market support measures have been put in place at EU level, including an increase in the ceiling for SMP intervention to 350,000 tonnes, which was sought by Ireland.  In terms of input costs at farm level, I have called on the Commission to consider looking at temporary suspension of EU import tariffs on fertilisers to reduce input costs for Irish and EU farmers.</p></reply>

Dairy exports in 2015 were valued at over &euro;3.2 billion and the dairy sector is by a number of measures the country&rsquo;s largest indigenous industry. 2015 was also a very successful year for meat exports. According to Bord Bia, overall exports of beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat and poultry increased by &euro;140 million to more than &euro;3.5 billion. Seafood exports also increased in 2015   and are now valued at a further &euro;560 million.</p>  <p>  The target in Food Wise 2025 is to increase the overall value of agrifood exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion by 2025. The Department continually monitors trade statistics produced by Bord Bia and the CSO, in order to analyse the destination of exports and, together with industry, to identify new market opportunities. Third Country markets are an increasingly important alternative outlet for the industry. The development of new and alternative markets, given the changing global demographics and emerging economies in Asia and elsewhere, is a crucial component of the Food Wise 2025 Strategy.  As an exporting country, accessing new markets is crucial to the long-term sustainability of our agri sector.</p>  <p>  In the medium and long term global demographics will result in strong global demand for meat and dairy products and my role as Minister is to facilitate market access so that Irish exporters can take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. Taken together these factors provide a great opportunity for increasing the exports of high quality, safe and sustainably produced Irish meat, dairy and fish production.</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the need to develop as many market outlets as possible for Irish meat, seafood and dairy products. I will continue to work with stakeholders to raise the profile of the Irish agri-food sector generally, in emerging markets in the Far East, North Africa, the Gulf States and elsewhere. In this context I intend to lead a Trade Mission to China, Vietnam and Singapore in September to further promote Irish food and drink in the region. My Department has also re-configured its network of agricultural attach&eacute;s abroad, with an enhanced role in relation in agri-food trade and Bord Bia is also presently expanding its network of offices abroad, with a focus on new and emerging markets. This will also enhance our identification of new markets abroad.</p></reply>

This imperative informed the approach to the negotiations in 2012 and 2013, and they continue to inform the process by which the various elements of CAP reform are now being delivered.</p>  <p>  Taking the direct payments system as an example, the Deputy may recall that my predecessor proposed an alternative approach to the redistribution of direct payments than that originally advocated by the European Commission, precisely because the direct payments system needed to be made fairer and more equitable while at the same time ensuring that the level of transfer of payments between farmers was not of a scale that might jeopardise our objectives for the development of the sector. </p>  <p>  We now have a system which satisfies these two requirements. Last year&rsquo;s payments under the Basic Payment and other schemes represented the start of a process that, by 2019, will see a considerable shift in the balance of payments from those previously receiving very high rates per hectare to those previously receiving much lower rates of payment. I believe that this not only makes the direct payments system fairer, but also ensures that it continues to provide support and income stability that will allow farmers to respond to the demands of the market. As such, it also provides a vital tool to help us achieve the objectives outlined in the Food Wise 2025 strategy.</p>  <p>  Significant steps have also been taken to encourage the participation of young farmers in agriculture, which is vital in terms of securing the critical role that farm families play in the development of the sector. In addition to receiving a top-up of direct payments, young farmers are also prioritised in the allocation of payment entitlements from the national reserve. These direct payments measures are further complemented by supports under the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme where, for example, enhanced support for capital investment by young farmers has been made available under the TAMS schemes. </p>  <p>  More generally under Pillar 2 of the CAP, I am focussed on the socio-economic development of our farms and of our rural areas so that all farm families have an opportunity to realise their potential. Schemes for improving sustainability (such as GLAS and the Beef Data and Genomics Programme) and competitiveness (such as TAMS) are complemented by continued strong support for disadvantaged areas (now known as Areas of Natural Constraint). I believe this combination provides a vital range of supports that will allow farm families to continue to benefit from the CAP in an equitable manner while supporting their development over the coming years.</p></reply>

Ireland ranks quite highly in global competitiveness tables, but is still considered to be less competitive than some of our main competitors on global agrifood export markets such as Netherlands and New Zealand, or Norway and Scotland for seafood products.  Exchange rate volatility and business costs, including transport, credit and financial services costs, as well as labour costs, are particularly important for the agrifood sector.</p>  <p>  Improving competitiveness is one of the cross-cutting themes of the Food Wise 2025 strategy, which includes detailed actions aimed at improving competitiveness at both the primary and processing levels. Investment in innovation and human capital will be key drivers of competitiveness in the sector, and will enable businesses to adapt to market conditions and adopt best practice in delivering food solutions in global markets.  The Food Wise High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC) engaged with the Chair of the National Competitiveness Council in April, for a useful discussion on the competitiveness challenges facing the sector. </p>  <p>  I launched a first year progress report on Food Wise 2025 entitled &lsquo;Steps to Success 2016&rsquo; today, along with a detailed report on progress to date on each of the actions in Food Wise. In relation to competitiveness, all of the specific recommendations for 2015 and/or 2016 have been commenced, and in some cases substantial action has been undertaken. My Department and its agencies are consulting closely with industry on planning to address possible trade implications and future issues following the UK referendum. I plan to lead trade missions with companies and the development agencies to diversify and deepen our international export markets and will be visiting China in September.</p></reply>

This legislation requires the proper identification of equine animals as well as the maintenance of traceability and ownership issues.</p>  <p>  The current rules regarding the identification of equidae are determined by Commission Regulation 262/2015, which has been effective since 1st January 2016, and which has been transposed into national legislation via S.I. 62 of 2016 (as amended).</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of Commission Regulation 262/2015, all equine animals are required to be identified with an equine passport by 12 months of age. Such passports must contain a unique identifying number (UELN) in respect of the animal, retained for the lifetime of the animal, and must also record details of the number of the transponder implanted into the neck of the equine by a veterinary practitioner, thus ensuring an unequivocal link between the identification document and the animal. Only those equines identified within the time limits set out in Regulation 262/2015 can be deemed to be eligible to be slaughtered for human consumption. The final decision as to whether an equine can be included in the food chain is determined by an official veterinarian from my Department, present at the factory at the time of slaughter, having examined the data contained in the identification document and on the central database and having undertaken a series of ante and post mortem examinations on the equine. </p>  <p>  Article 38(1) of the Regulation 262/2015 specifies the minimum data to be recorded on the central database of each Member State in respect of each equine identified and each record must be updated by approved Passport Issuing Organisations (PIOs) in that Member State. In addition, the database must be notified, again via an approved PIO, of all studbook equines identified by PIOs outside the country where such animals are ordinarily resident. Similarly, relevant information in respect of all equines introduced into the State must be notified to an appropriate approved PIO in the Member State into which the equine is introduced, for onward notification to the central database.</p>  <p>  In addition to this minimum equine identification data, the central database operated and maintained by my Department also records information in relation to Equine Premises Registration (PRN) and equine Transfer of Ownership details. The rules in these regards are determined by national legislation via S.I. No 8 of 2012 and S.I. 189 of 2014 (as amended) respectfully.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, national legislation provides that applications for an equine passport must indicate the premises registration number (PRN) of the holding at which the equine will be kept. Applications for PRNs are managed by the Regional Office network of my Department and the PRN of each keeper making an application for an equine passport in respect of an equine in his/her care is recorded on the central database. Similarly, information in relation to the current ownership of equines must be notified to an appropriate PIO for onward notification to the central database. Both of these measures facilitate the traceability of equines, as required.</p>  <p>  All equine keepers have responsibility for proper animal welfare under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013. The adoption of best animal husbandry practices is a matter for individual owners and keepers.</p></reply>

The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s), prior to awarding a contract(s). As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and / or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p></reply>

As shareholder, however, I have a strong concern in relation to the ongoing commercial position of the Company and therefore liaise with the Company in this regard. </p>  <p>  It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong, viable company in a position to provide a high quality postal service and maintain a national network of customer focused post offices in the community. The post office network plays an important role in serving the needs of business and domestic customers alike. However, the postal sector is undergoing systemic change, with migration towards electronic communications resulting in core mail volume decline year on year.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the changing commercial environment, my predecessor established the Post Office Network Business Development Group last year, the remit of which was to examine the potential from existing and new Government and commercial business that could be transacted through the post office network. Mr. Bobby Kerr was appointed as the independent chairman of the group and he brought a depth of knowledge and experience in identifying and developing business opportunities for the post office network.</p>  <p>  The final report of the group, which was published in January of this year, sets out 23 recommendations with network renewal, a basic payment account and motor tax being the three key actions. The final report recommended that An Post should, following appropriate consultation with postmasters and others, review and amend the five-year strategy for the post office network.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to acting on all of the recommendations of the final report.  Responsibility for implementation of the recommendations in the Final Report has transferred  to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural  and  Gaeltacht Affairs. In this regard experienced senior officials from my Department, who have knowledge of the Report and its recommendations, have moved to that Department to work on the implementation of the various recommendations.</p></reply>

The REFIT support schemes are underpinned by detailed economic analysis to ensure long-term certainty for investors and overall value for money for consumers.  The REFIT schemes assure a minimum price for each unit of electricity exported to the grid over a 15 year period and cover a range of different renewable energy technologies, including wind energy, biomass and hydro-generation.</p><p>REFIT forms a key part of the Public Service Obligation (PSO). The PSO levy is charged to all electricity customers in Ireland to support national policy objectives related to renewable energy, indigenous fuels (peat) and security of energy supply. The PSO levy is determined each year by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). Ireland&rsquo;s REFIT schemes have proved effective in attracting investment into the renewable energy sector. In addition, the REFIT schemes have been found to be a very cost effective tool to support renewables development, as indicated by a report published by the Council of European Energy Regulators in 2015. </p><p>Each year my Department publishes a list of renewable energy technologies to be supported and the associated tariff for each. The 2015-2016 list is outlined in the following table.<table><tr><th>Tariff per MW (&euro;)</th><th>2015/2016</th></tr><tr><td>REFIT 1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Large Wind (above 5MW)</td><td>69.72</td></tr><tr><td>Small wind (equal to or  less than 5MW</td><td>72.167</td></tr><tr><td>Hydro</td><td>88.068</td></tr><tr><td>Biomass Landfill Gas</td><td>85.622</td></tr><tr><td>Other Biomass</td><td>88.068</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>REFIT 2</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Large Wind (above 5MW)</td><td>69.72</td></tr><tr><td>Small Wind (equal to or less than 5MW</td><td>72.167</td></tr><tr><td>Hydro</td><td>88.068</td></tr><tr><td>Biomass Landfill Gas</td><td>85.622</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>REFIT 3</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Biomass Combustion</td><td>89.314</td></tr><tr><td>Biomass Combustion &ndash; Energy Crops</td><td>99.822</td></tr><tr><td>Large Biomass CHP (above 1,500 kW)</td><td>126.091</td></tr><tr><td>Small Biomass CHP (equal to or less than 1,500 kW)</td><td>147.106</td></tr><tr><td>Large Anaerobic Digestion (AD) Non CHP (above 500kW)</td><td>105.076</td></tr><tr><td>Small AD Non CHP (equal to or less than 500kW)</td><td>115.583</td></tr><tr><td>Large AD CHP (above 500kW)</td><td>136.598</td></tr><tr><td>Small AD CHP (equal to or less than 500kW)</td><td>157.613</td></tr></table></p><p>My Department is developing a new support scheme for renewable electricity and an initial consultation took place last year. In-depth economic analysis is now underway to inform the cost of any new scheme. Maintaining overall value for money for consumers, while reflecting the actual investment costs for renewable energy technologies is a key part of this work. Once the detailed economic analysis is complete, there will be a further public consultation on the design of the new scheme. The scheme, which will be subject to Government approval and State Aid clearance from the European Commission is expected to become available in 2017.</p></reply>

This is an increase of &euro;12.5m compared with 2015.  This funding is split between a number of programmes that are designed to encourage energy efficiency activity and assist householders living in energy poverty, along with grants for electric vehicles.  A brief summary of each of the energy efficiency programmes being funded in 2016 is provided below:</p>  <p>  - Better Energy Homes: This is the primary elective grant scheme available to homeowners.  Individual homeowners apply for grants that cover a range of energy efficiency improvements, from various types of insulation to heating controls and solar thermal technologies.  In 2015, grant levels were increased, a bonus payment was introduced for homeowners who undertake multiple measures and the minimum grant threshold was abolished.  I anticipate that between 14000 - 15000 homeowners will receive grant support under this programme in 2016.</p>  <p>  - Better Energy Warmer Homes: The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty.  In 2016 the eligibility criteria for the scheme have been broadened in line with Government policy on deprivation generally.  I expect nearly 9,000 homes to be upgraded under this scheme in 2016.</p>  <p>  - Better Energy Communities: The Better Energy Communities scheme aims to encourage community based partnerships to improve the efficiency of homes, community facilities and local businesses.  These partnerships can be between the public and private sectors, domestic and non-domestic sectors, commercial and not-for-profit organisations and energy suppliers.  Grants are awarded through an annual competitive evaluation process and must leverage considerable additional private investment.  I recently awarded &euro;20m in grants for this scheme in 2016.  These grants will support the upgrade of more than 2,600 homes and almost 300 community and commercial facilities.</p>  <p>  - Warmth &amp;amp; Wellbeing Pilot Scheme: This year I have also launched a new scheme to combat energy poverty called Warmth &amp;amp; Wellbeing.  Its objective is to better understand how we can improve health and wellbeing by making homes warmer and more energy efficient.  The scheme has been developed by my Department in close cooperation with the Department of Health and is being operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and the HSE.  &euro;20m has been ear-marked by my Department for the scheme in the period 2016 to 2018, of which &euro;4m will be spent this year.</p>  <p>  The funding available for energy efficiency also supports a number of smaller programmes.  The Sustainable Energy Communities scheme seeks to help communities build capacity to undertake energy projects, while the Better Energy Finance scheme supports a number of pilot initiatives to help determine how future energy efficiency support schemes should be structured.  Initiatives to encourage energy efficiency in the commercial and public sectors are also funded.</p></reply>

These policies deal with the established practice of controlling pike in waters that are designated as primary wild brown trout fisheries and where the principal predator, pike, is managed to optimise wild brown trout stocks for anglers.</p>  <p>  Following the appointment of an internal IFI Policy Review Group later this month, the review process will commence with a scoping consultation which will be open to all parties.  As part of the policy development process, fish stock management methodologies including gill netting and electrofishing will be carefully reviewed.  IFI will have regard to scientific advice and best practice internationally.  IFI is working to ensure the completion of this process in as consultative a way as possible which ensures that all interested parties can have input to policy formulation.  IFI hopes to receive the agreed views of angler stakeholder groups, domestic and tourist anglers, tourism providers and the general public.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the updated Pike and Trout policy documents will be available in July 2017.</p></reply>

On the 15th of April 2016 the US Department of Transportation published a tentative decision to grant Norwegian Air International the foreign air carrier permit required to operate the proposed Cork to Boston route.  A public consultation on this tentative decision was completed on the 23rd of May.  It is now a matter for the US authorities to decide whether to confirm that tentative decision or not.</p>  <p>  As detailed in my response to PQ 20673/16, I and my Department continue to liaise with the European Commission regarding the proposed Cork to Boston route by Norwegian Air International.  The Commission agrees that the 2&frac12; year delay by the US authorities in making a decision on NAI's permit application is not acceptable.  The next step in resolving the issue would be for the Commission to initiate a formal arbitration under Article 19 of the Open Skies Agreement between the European Union and the United States of America.  It is hoped that by granting the permit there will be no need to take this step.  However, I am confident that the Commission, if necessary, will take the appropriate action under the Agreement to help resolve this dispute.  I look forward to a decision being confirmed by the US Department of Transportation as soon as possible so that Norwegian Air International can start operating the new route from Cork to Boston and other new transatlantic routes.</p></reply>

Pedal-powered rickshaws come within the definition of 'pedal cycles' and powered rickshaws are classified as 'mechanically propelled vehicles'.  They, like all other road traffic, are obliged to obey road traffic law.  The measures which were introduced last year to allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to issue fixed charge notices to cyclists also apply to pedal powered rickshaws and provide an important tool for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in enforcing the law.</p>  <p>  ​I understand that in response to some concerns, primarily of a safety nature, discussions have taken place between Dublin City Council and the National Transport Authority on the question of the regulation of rickshaws and that the NTA has indicated that a formal proposal is to be made to the Department shortly arising from those discussions.</p>  <p>  Consideration of the issues relating to the regulation of rickshaws will take place following receipt of this proposal.</p></reply>

Any complaints regarding compliance with the scheme should be addressed to that Department.  The Minister for Social Protection has already announced that he is considering replacing JobBridge with a more targeted scheme later this year, as he believes that economic and labour market conditions have changed for the better since the scheme was introduced in 2011.  However, the Minister believes it is important that the design of a new scheme be informed by the best evidence possible.  It is for this reason that he intends to await the results of a second large scale evaluation of JobBridge currently underway.  The results of this evaluation, which is again being undertaken by Indecon, are expected in September and the Minister will announce his proposals for a new scheme shortly thereafter.</p></reply>

The Act is primarily concerned with aftercare &ndash; the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him or her in making the transition to independent living.  The legislation obliges Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, following an assessment of need, to prepare an aftercare plan identifying relevant aftercare supports for an eligible child or eligible young person.</p>  <p>  Prior to the drafting of the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2015, a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) was conducted in 2014 in order to consider the possible implications of the proposed legislative amendments across a range of categories, including potential additional exchequer costs. </p>  <p>  The Bill sought to place on a statutory footing the aftercare planning provision that already existed at that time with an accompanying expansion of the cohort to be supported.  Initial estimates of associated costs were considered to be minimal given that it was considered that the revised cohort would not in and of itself, present a significant additional expenditure requirement.  However, an additional cost element has since been identified and officials from Tusla and my Department are working in this regard to establish an appropriate quantum of costs, which will form part of the estimates negotiations.</p>  <p>  Further additional costs of a 17 year old cohort who may not reach the eligibility criteria has not been assessed as to change the eligibility criteria for this group would have implications for the entire cohort.  </p>  <p>  The thresholds applied have been carefully considered to maximise the impact on those most in need of support and to maintain a careful balance to avoid unwelcome and extended interaction of the State in the lives of children and families who no longer need the Child and Family Agency&rsquo;s support, and do not wish to have a reminder of past difficulties.</p></reply>

In relation to a child, who is aged 16 or over, who is in the care of the Child and Family Agency, following an assessment of need, the Agency shall prepare an aftercare plan setting out the assistance required to meet the needs identified in the assessment, upon the child reaching 18 years of age.
