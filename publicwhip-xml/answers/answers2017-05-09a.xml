Recognising this frustration, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the NBP State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and is available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg,  State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.</p>  <p>  Implementation of the actions identified by the Taskforce will allow the business opportunities and benefits that the growth in the digital economy is bringing to be felt across the entire country.  It will also assist in the creation of a digital infrastructure that can support this growth, and that can provide nationwide coverage with sufficient capacity to ensure that data can flow at the volume, speed and reliability required to meet the demands of modern life.  Implementation of these actions will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p>  <p>  In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I, together with Minister Humphreys, have established an Implementation Group.  This group is driving and monitoring the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions to both myself and Minister Humphreys.</p>  <p>  The first meeting of the Implementation Group took place on 8 March, and was followed by a series of bilateral meetings with action holders.  These discussions have formed the basis of the first quarterly progress report, which I together with Minister Humphreys expect to publish shortly.  This report will show that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017. </p>  <p>  The Implementation Group is also tasked with comprehensively reviewing progress made after twelve months, and producing an annual report summarising progress across all actions.  The Group is also mandated to recommend further actions that would result in an improved service for consumers. </p>  <p>  The benefits that the implementation of the actions in the Task Force report will bring will be felt across Ireland, including in the AMBER NBP Intervention Area.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-09a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050900059#WRB00300"><p>The Climate Change Advisory Council was established under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.  Under this legislation, the Advisory Council is an independent body whose key function is to provide advice and recommendations to me, to relevant sectoral Ministers and to the Government as a whole in relation to the development of national mitigation plans and national adaptation frameworks.  The Advisory Council is also tasked with advising on matters relating to the achievement of the Ireland&rsquo;s objective to transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and sustainable economy by 2050.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome the publication by the Advisory Council of its first report in November of last year. In this report, the Advisory Council very clearly articulates the scientific understanding underpinning of the nature of climate change, the resulting imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the policy implications this presents Ireland. In these respects, I would commend the report to every member in these Houses.  The Advisory Council also arrives at some initial conclusions in relation to the issues that the first National Mitigation Plan should consider both for individual sectors covered by the Plan as well as on a cross-sectoral basis. </p>  <p>  In order for the Advisory Council to meet its mandate under the 2015 legislation, I invited it, following my publication of the draft National Mitigation Plan, to engage directly with me and with other relevant Government Ministers with a view to providing my colleagues and me with its recommendations to feed into the preparation of the final Plan.  All input received from the Advisory Council is being considered in finalising the National Mitigation Plan which will go to Government for approval in early June.  I also understand that the Advisory Council intends to publish its first Periodic Report in July of this year and that this report will include the Council&rsquo;s overall response to the final National Mitigation Plan as published.</p>  <p>  In this regard, it is important to note that the Advisory Council is also required, under the 2015 legislation, to report annually on progress made during the previous year in achieving greenhouse gas emissions reductions and to make recommendations, as it considers necessary or appropriate, in relation to the most cost-effective manner of achieving reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in order to enable the achievement of the national transition objective.   </p></reply>

The aim of the RHI is to build on the progress already made in the renewable heating sector and to help reach Ireland&rsquo;s 12% target by 2020.  In 2015, 6.5% of heat was derived from renewable sources in Ireland.  </font></p><p><font color="#1D1B11">  The final public consultation on the design and implementation of the new RHI closed in March 2017, and all 119 submissions are currently being reviewed by my Department.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  </p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  </p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. </p><p>On the 4 April, I signed a commitment agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide broadband to an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.  Eir has committed to concluding this work over a 90 week period, an average of nearly 500 premises per day.  My Department will be monitoring this rollout to ensure that eir meets its obligations under the Agreement.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department's website.  On the same day I published  an updated High Speed Broadband Map which finalises the State Intervention area.  The updated Map shows the following categories of areas for delivery of broadband: </p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,  </p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.  </p><p>There are approximately 2.3m  premises covering Ireland&rsquo;s 26 counties, of which approximately 23% (542,000) premises are located in the AMBER area on the Map.  These premises will require State intervention and are the focus for the State Intervention procurement process.  The remaining 1.8m  premises are located in the BLUE areas and will be/are served by commercial operators.</p><p>The map shows that 100% of Oldtown Co Dublin falls within eir&rsquo;s plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and end 2018 (Light Blue on the Map).  Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at www.broadband.gov.ie. Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at  .</p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The finalisation of the State Intervention Area for the procurement process is an important milestone as it means that bidders can progress their business plans and the Department can move to the next stage of the procurement.The  three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second. </p><p>The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers. </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP once contracts are in place. </p><p>The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand and a prioritisation programme.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. </p><p>In this regard, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task Force in July 2016 together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and is available on my Department's website.  In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers. </p><p>The work of the Task Force is being led by an Implementation Group.  This group brings together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery of actions.  This group will formally report every 90 days on progress made on all actions to both myself and Minister Humphreys. I am expecting the first such quarterly report shortly.</p><p>In addition, I have signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with a 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band.  This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. </p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.  </p><p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland. </p><p>There is no universal service obligation (USO) for high speed broadband provision or mobile voice services in Ireland.  The current EU and national regulatory framework for telecommunications relates solely to voice telephony and Functional Internet Access (28.8 kilobits per second) and is provided for under the current EU regulatory framework governing telecoms.  In September 2016, the European Commission published an ambitious proposal for the regulation of the European telecoms sector, which aims to incentivise and encourage increased investment in high speed broadband networks.  I have raised the issue of a USO for high speed broadband at EU level and I am seeking inclusion of a specific provision in the new framework that would allow Member States to apply a USO for high speed broadband, where such networks are available.  </p></reply>

The projections indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy not covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020, a deteriorating position in respect of the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s targets for 2020 when compared with previous projections.  Though not unexpected, given the welcome return to economic growth in Ireland, it nevertheless confirms that Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse emissions continue to track broader trends in the economy and serves to underline the difficult decisions ahead of us as we try to reduce emissions in line with our international commitments.</p>  <p>  In relation to the targets for 2020, Ireland has an emissions reduction target for each year between 2013 and 2020 under the 2009 EU Effort Sharing Decision.  For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their level in 2005.  This will be Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the overall EU objective to reduce its emissions by the order of 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.  Ireland&rsquo;s target is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated to EU Member States under this Decision, which is shared only with Denmark and Luxembourg.  </p>  <p>  The projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself.  In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was misinformed and not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis. </p>  <p>  In order to maximise Ireland's emissions reductions and address the gap to the 2020 target, it will also be necessary to pursue other available options, in addition to the introduction of further policies and measures planned through the National Mitigation Plan. </p>  <p>  The legislative framework governing the EU&rsquo;s 2020 emissions reductions targets includes a number of flexibility mechanisms to enable Member States to meet their annual emissions targets, including provisions to bank any excess allowances to future years and to trade allowances between Member States.  Ireland expects to make use of both of these mechanisms in meeting our compliance obligations.  In relation to likely costs that Ireland will incur, this would arise in the context of a possible requirement to purchase additional allowances to meet our annual compliance requirements.  At this stage, it is not possible to accurately quantify the potential cost of such purchases as this will depend on both the volume of purchases required and the price of allowances to be purchased. </p>  <p>  In relation to 2030, I do not accept the contention in Deputy Martin's Question in relation to the scale of costs related to failure to meet Ireland&rsquo;s 2030 targets as these targets have not yet been agreed.  I would, however, note that while the scale of investment required in order to help Ireland meet these targets will be significantly in excess of current levels of expenditure, such productive investment in our economy will contribute to sustainable economic growth and job creation over the next decade and beyond. </p></reply>

In the transport sector, Ireland aims to meet its renewable target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles (EVs) also making a small contribution.  At end 2015, 5.7% of our energy needs in the transport sector were met from renewable sources.</p>  <p>  The Electric Vehicles Grant Scheme provides grant aid of up to &euro;5,000 towards the purchase of a new full battery EV (BEV) or Plugin Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV).  The scheme, which will be kept under review, is continuing this year and an allocation of &euro;5 million has been provided in my Department&rsquo;s Vote for this purpose.  These grants are in addition to the VRT reliefs of up to &euro;5,000 that also apply to EVs.  Budget 2017 extended VRT reliefs on PHEVs to end 2018 and on BEVs to end 2021. </p>  <p>  Increasing numbers of EVs have been registered in Ireland.  Since the introduction of the EV Grant Scheme in 2011, the purchase of 2,060 electric vehicles has been supported to date under the scheme to the value of almost &euro;9.7 million.  Almost 75% of the vehicles supported received grant aid since 2015.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government, my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport are co-chairing a Low Emission Vehicles (LEV) Task Force involving relevant Government Departments and agencies. The work of this Task Force has been divided into two phases with the first phase focusing solely on EVs.  The topics being examined include the potential for market growth of EVs and policy levers to stimulate this growth.  Options under consideration include tax incentives, access to restricted areas and preferential rates for tolls and parking.  Having considered the available options, the Task Force expects to report on an interim basis to Government on the first phase shortly with associated recommendations for decision. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated. </p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  </p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second. The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. </p><p>In accordance with procedures set out by my Department in December 2015, in late 2016 my Department initiated a review of an eir proposal to rollout fibre to over 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.  These premises were in areas that had formed part of the procurement process for the NBP State Intervention area.  This analysis is complete and on 4 April, I signed a commitment agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide broadband to an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.  Eir has committed to completing the rollout over a 90 week period, an average of 500 premises passed per day.  In line with the published Agreement there are regular Review Meetings the purpose of which is to monitor this rollout and ensure that eir meets its obligations under the Agreement.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website . </p><p>Quarterly updates will be published on the Departments website.  The Q1 2017 update will be published in May and I am pleased to announce that the eir rollout is in line with the Commitment Agreement.  My Department has informed me that in the period from 1 January to end March 2017 30,064 premises have been passed.  This brings to 40,114 the total subset of the 300k premises that eir has passed since they commenced work in late 2016.  </p><p>Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at <i>.</i></p></reply>

A well balanced fuel mix that provides reliable and sustainable energy, minimises costs and protects against supply disruptions and price volatility, is essential to Irish consumers and businesses.   </p>  <p>  The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive sets Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.  Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter target also being legally binding. </p>  <p>  Data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) shows that 25.3% of electricity, 6.5% of heat and 5.7% of transport energy requirements were met from renewable sources at end 2015.  Overall, SEAI analysis shows that 9.1% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements in 2015 were met by renewable energy.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy and although good progress towards the target has been made to date, meeting the 16% target remains challenging.  The REFIT schemes underpin the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies.  In addition, my Department is working on the development of a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme and a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) Scheme, designed to assist in meeting our RES-E and RES-H targets.  The introduction of any new scheme - including the overall costs and technologies to be supported - will be subject to Government approval and State Aid clearance from the European Commission. </p>  <p>  In the transport sector, Ireland aims to meet its renewable target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a small contribution.  The Biofuel Obligation Scheme (BOS) was increased from 6% to 8% by volume from 1 January 2017.  A public consultation on future increases to the BOS, required to meet the 2020 renewable transport target will take place later this year. </p>  <p>  The 2014 National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, which is underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, provides the high-level policy direction for the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050.  The development of sectoral mitigation measures for the electricity generation, built environment, transport and agriculture sectors to be set out in a National Mitigation Plan (NMP) is nearing finalisation.  The primary objective of the first NMP will be to monitor measures already underway and identify potential additional measures that, in the medium to longer term, will reduce GHG emissions.  This will assist Ireland to achieve our national transition objective to become a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050.  The NMP will be submitted to Government for approval in June.</p></reply>

A fundamental review of An Post, including the post office network, which will identify the strategic changes and restructuring necessary to maintain the company on a sound financial footing is ongoing.  Regarding the provision of new services in post offices, there are opportunities to develop new or enhanced product lines for the network including the concept of 'digital assist' whereby the Post Office would become a default option for the provision of Government services for those who are not comfortable in the digital space.  These opportunities will be assessed by An Post in the context of the current strategic review.</p>  <p>  On foot of a reconfiguration of Government Departments in July last year, responsibility for the post office network transferred to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  That Department published the Final Report of the Post Office Hub Working Group in March in which it was outlined that they are pursing the possible opportunities for services such as community banking and motor tax renewal for the network.

The Plan is being prepared on a whole-of-Government basis reflecting in particular the central roles of key Ministers responsible for the Electricity Generation, Built Environment, Transport and Agriculture, Forest and Land Use sectors. </p>  <p>  A public consultation on the Plan closed on 26 April 2017.  Submissions received through this consultation are currently being examined by my Department as well as by the Departments with responsibility for the key sectors listed above and each submission will be given due consideration in the finalisation in the Plan. </p>  <p>I also recognise the need to engage wider society more generally with the climate challenge, motivate changes in behaviour, and create structures at local, regional and national levels to support the generation of ideas and their translation into appropriate cost-effective actions.  To progress this, I recently announced a National Dialogue on Climate Action to provide for an inclusive process of engagement and consensus building across society towards enabling the transformation to a low carbon and climate-resilient future.    </p>  <p>  It must also be recognised that the first Plan is a work in progress reflecting the reality of where we are in our decarbonisation transition having regard to a number of factors including curtailed public and private investment over the course of recent years.  The first Plan cannot, therefore, provide a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050 but it will begin the process of development of medium to long term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. </p>  <p>  This will be an ongoing process aimed at incremental and permanent decarbonisation.  The Plan will become a living document: it will be made accessible on my Department's website; will be subject to annual progress reports; and will be updated on an on-going basis as analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate further cost-effective sectorial mitigation options.  Recognising that funding climate action to the required level presents an enormous challenge for Ireland, a key part of this process will be to evaluate exchequer and non-exchequer options for financing Ireland's transition.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the translation of the draft Plan, my Department is fully aware of its responsibilities under the Official Languages Act and every effort has been made to ensure that an Irish version of the draft Plan can be made available as soon as possible.  My Department is currently undertaking final proofing of the Irish language text of the draft Plan and I will publish this version on my Department's website as soon as possible.  I also intend that an Irish language version of the final Plan be made available following its approval by Government.</p></reply>

The 2014 Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP) sets out Government policy in relation to the sustainable development of this resource.   The Plan identifies policy actions and enablers that are key to the development of this sector.   Progress on these policy actions and enablers is on-going under the aegis of the Offshore Renewable Energy Steering Group (ORESG).  The ORESG, which includes representation from all relevant Government Departments and agencies, is responsible for the implementation of the Plan across three work-streams: Job Creation; Infrastructure; and Environment.  A Working Group for each stream was established with a view to ensuring that offshore renewable energy is developed in line with EU environmental obligations and best practice and significant progress is being made on a number of fronts.</p>  <p>  Work items progressed in 2016, and continuing into 2017, include the creation of an inventory of environmental, social and economic data relevant to offshore renewable energy developments; the development of guidance documents for industry on the preparation of Environmental Impact Statements, Natura Impact Statements and on environmental monitoring requirements; and work on mapping opportunities and constraints for the development of offshore renewable energy projects around Ireland.  The latter will be a useful tool to help inform future decision making in relation to the most suitable locations for offshore renewable energy development.  A Communications Strategy has also been developed to showcase Ireland&rsquo;s significant potential and strong offering in this area, to raise the profile of the Irish ocean energy industry and to communicate that Ireland is "open for business". </p>  <p>  In addition, legislative proposals for a new streamlined development consent process for offshore renewable energy in the maritime area are being progressed under the Maritime Area and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill.  </p>  <p>  Finally it should be noted that the OREDP mandates an interim review of the Plan itself and its associated Strategic Environmental Assessment, to be carried out in 2017.  This task is being progressed in 2017 and a full review of the OREDP will take place in 2020.</p></reply>

A well balanced fuel mix that provides reliable energy, minimises costs and protects against supply disruptions and price volatility, is essential to Irish consumers.    The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet this target,  Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources. Good progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy in our generation portfolio.</p>  <p>  Policies and schemes are in place to incentivise the use of renewable energy.  The REFIT schemes underpin the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies.  In addition, my Department is working on the development of a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme designed to assist in meeting our renewable electricity target. </p>  <p>  To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity.  At end January 2017, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was 3,120 MW of which 2,796 MW was wind.  A further 3,570 MW of renewable generation is contracted for connection to the grid. Provisional figures provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland indicate that the total contribution from renewable generation to gross electricity consumption last year was 26.5%.  In addition, solar and biomass have the potential to also contribute to our renewable electricity target.  Eirgrid estimates that a total of between 3,900 and 4,300 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to achieve 40% renewable electricity by 2020. </p>  <p>  Looking to the European Union's emerging climate and energy targets for 2030, it is likely that all Member States will be required to expand their renewable electricity generation portfolios beyond their 2020 capacities.  This will be subject to negotiation in the context of the Commission's Clean Energy Package proposals and Ireland's share of any EU binding renewable target to be agreed would have to be fair, affordable and deliverable.</p></reply>

This builds on the commitment in this area in the 2015 Energy White Paper. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  My Department is currently developing a proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which will be designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions out to 2030. Analysis is on-going against a range of commercial renewable technologies at various scales and includes an assessment of the cost of supporting Solar Photovoltaics (PV) - both rooftop and ground-mounted.  The assessment also includes analysis of the optimum support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  Once this assessment is complete, my Department will publish a public consultation on the design of the new support scheme in the coming months.  Following the outcome of this public consultation, and before any new scheme is introduced, it will need to secure Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission. Subject to this, it is expected that the new scheme will become operational in the first half of 2018.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  I am fully aware of the level of interest in the solar PV sector in Ireland.  I am advised that there have been over 550 applications, amounting to about 3,900 Megawatts of solar capacity, seeking a connection to the electricity grid in the last 18 months.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  Notwithstanding the level of solar applicants seeking connection to the grid, my stated position is that while solar has a role to play in Ireland&rsquo;s energy future, we cannot have a situation where a new support scheme leads to a disproportionate increase in people&rsquo;s electricity bills through the Public Service Obligation levy.  In designing the new RESS, the cost implications for people and businesses will, therefore be a high priority.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  Finally, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland currently provides supports for the use of solar thermal heating technology to both large industry and SMEs.  Households can also avail of grant support for investment in renewable energy installations, including solar thermal, under the Better Energy Homes Scheme.</font></p></reply>

In the case of Ireland a target of 39% has been proposed, which has been adjusted downwards to 30% to reflect a cost-effectiveness criterion.  The proposal also recognises the mitigation potential of land use, land-use change and forestry, and contains a one-off flexibility between the ETS and the non-ETS, to ensure that all Member States are collectively enabled to reduce their emissions as cost effectively as possible, while ensuring progress towards the overall EU 2030 target can be maintained on a robust basis.  Technical and economic analysis is ongoing on a cross-Departmental basis to understand the implications of  the ESR proposal for Ireland.  The proposal continues to be negotiated at EU level and Ireland's analysis of the impacts of the proposal will continue to evolve during this process.  The final outcome of these negotiations will determine Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU's commitments for 2030 under the Paris Agreement.</p></reply>

This commitment to intervene will ensure that no part of Ireland, no household, no school, no business is left behind.</p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. </p><p>I set out in reply to Question Nos. 72 of 6 December 2016 the position is relation to previous announcements on the development of the NBP.  The updated position is as follows:</p><p>- On the 4 April 2017 I signed a commitment agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide broadband to an additional 300,000 premises;</p><p>- I also published on 4 April an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie which gives certainty to the bidders in terms of the State Intervention Area for the procurement process.  This is an important milestone as it means that bidders can progress their business plans and the Department can move to the next stage of the procurement;  </p><p>- On 5 April I held a briefing for Deputies and Senators in Leinster House to update on progress. </p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The finalisation of the State Intervention Area for the procurement process is an important milestone as it means that bidders can progress their business plans and the Department can move to the next stage of the procurement.  The  three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second. </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP once contracts are in place. </p><p>The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand and a prioritisation programme.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. </p><p>In this regard, in July 2016, together with Minister Humphreys I established the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and is available on the Departments website.  In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg,  State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers. </p><p>The work of the Task Force is being led by an Implementation Group.  This group brings together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery of actions.  This group will formally report every 90 days on progress made on all actions to both myself and Minister Humphreys.  I am expecting the first such quarterly report in May.</p><p>In addition, I have signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with a 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band.  This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. </p><p>  In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band. ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.</p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.</p></reply>

The most recent figures available are for Q4 2016 when the proportion of employees aged 15 years and over reporting earning the National Minimum Wage or less in the State was 8.6% (134,500).</p>  <p>  The CSO introduced a new series of questions to the QNHS in Q2 2016 to facilitate the production of these new estimates to meet the needs of the Low Pay Commission.  There are no comparable estimates of the ratio of workers earning the National Minimum Wage or less for other EU countries as the regulation governing the operation of the Labour Force Survey (implemented in Ireland using the QNHS) does not include a requirement to collect such estimates.</p></reply>

This was superseded by the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP), which allows for Syrians and other eligible nationalities to benefit from resettlement and relocation schemes, and offers them protection status in Ireland in their own right including all the rights and privileges that that entails.  This is a much improved programme allowing thousands to benefit from protection here.  I gave an undertaking that Ireland would accept 520 persons for resettlement over an 18-month period to the end of 2017.  This was almost double the figure proposed for Ireland by the European Commission and was delivered a year ahead of the Commission deadline.  As a result, I announced that Ireland would extend the resettlement programme to take in a further 520 refugees from Lebanon in 2017, most of whom are of Syrian origin.  To date, 627 programme refugees have arrived under the resettlement aspect of the programme and 1,040 will arrive in total.  In relation to the relocation scheme, a monthly schedule has been agreed with the Greek authorities which will sustain the pace of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meet its commitments to Greece within the time frame envisaged by the Programme. Ireland will have accepted approximately 1,100 asylum seekers from Greece by September.</p>  <p>  My current emphasis is to increase the number of people arriving in Ireland under the programmes currently in place.  I am satisfied that we are making considerable progress now and that there is still capacity to ensure more vulnerable people can come to Ireland under our resettlement and relocation programmes.  All of our focus needs to be on meeting these targets. In addition, existing avenues remain open as pathways for family reunification.</p>  <p>  Significant resources are currently being invested in these humanitarian efforts through the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration and the International Protection Office.  As a result, we have established functioning mechanisms and associated expertise to deal with resettlement and relocation.  Our response to the migrant crisis, in terms of accepting refugees, is through the IRPP and all available resources are being directed to that Programme in order to meet the commitments entered into. </p></reply>

Such applications are being processed, as part of a single application procedure, by the new International Protection Office (IPO) which has replaced the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) from that date.  The staff of the International Protection Office (the Chief International Protection Officer and International Protection Officers) are independent in the performance of their protection functions.</p>  <p>  If an application for asylum or subsidiary protection has been made in the State, for confidentiality reasons it is not the practice to comment on such applications and the applicant should contact the International Protection Office directly either by email to info@ipo.gov.ie, by telephone to the IPO Customer Service Centre at 01 6028008 or in writing to the Customer Service Centre, International Protection Office, 79-83 Lower Mount Street, Dublin 2.</p>  <p>  For your information, on 27 February 2017 the Chief International Protection Officer, following consultation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), published a statement on the Prioritisation of Applications for International Protection under the International Protection Act 2015.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I have been advised by the Commissioner that as of the 31 March 2017 there were 660 Garda with 27 Garda Reserves and 46 civilians attached to the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) West Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that 981 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 87 of which were assigned to the DMR West Division.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across the organisation, including the DMR West Division. </p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will benefit all areas of Garda activity.</p><p>The number of Garda&iacute; assigned to DMR West by Station for each of the years 2013-2016 and to 31 March 2017, the latest for which figures are currently available, is as set out in the table.</p><p><b>Garda Strength D.M.R.

The Chief International Protection Officer and the International Protection Officers of the Office are independent by law in the exercise of their international protection functions.

I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the International Protection Office does not keep statistics specific to the grounds on which protection applications are made.</p>  <p>  All applicants for international protection are carefully interviewed and their cases are individually assessed by experienced caseworkers. The circumstances of each individual case is assessed having regard to both the subjective elements (the applicant&rsquo;s own account or personal history) and objective elements (up-to-date information on the applicant&rsquo;s country or place of origin). Supporting documentation submitted by applicants is also taken into account.  Country of Origin information is obtained from a variety of legitimate sources such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Amnesty International and other NGOs, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), the US State Department and the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board.</p>  <p>  Applicants for international protection can appeal the recommendation of the IPO to the International Protection Appeals Tribunal (IPAT) and may also seek remedies through the Courts.   The procedures for appeal are set out in Part 6 and Part 10 of the International Protection Act 2015 as well as in the International Protection Act 2015 (Procedures and Periods for Appeals) Regulations 2017.</p>  <p>  The overall recognition rate in relation to refugee status is approximately 20% per annum over the last five years.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  </p>  <p>  The Garda Reserve was established in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to enhance the links between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities and consists of voluntary unpaid members, drawn from the community, to support the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Reserve perform policing  duties as determined by the Garda Commissioner, while accompanied by full time Garda&iacute;.  Their role is to provide local patrols and participate in crime prevention initiatives targeted at specific local problem areas.  Reserve members are also involved in policing major incidents and events, and in providing other operational support to full time Garda&iacute;.  In recent years the Garda Commissioner has conferred further powers on reserve members under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Road Traffic Act 1961 and has also decided that they should carry out more duties including the serving of summonses, and the issuing of Fixed Charge Penalty Notices where offences are detected.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves this year.  I am pleased to say that a new recruitment campaign for Garda Reserves which closed on 13 April attracted considerable interest. </p>  <p>  Reserve members have undergone training in many of the skills required to be an effective full-time member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it is important that as we expand the Reserve we build on their contribution to the policing of communities right across the country  and ensure that they are used to optimum effect.  In this regard  I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is undertaking an audit of the experience and skills of Reserves which, when completed, will assist Garda management in considering the future role to be played by the Reserve including whether additional powers should be conferred on Reserve members.</p></reply>

This provision, however, was never brought into force.  The Criminal Justice Bill 2016 (changed from the Bail (Amendment) Bill 2016) amends section 6B so that a court will be enabled to make electronic monitoring a condition of bail only on the application of the prosecution, enabling the use of electronic monitoring to be managed and controlled.  The Bill is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas and completed Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 5 April 2017.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 amends the Schedule to the Bail Act by adding a number of the new offences created under that Act, including those relating to child sexual exploitation, to the scope of the Bail Act.</p>  <p>  I would also like to inform the Deputy that officials in my Department are preparing provisions to introduce electronic tagging for the purpose of monitoring compliance with sex offender orders.  These provisions will be included in the General Scheme of a Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill which I intend to publish later this year.</p></reply>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has statutory powers of search and entry available to it under various legislative provisions and these apply to civil aircraft as much as to any other type of private property.  However, these powers may only be exercised in circumstances where a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reasonably suspects that an offence has been or is being committed.  Of course these powers must be exercised in accordance with law.  The mere suggestion or assertion of wrongdoing would plainly not be sufficient in this regard.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has no role in relation to the inspection of foreign State or military aircraft which, in accordance with international law, enjoy sovereign immunity.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has previously investigated allegations made to it of unlawful activity at Irish airports and the Garda Authorities remain fully committed to investigate all alleged breaches of the criminal law, including alleged offences involving the use of aircraft at Shannon Airport or other Irish airports.</p></reply>

At that time, I commenced Parts 1 and 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 as necessary to get the new Authority underway, particularly in terms of its nomination and appointment with the necessary motions of approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As part of the commencement of Part 2 of the 2015 Act, the Law Society, the Bar Council and the Honorable Society of the King's Inns furnished the Legal Services Regulatory Authority with copies of their professional codes as required within one month of the Authority's establishment under section 23(6)(a).  In December 2016 sections 118 to 120 of the 2015 Act were commenced to enable the conduct of public consultations and reports by the new Regulatory Authority within the statutory periods concerned.  These relate to Legal Partnerships (between solicitors and barristers or barristers and barristers - solicitors can already operate partnerships), Multi-Disciplinary Practices (where legal practitioners can provide their services together with other non-legal services providers) and certain restrictions on the work of barristers.  The Authority, for which initial office accommodation has been provided by my Department along with the secondment of an officer at Assistant Principal level, also appointed an Interim Chief Executive on 1 January 2016.  It is is currently conducting a public recruitment campaign for a long-term Chief Executive.  The Authority has met five times since its inaugural meeting on 26 October 2016 with its next such meeting set for 25 May 2017.  Funding support of &euro;1 million was provided to the new Authority by my Department in December 2016.  This is being done on a strictly recoupable basis as the Authority will be self-funding by levy with a similar allocation available to the Authority under my Department's Vote for this year. </p>  <p>  On 31 March 2016, the Regulatory Authority presented respective reports under sections 118 and 119 to me as Minister for Justice and Equality and these have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  These reports, which were completed under very tight statutory deadlines, are historical as the first formal outputs of the Authority in the discharge of its legislative functions.  They are also available along with minutes of meetings and other information on the web page of the new Regulatory Authority which is under development at www.LSRA.ie.  On 6 April 2016 the Authority commenced its public consultations process under section 120 of the Act about certain restrictions on the work of barristers - these arise with regard to the holding of clients monies and to the direct provision of services to a client in relation to contentious matters.  More recently, the Authority has submitted its first Annual Report which, under the relevant terms of the Act, covers its activities for the quarter since establishment on 1 October to the end of 2016 and this will soon be laid, as required, before each House of the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  Alongside these developments, the working focus right now is on the managed roll-out of the Authority's remaining functions with the matching development of its organisational capacities and office and staffing resources.  This includes, under Part 10 of the 2015 Act, the introduction of a more transparent legal costs regime and the parallel transition, within the courts system, of the Office of the Taxing-Master to that of the Legal Costs Adjudicators; the establishment of a Roll of Practising Barristers under Part 9; the introduction of new regulations for the advertising of legal services under section 218 and the separate introduction, by my Department, of Pre-Action Protocols in medical negligence cases under Part 15.  Following these steps the key structural reforms of Part 6 of the Act relating to public complaints, professional conduct and the appointment of the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced.</p>  <p>  The Chairperson and members of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, its Interim Chief Executive and my Department are working closely to ensure that we can successfully coordinate the identification of the necessary steps and commencements by the Department, and the delivery, by the Authority as the new independent statutory regulator, of the various remaining provisions concerned.  While it remains the intention that the Legal Services Regulatory Authority will come into substantive regulatory mode in these areas during the latter part of this year and early in 2018, the phased start-up of its various functions will need careful project management and the identification over coming weeks, and in conjunction with the Authority, of more specific delivery dates for the respective functions involved.</p></reply>

Those provisions have yet to be implemented in full, and Ireland has yet to join the second generation Schengen Information System "SIS".  I am prioritising Ireland's full implementation of our Schengen decision and our joining SIS.  SIS is a valuable policing tool and will help in the fight against cross-border crime and terrorism.</p>  <p>  The national legislative measures required for participation were largely completed by 2009, although some of those legislative provisions will not be commenced until Ireland is ready to join SIS.  Joining SIS involves major ICT investment, which in recent years the State was simply not in a position to make.  With the easing of economic conditions, I have been able to secure funding for this valuable project, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have now entered a contract with an ICT contractor to carry out the work required for Ireland to join SIS.  The contract is for full operationalisation of SIS in Ireland, that is to say creating the link to the central Schengen Information System (CS-SIS), the creation of the national copy (N-SIS), its integration with PULSE, and comprehensive training from the SIRENE Bureau to the end-user.  That contract was signed in December 2016, and &euro;4m has been provided to commence the project.</p>  <p>  An implementation group comprising my officials, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other stakeholders is overseeing the wider Schengen implementation plan to ensure that all State bodies involved are prepared for and able to implement their responsibilities under the Schengen decision.</p>  <p>  I have kept the EU Commission informed of our progress to implementing the Schengen decision and joining SIS, and I have been very clear that Ireland is committed joining SIS and is dedicating the necessary resources to do so.</p></reply>

There are currently a number of such prisoners in the care of the Irish Prison Service who have significant and ongoing healthcare needs, many of whom are currently dispersed across the estate and in some cases significant distances away from the healthcare providers they rely on.</p><p>  The establishment of the unit will allow the Irish Prison Service to accommodate such prisoners in a purpose built unit within close proximity to a variety of medical care facilities and will also allow for appropriate remedial works to the accommodation.</p><p>  It is envisaged that the repurposing of the unit will take 18-24 months to complete.  During this time, it will be necessary to accommodate current prisoners elsewhere in the prison estate, primarily within the Mountjoy Campus.  It is intended that prisoners who are currently on programmes of temporary release will be facilitated in continuing with such programmes.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>Ballyfermot Garda Station is in the Clondalkin Garda district which forms part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) West Division and I have been advised by the Commissioner that as of the 31 March 2017, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 660 Garda with 27 Garda Reserves and 46 civilians attached to the DMR West Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that 981 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 87 of whom were assigned to the DMR West Division. I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across the organisation, including the DMR West Division. </p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.

However, Ireland applies the 13.5% reduced rate of VAT to construction services under a derogation from the EU VAT Directive, because Ireland applied a reduced rate to such services on 1 January 1991. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government committed to ask the Oireachtas to consider the merits of a temporary targeted reduction of the rate of VAT from 13.5% to 9% on new, affordable houses and apartments, both public and private, timed to generate the maximum impact on supply and to target principally the purchasers of affordable homes.   </p>  <p>  In its June 2016 Report, the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness reviewed the costs of construction including VAT, in the light of the Programme for Partnership Government commitment.  They recommend that the Housing Agency annually review construction costs but did not recommend that the VAT rate on new residential property be reduced.</p>  <p>  Ahead of last year's Budget I decided that relief would be better operated through the income tax rather than the VAT system, as applying the 9% VAT rate to the construction of new residential properties would involve having two separate VAT rates applying to construction services. </p>  <p>  As the deputy will be aware, I also introduced the Help-to-Buy incentive in Budget 2017 to help encourage the building of additional new homes.

These externalities are the costs to society and to the environment that, without the tax, would not otherwise be reflected in the price of the vehicle and for which the consumer would not otherwise have to pay.  In the case of motor vehicles, these externalities include environment externalities such as air pollution, which is why one of the bases for imposing VRT is the vehicle's carbon emissions.  Other externalities which VRT seeks to reflect, include the costs to society of providing and maintaining the road infrastructure, traffic control, relevant emergency services, and vehicle registration and licensing.  The funds raised through VRT go towards compensating the Irish State for these significant costs.  </p></reply>

Reducing the VAT registration threshold for architects may increase the administrative burden on smaller firms, while raising the threshold may cause competitive distortions.</p>  <p>  VAT is governed by the EU VAT Directive with which Irish VAT law must comply.

I presume that the Deputy intends referring to private equity funds.  The Deputy will be aware that international private equity funds invested much needed capital in our economy during a period of high risk and uncertainty.</p><p>Central Bank data published on 16 March 2017 provided the following data in respect of mortgages held by what they called &ldquo;unregulated loan owners&rdquo;.</p><p>The total number of Principal Dwelling House (PDH) mortgages held by unregulated loan owners stands at 12,234, valued at &euro;2.4 billion.  The total number of mortgages in the Buy to Let (BTL) category was 5,955, valued at &euro;1.7 billion.  Of these loans, the number of PDH mortgages in arrears was 7,445.  The number of BTL mortgages in arrears was 4,494.  </p><p>The full report is available at:.</p><p>Other than that, the Central Bank does not routinely publish data on entities which are not regulated by the Central Bank and it is not possible to provide the list sought by the Deputy.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 was enacted in July 2015.  It was introduced by the previous Government to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. </p><p>Under the Act, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm that is regulated by the Central Bank.  The significant point is that the regulation is focussed at the point of contact with the customer.  Therefore relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which came into operation in July 2016.  It is also important to highlight that the transfer of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the original contract.</p><p>A register of Credit Servicing Firms authorised or transitionally authorised by the Central Bank is available on their website at .</p><p>Finally I would highlight that tenant relations are governed by multiple pieces of legislation mainly under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

Progress in the liquidation has been delayed due to court proceedings in the case of Law Society of Ireland v the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland (MIBI).  The focus of the court action is to determine whether it is the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) or the MIBI which is responsible for the payment of third party claims.  No date has been specified for the judgment in relation to the MIBI appeal to the Supreme Court, which was heard in October 2016.  It should be noted that first party claims are not affected by the court action and are being processed by the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice.</p><p>A liquidator was appointed in October 2016 to Enterprise Insurance, which is a Gibraltar incorporated company and, therefore, the Enterprise liquidation is being carried out under the laws of Gibraltar.  I am advised that a letter has been received from the Government of Gibraltar outlining that there are currently 233 live claims from Irish policyholders with a reserve value of &euro;7.4m.  However, the reserve figure is under review.  Wrightway Underwriting Ltd have been appointed to manage claims to enable the liquidator to adjudicate and admit them as insurance claims in the liquidation.  Claims are therefore being actively managed.</p><p>In relation to the question of compensation being sought from the governments of Malta and Gibraltar, it should be noted that both countries are common law jurisdictions.  The legal unit of the Department of Finance is of the view that an action against the Maltese or Gibraltar regulators would likely be difficult.  However, in order to establish this definitively it would be necessary to seek legal advice from Maltese and Gibraltar lawyers as well as to seek to establish further information in respect of any failures in their legal duties on the part of the regulators which might give rise to such a compensation claim.  The Department of Finance&rsquo;s legal unit does not consider that there is sufficient likelihood of a successful action being brought to justify the costs which would be incurred in seeking such advice and information.</p><p>Regarding any proposal to take such legal action, it should also be noted that the two companies concerned availed of the &lsquo;passporting&rsquo; provisions of the European Union &ldquo;Freedom of Services&rdquo; rules in order to sell insurance business in Ireland.  This allows an insurance company prudentially regulated in any Member State to operate throughout the Union and is an important aspect of Ireland&rsquo;s obligations as an EU Member State.  While there have been cases, such as the liquidations of Enterprise and Setanta, which have caused difficulties, Ireland has also positively benefitted from these EU rules through, for example, the building up of our large life insurance sector. </p><p>In response to the liquidation of Setanta Insurance and the subsequent uncertainty in relation to compensation arrangements, a Review of the Framework for Motor Insurance Compensation<b></b>was initiated with a report published in July 2016.Work is well underway on the implementation of the review&rsquo;s recommendations; in particular the drafting of the Heads of Bill is being progressed and is on course to be  submitted to Government for approval for publication by the end of Q2 2017.  This once enacted will bring clarity on the respective roles of the ICF and the MIBI in the event of the future collapse of a motor insurer.</p><p>More generally, insurers operating throughout the EU are regulated according to the set of demanding standards required by the Solvency II Directive.  This took effect in Ireland on 1 January 2016.  The Government is supportive of the principle of the freedom to provide services across the European Union and is of the view that the legislative framework underpinning this principle is robust.  Additionally the Central Bank has informed me that it works closely with relevant foreign National Competent Authorities and EIOPA (the insurance European Supervisory Authority), which has identified as one of its key strategic objectives 'to improve the quality, efficiency and consistency of the supervision of EU insurers and occupational pensions.'  The Central Bank of Ireland fully supports EIOPA's work in this regard and has actively engaged with it in its revision of the General Protocol which will enhance the exchange of information between supervisory authorities.</p></reply>

Dividend payments are therefore made to the ISIF.  Payments from the ISIF to the Exchequer arising from the proceeds of the disposal of the State's shareholdings in the Banks are provided for under the NTMA (Amendment) Act 2014.  This legislation allows the Minister to direct the Agency to make such payments after having consulted the Agency.  </p>  <p>  Regarding proceeds from dividends, these are typically recorded as property income in the European System of Accounts (ESA) framework.  Therefore any dividend payments would be recorded as General Government Revenue and, as such, would improve the General Government Balance.  However, the payment of any dividend is exclusively a matter for the board and management of AIB based on the bank&rsquo;s financial performance and future prospects, and subject to regulatory approval.  As such, it is not classed as a discretionary revenue measure and, as the Deputy is aware, has no impact on the fiscal space for 2018.</p>  <p>  The proposed dividend will be payable on 9 May 2017 to holders of ordinary shares on the Company&rsquo;s register of members at close of business on 24 March 2017.

Revenue has approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that focused on confronting non-compliance.  These activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection activities and interventions.  This level of resources has been maintained by Revenue notwithstanding the challenges since 2009 in regard to the overall reduction in Civil Service numbers which included Revenue.</p><p>Revenue carries out a programme of compliance interventions that seek to achieve the optimum balance between minimising  the burden on the compliant taxpayer and tackle, in an appropriate way the non-compliant taxpayer. </p><p>Not all interventions are in the form of audit &ndash; other less resource-intensive interventions are also used (Aspect Queries and Profile Interviews).

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to review individual cases regarding cars registered in particular years nor to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in particular cases. </p><p>I am advised that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  These rating factors can include the type and age of car, as well as the age, driving experience, claims record and penalty points of the driver, the number of drivers, how the car is used, etc.  My understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market.  In addition, insurance companies will price in accordance with their own past claims experience.  </p><p>The Deputy should note that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  Insurance Ireland can be contacted at <i>feedback@insuranceireland.eu</i>or 01-6761914.</p></reply>

It is integrated into European Social Fund (ESF) programming as a dedicated priority axis within the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020 (PEIL) that was adopted by Commission Decision in February 2015.  The specific YEI allocation for Ireland of &euro;68m is matched by equal amounts from our ESF allocation and from the Exchequer, giving an overall allocation of &euro;204m. </p>  <p>  The ESF Regulations provide for initial pre-financing/advances of EU support at 1% (or 1.5% for Member States under financial assistance in 2014 and 2015) of the full programme support, payable for each year from 2014 to 2016, together with annual pre-financing of between 2% and 3% payable from 2016 to 2023.  In May 2015 an amendment to the relevant EU Regulations resulted in an unprecedented increase in the YEI advances to be paid to Member States.  The Commission subsequently released pre-financing payments from the dedicated YEI budget line, worth 30% of the YEI budget, to provide additional financial liquidity to support YEI implementation.  However, the relevant Regulations specified that where a Member State did not submit an interim payment application by 23 May 2016 for at least 50% of the additional pre-financing amount, that the Member State must reimburse the Commission the total YEI pre-financing contribution.  The ESF regulations also provide that annual pre-financing for any year in which an interim payment application is not made in that year must also be reimbursed.</p>  <p>  As Ireland did not submit an interim YEI payment application, the &euro;19.8m additional pre-financing received was reimbursed to the Commission.  Furthermore, as there was no ESF application made in 2016, the &euro;11.6m annual pre-financing for 2016, including &euro;1.36m for the YEI, will be offset against the 2017 pre-financing due.   The reimbursement of these amounts has not resulted in any loss of EU monies to the Exchequer.  Furthermore, as the YEI activities are fully funded up-front by the Exchequer there is no resulting reduction or delay in the funding available to them.  The YEI funding is available for drawdown before the end of 2018 and it is expected that the funding will be fully drawn down.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection has advised that it obtained EU funding under the European Commission&rsquo;s call for proposals for preparatory actions under the Youth Guarantee Pilot, to pilot a Youth Guarantee Scheme in Ballymun which operated in 2014.  The total cost of the pilot was &euro;302,279 which included EU funding of &euro;250,000.</p>  <p>  Youth Employment Initiative activities are programmed within Priority Axis 4 of the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020 (PEIL).  Those activities are the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) Scheme, the JobsPlus Incentive Scheme, T&uacute;s, JobBridge, Youthreach, the Social inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) and Momentum.  The participant figures requested by the Deputy are currently being compiled and will be provided to the Deputy separately.</p></reply>

The most recent report by the HEA on retention and progression, entitled 'A Study of Progression in Higher Education focuses on the progression of students from their first year of study in 2013/14 to their second year of study in 2014/15.  This is the fifth in a series of progression analysis released by the HEA.  The report gives an in-depth analysis of the non-progression rates by NFQ level, sector, discipline, gender, age, nationality and socio-economic group.  There are many factors identified as influencing the likelihood of progression such as Gender, Age at commencement, Prior Educational attainment, nationality and socio-economic grouping. </p>  <p>  The HEA through the System Performance and Strategic Dialogue process also monitor progression rates within the institutions on an annual basis.  Institutes report on retention measures in place within their institutes to combat high non-progression rates.  The HEA funds retention initiatives in Computer Science disciplines in higher education institutions through the Information Technology Investment Fund.  In 2015 these initiatives included additional classes, attendance mentoring, teaching and learning initiatives, student support sessions, buddy practicals and maths enabling courses.  </p>  <p>  In 2016 the National Forum for Teaching and Learning established an ICT Retention Scoping Group to examine ways in which students could be enabled to complete ICT courses.  The group working with practitioners and industry recently made a number of recommendations including capacity building within the school system, improved career guidance, sharing of good practice on pedagogy and retention across the sector and strengthen links with the FET and post primary sectors. </p>  <p>  One of the key objectives of the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2019 (National Access Plan) is to address the issue of non-completion within higher education institutions, for those in under-represented target groups.  The Plan also commits to the further development of mechanisms to track the progression, retention and student experience of target groups.  The target student groups include entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education; first time mature student entrants and students with disabilities. </p>  <p>  To support the implementation of these objectives, a Working Group has been established to consider the issues contributing to the non-completion of target groups in the National Access Plan and to produce recommendations for policy and practice.  The group is chaired by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) and includes representatives of relevant stakeholders.  The HEA, with assistance from the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning, is currently undertaking a scoping exercise to inform the work of the group.</p></reply>

This is an appeal level ratio which is broadly similar to the number of primary schools who submitted appeals to the primary staffing appeals board for the 2016/17 school year, which also represented about 15% of schools.</p><p>The appeals will be processed in the coming weeks and it is intended that schools will be notified of the outcome by 31st May.  </p><p>Schools could appeal whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017/18 allocation.</p><p>DES Circulars 0013/2017 and 0014/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools.  </p><p>In advance of any submission of an appeal, schools were asked to read carefully the DES Circulars and in particular the relevant sections, which relate to the breakdown of the allocation, which may be under consideration for appeal.</p><p>The model will also allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model. The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance. Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. </p><p>Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs have also now been published and are available on my Departments website.</p><p>The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs. The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants. </p></reply>

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers. </p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. </p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO in September 2016 will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4,600 and &euro;6,700) for new entrant teachers.  The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.  The pay increases for new teachers were also available to ASTI members under the proposals which members recently balloted on.</p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.</p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated full year cost in 2017 would be in the order of &euro;85 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  Further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay across the public service will be informed by the analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission. </p>  <p>  The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.  However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of future public service pay talks.  Indeed, negotiations on a successor agreement to Lansdowne Road will shortly get under way.</p></reply>

The commitment to implement these frameworks is a condition of the contract agreed between pre-school service providers and the Department of Children and Youth affairs (DCYA).  Currently 4,222 services are in active contract with the DCYA providing the ECCE programme to 117,000 children.  The DCYA contract also includes provision for verification and audits which require pre-school service providers to permit representatives to attend at the premises for the purposes of inspection and audits.  These include regulatory inspections by the Tusla Early Years (Pre-school) Inspectorate, Pobal, and education-focused inspections conducted by the Inspectorate of the Department of Education and Skills (DES).  The DES, effective from 11 April 2016, has responsibility for evaluating key aspects of education provision in the educational setting inspected and to promote improvement in that setting.  Reports arising from education-focused inspections are published on <i>www.education.ie</i></p><p>The National S&iacute;olta Aistear Initiative, which is being led by the DES, in partnership with DCYA and the NCCA, was established in 2016, to centrally coordinate the implementation of the S&iacute;olta and Aistear frameworks.  The initiative includes the provision of mentoring to support early years settings to implement S&iacute;olta and Aistear and an Aistear CPD pilot being led by the NCCA.Early-years education-focused inspections evaluate the nature, range and appropriateness of the early educational experiences for children participating in the ECCE Programme.  The EYEI model of inspection is based on a quality framework informed by the principles of both Aistear and S&iacute;olta as well as national and international research relating to early childhood education and inspection.</p></reply>

The Department of Education and Skills invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling: </p><p>- 63% of students to attend mainstream schools</p><p>- 26% to attend special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, and</p><p>- 11% to attend special schools.</p><p>My Department considers it essential that in assessing the need for special class placements the individual needs of children should be properly assessed to determine the appropriateness of special class provision for them.</p><p>Some students, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there.  This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.</p><p>Enrolment in an ASD special class should only be considered where it has been demonstrated that a student requires the support of a special class because he/she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day even with appropriate supports. </p><p>Students enrolling in ASD Special Classes must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals (for example, psychologist, speech and language therapist, psychiatrist) stating that: </p><p>- S/he has ASD </p><p>- S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p><p>The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned.  The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  </p><p>The NCSE continues to establish additional special classes to support children with Special Educational Needs including Autism as required.  Since 2011 the NCSE has increased the number of such classes by over 50% from 548 in 2011 to 1153 across the country now, of which 889 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes. </p><p>The NCSE has informed my Department that it intends to establish an additional 162 ASD Special Classes for the 2017/18 school year increasing the number of ASD Special Classes by 18% from 889 to 1,015. </p><p>The NCSE are currently finalising the list of Special Classes for the 2017/18 school year which will be published on the NCSE website <i>www.ncse.ie.</i></p></reply>

In restoring capitation payments, where schools have introduced these cost effective principles, they will receive a premium capitation payment. </p><p>I believe that full transparency in relation to the use of any voluntary contributions is important information for parents to have.  The Parent and Student Charter will require every school to set out a financial statement, which will include information on how any voluntary contributions are used.</p><p>This is part of a suite of measures I am introducing, including the School Admissions Bill which will reform information and procedures around the process of school enrolment, and the commencement of Fitness to Teach, which allow a complaint to be made about a registered teacher to the Teaching to Council for the first time.</p><p>Circular letter 32/2017 &lsquo;Measures to be adopted by schools to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs&rsquo; was published at the end of April and is available on my Departments website.</p><p>Following the implementation of the circular, school authorities will be required to adopt the following principles of cost-effective practice which will put a greater emphasis on reducing the cost of school uniforms and other costs:</p><p>- All elements of a school uniform should be purchasable from various stores;</p><p>- Only iron on or sew on crests should be used;</p><p>- Wherever possible, generic rather than branded items should be specified (e.g. uniform, clothing, IT tablets, sports equipment etc.);</p><p>- Provide parents with a list of all required items and indicate the likely costs of these required items at best value stores;</p><p>- Provide a book rental scheme;</p><p>- Phase out, between now and September 2018, the use of workbooks which cannot be reused;</p><p>- Where an exclusive supply arrangement applies, it should be tendered for regularly and</p><p>- The Board of Management in each school will have to review the cost of items which they require parents to purchase and to make this information available to the school community.</p><p>Schools will consult with parents on their views and ask for suggestions on cost reduction initiatives.  Parents will be asked for their views about school uniform costs, and other costs, through a questionnaire.</p><p>As resources permit, it is my intention to reward schools that can provide evidence of having adopted the principles of cost-effective practice.  It is intended that this could be done through some premium in capitation grants for schools.</p><p>The Action Plan for Education 2016-2019 outlines hundreds of actions to be implemented over the 3 year period 2016 to 2019.  One of these actions aim to restore capitation funding over a three-year period as resources permit.  It was not possible to provide additional funding in Budget 2017 in relation to capitation funding due to the many competing demands for the available funding.  However, this commitment remains a priority for me to address as soon as possible during the lifetime of the Action Plan.</p><p>Circular 32/2017 recognises that schools may already have arrangements made for school uniforms and other school costs for September 2017.  Therefore it is envisaged that it will be the school year 2018/2019 school year before schools can provide evidence of having adopted the principles of cost-effective practice. </p><p>When budgetary resources are available to provide an increase in capitation for schools, my Department will then consider the most appropriate mechanism to gather evidence on whether or not schools have adopted the principles of cost-effective practice.</p></reply>

One of these seven key objectives relates to Equity of Access. </p>  <p>  The last System Performance report was published by the HEA in late 2016.  This illustrates the progress that is being made by institutions in this important policy area, as well as the challenges that are currently being addressed.  A new System Performance Framework is currently being developed by my Department.  This will provide a key accountability mechanism for the future.</p>  <p>  The National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education, 2015-19, contains a specific goal relating to evaluation of current initiatives to support equity of access in higher education institutions.  Considerable progress has been made under this Goal since the National Access Plan was published in 2015. </p>  <p>  The review of the Student Assistance Fund was completed in 2016 and implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations has commenced.  A Review of the Fund for Students with Disabilities is nearing completion.  A key element of the evaluations of both Funds is on the identification and dissemination of best practice guidelines across institutions. </p>  <p>  The HEA are currently evaluating the Recurrent Grant Allocation Model (RGAM), the mechanism to allocate funding to HEIs.  A key element of this review is an assessment of how the RGAM currently supports the access infrastructure in each HEI. </p>  <p>  There will also be a mid-term review of the National Access Plan towards the end of 2017.  This will provide an opportunity to evaluate the overall direction of access policy with a view to informing future policy and practice.  </p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the National Access Plan, the Department of Education and Skills is committed to hosting an annual forum for the dissemination of best practice.  The first of these took place in January 2017. </p>  <p>  Dissemination of best practice is also facilitated by the HEA who work with a network of access officers drawn from each Higher Education Institution.  This provides an opportunity to share knowledge and experience of best practice for the benefit of the system as a whole.</p>  <p>  One of the main access initiatives funded by my Department is the Student Grant Scheme.  In 2017 the scheme is expected to benefit some 80,000 students with investment of approximately &euro;380m.  The Student Support Act, 2011, which provides the legislative basis for the Student Grant Scheme, is currently under review.  This will ensure that the main provisions underpinning the Student Grant Scheme are appropriate and support broader access policy.  There is also a commitment to review SUSI, the awarding authority for student grants, in 2018.</p></reply>

The key data sources are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.  Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates.  This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.</p>  <p>  The use of the HP Index in the context of educational disadvantage is consistent with its use across a broad range of Government Departments, agencies and various public sector entities.  The index contains variables which provide a measure of the underlying risk of educational disadvantage and the exploratory analysis conducted by the Educational Research Centre shows that there is a moderate to strong correlation between scores on the HP index and poorer educational outcomes across the school spectrum, particularly in urban and post primary schools. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the new DEIS Identification Model used to assess the level of disadvantage among the pupil cohort of a school has been applied fairly using centrally held data adopting an objective and scientific approach which has been uniformly applied for all schools.</p>  <p>  I also wish to inform the Deputy that a communication to all schools will issue shortly to provide information on the identification model including details of how the datasets are used to determine a schools level of disadvantage; the importance of data quality to the process and the need for detailed and up to date information from schools.</p></reply>

The DEIS Plan for 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of social inclusion in education policy.</p>  <p>  The rationale for allocating resources and supports based on a schools&rsquo; level of concentrated disadvantage is based on the existence of a &ldquo;multiplier effect&rdquo; whereby students attending a school with a concentration of students from disadvantaged backgrounds have poorer academic outcomes. </p>  <p>  As noted in DEIS Plan 2017, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that DEIS supports are just one of a suite of supports provided by the Department of Education and Skills and by other Government Departments and agencies to assist schools in meeting the identified educational needs of their pupil cohorts.  These include supports for children with special educational needs, English as an additional language (EAL) supports, Educational Welfare Services and School Meals schemes.</p>  <p>  My Department will also provide some &euro;450m in 2017 in supports to promote  students from under-represented groups to participate in higher education.  The main support is the student grant scheme which will benefit some 80,000 students in 2017 through investment of more than &euro;380million.  I also recently announced funding of &euro;2.4m for measures to widen access to initial teacher education for students from groups that are currently under-represented.  This will support 120 students to access initial teacher education over the next three years.  These measures are targeted at those students most in need of support and will benefit students in DEIS and non-DEIS schools who meet the relevant eligibility criteria.  </p></reply>

Schools will be frontloaded with resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils who need such support. </p>  <p>  The Circulars note that for the introduction of the new allocation model, from September 2017, the NCSE &lsquo;Low Incidence&rsquo; allocations which had been made for each school during the preceding 2016/17 school year, have been used to establish the complex needs component of the new model for each school.</p>  <p>  This means that on the introduction of the new allocation model and until allocations are reviewed, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, which is less than the allocation they had received to support pupils with Low Incidence special educational needs during the 2016/17 school year.</p>  <p>  This also means that no allocation for pupils made by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. </p>  <p>  Whereas schools will have greater discretion as to how they can distribute resources under the new model, based on the individual needs of pupils, no reduction in allocations have been made to schools in respect of any pupils who were previously in receipt of a Low Incidence special needs allocation in that school.</p>  <p>  A model for the identification of pupils with complex needs in future is being finalised by the NCSE, in consultation with the Health Service Executive and National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS). </p>  <p>  This model will take account of the decision making process and qualification criteria for the selection of children for access to HSE Children Disability Network Teams. </p>  <p>  For the next re profiling of the model, the Complex Needs category will be the existing low incidence allocations for schools, less any leavers included in this category, plus additional allocations for any new complex needs category pupils, over the period of time since the first school profiles were developed, to the point of the next re-profiling of the model. </p></reply>

Since 2011 the NCSE has increased the number of such classes by over 50% from 548 in 2011 to 1153 across the country now, of which 889 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes. </p><p>The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned.  The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  </p><p>With regard to ASD Post Primary provision in Carrigaline, the NCSE is not aware of and has not approved the arrangement referred to by the Deputy. </p><p>The NCSE has to date established 3 ASD Post Primary classes which are catering for existing need.  The NCSE intends to establish an additional class for the forthcoming school year to meet identified future need.  The NCSE will continue to enage with schools in the area in opening ASD special classes in future years as required.</p><p>Parents/Guardians who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) who can assist in identifying an appropriate educational placement for their child.  Contact details are available on .</p></reply>

The programme is available in twenty hour and forty-five hour units.  It features inputs from agencies such as the ambulance service, fire service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as providing for visiting speakers, trips out of school, projects and case studies. </p>  <p>  The programme provides for an introduction to road safety for pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists and motorists, and covers such issues as seatbelts and airbags, driver fatigue, drink/drug driving, enforcement, basic first aid at road crashes, emergency services and rehabilitation.  The programme is also supported by digital resources, including DVD support and access to international websites on road safety issues. Relevant Driver Theory Test learning is included at the end of each module.  The programme does not include driving lessons.</p></reply>

However, the nature of the assessment process undertaken by SUSI means that there is a risk that some students may be awarded maintenance grants and/or fee grants for which they are not eligible.</p><p>Where overpayments do occur, SUSI treats the overpayment as a debt to the exchequer and seeks to ensure that all such payments are recovered from the student.  This approach is consistent with the general policy and principle regarding the recovery of debt, as set out in the Student Support Act 2011. </p><p>When an overpayment is identified, SUSI will write to the student to inform him/her of the decision to vary the grant amount and to advise that recovery (repayment) of the overpayment will be necessary.  A further letter will then issue to formally advise of the overpayment amount and to request repayment.  This letter includes a Grant Repayment Option Form which requests details of the preferred repayment option. </p><p>If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI.  Applicants may also appeal against decisions made by SUSI in relation to overpayments. </p><p>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal may be submitted by the applicant via outlining the position to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe.</p></reply>

The Wellbeing Programme will cross the three years of junior cycle and build on substantial work already taking place in schools in support of students&rsquo; wellbeing.  This area of learning will make the school&rsquo;s commitment to wellbeing visible to students.  It will include learning opportunities to enhance the physical, mental, emotional and social wellbeing of students.  It will enable students to build life skills and develop a strong sense of connectedness to their school and to their community.</p><p>Planning for wellbeing in schools involves consideration of four aspects;</p><p>(1)Culture </p><p>(2)Relationships </p><p>(3)Policy and planning </p><p>(4)The curriculum</p><p>positive relationships between teachers and students, and students and their peers, along with a sense of connectedness, are the key influences on a student&rsquo;s sense of wellbeing while in school.</p><p>As with all new subject specifications and programmes the development was informed by extensive consultation and engagement with stakeholders.  </p><p>The Junior Cycle Wellbeing programme will begin with 300 hours of timetabled engagement in 2017 and build up to 400 hours by 2020 as the new Junior Cycle is implemented fully in schools. </p><p>All the curriculum components of the Wellbeing curriculum provide opportunities for ongoing classroom based assessment and formative feedback.  Reporting on students&rsquo; learning in Wellbeing happens in two different ways: reporting in first and second year, and reporting as part of the Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement (JCPA) at the end of third year.</p><p>Schools can plan a wellbeing programme without loss of teaching time for other subjects.  Learning in CSPE, PE and SPHE is viewed as fundamental to learning about and for Wellbeing.</p><p>Introducing a Wellbeing programme should not result in students experiencing less time in PE, SPHE or CSPE than under current provision.  For this reason, there is a minimum threshold of time which should be provided in each area.

The Department of Education and Skills invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling: </p><p>- 63% of students to attend mainstream schools</p><p>- 26% to attend special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, and</p><p>- 11% to attend special schools.</p><p>My Department considers it essential that in assessing the need for special class placements the individual needs of children should be properly assessed to determine the appropriateness of special class provision for them.</p><p>Some students, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there.  This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.</p><p>Enrolment in an ASD special class should only be considered where it has been demonstrated that a student requires the support of a special class because he/she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day even with appropriate supports. </p><p>Students enrolling in ASD Special Classes must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals (for example, psychologist, speech and language therapist, psychiatrist) stating that: </p><p>- S/he has ASD </p><p>- S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p><p>The NCSE continues to establish additional special classes to support children with Special Educational Needs including Autism as required.  Since 2011 the NCSE has increased the number of such classes by over 50% from 548 in 2011 to 1153 across the country now, of which 889 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes. </p><p>The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned.  The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  </p><p>The NCSE has informed the Department of Educational and Skills that, in general, they are satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand. </p><p>The NCSE has not identified the need to establish ASD special classes in every school in the country and as such my Department has no plans to do. </p><p>My Department will continue to support the NCSE in opening ASD special classes in areas where there is an identified need.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it.  The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.  Domestic water charges have been suspended since 1 July 2016.</p><p>Any business connected to a public water supply is liable for charges as a non-domestic customer.  If the premises is also used for domestic purposes it is termed a mixed-use customer.  From 1 January 2015 mixed-use customers were billed separately for their domestic and non-domestic water services and had a separate account number for each.  Mixed-use customers were charged for the domestic component of their usage based on occupancy.  It should be noted that the charging arrangements for the non-domestic component of the customer&rsquo;s water use remain the same as operated by local authorities in 2013.  In the case of a metered customer, the volume to be charged at the non-domestic rate is the metered volume in excess of the current local authority domestic allowance.</p><p>The CER is progressing a review of all aspects of non-domestic water tariffs and in conjunction with Irish Water will establish an enduring non-domestic tariff framework.  The CER has recently published an information note informing customers and interested parties about the project and will shortly engage in a period of public consultation on the enduring tariff framework for non-domestic water and/or wastewater customers of Irish Water.</p><p>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.  The team can be contacted via email at oireachtasmembers@water.ie or by telephone on a dedicated number, 1890 578 578.</p><p>Furthermore, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has a statutory responsibility to provide a complaints resolution service to Irish Water customers who have an unresolved dispute with the utility.  A Customer Care Team has been set up within the CER to deal directly with customers who have complaints.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.</p>  <p>  Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities.  However, the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century.  Many of the provisions are outdated and not suitable for business trends in the modern era.  My Department has developed legislative proposals to modernise and consolidate the legislation governing commercial rates.  The main issues being addressed in the General Scheme include; the consolidation of over 20 separate pieces of legislation dealing with commercial rates into a single enactment; improved enforcement powers for local authorities to collect rates; provisions to allow the local authority to introduce rates alleviation schemes to support national and local policy objectives; and provisions for temporary abatement for vacant premises. </p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government approved the drafting of a Rates Bill at its meeting on 11 April 2017.  These proposals will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny in due course, the outcome of which will be considered in the detailed drafting of the legislation, which will be advanced as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

For example, the North Quays in Waterford have been designated as a Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) in 2016, only the second SDZ designated outside Dublin. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Government's Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021 has committed to providing investment for certain enabling works in key areas.  The next stage of the SDZ process will be the publication of a draft planning scheme for public consultation which I am expecting later this year.  Through this designation and the subsequent planning scheme, there is a unique opportunity to unlock the considerable potential of the North Quays to drive significant economic development within the heart of Waterford City. </p>  <p>  The SDZ designation, coupled to the recent announcement of &euro;4 million ERDF funding for urban regeneration projects within the City and previous National Development Plan funded investment in the M9 motorway, public transport upgrades and water services infrastructure, demonstrates the commitment by Government to activating the potential of Waterford and other regional cities and this will be further elaborated on in the forthcoming National Planning Framework.  I believe that a shared funding commitment by both Waterford City and County Council and Kilkenny County Council to local infrastructure enhancements to projects such as the SDZ will be a key enabler. </p>  <p>  Building on the broader national level investment context both in previous years and into the future as well as the National Planning Framework, I believe that we must now examine all potential mechanisms to bring the relevant stakeholders, including local authorities, together to put in place the  strategic local planning and infrastructure delivery and funding mechanisms necessary to properly harness the under-utilised development potential in Waterford, now that key national enablers for its development such as access have been substantially improved.  I have also indicated that I will be addressing relevant local government issues in the report to be submitted to Government and the Oireachtas under the Programme for Partnership Government in mid-2017.</p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to my powers under the Planning Act to bring local authorities together in respect of their forward planning functions and the question raised by the Deputy in relation to putting the PLUTS on a statutory footing, there is no requirement for the Minister to do so.  Indeed, the appropriate fora for the adoption of such PLUTS within a statutory context are the relevant local authorities, through the inclusion of such commitments as policy in their respective Development Plans. More widely, these are also matters more properly addressed in the context of the implementation aspects of the National Planning Framework, whose progression is a major priority for my Department and Government later this year.</p></reply>

The HAP scheme is funded through a combination of Exchequer monies and tenant differential rents collected in respect of HAP tenancies.  The  exchequer outturn for the HAP scheme in 2016 was in excess of &euro;57 million.  The majority of this funding supported the ongoing costs of tenancies established in 2015 that continued into 2016, and the costs of the 12,075 new households supported by the scheme in 2016.  Budget 2017 has increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme to &euro;152.7 million, in order to meet the continuing costs of existing HAP households, and the costs of the additional 15,000 households, targeted under Rebuilding Ireland, to be supported by HAP in 2017.</p><p>Limerick City and County Council provides a highly effective HAP transactional shared service on behalf of all local authorities.

The Central Bank of Ireland is responsible for the prudential supervision of such undertakings authorised in Ireland.  My Department has no function in relation to this aspect of the matter nor does it collect any statistics on the use of insurance.  For consumers such products have the advantage of providing direct recourse from the insurer when problems arise rather than having to rely on the insurances of the builder/developer or other parties.</p>  <p>  The recently transposed EU Solvency II Directive prohibits Member States from interfering in relation to the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Therefore while it would technically be possible to introduce mandatory latent defects insurance, this could have a potentially inflationary impact on the cost of housing delivery.  Furthermore mandatory insurance would not necessarily increase levels of compliance with Building Regulations, rather it would provide compensation and recourse where defects were identified after by homeowners after completion. </p>  <p>  My Department has focussed on implementing reforms to ensure strong and effective regulation in the building control system and the construction industry.  The building control reforms introduced provide insurance underwriters with sufficient confidence to cover risks at prices which are sustainable and which the market can bear.</p></reply>

That Code was produced in late 2014 and revised last year and is available on my Department's website at: . </p><p>The purpose of the Code of Practice is to provide guidance with respect to inspecting and certifying works or a building for compliance with the requirements of the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations.  </p><p>Where works or a building to which the Building Control Regulations apply are inspected and certified in accordance with the guidance contained in this Code of Practice, this shall, prima facie, indicate compliance with the relevant requirements of the Building Control Regulations.</p></reply>

Pillar 3, entitled Build More Homes, has a key objective of increasing the output of private housing to meet demand at affordable prices.</p><p>The opening up of state owned lands for the development of for mixed-tenure housing, particularly in the major urban areas, where demand is greatest, is an important policy initiative.  On 27 April 2017, I published details of some 2,000 hectares of land in public ownership, which has the potential to deliver up to 50,000 homes nationally.  Full details of these sites can be accessed on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map at the following link<i><font color="#2F2F2F">: .</font></i></p><p>I have asked all local authorities to be innovative and proactive in developing these sites.  The final model for each site will be the subject of careful consideration by the local authority concerned, the elected members included, who are best placed to know and provide for the housing need in their area.  Indeed, the Dublin local authorities are well advanced in bringing large-scale sites forward for mixed tenure housing, with projects advertised that can deliver circa 3,000 mixed-tenure homes in the Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council areas alone.  </p><p>Other measures being taken to increase the supply of housing include:</p><p>- &euro;200 million Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund;</p><p>- National Treasury Management Agency financing of large-scale &ldquo;on-site&rdquo; infrastructure;</p><p>- Planning Reforms;</p><p>- Putting in place a National Planning Framework and land management actions;</p><p>- Efficient design and delivery methods to lower housing delivery costs;</p><p>- Measures to support construction innovation and skills;</p><p>- The enhanced supply of more affordable starter homes in key locations through a targeted rebate of development contributions in Dublin and Cork for housing supplied under certain price levels;</p><p>- New National Apartment Planning Guidelines, reducing the cost of apartment building;</p><p>- Changes to aspects of the operation of Strategic Development Zones to enable swifter adjustments to meet market requirements;</p><p>- A vacant sites levy.</p><p>Pillar 4 of the Rebuilding Ireland Plan, entitled 'Improve the Rental Sector', provided for the introduction of an affordable rental scheme to enhance the capacity of the private rented sector to provide quality and affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.  Lands held by local authorities in rent pressure zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent, targeting middle income households, in mixed tenure developments.</p></reply>

Currently, 80% of the estimated LPT liability in each local authority area for a given year is retained in that area to fund public services, notwithstanding any local variation decisions.  The remaining 20% of LPT is re-distributed to provide equalisation funding to those local authorities that have lower property tax bases, due to the variance in property values and density across the State.  These amounts and subsequent distribution of equalisation funding in 2016 are published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following web link:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>Equalisation is the process that ensures that every local authority&rsquo;s LPT allocation is brought up to minimum funding level known as the LPT Baseline.  The 2016 LPT baseline is linked to the General Purpose Grants allocated to local authorities from the Local Government Fund in 2014, immediately prior to the introduction of local retention.  The shortfall between the 20% contribution from local authorities and the total amount required for equalisation is met by the Exchequer.  In a challenging national fiscal situation, this is a significant investment by the State in local government.  My Department keeps the LPT allocation mechanism under review to ensure equitable treatment for all local authorities.  Matters relating to equalisation levels and allocation methods for future years will be reviewed as necessary and appropriate.</p></reply>

With this in mind, my Department undertook an analysis of CE, which also looked at the other employment programmes.  In this context, it is should also be borne in mind that the Government strongly supports the work being done through CE and the other employment programmes.  </p>  <p>  I have seen first-hand myself, over recent months, the vital role such schemes are playing in local communities, including supporting social services, across the entire country. </p>  <p>  Recently the Government approved the implementation of a number of changes to the terms and conditions of participation on CE.  The main purpose of these changes is to broaden the availability of CE to a greater number of people on the live register and to standardise other conditions around the length of time a person can participate on the programme. </p>  <p>  The changes I am planning to introduce will see the general qualifying age for CE for those on the live register reduced from 25 to 21 years.  It will also be easier for previous participants, who have exhausted their CE entitlement, to requalify as participation prior to the year 2007 will be disregarded.  While participants between 21 and 55 years on CE will be entitled to one year on the programme, this can be extended by up to 2 more years if they are engaged in a recognised training or education award that is helping them progress towards employment.  All CE participants age 55 and over will be able to avail of 3 consecutive years on a CE scheme up to the overall limit of 6 years from 2007 (7 years if on a disability payment). </p>  <p>  I have also agreed to review the current participation limits for older people on CE within the next three months.  As the Deputy will be aware, participation limits are necessary to allow for the utilisation of places amongst qualifying persons to ensure the benefits of CE are available to the widest possible number of jobseekers. </p>  <p>  My Department keeps all aspects of its activation programmes under review to ensure the best outcomes for participants.  As part of the implementation of the new measures, my Department is currently consulting with key stakeholders across the country. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Therefore, the ratio of NAS advocates to the 2016 estimate of people with disabilities nationally is 1:17,672. </p><p>However, not all persons with a disability require the services of a NAS advocate.  In 2016, 2,152 people engaged with NAS for advocacy services.  Of these, 1,152 received once off information, advice and advocacy, with the remainder being casework.  Therefore, the ratio of advocates to people who engaged with the service is 1:62.  In addition, the NAS national helpline received 2,000 calls in 2016. </p><p>NAS is fully funded and supported by the Citizens Information Board (CIB), which has a mandate under the Citizens Information Act 2007 to provide advocacy for people with disabilities.The NAS operational grant from the Citizens Information Board for 2017 is &euro;3.1 million.Based on 2017 costs, the following table shows the estimated cost if the number of advocates (including senior advocates) was increased by certain percentages, as requested by the Deputy. <table><tr><th>Increase in number of advocates</th><th>5%</th><th>10%</th><th>15%</th><th>20%</th></tr><tr><td>Full year cost</td><td>&euro;3,209,817</td><td>&euro;3,316,590</td><td>&euro;3,423,362</td><td>&euro;3,530,135</td></tr></table></p><p>These figures include estimated overheads (rent, light, heating) based on current costs and salaries based on an average salary points of both advocate and senior advocate roles.

CIS provides free, impartial and confidential information to the public on a range of social and public services.

Abolishing the bereavement grant provided a significant annual saving and allowed my Department to protect other core social welfare payments such as the State pension. </p>  <p>  The number of bereavement grant claims in 2013 was 23,716, and this represented an increase of approximately 4% on 2012.  Based on a similar yearly increase each year since 2013, it is estimated that the number of bereavement grant claims that might arise in 2018, were the scheme to be reintroduced, would be in the region of 28,858, with that number likely to increase in future years.  The estimated cost of reintroducing the grant at a rate of &euro;850 for 28,858 recipients would be &euro;24.53 million.</p>  <p>  Any decision to reinstate the Bereavement Grant would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  It&rsquo;s worth noting that there are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant.  These include weekly-paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  In Budget 2016, the Government increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone cares for an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  Under the SWA scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income, which may include help with funeral and burial expenses.  The Government has provided &euro;31.5 million for exceptional and urgent needs payments in 2017. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-09a.645.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050900069#WRM02700"><p>The savings arising from the initial reduction and subsequent discontinuance of the telephone allowance meant that my Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence.  My Department will spend approximately &euro;232 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 426,000 customers.</p>  <p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen significantly each year, as the number of eligible customers grew.  At the end of September 2013 there were almost 396,000 receiving the telephone allowance compared to approximately 316,000 people in 2007.  This was an increase of 25%, or an average increase of nearly 4% per annum. </p>  <p>  In 2013 the value of the telephone allowance was &euro;114.00 per annum.  Therefore, the cost of restoring the allowance at 2013 levels in 2018 is estimated to be in the region of &euro;50 million per annum. </p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and strives to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way.  In Budget 2016, the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years was given.  This increased the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  There was also a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.  </p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, I announced a further increase in the rate of State pensions by &euro;5, which has increased the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory) to &euro;238.30.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, over the past two Budgets, the maximum weekly rate for State Pensions has increased by &euro;8 per week.  The value of these increases is well in excess of the value of the telephone allowance previously provided.</p>  <p>  Any decision to restore the telephone allowance would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.  In the previous two Budgets, the Government has concentrated resources on increasing the rate of the pension, rather than on the Household Benefits package.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As part of Budget 2017, I introduced a number of important measures which will benefit self-employed people, namely the extension of cover in 2017 for treatment benefits and invalidity pension.   </p>  <p>  I have already indicated my intention to examine the further extension of benefits to self-employed people.  In doing this I will take account of the recently published results of a survey of self-employed workers and of the forthcoming actuarial review of the social insurance fund. </p>  <p>  The results of the survey of self-employed workers, which I published last week, indicate that the main benefits to which self-employed people would like access are long-term illness, short-term illness and unemployment benefits.  It also indicated that self-employed people are open to paying a higher rate of social insurance in return for additional benefits.  </p>  <p>  Work is currently underway on the actuarial review of the social insurance fund by independent actuaries.  Their work will include an examination of the cost of extending individual benefits self-employed people. </p>  <p>  Together these two reports will inform the development of benefits for self-employed people and I hope to be in a position to announce further changes later this year.</p></reply>

Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim, particularly if they qualify for a full-rate State pension (non-contributory).</p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC.  It does not involve the award of credits.</p>  <p>  From September 2012, new rate bands for State Pension contributory were introduced.  These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contributed to the Social Insurance Fund more frequently during their working life will, generally, benefit more in retirement than those who made less frequent contributions.  People who qualify for a lower contributory pension as a result, but who have an income need, may still claim the means-tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum rate of which is 95% that of the State pension contributory.</p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

However the system is designed to be flexible and fair and allows for review and submission of further information at all stages.

These services have been designed by the Department to augment and complement one another, to ensure the best outcomes possible for jobseekers. </p><p>The JobPath element of the service is being delivered through a payment by results model which means that the companies will not be able to fully recover their cost unless they are successful in supporting sufficient numbers of jobseekers into full time paid sustainable employment.  The contract in place for the delivery of the service is split into two phases: during the first phase jobseekers may be referred to the service while phase two allows for a run off period during which referrals cease, but jobseekers who were successfully placed into employment will continue to receive support and advice.  </p><p>The cost of the JobPath service, over the term of the contract, will therefore be determined by a combination of factors such as a) the number of jobseekers on the live register b) the profile of jobseekers on the live register (higher fees may apply the longer a jobseeker is on the live register), the number of people who are referred to the service by the department and critically the number of Jobseekers who are successfully placed into sustainable full time paid employment.</p><p>Payments are made to the companies in respect of an initial registration fee, paid on completion of a personal progression plan, and thereafter fees are only paid for sustained employment (job sustainment fees) outcomes of 13, 26, 39 and 52 weeks duration. </p><p>The amount paid in fees, is as follows:</p><p>- up to the end of 2016 &euro; 28.5m.</p><p>- up to the end of March 2017 &euro;13.5 m.</p><p>The outline estimate for the service in 2017 is &euro; 65m - it is not anticipated that this sum will be exceeded in 2018 or 2019.  However, it is important to note that these estimates in themselves are gross figures i.e. the associated savings in social welfare payments have not been deducted: job sustainment fee payments are only made were a jobseeker has obtained and sustained paid employment of 13, 26, 39 and 52 weeks duration and were s/he is not in receipt of a jobseekers related payment during that period.  </p><p>In relation to your inquiry on the number of people activated in to full time employment, it is important to note that jobseekers may be supported through the service for up to 30 months - under the service jobseekers have access to a personal adviser (PA) who works with them over two phases.  During the first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  In addition to the two phases jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service for up to a further 6 months</p><p>It will therefore take time to accumulate a sufficient number of clients (who have completed their engagement period with the service) for complete and robust outcome data to be available.  With this in mind, it is intended that an econometric evaluation of the service will commence at the end of 2017.</p><p>The Department has however commenced publishing reports on the performance of the service on a quarterly basis, with the first such report having been published on the Department&rsquo;s website earlier this year.  The report can be accessed on the Department&rsquo;s website at - &quot;</p><p>I can confirm that the next performance report will be available on the Department website in the next week or so.</p><p>In managing the State&rsquo;s public employment service the Department seeks to provide the greatest level of support possible for jobseekers, with the combination of the introduction of JobPath and the welcome significant reduction in the live register in recent years.  The Department for example was able to refocus the LES element of the service to provide an enhanced level of service for jobseekers in 2016 and in 2017.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department keeps under continual review the level of service provided to its customers both in term of social welfare provision and activation measures.</p><p>I trust this information addresses the matters raised by the Deputy.</p></reply>

These reviews yielded &euro;506 million in control savings for the year.  Reviews and investigations of entitlements are conducted by social welfare staff, social welfare inspectors and inspectors assigned to the Special Investigations Unit and a combination of desk-based assessment of entitlements, direct enquiries with recipients of social welfare payments, site and employer visits and face-to-face interviews are used. </p>  <p>  The value of savings recorded by staff for the year 2016 was &euro;506m.  Savings are calculated when a social welfare claim is reduced in value or terminated following a review or investigation initiated by the Department.  Control savings do not include any element where the customer voluntarily told the Department of changes in their means or circumstances which resulted in a reduction in the rate of payment or termination of the claim.  Departmental error cases are also excluded from the savings figure.</p>  <p>  The basis of the savings calculated is scheme specific.  The nature of the scheme is taken into account - in particular whether it is short-term (e.g. jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or supplementary welfare allowance) or more long-term (e.g. State Pension Contributory/Non-Contributory).  Also taken into account is the length of time a person who has a claim reduced or terminated is expected to remain off a particular scheme or at the reduced rate of payment. </p>  <p>  Over 18,700 reports of suspected social welfare fraud were made by members of the public last year.  All reports are received on an anonymous and confidential basis. While the Department does not track the outcome of the individual allegations of wrongdoing received, internal assurance checking indicates that around 1 in 3 reports received results in the value of the payment made being reduced or terminated.  </p>  <p>  The cost of the advertising campaign is &euro;165,988 excluding VAT.  It includes all design and advertising costs associated with the campaign (print advertising, national and regional radio advertising, outdoor and online/digital advertising).  No additional costs arise in staff resources, website development or the provision of the telephone reporting facility.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matters for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

The RSS is a supplementary income support scheme and is not designed as an employment activation scheme. </p><p>I have seen at first-hand myself from visits to various schemes throughout the country in recent months how programmes like the RSS deliver both for participants and for their communities.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to these programmes is clearly demonstrated by the announcement of the additional 500 RSS places in Budget 2017, the first increase in places since 2006.  These additional places were rolled out with effect from 1<sup>st</sup>February 2017 increasing the overall number of places to 3,100.  This measure, allied with my reversal of the previous cuts to Farm Assist, is evident of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to rural Ireland.</p><p>Since 1<sup>st</sup>February 2017, all new participants commencing on the RSS have to be over 25 years of age and a 6 year overall participation limit also applies.  It should be noted that prior to the introduction of the six year participation limit, almost 50% of the participants were on RSS for over 10 years.  The new measure will, therefore, ensure that places become available to provide opportunities for other farmers and fishermen to take part in the scheme.  Income support will still be available to eligible farmers and fishermen who are not on the RSS in the form of Farm or Fish Assist.</p><p>RSS participants who commenced on the scheme prior to 1<sup>st</sup>February 2017 will remain on the scheme as long as they continue to satisfy the eligibility conditions of the scheme. </p><p>The RSS is managed by 35 Local Development Companies (LDCs) and by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s Na Gaeltachta who are the employers of the supervisors and participants.  The setting of terms and conditions of supervisors employed to support RSS participants are matters for each LDC whose representative body is the Irish Local Development Network (ILDN).  Each supervisor has a contract of employment with the partnership company, in line with statutory requirements.  </p><p>The Department has, over the past number of months, been aware of the concerns of RSS supervisors about their terms and conditions of employment and, in particular, their pay rate.  While any issues regarding the terms and conditions of RSS supervisors are a matter for ILDN and the LDCs, the Department is conscious of the role it plays in terms of the funding that it provides to the companies for the programme.  The Department has, therefore, informed ILDN that it is willing to provide funding to implement a pay scale for supervisors in return for some productivity-related benefits.  This issue is now with ILDN and the LDCs to progress as the employers of the RSS supervisors. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy</p></reply>

This software is used to ensure that multiple or fraudulent identities can be detected at the point where a person registers for a personal public services number (PPSN) or a PSC.  Where there is suspicion that a person has attempted to gain a PSC where a Card has already been issued to a person matching the same facial profile, the matter is referred to the Department&rsquo;s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) to make further enquiries and to refer the matter to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation and prosecution under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, as appropriate.</p><p>As of 25 April 2017, 155 suspected cases of identify fraud have been referred to the SIU and/or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Binding obligations to protect the rights of older persons without discrimination are implicit in the core international human rights treaties, including the Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as well as in European human rights law.  The international community has sought to address the situation of older people in particular through the adoption of the United Nations Principles for Older Persons in 1991 and the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing in 2002. More recently, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development clearly identifies human rights, including those of older people, as integral to development and social policy.  Ireland recognises that there are some shortcomings in the implementation of existing instruments and believes that efforts to improve the situation of older people should focus in the first instance on the better implementation of the existing human rights framework.  In this regard, I  believe it is more effective to  engage in the established mechanism of the Open Ended Working Group on Ageing rather than diverting limited resources to the Group of Friends which was established following the fourth session of the Working Group in 2013 and which currently comprises    Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Slovenia, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, and Uruguay.</p>  <p>  Non-membership of this Group of Friends should not be misconstrued as an indication of a lack of commitment to advancing the situation of older people.  In September 2016, Ireland was a co-sponsor of a resolution on the rights of older persons, adopted by the Human Rights Council, which aims to contribute to the substantive understanding of how human rights standards apply to older persons and provides for the consideration of the possible elaboration of a multilateral legal instrument on the rights of older people.</p>  <p>The elaboration of such an instrument was discussed at the most recent seventh session of the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on Ageing in December 2016, which Ireland attended.  It was agreed that certain areas, including non-discrimination, ageism and social inclusion, need to be addressed in order to allow older people to fully enjoy their rights.  Ireland will continue to engage in these discussions, and will participate in the next OEWG meeting in July 2017.</p></reply>

A clear focus on gender equality, protection and gender based violence must be an essential part of every humanitarian operation.  Since 2012, Ireland has provided just over &euro;7.75 million in humanitarian assistance to Iraq.  In 2016, over &euro;3 million was allocated to UN and NGO partners in order to meet the urgent needs of the most vulnerable people inside Iraq, particularly in hard-to-reach areas and those who have been displaced internally.  So far in 2017, we have provided &euro;2 million to address the humanitarian crisis.</p>  <p>  The majority of Ireland&rsquo;s support has been provided to the UN Iraq Humanitarian Pooled Fund.  The Fund provides support for protection services and, in particular, relief items for survivors of sexual and gender based violence.</p>  <p>  The political turmoil which has overwhelmed many countries in the Middle East in recent years has led to increased concerns about the safety of women and children, religious minorities and other vulnerable minority groups.  The only means of securing the protection of religious and other minorities across the Middle East is through the promotion of sustainable political solutions to the conflicts which have for so long destabilised the region and promoted radical and extremist ideologies.  Ireland has consistently called for inclusive, democratic solutions to the unrest in the Middle East and North Africa region.  In the Iraqi context, we have emphasised that the security effort must be accompanied by the implementation of the programme for national reconciliation set out by Prime Minister Abadi in late 2014 to avoid further sectarian divisions.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to monitor actively the situation, advocating for the respect of international humanitarian and human rights law, and for equal access to humanitarian assistance by all vulnerable groups.</p></reply>

In addition, Ireland has agreed to contribute &euro;100,000 to the operating costs of the Mechanism.

We have also consistently called for accountability and the referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.</p>  <p>  Ireland is also a strong and consistent supporter of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) whose Fact Finding Mission (FFM) was set up in 2014 to &ldquo;establish facts surrounding allegations of the use of toxic chemicals, reportedly chlorine, for hostile purposes in the Syrian Arab Republic&rdquo;.  We support their work financially with annual contributions amounting to nearly &euro;1 million since 2014.  In addition, Ireland has contributed &euro;200,000 specifically to the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mission an independent mechanism established to determine the perpetrators of the use of chemical weapons in Syria.

The Act provides the legal basis for the policies and practices that are applied by the Passport Service.  Section 10 of the Act broadly provides that a passport will issue in the name of a citizen as it appears on his/her birth certificate. Issuing a passport in a different name is permitted under the Act in situations such as marriage, adoption or gender reassignment, where civil or legal documents are available to verify the change.  In all other cases where an individual wishes to apply for a passport in a different name, the Act specifically requires evidence of usage over a two-year period.</p><p>Given that a name change effectively replaces an existing identity with a new one, the Passport Service must ensure that stringent checks are in place to mitigate any associated risks.  The documentary requirements in support of a name change are detailed on my Department&rsquo;s website as follows:</p><blockquote><i>&ldquo;Two years&rsquo; proof of usage of the new name, e.g. any two of the following: photo ID document, payslips, utility bills, Government correspondence. For minors, school reports, letter from GP&rdquo;.</i>(www.dfa.ie/passports-citizenship/top-passport-questions/documentary-requirements-passport-applications/).</blockquote><p>The Passport Service&rsquo;s practice is in line with the relevant legislation and is intended to safeguard the high international reputation of the Irish passport and, in turn, protect the wellbeing and security of our citizens travelling abroad.</p><p>I am informed by officials in the Passport Service that the person in question wishes to have a passport issued in a name other than that on his birth certificate but that he has not supplied acceptable supporting documentation.  The Passport Service has advised the applicant of the requirements.  Until such a time as the applicant can provide the relevant documents, the Passport Service, in line with the Act, will be unable to issue a passport in the alternative name.</p></reply>

In the Programme for Government we have set out our ambition to make progress towards the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP to Official Development Assistance (ODA) as resources permit.</p>  <p>  Over the past two years we have managed to increase funding allocations for ODA, providing an increase of &euro;40 million in 2016 and a further &euro;10 million for 2017.  The total 2017 allocation for ODA is &euro;651 million.</p>  <p>  Annual Budget allocations for ODA, as with all public expenditure, are a matter for Government, and are set in the context of available resources, our commitments and competing budgetary demands.  For 2018, when the Estimates process begins, I and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will be making the strongest possible case for a continued increase in the allocation to ODA.</p>  <p>  Our priorities for the aid Programme are very clearly laid out in our policy -&lsquo;One World One Future&rsquo;.  In line with our commitment to the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, our aid programme is sharply focused on delivering our goals of reducing poverty and hunger, promoting inclusive and sustainable growth and building more equitable and better systems of governance, particularly in our key partner countries.</p>  <p>  Detailed financial allocations are made annually across the aid programme in response to existing needs, humanitarian crises and overall programme priorities.  Clear criteria are in place to inform the budget allocation process.  Sub-Saharan Africa remains our priority region, where we direct assistance to the poorest communities, particularly in our key partner countries.  Our aid programme focuses on delivering real and sustainable improvements to the lives of some of the world poorest and most vulnerable people in the areas of basic health, education, agriculture, and food production.</p>  <p>  Grants to partners are made to support development and humanitarian programmes.  Eligible partners include civil society organisations and missionary organisations, multilateral organisations and national and local governments in partner countries.  All partners are assessed to ensure that they have the appropriate governance systems in place, that they can ensure proper accountability of funds and that they have the capacity to deliver effectively.</p></reply>

My Department has recently been made aware of his health issues, which have reportedly deteriorated seriously during his most recent incarceration.  Last week, officials from my Department also had correspondence with the Bahraini Embassy in London on this specific case.</p>  <p>  Ireland attaches a high priority to safeguarding human rights defenders, and has continually advocated for freedom for civil society actors to operate in a safe and enabling environment, without repression.  In August 2014, officials from my Department met with the individual who is the subject of this Question, and discussed the situation of human rights in Bahrain with him.  In October 2015, the Bahrain National Institution for Human Rights (BNIHR) came to Ireland on a training visit, which included meetings with Irish human rights and civil society organisations.  Officials from my Department also met with this group, and set out Ireland&rsquo;s support for human rights promotion across the Middle East region.  We also engage with a number of Irish and international NGOs on human rights issues in Bahrain.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about human rights issues in Bahrain, in particular around civil liberties, are also regularly conveyed to the Bahraini authorities.  In March, officials from my Department met with an official from the Bahraini Embassy in London to discuss the human rights situation in Bahrain, and this specific case was discussed.  My officials also raised ongoing human rights issues with Bahrain in the context of Bahrain&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review, which took place in Geneva last week.  In advance of this review, in early February the Irish Mission to the UN in Geneva supported an event by the Bahrain Center for Human Rights.  </p>  <p>  Further, Ireland&rsquo;s (non-resident) Ambassador to Bahrain met with the Bahraini Deputy Minister for International Affairs, Abdullah Bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, at the beginning of this year and they discussed human rights.  As such, my Department utilises all possible opportunities to express Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the human rights situation in Bahrain to the Bahraini authorities, and the case of this individual in particular has been raised where appropriate.</p>  <p>  The Deputy puts this question to me at a time where we have witnessed some deterioration in the human rights situation in Bahrain, in particular in the targeting those who express dissent or criticism of the Bahraini Government.  My Department will continue to monitor the situation in Bahrain, including this particular case, and will also continue to call on the Bahraini Government to make good on their stated commitment to make progress in the area of human rights.</p></reply>

It would also likely seriously disadvantage smaller States.  Accordingly, I do not propose to abandon a practice that has been in place for over six decades and observed by all previous governments.  To do so would be harmful to Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to engage at the UN and harmful to our capacity to conduct sensitive international relations.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that in the election to the Commission on the Status of Women, the Asia-Pacific Group put forward five countries for five seats on the 45-member Commission which produces non-binding conclusions on an annual basis.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a very strong record on promoting the rights of women and girls at the United Nations.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains a roster of individuals who are available to participate in election observation missions organised in the main by the OSCE and the EU.</p><p>Members of the roster who are nominated as long or short term election observers by the Department do not receive remuneration.  They are paid a daily allowance, determined by the EU and the OSCE, based on local cost of living, to cover the cost of food, accommodation and expenses.  The Department does not seek tax clearance certification from observers prior to participation in a mission.</p><p>The table below sets out the costs of deploying election observers, together with the numbers and categories of observers and elections observed, for the years 2014, 2015, 2016 and to date 2017.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Long Term Observer</th><th>Short Term Observer</th><th>No. of Countries to which  Observers were deployed</th><th>Total costs</th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>9</td><td>44</td><td>11</td><td>&euro;156,255</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>13</td><td>33</td><td>14</td><td>&euro;137,271</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>14</td><td>54</td><td>16</td><td>&euro;253,677</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>&euro;27,185</td></tr></table></p><p>The grant of &euro;600 is paid once in a 12-month period, to cover pre-departure expenses including vaccinations and transport costs ahead of travel to the country in question.  The election observation roster is the only means through which the Department provides a structure to support Irish election observers.  A number of independent NGOs also send monitors to observe elections throughout the world and the Department is aware of a number of Irish nationals who have deployed on such missions.  These individuals can, of course, avail of consular advice and assistance, but are not eligible for the pre-departure grant, which is only paid to observers who have succeeded in being selected for the election roster.</p><p>In relation to the level of response from roster members to calls to observe elections, the situation is that 133 members of the current roster have taken part in missions since 2013.  61 members have not yet done so.  A significant factor in this is that the number of applicants for election missions is always higher than the number of available places.  I understand that some 29 members of the current roster have yet to apply to participate in a mission, which represents under 15% of the membership.  As has been the practice to date, all roster members will be invited to apply to participate in any mission to which Ireland proposes to deploy observers, with a view to ensuring the widest possible participation in election missions by roster members.  It is envisaged that the current roster will operate until May 2018.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-09a.773.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050900071#WRO04200"><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform allocates capital funding between departments/sectors, on a multi-annual basis, based on the Government's capital plan.  Responsibility for selecting the individual projects to be funded within the various departmental/sectoral allocations is then a matter for the relevant individual Minister to decide, based on their priorities for the sector (and subject to agreement by Government, where necessary).</p><p>Capital expenditure is sanctioned through the line departments or bodies given a delegated sanctioning role by those departments.  These 'sanctioning authorities' are responsible for monitoring the projects and dealing with cost overruns that arise within their capital sanctions.  The Public Spending Code published by my Department sets out the principles which apply in relation to project appraisal, value for money etc., and which continue to apply throughout the implementation phase.</p><p>A project must complete the review stages set out in the Public Spending Code before sanction is given to go out to tender. At each review stage the project is evaluated to ensure it continues to meet its objectives, the budget is reviewed and adjustments undertaken as necessary.  Once tenders are received the sanctioning authority must review the tender report and give permission for a contract to be awarded with an established construction budget.</p><p>It is a matter for the contracting authority who has awarded the contract to manage its performance thereafter and report on budgetary matters to the capital sanctioning authority concerned.  The extent of cost increases on individual capital projects is a matter for each sanctioning authority, the details are not held centrally and therefore cannot be provided by my Department.</p><p>All public works projects that are delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the Government's capital plan must be procured in accordance with the provisions laid down in the Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF).  The CWMF is mandated by circular and was developed to provide an integrated set of contractual provisions, guidance material, technical templates and procedures which cover all aspects of the delivery process of a public works project from inception to final project delivery and review.  The structure of this strategic framework complements the Public Spending Code.</p><p>A central pillar to the successful outcome of a construction project is a clearly defined set of contract conditions.  The standard public works contract which must be used without amendment (unless otherwise sanctioned) is a lump sum, fixed-price contract and includes, amongst other important elements, a set of tightly defined circumstances where the contract sum and the project's completion date may be adjusted.  It is a general principle that public works projects are put out to tender on the basis of a comprehensively defined set of project requirements so that tenderers can provide a lump sum price for the completion of the project.</p><p>Notwithstanding that, the conditions of construction contracts must make provision for change after the contract is awarded whether that is due to unforeseen circumstances or brought about by a change in the contracting authority's requirements.  Careful management pre-procurement is required to ensure that neither scenario arises since changes are disruptive and costly in the construction phase.  Public procurement law also recognises both eventualities and Article 72 of the EU 2014 Procurement Directives sets limits for both types of changes.  Where these limits are exceeded a new procurement process is required.</p><p>With regard to the engagement of former employees of the public service on construction projects it is incumbent on contracting authorities to ensure that a conflict of interest does not arise in the procurement of public contracts generally.  Article 24 of 2014/24/EU makes specific provision in this regard.</p><p>A key element of the Public Service Reform agenda is to reduce costs and achieve better value for money through reform of public procurement.  In 2012 the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) was established as an office under my Department to lead on the Public Procurement Reform Programme by:</p><p>- Integrating procurement policy, strategy and operations in one office;</p><p>- Strengthening spend analytics and data management; and</p><p>- Securing sustainable savings</p><p>Much of the information sought by the Deputy up to and including the award of the contract is provided by contracting authorities as part of their obligations under procurement rules.  Under EU Directives on public procurement public works, supplies and service contracts above certain thresholds must be advertised on the Official Journal of the EU (OJEU) and awarded on the basis of objective and non-restrictive criteria. For works contracts the current threshold is &euro;5.225 million. </p><p>In relation to contracts valued below the EU thresholds, the general requirement is that works contracts above &euro;50,000, be advertised on the national eProcurement portal <i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i>.  It should be noted that not all contract notices give rise to a contract award.</p><p>The EU Directives require contract award notices for contracts above EU thresholds to be published in the OJEU not later than 30 days of the award of the contract.  Guidelines in Circular 10/14 issued by my Department also require public bodies from 1 August 2014 to publish all contract award notices over &euro;25,000 on eTenders.  The publication of contract award notices is facilitated by the OGP through eTenders.  It is important to note that the OGP does not validate the contract award data entered by contracting authorities on eTenders and this information does not constitute a contract repository.</p><p>The information sought by the Deputy relating to the tender and award of contracts has been forwarded in an excel spreadsheet from the data input by contracting authorities on eTenders.  It is structured in columns setting out Tender ID; Contract Type; Contracting Authority; Tender Name; Procurement Procedure Type; Contract Award Value (for contracts above EU threshold, and below EU threshold contracts from 1 August 2014); Date of Publication of Contract Notice.</p><p>The OGP migrated to a new eProcurement platform in 2012 and, even though contracts were required to be published on the eTenders platform since well before this date, it is not possible to distinguish notice types prior to that date.  The information provided from the current eTenders platform is all works contract notices (for projects with a value in excess of &euro;50,000) published on the eTenders system from November 2012 (when the current version of eTenders became operational) to December 2016.</p><p>For the purposes of the response the Deputy should note that all contracts for commercial semi-state bodies have not been included on the basis that they are typically funded from their own revenue streams.  It is acknowledged that some of these contracts may have been funded by the taxpayer but the source of funding cannot be determined from the contract notice.  It should also be noted that the list of contract notices include framework agreements which are not, in and of themselves, contracts.  Once a framework is concluded, contracts may be awarded in accordance with the call off rules for the framework.  The list also includes Prior Information Notices (PIN) which are early indicators to the market of an intention to publish a tender within 12 months of the publication of the PIN, they do not necessarily result in the publication of a contract notice which initiates a tender.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-09a.793.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1260" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050900071#WRO06200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 327 to 329, inclusive, together.</p><p>The core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding is the OPW's Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.  The Programme is focussing on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding.  It is the principal vehicle for implementing the EU Floods Directive and national flood policy. </p><p>The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the Office of Public Works (OPW) working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans. </p><p>The OPW is finalising the Flood Risk Management Plans that will be submitted to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for his approval.</p><p>In arriving at a preferred measure, the OPW having assessed the flood risk for each area considered a wide range of flood risk management options.  These ranged from non-structural methods that comprise actions typically aimed at reducing the impacts of flooding to<b></b>structural works that reduce flood flows or levels in the area at risk or that protect the area against flooding. </p><p>The OPW consulted on the possible feasible options for each AFA with the public and communities in the AFAs during the end of 2015 and the first half of 2016.</p><p>Deciding which option best addresses the flood risk for each area was decided against agreed Flood Risk Management Objectives.  The Objectives are aimed at considering potential benefits and impacts across a broad range of factors including:</p><p><b><i>- Economic</i></b>- costs relative to economic benefits</p><p><b><i>- Environmental and Cultural</i></b>- impacts for the environment and assets and collections of cultural importance</p><p><b><i>- Social</i></b>- impacts for people, the community and society</p><p>- <b><i>Technical</i></b>- effectiveness in managing or reducing flood risk</p><p>While each of these factors is treated equally, there are a range of objectives within each that are prioritised by their importance.  These Flood Risk Management Objectives and their relative scores were developed by the OPW through separate and extensive public consultation. </p><p>Each of the possible options for each AFA (except those assessed to have a low risk) was tested and scored against these objectives to determine how well each option contributes towards meeting the defined goals. </p><p>The option that best meets the objectives was identified in the draft Flood Risk Management Plan as the preferred measure for an area and a further local and statutory consultation was completed by the OPW on these draft Plans during the second half of 2016.</p><p>While the information in relation to the costs for each measure are not available at this time, major defence schemes are only considered to protect against a 100 year flood risk and where the benefits at least equal the costs.  In cases where a scheme is technically viable and has a  benefit to cost ratio  greater than 0.5 but less than 1, a more detailed assessment of the costs can be progressed to determine if an economically viable measure may in fact exist that could justify the progression to full project-level assessment. </p><p>The OPW operates a Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme to provide funding to local authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection measures within their area.  The scheme is available for projects that are estimated to cost up to &euro;500,000 in each instance.  Applications are considered in the context of specific technical, economic, social and environmental criteria.  Proposals must meet a minimum benefit to cost ratio of 1.5:1 in order to qualify.  Further details on the scheme are available on the OPW website, <i>www.opw.ie</i>.</p><p>The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in September 2015 announced details of a &euro;430 million six-year programme of capital investment on flood defence measures as part of the Government&rsquo;s overall Capital Investment Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021.  During this time, the annual allocation for flood defence schemes will more than double to &euro;100 million.</p><p>The flood protection capital programme 2016 &ndash; 2021 will build on the very significant investment that has already been undertaken in flood relief works throughout the country over the last 20 years.  It will provide the means to provide feasible protection to homes and businesses in major urban areas together with investment in many minor works projects to address more localised flooding problems.</p></reply>

Compliance with the legislation covering these areas is rightly a matter for the relevant Department or agency.  Therefore employment law, health and safety and their enforcement, are matters for my colleague Ms. Mary Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor TD Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>  <p>  Recently revised public procurement procedures require applicants to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts.  The criteria upon which contracting authorities may exclude applicants from the award procedure of public contracts are set out in Regulation 57 of S.I. No. 284 of 2016 &ndash; European Union (Award of Public Authority Contracts) Regulations 2016 and Article 57 (4a) and Recitals (100) and (101) of Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on public procurement.  Before an applicant, in relation to certain breaches is excluded, the applicant may make a case and provide supporting evidence as to why it should not be excluded.  The contracting authority must consider this evidence before deciding whether to exclude or include an applicant.  In addition, the qualifying tenderer must submit signed declarations stating that none of the circumstances outlined in Regulation 57 of S.I. No. 284 or Article 57 of 2014/24/EU apply.</p>  <p>  The Workplace Relations Commission (WPC) (comprising the former National Employment Rights Authority) is responsible for enforcing minimum statutory employment rights and entitlements in the State and, in undertaking that role, carries out a range of functions including the provision of employment rights information and the inspection of employment related records.  The WPC operates a system of risk based inspections in sectors where there are identifiable risks.  Inspections are also carried out in response to complaints received and routine inspections are undertaken as a control measure.</p></reply>

Section 11 (1) of the 1997 Act sets out the principal functions of the Board of the Museum.  Section 11(2) deals with the powers of the Board of the Museum.  The Act also specifies certain points where the involvement of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is required eg section 34 where the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance is required to borrowing by the Board.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, 2016, sets out the key functions which all State Boards should fulfil including: reviewing and guiding strategic direction and major plans of action, risk management policies and procedures, annual budgets and business plans, setting performance objectives, monitoring implementation and State body performance, and overseeing major capital expenditure and investment decisions.</p>  <p>  In recent years, my Department has entered into a Service Level Agreement with the National Museum.  This set out the framework for the relationship between the Department and the institution and was a performance contract in which an agreed level of service was formalised between my Department and the institution.  This was to ensure that resources are used in an effective and cost effective manner to deliver quality services to the public.  The Agreement set out the NMI's targets for the year and defined the output and outcome indicators on which performance should be measured. It also contains the commitments of the Department.</p>  <p>  The Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies was revised in 2016.  In line with the updated Code, my Department has prepared a draft Oversight Agreement and draft Performance Delivery Agreement (previously Service Level Agreement).  My Department has recently written to the Board of the National Museum with regard to consideration of a draft Oversight Agreement between the Department and the Board of the National Museum.</p></reply>

The expressions of interest which were received will now be assessed through a process organised by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) in accordance with the Guidelines for Appointments to State Boards.</p><p>PAS will provide me, for consideration, with a list of candidates who have been assessed as meeting the criteria for the role of Board member.  I will appoint a new Board and Chair as soon as possible once these processes have been completed. </p><p>I do not agree with recent comments made by the former Chair of the WDC questioning the Government&rsquo;s commitment to regional and rural development and to the WDC. Regional and rural development is a key priority for the Government and this is reflected in the many commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Governmentto support regional and rural progress.  Significant developments in this regard include the publication of the Action Plan for Rural Development, the establishment of a Taskforce to progress the concept of an Atlantic Economic Corridor, and the development of a National Planning Framework which is being coordinated on behalf of the Government by Minister Coveney. </p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Governmentalso includes a specific commitment to reinforce the role of the WDC so that it continues to play an important part in the Government&rsquo;s efforts to achieve more effective regional development.</p><p>In this context, the WDC has been involved in an increasing number of initiatives, some of which go beyond the role the body has played to date, and which can develop its potential further.  For example:</p><p>- The WDC is represented on the Monitoring Committee for the Action Plan for Rural Development which is chaired by Minister Humphreys. The WDC is assisting my Department, as part of a sub-group of the Monitoring Committee, in developing indicators to measure the impact of the Action Plan on rural communities.</p><p>- The WDC is also represented on the Implementing Committees which oversee the delivery of the Action Plans for Jobs for the West and North-West regions.</p><p>- The Commission is represented on the Taskforce which I established in March to progress the concept of an Atlantic Economic Corridor along the western seaboard.  The WDC is involved in a sub-group of the Taskforce which is mapping out the options for EU funding which could support the development of the Western region.</p><p>- The WDC has also assisted my Department in participating in, and reporting on, a public Dialogue on the implications of Brexit for areas such as rural communities, regional SMEs, culture, the Irish language, and heritage and outdoor recreation.</p><p>Strengthening the Commission&rsquo;s role in this way is not contingent on providing them with extra funding, but shows how their expertise and potential can be drawn upon to support the Government&rsquo;s objective of supporting economic and social development across the regions.</p></reply>

The underspend has primarily occurred because of timing issues in relation to the quarterly drawdown of funding by bodies and institutions under the aegis of my Department and also some delays in the drawdown of funding in relation to a number of schemes and projects across my Department's programme areas. In terms of capital carryover, provision is made in the Revised Estimates Volume for the carryover of unspent capital funding from the previous year for expenditure on priority capital programmes, subject to a Ministerial Order being made by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform before 31st March in the year of carryover. The amount of capital funding carried over into 2017 for my Department was &euro;13.548 million.  Since the making of the relevant Order by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the 6th March 2017, expenditure totalling just over &euro;2.1 million has been incurred from the carryover.  No expenditure could be incurred against capital carryover prior to the 6th   March 2017.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage closely with Local Authorities to ensure that all allocated funding is spent promptly and in accordance with project proposals and the provisions of the Public Spending Code. My officials are continuing to impress on all Local Authorities the need to have their projects completed as soon as possible. In this context, satisfactory progress in relation to projects under the 2016 schemes will be an important consideration in any 2017 funding decisions. </p>  <p>Expenditure across all programme areas within my Department's Vote will continue to be carefully monitored throughout the year to ensure the best use of available financial resources.</p></reply>

Any revision of these medical card income thresholds requires primary legislation.</p>  <p>  Persons aged 70 or older, who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds, may also have their eligibility assessed under the means-tested medical card scheme if they so wish, for example in the event that they face particularly high expenses, e.g. nursing home or medication costs. This scheme is open to all persons, irrespective of their age and assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses. The qualifying income thresholds under this scheme are lower than over-70s gross income thresholds. In setting the assessment guidelines, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has regard to Government policy as outlined by the Minister for Health, changes in the consumer price index and other issues which may be relevant. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, persons, including those aged over 70 years, may be deemed eligible for a medical card on a discretionary basis, if they are judged to face undue hardship in arranging GP services as a result of medical or social circumstances. In addition, from August 2015, all persons aged 70 or older qualify for a GP Visit Card, regardless of income.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the increase in the State pension came into effect in March 2017. It would be the Government's intention that people would not be adversely affected by this increase. I have asked the HSE to monitor the situation and to advise me if it considers that changes in the rates of Department of Social Protection benefit may affect people's ability to qualify for a medical card.</p></reply>

The HSE Integrated Audiology Programme set up a working group of key stakeholders in 2015, with the aim of assessing the standards that were applied to the fitting of medical devices (i.e. hearing aids) within Ireland.  The group has drawn on various good practices that are applied across Audiology and Hearing Aid Audiology and are currently in the final stages of producing a best practice guide to ensure a code of practice for the profession (both public and private) for use within Ireland.</p>  <p>  The sale of medical devices, including hearing aids, within the European Union is regulated by EU legislation.  All medical devices placed on the market undergo a conformity assessment to confirm that they meet specified safety and performance requirements.  Once a medical device is CE marked and is not subject to prescription control it may be sold on the EU market without restriction.  There are new distributor requirements that will come into effect with the application of the new EU medical devices regulations which will broaden the scope of the current regulatory framework to address obligations of all economic operators.</p>  <p>  The profession of audiologist is not included in the 14 professions currently designated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  The Act provides that the Minister for Health may, following a consultation process and with the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas, make regulations designating a health or social care profession not already designated if the Minister considers it in the public interest to do so and if certain specified criteria have been met.</p>  <p>  My Department is proposing, towards the end of this year or early next year, when all registration boards have been established, to ask  CORU - the Health and Social Care Professionals Council to undertake a risk assessment, in terms of public protection, of the principal health and social care professions seeking designation under the Act and to make recommendations concerning options for their possible future regulation.  The question of designating the professions of audiologist will be considered as part of that process.</p></reply>

It offers free bowel screening to men and women aged 60-69.

These efforts include digital and social media initiatives, as well as targeted radio and press advertisements.  The BowelScreen website (www.bowelscreen.ie) also provides much information and allows people to check that they are on the register.  Also, a range of information leaflets, posters and flyers are available to healthcare professionals. </p>  <p>  BowelScreen moved from the initial three year round, to a two year round of screening in 2016.  The extension of BowelScreen to the 55-74 age range will be considered in the future in the light of the experience of the current programme and available resources.</p></reply>

This was developed by the HSE in partnership with the Health Sector unions and was launched in May 2005.  The objectives of the Policy are twofold.  Firstly, to promote a safe and caring environment in all health care settings, where the dignity of patients and clients is paramount and they are afforded the highest possible standards of care.  Secondly, it aims to safeguard staff by providing effective supervision, support and training and a safe system of work  </p>  <p>  The Policy has both a preventative and a procedural dimension.  It places particular emphasis on the role of best human resource practice in promoting high standards of care and preventing potential abuse.  The Policy also emphasises employees&rsquo; duty to be vigilant and to report concerns regarding the welfare of patients and clients.  It sets out the reporting procedures to be followed in the event of abuse being suspected or alleged.  Finally, it contains a robust procedure for managing allegations of abuse against staff.</p>  <p>  As investigations carried out under this policy and actions taken are a matter for the HSE, I have referred this question to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

The Annual Report of the National Treasury Management Agency notes that the SCA resolves the majority of claims by negotiating a settlement, either directly with the plaintiff's legal advisors or through a process of mediation.  In 2015 97% of clinical negligence cases which were handled by the SCA were settled without the necessity for a contested court hearing.</p><p>The SCA has supplied a report on the information requested by the Deputy.  The data is extracted from the <i>National Incident Management System</i>(NIMS), a system which it hosts for the Health Service Executive, other healthcare enterprises and Delegated State Authorities.</p><p>The tables supplied show details on claims finalised for the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health from 1 January 2011 to 4 May 2017 under the following case outcomes: Settlement Agreed, Case Discontinued/Claim Statute Barred, Indemnity Received and Outside the SCA remit.  A claim in this context refers to a notification of intention to seek compensation for personal injury and/ or property damage where it is alleged that the State was negligent.  The application may be in the form of a letter of claim, an InjuriesBoard.ie application or a written or oral request.  A finalised claim refers to when a claim and all other matters associated with it have been agreed, e.g. costs.  There may still be some associated payments and reimbursements outstanding on finalised claims.</p><p><i>Table 1</i></p><p>Number of Claims by Claims Finalised Year (2011 - 2017) </p><p><b>Number of Claims </b><table><tr><th>YEAR</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017 Year to Date</th><th>Total Claims</th></tr><tr><td>Settlement agreed</td><td>343</td><td>376</td><td>460</td><td>540</td><td>566</td><td>658</td><td>281</td><td>3,224</td></tr><tr><td>Case Discontinued/Claim Statute Barred</td><td>148</td><td>169</td><td>189</td><td>255</td><td>362</td><td>361</td><td>191</td><td>1,675</td></tr><tr><td>Indemnity Received</td><td>54</td><td>58</td><td>58</td><td>149</td><td>105</td><td>269</td><td>23</td><td>716</td></tr><tr><td>Outside SCA Remit</td><td>22</td><td>15</td><td>13</td><td>25</td><td>30</td><td>19</td><td>14</td><td>138</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>567</td><td>618</td><td>720</td><td>969</td><td>1,063</td><td>1,307</td><td>509</td><td>5,753</td></tr></table></p><p><i>Table 2</i></p><p>Paid Total by Claims Finalised Year (2011 - 2017)</p><p><b>Paid Total (&euro;&rsquo;000)</b><table><tr><th>YEAR</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017 Year to Date</th><th>Paid Total</th></tr><tr><td>Settlement agreed</td><td>56,370</td><td>56,769</td><td>61,433</td><td>77,282</td><td>77,380</td><td>91,317</td><td>46,691</td><td>467,242</td></tr><tr><td>Case Discontinued/Claim Statute Barred</td><td>753</td><td>903</td><td>878</td><td>604</td><td>2,300</td><td>676</td><td>2,121</td><td>8,235</td></tr><tr><td>Indemnity Received</td><td>606</td><td>491</td><td>310</td><td>563</td><td>389</td><td>162</td><td>436</td><td>2,957</td></tr><tr><td>Outside SCA Remit</td><td>0</td><td>11</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>57,729</td><td>58,173</td><td>62,622</td><td>78,448</td><td>80,073</td><td>92,158</td><td>49,248</td><td>478,452</td></tr></table></p><p>Definitions for the terms used in the tables:</p><p>(i) 'Settlement Agreed', - i.e. a negotiated settlement has been agreed with the Plaintiff for damages or an Injuries Board award accepted.

As of yet there have not been any decisions made in relation to the opening of temporary alternative accommodation in specific locations but any such decisions will be based on the procurement process as set out in this National Framework and submissions made by hospitals and hospital groups to the HSE as part of their budgetary processes.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Winter Initiative provided &euro;40 million of additional funding for winter preparedness.  This Initiative was developed to manage the expected winter surge in demand for hospital care in an integrated way across Primary, Acute and Social Care. This Initiative concluded in March.</p><p>A range of practical measures to address ED overcrowding were implemented, including 90 additional beds, aids and appliances for over 4,450 patients, around 1,000 extra homecare packages and 615 additional transitional care bed approvals.</p><p>During this Initiative, delayed discharges reduced from 638 in September 2016 to a low of 434 at the end of December and were maintained below 500 from mid-December through to end February.  This had a positive impact on ED overcrowding and trolley numbers, in freeing up beds for use by patients awaiting admission to hospital.</p><p>Since the start of 2017 there have been approximately 5% less patients waiting on trolleys nationally compared to the same period last year.  I can assure the Deputy that there continues to be a very strong focus on reducing ED overcrowding and my Department and the HSE are currently engaged in a process to commence winter planning for next year and to achieve an improvement trajectory in ED performance.</p></reply>

The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  </p>  <p>  There is scientific evidence of the beneficial impact of HPV vaccine for women's health in countries that have had high vaccine uptake rates.  Cases of high grade pre-cancerous changes of the cervix have reduced by 75% in Australia and by more than 50% in Denmark and Scotland.</p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines that are licensed in Ireland.  While no medicine is entirely without risk, the safety of vaccines, as with all medicines, is carefully monitored and any new evidence concerning side-effects is taken into account.  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency continually monitor adverse events to vaccination. </p>  <p>  Unfounded, false claims have been made of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that they first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine and a false connection is being made between the HPV vaccine and the onset of these symptoms.  There is no scientific evidence that the HPV vaccine causes any long term illness. However, these claims led to a significant drop in uptake rates of the HPV vaccine from 87% in 2014/15 to 72% in 2015/16.  This means that a large cohort of girls is now at risk of developing cervical cancer later in their lives.  </p>  <p>  Misinformation is causing real harm to those unvaccinated children and adults who develop vaccine preventable diseases, and to people who seek inappropriate treatments for real conditions that are not caused by vaccines.  Any parent who has doubts or questions about vaccination should talk to their family doctor, or alternatively to visit the National Immunisation office website.  These sources of information are clear and accurate and will answer any queries you may have about the benefits or risks of vaccination.  Vaccination is the best way for parents to make sure their children are healthy and protected from preventable diseases.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-09a.1221.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050900079#WRW04500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 483 and 502 together.  </p><p>Lyme disease (also known as Lyme borreliosis) is an infection caused by a spiral-shaped bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi.  It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE has extensive information concerning Lyme disease on its website .  I have appended a copy of the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) from the website for your information.  </p><p>Lyme borreliosis was made been statutorily notifiable in Ireland by the Infectious Diseases (Amendment Regulations) Regulations 2011 (S.I. no 452 of 2011).  The notifiable entity is Lyme neuroborreliosis, the more severe neurological form of Lyme boreliosis and the average number of annual neuroborreliosis notifications has been 14 over the last few years  However, the diverse and unspecific nature of the symptoms means that a number of the less serious cases may not be diagnosed, leading to under reporting of cases.  It is likely that there are between 150 and 250 cases of Lyme disease in Ireland per year, making Ireland a low to medium incidence country (the highest incidence of Lyme disease in Europe is seen in Alpine and Scandinavian countries).  It is estimated in most Western European countries that between 5% and 20% of the population have positive Lyme blood tests, indicating that they have been bitten by an infected tick and either did not develop symptoms of Lyme disease or developed such mild symptoms that these were not recollected.</p><p>Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  </p><p>The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step.  Screening EIAs can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other similar bacteria, and certain other viral infections, including glandular fever.  In addition, blood samples from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results.  </p><p>Samples giving positive or equivocal results in screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage immunoblot (Western blot) tests.  Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity.  Using this two stage approach will give a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme. </p><p>All clinical (and other) laboratories in Ireland must undergo continuous quality assurance to ensure that the quality of the diagnostics they provide is maintained at the highest international level for human diagnostics.  </p><p>The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC, the Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland, the Irish Society of Clinical Microbiologists, the Irish Institute of Clinical Neuroscience and the Irish College of General Practitioners agreed a Consensus Statement on the Clinical Management of Lyme Borreliosis, which endorsed the previously referenced, internationally recognised set of guidelines (those of the Infectious Diseases Society of America) to Medical Practitioners to ensure a standardised approach to the diagnosis and management of Lyme disease in Ireland.  </p><p>The HPSC have published Frequently Asked Questions on Testing for Lyme Disease on their website<font color="#0000FF">, </font><i>.</i></p><p>The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee, the aim of which is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency, an Environmental Health Officer and, very importantly, a representative from Tick Talk Ireland, the primary Support Group for Lyme disease in Ireland.  </p><p>The initial work of the Lyme Borreliosis Sub-committee involved a survey of laboratory methods for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland, the development of Lyme borreliosis guidance for general practitioners, the publication of medical media articles to highlight diagnostics and laboratory methods relating to Lyme borreliosis available in Ireland.  Material has been produced which is aimed both at the general public and General Practitioners.  </p><p>There is extensive information for the public and health professionals on the HPSC website.  This information for the public includes:</p><p>- Lyme Disease Frequently Asked Questions; </p><p>- Laboratory testing for Lyme Disease: FAQs for general public; </p><p>- Lyme Disease Illustrations; and  </p><p>- CDC's instructions on how to remove a tick.  </p><p>The website also contains factsheets, information, clinical guidance and an Erythema Migrans Diagnostic Support Tool  for health professionals.  </p><p>As a result of climate change there is likely to be an increase in the incidence of Lyme disease in Ireland.  The predicted warmer temperatures and altered rainfall are likely to result in a longer tick season and increased numbers of the small rodents that the ticks feed upon.  This is the likely picture in Ireland and would be replicated in the UK, the US and Canada.  Campers, walkers and certain occupational groups such as forestry workers, conservation workers, deer cullers and farmers are at particular risk of exposure.  The risk of infection is greatest in late spring and early summer, so Springtime is the time to ensure that parents, children and doctors are aware of the risks posed by ticks.  Since 2013, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has held an annual &lsquo;Lyme Awareness Week&rsquo; at the beginning of the tick biting season, the purpose of which is to draw attention - particularly in the media - to Lyme disease and the ticks that can spread this disease.  This year Lyme Disease Awareness Week will take place on 15-22 May.  </p></reply>

While the market share for electronic cigarettes and refill containers is growing, the long-term effects of vaping on public health are not yet known.  Electronic cigarettes are regulated by the European Union (Manufacture, Presentation and Sale of Tobacco and Related Products) Regulations 2016.  These Regulations transposed the European Tobacco Products Directive and came into effect on 20 May 2016.  </p>  <p>  The introduction of the workplace smoking ban was based on clear and unequivocal evidence that second hand smoke is harmful to non-smokers.  That evidence base does not exist for the aerosol generated from e-cigarettes.  However individual organisations/companies are free to introduce an e-cigarette free policy if they so choose to prevent people vaping where they would not be free to smoke.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the emerging research on these products, so as to inform decisions around any future additional regulation in this area.</p></reply>

Additional exceptional aid measures for the sector included a one off co-funded support payment of &euro;1,395 to dairy producers in 2015. In 2016 a Voluntary Supply Management Scheme formed part of the exceptional aid package from the EU Commission from which over &euro;6.5m was paid to Irish dairy producers.  I can confirm that the referenced individual received payments through both schemes.  </p>  <p>  A further measure implemented by my Department under the 2016 EU exceptional aid package was the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme.  This scheme was developed by my Department in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), making &euro;150 million available to farmers at interest rates of 2.95%.  Distributed and administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, the Scheme provides farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to monitor the market situation for dairy and other sectors to ensure that the most appropriate supports are made available to producers.</p></reply>

At this stage it is impossible to say with certainty what effect Brexit will have on the Irish fishing industry as we don't know yet what changes the UK may seek to the current arrangements.</p>  <p>  The most serious issue facing the fishing and seafood sector is the kind of relationship the UK wants with the EU in terms of fisheries post -exit.  When we do know what the UK want, we will work closely with our EU partners in trying to seek a new relationship with the UK.</p>  <p>  The UK could seek to limit access to their waters and/or try to gain larger quota shares at the expense of others.  However, that could only happen if the UK were content to ignore the potential repercussions that would certainly arise from the EU side.  Any attempt by the UK to alter the status quo at the expense of Ireland and others must, and will be resisted strenuously.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the negotiations that will take place over the next few years are not a renegotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy.  The CFP remains in place and will be reviewed in the normal way from 2019.  That review is due to conclude by 2022.</p>  <p>  I strongly believe that we must concentrate all our efforts on the Brexit negotiations at this time and until Brexit is completed.  The discussion on the post Brexit CFP will undoubtedly occur in earnest once the Brexit arrangements are clear.</p>  <p>  The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) provides the framework for the long term sustainability of fish stocks around our shores, the continued economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processing industry while supporting our families and communities that depend on the sea for their livelihood.</p>  <p>  The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) Operational Programme 2014-2020 is funding a suite of schemes implemented by Bord Iascaigh Mhara to support our seafood processing sector develop new value-added seafood products, put in place the capital investment to produce new and more seafood products, develop business and marketing strategies to take advantage of the export opportunities, and to work cooperatively with other seafood enterprises to develop marketing resources in potential export markets.</p>  <p>  The Operational Programme  provides &euro;240 million approximately for the development of our seafood sector.  Some &euro;147.6 million is being provided by the EU (61%) and this represents more than a doubling of EU funds allocated to Ireland compared to the previous EU funding period.  This increased allocation was in recognition of the strong case made by Ireland in CFP negotiations that Ireland carries a disproportionate control and data collection burden relative to our share of EU quotas in our territorial waters.  That remains the case.  The overall EU budget available for the EU seafood sector in the next funding period will be the subject of future budget negotiations between the EU institutions.  In the absence of the UK, the overall budget of the Union is likely to be lower, so difficult negotiations can be expected.  The relative share of the EU seafood funding is determined by the Commission having regard to criteria specified in the EMFF Regulation.  These criteria will be an important focus of Ireland&rsquo;s negotiating position for the next programming period and I will be seeking to ensure that they reflect Ireland&rsquo;s control and data collection burdens.</p>  <p>  I am and will remain in close contact with fisheries stakeholders as the issues develop and work with them to ensure that we are all fully prepared for what are likely to be extremely complex negotiations for both the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU and the subsequent CFP reform.</p></reply>

In addition, tax changes over the last three Budgets have provided a comprehensive set of supports to encourage early farm transfer, long term leasing and partnership arrangements: </p>  <p>- Tax treatment of agricultural assets means that the family farm can be transferred on to the younger generation without any tax liability arising in almost all cases.</p>  <p>- Generous incentives apply to encourage farmland to be leased out in long term lease arrangement, rather than the conacre (11 month) system, allowing for proper planning and investment in relation to leased land. </p>  <p>- The Succession Farm Partnership scheme will promote the earlier inter-generational transfer of family farms, in line with Programme for Government commitments and the Food Wise strategy.  It will encourage and support important conversations within farm families about succession planning.   This Scheme provides for a &euro;25,000 tax credit over five years to assist with the transfers of farms within a partnership structure.  Administrative arrangements are being finalised and I will launch the Succession Farm Partnership Register shortly.</p>  <p>  As a result of these efforts, we are starting to see more young people taking over farms, whether through family transfers, family and non-family partnership arrangements, and other collaborative arrangements.</p>  <p>  The latest client data from my Department does suggest that, finally, we now have more farmers under the age of 35 than over the age of 80 &ndash; and while this represents progress, there is obviously a lot more to be done.  Many farmers don&rsquo;t want to retire fully, and I understand and respect that wish.  What we need is arrangements that work for both the older farmer and the new generation.  I think it is important to reflect the fact that most farms are family businesses, where the skills and talents of all family members, particularly farm women, can contribute to building viable businesses for the future.  We are all sadly aware of the issue of farm safety, and I hope that encouraging collaborative arrangements will help to reduce the risk of accidents on farm.</p>  <p>  In addition my Department is a member of the Farm Safety Partnership Committee and as part of the current and previous Farm safety Action Plans, programmes have been and are being implemented to promote the health of farmers.  One such element was the publication of a booklet entitled: Staying Fit for Farming.  This booklet was distributed as part of the FBD champions for change campaign, and it is intended to print a further run of the booklets.  The booklet has been made available to facilitators of Knowledge Transfer groups on the "Farm Safety key" memory stick. </p></reply>

I and my officials have engaged at political and official levels with representative organisations, businesses, and with UK, Northern Ireland and EU Member State counterparts, in order to both fully understand and to communicate the potential implications of Brexit, as well as the most appropriate industry and government responses. An important element of that process has been the Northern Ireland dimension, and the particular issues to be dealt with in a border context. </p>  <p>  In addition to the separate and ongoing contacts with the IFA, ICMSA, ICSA and Macra na Feirme, all of these organisations are members of the Stakeholders Consultative Committee that I established last year to exchange views and experiences on the implications of Brexit. The impact of Brexit on border areas is regularly discussed during these consultations. In addition, these organisations and their Northern Ireland counterparts have participated in the series of agri-food sectoral dialogues that I have hosted under the All Island Civic Dialogue process, specifically to look at North-South issues and areas of common interest that arise in this context. </p>  <p>  I am of course fully aware that the implications of Brexit for North-South trade, and for the movement of raw materials, including milk, meat and live animals, are potentially severe.  The implications for animal and plant health procedures on both sides of the border are also potentially very serious. Put quite simply, this substantial trade would be very significantly affected by the constraints of tariffs, customs controls, veterinary/phyto-sanitary certification and any deviation by the UK from EU common regulatory provisions and standards, if these were to arise.</p>  <p>  For the record I have had the following formal meetings with farming organisations since the beginning of the year:</p>  <p>  I met with the IFA on 22 March 2017 to discuss their Brexit Policy Paper and again on 30 March to discuss the effect of Brexit on the liquid milk market. I also accompanied the Taoiseach on 26 April when he met the IFA to discuss their Policy Paper. I spoke at their Brexit Conference in Goffs on 24 April.  I also met a delegation from the ICMSA on 14 February, a delegation from the ICSA on 16 February and a delegation from Macra na Feirme on 13 April 2017.</p>  <p>  The Government remains very focused on supporting the farming and agri-food industry through the challenges ahead. I will continue to meet the representative bodies both on their own and as part of our Stakeholder Consultative Committee process in order to exchange views and to monitor developments as the negotiations progress.</p></reply>

In Ireland, quota is managed to ensure that property rights are not granted to individual operators. </p>  <p>  While Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQ&rsquo;s) which permits the transfer/ sale of quotas may work for some Member States, it would not work for Ireland  where we have a network of small rural coastal communities dependant on our fishing fleet, large and small, demersal and pelagic. The Irish fishing fleet is for the most part made up of family owned vessels with strong links to their home ports. These families have a long tradition in fishing with generations succeeding each other into the industry. </p>  <p>  I have no doubt that if ITQs were  put in place, our quotas both whitefish and pelagic would be purchased by large European fishing conglomerates, with no socio or economic links to our ports, and landed elsewhere, with the resultant loss of jobs and economic activity around our coast. For Ireland, this scenario would wipe out our fishing industry and we will would not get the benefit from the rich fisheries resources in the waters around our coasts.  The issue of mandatory ITQs formed a part of the EU Commission proposal for the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy in 2011.  This proposal was rejected following a strong case made by Ireland that management of quotas should be a matter of national competence.</p>  <p>  To put in perspective much of the employment on shore in the seafood sector is generated by landings to Ireland by Irish vessels of all sizes. This activity delivers approximately 3,200 jobs in our fleet, with another 3,800 employed in our processing plants with additional employment  in ancillary support industries. These jobs are totally dependent on Irish quotas being landed into Irish ports and any change to this would seriously jeopardise the ongoing viability of these jobs with disastrous consequences. </p>  <p>  The result of Ireland's  long standing policy is that the Irish fishing fleet involves a balanced spread of sizes and types of fishing vessels who have retained a strong economic link with our coastal communities and have delivered economic activity including vital employment in these communities, where there are very limited alternative economic activities.   </p></reply>

As part of this package, Member States were given &euro;350 million to implement schemes which were tailored to meet their needs nationally.  This was to ensure that the funds were put to the most effective use possible in each State. Ireland was allocated &euro;11.1m under this aid package.</p>  <p>  My Department, after consultation with all stakeholders in the sector, has used our &euro;11.1 million allocation of funds, to part finance the Agri Cashflow Support Loan Scheme. Using national funds, I increased the amount provided to implement the scheme to &euro;25 million.</p>  <p>  This resulted in a low-cost credit scheme with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) which has made &euro;150 million available to farmers at interest rates of 2.95%. The Scheme provides farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital, allowing them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the on-going financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.</p>  <p>  The SBCI has said that &euro;60.2m has been drawn down by farmers to date.  The average loan size is &euro;32,000, with more than half the loans being advanced for terms of four years or more. 42% of loan value has been provided to dairy enterprises across the country. I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance. </p>  <p>  The banks advise that all of the remaining &euro;150m is committed and is in the process of being drawn down.  Based on progress to date, SBCI anticipate that in total approximately 4,000 farmers will benefit from the scheme. </p></reply>

This includes the FBO&rsquo;s obligation to test for undesirable substances, such as lead.</p>  <p>  Where appropriate tests are commercially available for routine testing of food products it is the norm that the FBO would use a commercial laboratory, as has been done for the tests required in the Silvermines area.  The laboratory chosen to conduct these tests is a commercial matter for the FBO in question.  It is part of an international company that has laboratory sites in different countries, with specialised testing being rationalised to specific laboratories to maximise efficiencies.  This is nowadays normal practice and guarantees service at a more competitive cost; overheads are high for analyses of this nature (the ability to detect lead at extremely low concentrations - where 20 parts per billion is the maximum permitted level in milk) due to the requirement for expensive instrumentation, specialised staff and tight quality control.</p>  <p>  The role of my Department&rsquo;s Laboratories is to test samples taken in the framework of official controls, surveys and investigations.  In the current Silvermines investigation my Department has worked in partnership with the FBO in trying to solve this incident and my Department&rsquo;s responsibility has been to test milk samples taken by my Department&rsquo;s Dairy Controls &amp;amp; Certification officers and RVL staff.  The purpose of the testing of these milk samples was to support actions such as restriction/derestriction of marketing of milk or to help progress the investigation.  A customised and well-planned system of sampling, delivery and testing has been coordinated by my Department to allow quicker turnaround times for these official samples.  My Department&rsquo;s Laboratories are however not able to act as a public testing laboratory because of current testing capacity and mandate.</p></reply>

We exported almost 20,000 head to Turkey in 2016 and two shipments of cattle have taken place to date this year, with indications that there will be further shipments this year.  In relation to the other significant potential third country markets for live exports, Ireland reached agreement with Egypt in 2016 on a health certificate for slaughter cattle.  My Department has been actively discussing with the Egyptian authorities the possibility of agreement on a health certificate for fattening cattle.  Good progress has been made on this matter and I am optimistic that an agreement can be finalised in the near future.</p><p>My Department is also looking at the possibility of bilateral health certificates for the export of cattle to Kazakhstan and has identified Israel as a live export market of potential interest to exporters.  Agreement on health certificates has been reached by my Department with all other live export markets identified as being of potential interest to Ireland.  At present 9 non-EU markets (Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Libya, Montenegro, Morocco, Serbia, Tunisia, and most recently Turkey) are currently open to live cattle from Ireland, in addition to all EU Member States.  Demand from North Africa and the Middle East for live cattle will depend on the political environment there as well as Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness.</p><p>I will continue to work to ensure that Irish meat and livestock producers have the option of exporting to markets abroad.</p></reply>

Tipperary with expenditure on the works totalling &euro;11.2 million to date.  The last substantive phase of the programme of remediation works to be completed is the work at the Garryard site.  Progression of this phase of the programme is under consideration by my Department.</p>  <p>  The Gortmore Tailings Management Facility was the largest site remediated at a cost of approximately &euro;6 million.  This work included drawing up proposals for its future maintenance having regard to the protection of the integrity of the work carried out. Since a negotiated approach with the landowner proved unsuccessful, arrangements were commenced for acquisition of the site by Compulsory Purchase Order, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This process stalled following the untimely death of the land owner and following the advice of the CSSO it was agreed to negotiate with the family of the landowner.  This negotiation process is ongoing. </p>  <p>  Environmental monitoring of the Silvermines sites has been undertaken for the Department by CDM Smith Ireland Ltd since 2013.  The purpose of such monitoring is to ensure no significant change in the conditions occurs at the remediation sites without detection. </p>  <p>  An Inter-Agency Group has recently been established to investigate recent unexplained cattle deaths and the presence of elevated metal levels in milk from farms in the area.  The Inter-Agency Group is led by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine with participation from my Department along with other relevant state agencies.  The findings of the Inter-Agency Group will help inform decisions in respect of remediation efforts at the former mining sites at Silvermines.</p>  <p>  I am aware that lands are currently being offered for sale at Shallee in the Silvermines area.  My Department has no plans to acquire these lands.</p></reply>

A review, which is ongoing, is seeking to facilitate the provision of options to householders on how they manage their waste costs, while still encouraging the reduction and recycling of waste.  It is important to acknowledge that many people are already on plans which encourage waste prevention and segregation, including models which include an element of weight-based charging.</p>  <p>  The figure quoted by the Deputy for the number of households that could do better under a pay-by-weight system was based on a study of a pay-by-weight model which was in operation in the south-west of the country, when compared to other pricing structures in that particular area.  The area chosen had a mix of urban and rural customers and pay-by-weight was long established, so that the customers in that particular area already had time and opportunity to adapt their behaviour to preventing and segregating waste.  The figures showed that households of 4 people or less in that area were better off under pay-by-weight and those figures were extrapolated, using CSO data on household size, to give an indication of the savings which were achievable.</p>  <p>  As previously pointed out, I do not and will not have a role in setting the level of charges for waste collection.  I would, however, like to see a system in operation whereby the prevention and segregation of waste was encouraged so that we reduce our reliance on landfills around the country. </p></reply>

In accordance with section 59(1) of the Waste Management Act, 1996, each local authority is responsible for the supervision and the enforcement of the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the holding, recovery and disposal of waste within its functional area.  Local authorities have specific powers under sections 55 and 56 of the Act to require measures to be taken, or to take measures directly, to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused or likely to be caused by the holding, recovery or disposal of waste, and to mitigate or remedy the effects on the environment of any such activity.</p>  <p>  Underpinning waste enforcement is state funding for waste enforcement officers.  I have made &euro;9 million available from the Environment Fund this year to support the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs) and the recruitment and continued employment of a network of local authority waste enforcement officers.  This investment is critical in tackling issues such as illegal dumping in local communities and in providing an enhanced response on the ground to other infractions of the waste code. </p>  <p>  My Department has also developed an Anti-Dumping Initiative to work in partnership with local authorities and community organisations in identifying high risk or problem areas, developing appropriate enforcement responses and carrying out clean-up operations.</p>  <p>  Applications for funding from local authorities were invited for consideration by the relevant WERLA with an initial allocation of &euro;650,000 made available to support this initiative.  Funding is being prioritised for projects where community groups and other state agencies work in partnership to clean-up and prevent illegal dumping and where effective enforcement actions are being undertaken by local authorities.</p>  <p>  I have been advised that 111 applications have been received from all over the country and given this very positive response it is my intention to make further funds available to support a second phase of this initiative in 2017.  I will be making an announcement in this regard shortly.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  </p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  </p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband roll-out so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. </p><p>On the 4 April, I signed a commitment agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide broadband to an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.  Eir has committed to concluding this work over a 90 week period, an average of nearly 500 premises per day.  My Department will be monitoring this roll-out to ensure that eir meets its obligations under the Agreement.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department's website.  </p><p>Quarterly updates will be published on the Departments website.  The Q1 2017 update will be published shortly and I am pleased to announce that the eir roll-out is in line with the Commitment Agreement.  My Department has informed me that in the period from 1 January to end March 2017, 30,064 premises have been passed. This brings to 40,114 the total subset of the 300k premises that eir has passed since they commenced work in late 2016.  Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at<i>.</i></p><p>On the same day I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which finalises the State Intervention area.  The updated Map shows the following categories of areas for delivery of broadband:  </p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,  </p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.  </p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis together with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in Ireland&rsquo;s 26 counties.  There are c2.3m premises of which c542,000 premises including some 22,000 in County Limerick are located within the AMBER area on the map and will require State Intervention.  The remaining 1.8m  premises including c76,000 premises in Co Limerick  are located in the BLUE areas and will be/are served by commercial operators.  Of the c76,000 premises, c15,000 premises  are part of eir&rsquo;s plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and end of 2018.</p><p>Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at<i>www.broadband.gov.ie.</i>Consumers in BLUE areas who cannot access High Speed Broadband are encouraged to notify the Department at NBPBroadband@DCCAE.gov.ie, quoting their eircode.  The Department is working with the operators, the local authorities and other key stakeholders on resolutions for black spot areas.  </p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The finalisation of the State Intervention Area for the procurement process is an important milestone as it means that bidders can progress their business plans and the Department can move to the next stage of the procurement.The three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second. </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to roll-out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP once contracts are in place. </p><p>The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand and a prioritisation programme.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded. </p><p>In this regard, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task Force in July 2016 together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and is  available on my Department's website.  In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.</p><p>The work of the Task Force is being led by an Implementation Group.  This group brings together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery of actions.  This group will formally report every 90 days on progress made on all actions to both myself and Minister Humphreys.  I am expecting the first such quarterly report shortly.</p><p>In addition, I have signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with a 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band.  This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. </p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band. ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.</p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.</p></reply>

Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter target also being legally binding.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has calculated that 25.3% of electricity, 6.5% of heat and 5.7% of transport energy requirements were met from renewable sources at end 2015.  Overall, SEAI analysis shows that 9.1% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements in 2015 were met from renewable sources. </p><p>The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy and although good progress towards the target has been made to date, meeting the 16% target remains challenging.  The REFIT schemes underpin the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies.  In addition, my Department is developing a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme and a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) Scheme, designed to assist in meeting our RES-E and RES-H targets.  The introduction of any new scheme - including the overall costs and technologies to be supported - will be subject to Government approval and State Aid clearance from the European Commission. </p><p>To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity.  At end January 2017, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was 3,120 MW of which 2,796 MW was wind.  A further 3,570 MW of renewable generation is contracted for connection to the grid.  In addition, solar and biomass have the potential to also contribute to our renewable electricity target.  Eirgrid estimates that a total of between 3,900 and 4,300 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to achieve 40% renewable electricity by 2020. </p><p>In the transport sector, Ireland aims to meet its renewable target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a small contribution.  Further increases to the obligation rate in the Biofuels Obligation Scheme took effect from 1 January 2017 when the rate increased to 8% by volume.  A public consultation on future increases to the Biofuels Obligation Scheme, required to meet the 2020 renewable transport target will take place later this year.</p><p>Details in regard to the sources of electricity generation in 2015 are publicly available in the report entitled Energy in Ireland 1990-2015, published by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) in November 2016 and available on the SEAI website at www.seai.  </p><p>The following table summarises those sources: <table><tr><th>Electricity Outputs (GWh)</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>Coal</td><td>16.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Peat</td><td>8.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Oil</td><td>1.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Natural Gas</td><td>43.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Renewables</td><td>27.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Of which:</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Hydro</td><td>2.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Wind</td><td>22.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Landfill gas, biogas, biomass and renewable wastes</td><td>1.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Non-Renewable Wastes</td><td>0.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Net Imports</td><td>2.3%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

I am, however, critically aware of the frustration currently being experienced across Ireland where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  Recognising this frustration, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task Force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the NBP State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and is available on my Departments' website. </p>  <p>  In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.  The work of the Task Force will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p>  <p>  In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I, together with Minister Humphreys, have established an Implementation Group.  This group is driving and monitoring the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions to both myself and Minister Humphreys.</p>  <p>  The first meeting of the Implementation Group took place on 8 March, and was followed by a series of bilateral meetings with action holders.  These discussions have formed the basis of the first quarterly progress report, which I, together with Minister Humphreys expect to publish shortly.  This report will show that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Mobile Phone and Broadband Task Force, other initiatives are underway to enhance services across the State.  I have signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with a 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band.  This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.</p>  <p>  In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band. ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.</p>  <p>  In terms of commercial investment, mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.  However, as mobile services are a radio based technology, services can be affected by topography, quality of handsets and the capacity of the network, as well as by and proximity to mobile telephone antennas. </p>  <p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.</p></reply>

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the competent authority in Ireland for the preparation of official inventories of greenhouse gas emissions and projections of future emissions. Inventories of greenhouse gas emissions are normally published by the EPA for each year towards the end of the following year. While it is not possible to provide a forecast of Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 or in future years, the EPA has projected that for each year between 2017 and 2020, Ireland is likely to exceed its annual targets under the Effort Sharing Decision.

Plastics feature across a wide range of applications and products, such as packaging, construction, electrics and electronics, agriculture, medical and health.  In Ireland, the latest statistics available show 55% of all plastic waste was sent to landfill in 2011.  The last waste characterisation study showed that 12.4% of our household waste, by weight, was plastic.  My Department is funding the EPA to undertake new characterisation work this year and new figures will be available over the coming 12 months.  Plastic packaging waste represents a significant element of our plastic waste. Under the EU Packaging Directive, 22.5% of plastic packaging must be recycled.  The most recent waste packaging statistics show that Ireland has met and exceeded this target, reaching 40% for plastic packaging recycling. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that waste collectors are obliged under waste management legislation to ensure that specified plastics are collected from households for the purpose of facilitating the recycling of such material.</p>  <p>  My Department provides funding to the EPA for the commissioning of research and is providing &euro;8.75 million for this purpose in 2017.  A number of studies on plastics have been completed through this funding stream.  This year, the EPA has commissioned a study to identify the sources and pathways of microplastics into our river systems and also to ascertain the harm caused to aquatic lifeforms.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has worked to address the issue of plastics in the environment and was the first EU country to address the issue of plastic bags which were a significant component of litter.  The introduction of the plastic bag levy has resulted in reductions from an estimated 328 bags-per-person per-year, prior to the introduction of the levy, to 12 bags-per-person per-year in 2015, of bags subject to the levy.  The EU has since introduced an amendment to the Packaging Directive to control plastic bags.</p>  <p>  At a European level, the European Commission is preparing a Plastics Strategy for publication later this year as part of its Action Plan on the Circular Economy.  The Strategy is intended to address issues such as recyclability, biodegradability, hazardous substances of concern in certain plastics.  </p>  <p>  On marine litter specifically, the Government will continue to work with partners to reduce the amount of plastic entering the riverine and marine environments as litter. My colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, recently committed to introducing legislation which will prohibit the manufacture and sale of certain &lsquo;rinse down the drain&rsquo; products containing plastic microbeads and is supporting related research in the matter.</p></reply>

There are numerous measures under the policy to give effect to minimising the amount of waste consigned to landfill.  The Environment Protection Agency (EPA) is charged with reporting data on waste management, which includes reporting the amount of waste consigned to landfill. A wide range of waste statistics is available on the EPA website (), including information on our performance against targets under the Landfill Directive and other European legislation. </p><p>In addition, annual reports on the implementation of the three Regional Waste Management Plans (2015 to 2021) are available on the respective Regional Waste Management Planning Office websites.  The plans contain targets which cover the areas of prevention, recycling and landfilling. The relevant websites may be accessed at<i></i></p><p>Notwithstanding the substantial progress made in terms of reducing our reliance on landfill from 95% in 1995 to 41% in 2012, I am aware that in 2016 there was insufficient capacity to dispose of residual waste and emergency powers were invoked by the regulatory authorities to make additional landfill capacity available. My Department is working with the three Regional Waste Management Planning Offices and other regulatory bodies to ensure such emergency measures are not required going forward. This will be especially important in terms implementing Government waste, renewable energy and jobs policies and in meeting current and future targets under EU legislation.</p></reply>

The NTA is preparing an Implementation Plan for the delivery of the GDA strategy for the period 2017-2022.</p>  <p>  The DART Expansion Programme also incorporates the DART Underground Tunnel (previously known as the DART Interconnector).  The Government decided in September 2015 that the original proposal for the tunnel should be redesigned to provide a lower cost solution and work is underway on that at present.</p>  <p>  Funding for some elements of the DART Expansion Programme is included in the Government's Capital Plan including funding for the extension of the DART to Balbriggan on the Northern line and for the redesign of the DART Underground Tunnel. </p>  <p>  The NTA in collaboration with Irish Rail has commenced work on the pre-planning stages of the DART Expansion Programme.  A project team has been established and will develop a programme of work that can be delivered on an incremental basis in line with available funding.  Subject to availability of funding and approval of the detailed business case for the project, it is envisaged that the extension of the DART to Balbriggan would commence in 2020.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Underground Tunnel, work has commenced to determine the optimal connection location for the tunnel to tie-in to the Heuston Mainline.  Other work is also ongoing in relation to tunnel variants.</p></reply>

However, I am aware that Tourism Ireland aims to mitigate any adverse impact of Brexit in the British market through implementation of the following policy initiatives:-  In Britain, competitiveness and the value for money message are more important than ever this year. Tourism Ireland is placing a greater focus on its 'culturally curious' audience, who are less impacted by currency fluctuations. It has an extensive, year-long programme in place which includes a greater focus on publicity. It is also undertaking an expanded partnership programme with airlines, ferry operators and tour operators, communicating a strong price-led message to drive home value for money.   -  Market diversification: A key element of Tourism Ireland's strategy since 2014 has been market diversification &ndash; which has seen Mainland Europe become the largest contributor of overseas tourism revenue, followed by the USA. It is continuing to implement its market diversification strategy and this year it intends to maximise holiday revenue through investment in North America and Mainland Europe.</p>  <p>  The major promotional themes for 2017 include the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East, the St Patrick's Day global greening initiative, screen tourism and city breaks. Tourism Ireland is promoting Ireland across a range of marketing platforms, including TV, radio, cinema, print and digital advertising as well as co-operative marketing campaigns with air and sea carriers, tour operators and travel agents. It is also continuing to work closely with tourism businesses from across Ireland at international holiday fairs and promotions, sales missions and business-to-business events.</p></reply>

To advance this commitment, the Deputy might also be aware that I recently announced my intention to establish a Stakeholder Dialogue on the issue of Public Transport.   It is vital that stakeholders have the opportunity to voice their opinions on public transport policy issues and these issues are then considered as part of the formal policy review. I believe that a Stakeholder Dialogue provides the appropriate forum to allow stakeholders to make a meaningful contribution towards policy development. It is also important that the Review will take cognisance of recent developments in other relevant areas of public policy such as the preparation of a new National Planning Framework, the Action Plan for Rural Development, a National Mitigation Plan and Climate Adaption Paper for the transport sector. My Department is currently scoping out the proposed approach to the work. The full Review will then take place as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  With regard to other commitments in the Programme for Government, funding is provided in the Capital Plan to facilitate construction of the new Metro North link commencing in 2021 with a view to delivery by 2026/2027. The Luas Cross City project is on target to be delivered within budget with operations due to commence in the final quarter of 2017. No decisions on any future changes to the rail network, including the Western Rail Corridor will be made before the Government has had the opportunity to consider the result of the NTA's consultation process on the Rail Review.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Programme for Government also commits to making public transport services more accessible for people with disabilities. Accessibility features are built into all new public transport infrastructure projects and vehicles from design stage and there is an ongoing programme to upgrade existing public transport infrastructure and facilities to improve accessibility. My Department is also undertaking a review of the actions in the Sectoral Plan 'Transport for All' and this will be progressed over the coming months.</p></reply>

This would provide a high capacity radial service from this area to the City Centre, sufficient to cater for the high transport demand along this corridor, and would serve Lucan, Liffey Valley and Ballyfermot along its route.</p>  <p>  The Strategy also envisages the development of a Core Bus Network, which would include a range of radial and orbital routes serving Dublin West, and a Bus Rapid Transit scheme linking Blanchardstown with UCD.</p>  <p>  The Capital Plan does not include funding for the  east-west Luas line so it will not be advanced during the period of the current Plan.  The timeline for the project will be determined in the context of Integrated Implementation Plans brought forward by the NTA for implementation of the GDA Transport Strategy and the availability of funding under future Capital funding reviews.</p></reply>

Since then, these branding initiatives have received very considerable public and private investment in capital and marketing expenditure and have been very successful in attracting overseas visitors.   </p>  <p>  My officials have been engaging with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and the Tourism Leadership Group with regard to the possibility of a themed year.  A number of possible themes have been put forward and further consideration is being given to the timing of a themed year.  Ideally, a themed year would be timed to avail of spare capacity, particularly with regard to accommodation, and also with regard to access to Ireland through our air and sea ports.  2016 was a record year for Tourism in Ireland, as was 2015 and 2017 is continuing that trend.  My officials will continue to monitor the tourism trends, along with wider developments (including the impacts of Brexit) and feed that into their consideration of the timing of a themed year.</p></reply>

Irish Rail currently operates one of the most modern fleets in Europe, employing a number of energy efficiency initiatives including technological solutions, driver behavioural change programmes and improved train configurations.  These initiatives increase fuel efficiencies, decrease energy requirements and consequentially lead to a reduction in pollutant and particulate emissions.</p>  <p>  In line with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, a National Mitigation Plan, is currently being developed by Government. I will submit transport sector emissions mitigation measures for inclusion in the plan to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment later this month.  The measures will reflect a multifaceted approach to reducing emissions with a particular focus on investment in public and sustainable transport in order to promote modal shift, supports for alternative fuels (including electrification of heavy rail where it is feasible and cost-effective to do so), and fiscal and taxation incentives to target behavioural change.   </p>  <p>  Rail will play an important role with rail projects supplementing the range of viable low carbon alternatives to the car, particularly in urban areas where high capacity transport plays a vital role in efficient, lower-carbon travel.  A very significant proportion (approximately &euro;1.3 billion) of the overall &euro;3.6 billion of funding available for public transport in the Government's Capital Plan is required for maintenance of the heavy rail network, benefitting the network both within and outside of the Greater Dublin Area (GDA).  A further &euro;250m approximately is provisionally allocated for other improvements to the heavy rail network. </p>  <p>  The Rail Review underwent public consultation earlier this year, enabling a public discussion on the current and future role of rail in Ireland as well as the funding of the rail network and services.  The public consultation process is currently being evaluated.  Rail plays an important role in meeting increased passenger demand and providing an energy efficient mode of transport.  Electrified rail use, in particular, is capable of achieving low emissions through utilising renewable sources of energy.  However, public transport modes are only more environmentally sustainable compared to private cars when they are operating at appropriate levels of occupancy.  A full train produces much fewer emissions per passenger than a large car with 1.5 passengers; however, an under-occupied bus or train emits more emissions per passenger than a full small car.  Accurately matching the right mode of transport to passenger demand is critical in ensuring emission savings.</p></reply>

However, in some instances it may not be possible to use the services of PAS, for example, for certain specialist posts, or where PAS are not in a position to assist due to the volume of campaigns on hand at a particular time.  In such instances a number of our Agencies have availed themselves of the services of external recruitment consultants and the following summarises the process operated in each case.</p>  <p>  When the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) engages outside service providers for recruitment purposes the NSAI provide a job description containing an overview of the post, key tasks and responsibilities, the qualification and experience required and the remuneration of the post.  The NSAI&lsquo;s Grade B is equivalent to the Clerical Officer grade and recruitment to any such vacancies is managed directly by the Agency.</p>  <p>  In the case of Enterprise Ireland (EI), where a recruitment consultant is engaged to source and/or screen applicants on behalf of EI, a detailed job specification for the relevant role is shared with the recruitment consultant at the outset of the engagement.  This job specification outlines the key deliverables of the role and details the key skills and knowledge required to successfully carry out the role.  It is explicit on the job specification as to the criteria (skills, experience and/or qualifications) that are considered essential and the recruitment consultant screens and short-list candidates against these criteria prior to providing a short-list to Enterprise Ireland for a full competency based interview.  Where EI has engaged the services of a recruitment consultant to source and/or screen applicants for Executive Assistant roles (Level B &ndash; equivalent to Clerical Officer), the process outlined above is followed.  In addition, to assess applicants&rsquo; skill levels, specific skills tests are conducted in relation to computer literacy/proficiency and basic clerical skills.  These tests are carried out by the recruitment consultant prior to providing a short-list to Enterprise Ireland for a full competency based interview.</p>  <p>  Where a recruitment consultant is assisting the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) in filling positions, they are instructed to screen applicants in accordance with the essential and desirable qualifications and experience as set out in the job description and on the basis of the competencies for the role as also specified in the job description.</p>  <p>  Where a recruitment consultant has been engaged by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), candidates are screened using the Job Description and Competencies aligned for the grade &ndash; outlining the requirements of the role and also the competencies involved (Competencies taken from PAS); the recruitment consultants then prepare a list of candidates for the CCPC to interview.  This method has been used for the recruitment of Clerical Officers in the CCPC in the past and currently.</p>  <p>  Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) gives the service provider/consultant a verbal brief and a job description which enables them to screen candidates. SFI does not have any staff at Clerical Officer grade or equivalent.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland, PIAB and IAASA, have advised that they do not use external recruitment consultants.</p></reply>

It was designed as a time-bound and co-funded arrangement between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) and The Atlantic Philanthropies (Atlantic), with a total allocation of &euro;29.7 million being provided between the funders on a matched basis between 2013 and 2017.</p>  <p>  The ABC Programme was preceded by the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) (2007-2013) in which the Preparing for Life Programme, along with two other sites: Youngballymun and the Childhood Development Initiative Tallaght participated.  Preparing for Life received &euro;6m as a participant in the PEIP.  The total funding for Preparing for Life under the ABC Programme is &euro;3.74m, bringing the funding received by Preparing for Life under both programmes to &euro;9.74m.</p>  <p>  I welcome the very positive results coming from the evaluation of the Preparing for Life Programme relating to the home visiting and parenting programmes elements, and am aware that a cost study is being carried out at present.</p>  <p>  These evaluation findings and the associated costs will be key in informing the consideration of mainstreaming the learning from the ABC Programme.  The ABC Programme is itself currently being evaluated.  The findings from this national evaluation will be produced in Q2 2018.</p>  <p>  In budget 2016, my Department secured additional funding of &euro;4.5m to extend all of the existing ABC Programme to the end of December 2017.  The current contract for Preparing for Life was due to conclude in August 2017.  My Department has agreed additional funding allocation of &euro;5,843 to extend this contract to the end of December 2017.  It is the intention of my Department to seek additional funding in this year's estimates process, to extend the ABC Programme to the end of August 2018 to align with the national evaluation of the ABC programme.</p>  <p>  My Department is working to ensure that we take full account of the learning from all the interventions across the 13 ABC sites, including Preparing for Life, and the national evaluation.  We will utilise these learnings to inform the delivery of prevention and early intervention initiatives in order to achieve our shared goal of improving the lives of children and families throughout Ireland.</p></reply>

These cases are a mix of children in care or living with their  families, whose  social worker has left, either temporarily or permanently, and new cases. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that all cases that are unallocated are closely monitored, supported and managed by the duty social work team under the supervision of the principal social worker. </p>  <p>  It is a continuing priority of Tusla to address the problem of unallocated cases in 2017.  Tusla currently has 1,480 WTE social workers and an end of 2017 target of 1,520 WTE.  This target is short of the target set in Survival to Sustainability by approximately 100 WTE and reflects the constraints of the social work labour supply.  Funding is in place to address the issue of unallocated cases, however, the recruitment environment for social workers is very challenging.  Tusla is also focusing on intervening at an early stage of a family difficulty through social care and family supports.  I have supported Tusla in the employment of additional social care workers and administrative staff to assist social workers in the course of their duties. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to closely monitor progress in this regard.  I will continue to engage directly with the Tusla Board and senior management team, over the coming weeks and months, to review progress.</p></reply>

The overwhelming majority of historical/retrospective disclosures are about sexual abuse. </p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that Tusla has advised that, at the end of February 2017, there were 1,985 historical/retrospective cases on hand, of which 1,144 were allocated to a social worker, and 841 were awaiting allocation.  An unallocated case is given a high priority where there is information that the person against whom the allegation is made has a child abuse conviction, and a role that brings them into contact with children. </p>  <p>  All child protection referrals which allege current or past criminal activity are referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Tusla&rsquo;s focus is to screen historical/retrospective disclosures for any indication of current risk to children.  Where a risk is identified, or in cases of urgent  need, the disclosure is treated as a child protection referral and acted on accordingly.  Tusla may also assist the person making the allegation to access HSE counselling services.   </p>  <p>  Tusla is engaged in year two of a three year plan to reduce the number of unallocated cases and is expanding the number of social workers it employs.  The funding is in place to achieve this, but the recruitment environment is proving to be challenging.  The Government is committed to helping Tusla to drive forward the reforms necessary to address this unacceptable waiting list.</p></reply>

The Forum has enabled consultation and engagement between the Minister, key Department of Children and Youth Affairs officials, and key representatives of the sector.</p>  <p>  Based on a recommendation from the Minister, members of the Early Years Forum have convened a working group to look at Professionalisation of the Early Years sector  to assist with driving improvements in the quality of services for children.  One area which this group is considering is the possibility of setting up an Early Years Council or professional regulator which would have responsibility, amongst other roles, for registering Early Years practitioners.  Such a Council would take over certain responsibilities currently held by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Education and Skills.  Clearly the establishment of a professional regulator would require legislation and has costs associated with it.  Agreement to progress same would have to be made on a cross Departmental basis and be included in an estimates process.  It is also important to note that the establishment of a professional regulator usually follows from a profession itself advancing professional standards and codes of conduct. </p>  <p>  The Minister looks forward to continuing her engagement with the Early Years Forum on this matter.</p></reply>

To this end, the SFPA has a Service Level Agreement with the Department of Defence to secure efficient enforcement of sea-fisheries law through support provided by the Defence Forces, namely the Naval Service and the Air Corps.  In accordance with this Agreement, an Annual Control Plan is agreed between the parties that sets out the strategy for achieving sea-fisheries control targets each year.  The Naval Service is empowered to board and inspect vessels and their cargos and, when necessary, to formally detain vessels and direct them to port for arrest by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The role of the Naval Service and the Air Corps in support of the SFPA is coordinated by the Fisheries Monitoring Centre which is located at the Naval Base in Haulbowline and is operated by the Naval Service on a 24/7 basis.  </p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence (2015) sets out the investment priorities for the Defence Forces for the next decade.  There has been significant investment in new Naval Service Patrol Vessels over recent years with the commissioning of the L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett in May 2014 , L&Eacute; James Joyce in September 2015 and the L&Eacute; William Butler Yeats in October 2016.  A contract for an additional sister ship was placed in June 2016 at a cost of &euro;54.3m, bringing investment in the new ships programme to over &euro;250 million since 2010.  This fourth ship is scheduled for delivery in mid 2018.  The White Paper on Defence (2015) also provides for the replacement of the Air Corps&rsquo; two CASA 235s Maritime Patrol Aircraft, with consideration of their replacement with larger more capable aircraft.</p>  <p>  The Naval Service and the Air Corps will continue to work closely supporting the SFPA in its work to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing by any vessel in Irish waters.</p></reply>

The plaque or medal would have a bar with the term Veteran inscribed on it.  </p>  <p>  The Veterans&rsquo; Organisations agreed to the proposal to recognise the contribution of veterans in 2016 in this way.  The Defence Forces have been asked to produce mock-up designs of both a plaque and medal which will then be shown to the Veterans&rsquo; Organisations for them to indicate their preference.  I expect that to happen shortly and a ceremony will be arranged thereafter for a formal presentation to the Veterans Associations.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the Representative Associations cannot be affiliated to ICTU.  The basis for the prohibition is that it would be inappropriate to apply the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 to members of the Defence Forces.  The taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service.  This is a long standing policy position taken by respective Governments since the foundation of the State.

Accordingly, the Representative Associations cannot be affiliated to ICTU.  The basis for the prohibition is that it would be inappropriate to apply the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 to members of the Defence Forces.  The taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service.  This is a long standing policy position taken by respective Governments since the foundation of the State.  The Defence Forces may be called on to contribute to maintaining vital services in times of industrial action.  The potential for serious difficulties and conflicts could arise in these circumstances if the Defence Forces Representative Associations were associated with, or affiliated to ICTU, given ICTU rules in relation to such matters. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Conciliation and Arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) provides a formal mechanism for the PDF Representative Associations, RACO and PDFORRA, to engage with the Official side.  The purpose of the scheme is to provide a means for the determination of claims and proposals from the Associations relating to remuneration and conditions of service.</p><p>It is open to the Representative Associations to submit claims to the Official side in relation to matters falling within the C&amp;amp;A scheme.  Generally claims relate to pay and conditions, award of allowances etc.  When submitted, these claims are generally the subject of negotiations and where agreement is not reached it is open to both sides to seek the assistance of an adjudicator to settle the matter. </p><p>  In addition, a framework exists which facilitates the Associations engaging with the official side in talks parallel to those taking place between ICTU and the official side at National level.</p><p>I have received representations from PDFORRA seeking to have access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court made available to them in the event of any future legislative changes being made to provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with access to same.  I am advised that the proposals in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being granted such access will require detailed legislative changes and the Department of Justice and Equality have established a Working Group to examine in detail what future legislative changes are required.</p><p>I remain satisfied with the present arrangements in place for the Defence Forces.  However, in the light of PDFORRA&rsquo;s representations the matter is being kept under review, including in the context of any future arrangements to be made for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>
