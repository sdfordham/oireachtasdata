It must also maintain standards and provide a high  quality service to its residents.</p>  <p>  In this context all such facilities are subject to standards which are set and supervised by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA). Many HSE facilities, particularly older facilities, face significant challenges in this context, and engagement between HIQA and the HSE is ongoing to address the issues arising.</p>  <p>  In 2012 the HSE launched a public consultation process regarding a proposal to consolidate the number of public nursing units in the Midlands.  At the time almost 100 submissions were received and over 60 meetings took place with interested parties, 55 of which were with residents and next of kin. </p>  <p>  The HSE is in the course of considering all of the available relevant information with a view to finalising a recommendation in relation to St. Brigid's Hospital, Shaen and Abbeyleix Community Nursing Unit.</p>  <p>  Abbeyleix CNU currently has 19 beds, 7 of which are occupied by long stay residents, the reminder being short stay and respite.  The HSE is no longer admitting clients to long stay beds, but  the respite service remains open to new clients subject to availability.  There are 16 beds occupied at St. Brigid's Hospital, Shaen, 13 of these are for continuing care and 3 are for respite.  The HSE are no longer admitting clients for either service.</p>  <p>  The Department awaits the HSE's recommendations in respect of both facilities and an announcement will be made as soon as possible once the HSE&rsquo;s definitive position is received.</p></reply>

As part of a comprehensive building programme at the hospital, a new Emergency Department will be completed and operational in 2016.  Pending its completion, a number of initiatives have been put in place to address current limitations for patients and staff.  </p>  <p>  A 22 bed Emergency Department overflow area has been provided, staffed by additional nursing and support staff. </p>  <p>  As part of the Group&rsquo;s escalation plan and in line with best practice, lower acuity in-patients are routinely transferred to Ennis, Nenagh and St. John&rsquo;s, thus freeing up beds in University Hospital Limerick for patients from the Emergency Department. A separate paediatric emergency area has also been opened, providing a separate child friendly environment. </p>  <p>  As well as these initiatives, University of Limerick Hospitals Group has developed several processes to improve emergency services. This includes a daily teleconference for all hospitals in the Group, led by a senior manager, with a focus on patient flow, risks and resource challenges. Multidisciplinary teams are in place to review, plan and manage demand and capacity on a daily basis within the hospital. There is extensive collaboration with the community sector to facilitate the transfer, back to the community or into long term care, of patients whose discharge may otherwise be delayed.</p>  <p>  The HSE, through its Acute Hospitals Directorate and Special Delivery Unit, continues to support the University Hospital Limerick team in developing interim and long term sustainable solutions to deal with bed capacity, excessive trolley waits and overcrowding in the Emergency Department.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-21a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015012100063#WRA00900"><p>Our ambulance services are undergoing significant development and performance is improving.  There has been significant upskilling of ambulance personnel, greater use of technology, improved response times, development of clinical protocols to promote better outcomes and dedicated aeromedical, paediatric and neonatal retrieval services.  There is much development under way to further improve the outcomes achieved by the National Ambulance Service.    </p>  <p>  Response times only measure one aspect of ambulance performance.  The overall goal is to improve outcomes for patients, so that lives are saved and disabilities are avoided.  Response times do not indicate when treatment was commenced or the outcomes achieved by our highly trained paramedics in deploying their skills.  In 2014, the National Ambulance Service introduced a patient outcome target for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, and more are being developed.  These will provide truer measures of the performance of our ambulance service. </p>  <p>  It is important, in any event, to note that response time performance is improving, in spite of increasing demands on services.  In October 2014, ECHO calls, for life-threatening cardiac and respiratory events, rose by 5% compared to 2013 and DELTA calls, for other life-threatening incidents, rose by 10%.  Despite this, an ambulance arrived within the target time for 76% of ECHO calls and 67% of DELTA calls - an improvement of 3.3% and 4% respectively, which means that treatment by paramedics and advanced paramedics is reaching more patients, more quickly. </p>  <p>  Achieving response time targets in rural and some urban settings is difficult for any ambulance service.  In its recent report on ambulance services, HIQA recommended different rural and urban response targets.  I also understand that a draft summary of the National Capacity Review, circulated to the Joint Committee on Health and Children, suggests that the response targets recommended by HIQA cannot be met, even with substantially increased resources.  However, that report is not finalised and I cannot give a considered view at this stage.  </p>  <p>  In 2015, a &euro;5.4m budget increase will help improve services, particularly in the west, by reforming rostering and staffing additional stations.  The Emergency Aeromedical Service has completed over 800 missions, and will continue to provide rapid access to treatment for very ill patients.  We will also expand community first response, particularly in more rural and sparsely populated areas.</p>  <p>  We are working to improve the service though the finalisation of the single national control centre.  The Intermediate Care Service continues to free up frontline ambulances, and we are focussed on improving hospital turnaround times.</p>  <p>  The three current reviews of our ambulance service will provide us with very good information to improve services.  I have  asked the HSE to prepare an action plan on completion of the three reports, with timelines to realise a new vision for our ambulance services, which will build upon recent achievements.</p></reply>

They are not political or ministerial decisions. </p>  <p>  This drug Eculizumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria or PNH.  It is considered to be one of the most expensive drugs in the world.</p>  <p>  I understand that in 2010 the HSE entered into an interim Access with Evidence Development Agreement between the company Alexion Pharma and St James's Hospital to treat 10 patients with this drug.  The interim agreement was put in place with the expectation that future evidence would emerge which would assist with the future decision making on this drug.</p>  <p>  The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Eculizumab in the GMS and community drugs scheme.  In accordance with agreed procedures the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Eculizumab.</p>  <p>  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics published an evaluation of the medicine in October 2013 which found that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of this drug and reimbursement would have an estimated cumulative gross budget impact for the HSE of &euro;33 million over 5 years.  Consequently the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics was unable to recommend reimbursement of the product under the community drugs scheme.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the pharmacoeconomic evaluation of this drug, in recognition of the burden of illness experienced by those with PNH, the HSE has been engaging with the manufacturer, Alexion Pharma, for some time in seeking to arrive at a price that would assist it in its desire to fund this medicine for as many patients as possible within the resources available.  </p>  <p>  The price being offered at present would involve the medicine in question costing &euro;420,000 per annum for each additional patient treated, with treatment continuing over a person's lifetime in most cases.</p>  <p>  The HSE's engagement with the company has now been concluded. The Executive is considering the outcome of that engagement and I expect that the HSE will shortly make its determination.  It is regrettable that to date the company has not been able to provide this drug at a more sustainable price to the HSE to reflect the clinical evidence. </p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that I fully understand the concerns of patients regarding the availability of this drug and that every effort is being made to achieve a satisfactory outcome.  While I appreciate that some may take the view that the taxpayer should reimburse every licensed medicine for whatever the price the drug company demands, the better interests of the health service require that we reimburse only the most effective medicines and only at a fair price.</p></reply>

All hospitals, including Naas General Hospital, have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care. These plans include the opening of additional overflow areas, reopening of closed beds, provision of additional diagnostic scans and Consultants doing additional ward rounds to improve the appropriate flow of patients through the hospital system.   </p>  <p>  The recent provision of Community Intervention services for Naas General Hospital, in particular the provision of IV Antibiotic therapy in patients homes, has avoided approximately 89 admissions to the hospital since service commenced in the last two weeks.  In addition, the HSE is developing a substantial infrastructure project at Naas General Hospital which includes an endoscopy unit, oncology unit and physical medicine department.  It is anticipated that construction will commence in the second half of 2015, subject to the awarding of planning permission.</p>  <p>  The total number of beds available as of October 2014 is 12,483.  However, these are beds available at a particular date in time and this number can fluctuate over time due to reasons such as ongoing refurbishment and maintenance work.  The total number of step down beds in public residential units as of end December 2014 is 1,869. However it should be noted that vacant nursing home beds are not always located where needed. The Government has provided additional funding of &euro;3 million in 2014 and &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges and actions being taken include the provision of additional home care packages, additional transition beds in nursing homes, 300 additional Fair Deal places and an extension in Community Intervention Teams.  </p>  <p>  I convened the Emergency Department Taskforce last month to find long term solutions to overcrowding by providing additional focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by the current trolley waits. Following a second meeting last week, the HSE is working on an action plan to be finalised by the end of the month to specifically address ED issues with a view to a significant reduction in trolley waits over the course of 2015.</p></reply>

In practice, geriatricians will provide an extended service to the community by way of undertaking clinics in a variety of settings including community hospitals, rehabilitation facilities and primary care centres. This type of outreach service provided in an integrated manner is a significant support to community services and to maintaining older people in their own homes and communities.  </p>  <p>  Historically, consultant geriatrician appointments were made to acute hospitals and thereafter community links, including provision of dedicated sessions, were put in place once the geriatrician was in post.  In more recent years, fuller consideration of such sessions has been undertaken in advance of appointment and the particular community duties of the post have formed part of the recruitment process.</p>  <p>  It is the intention of the HSE to develop an integrated care programme for older people in 2015 which will examine the variety of ways that consultant geriatricians currently work across hospital and community and to determine what is the most effective way to do so into the future.</p>  <p>  There are currently 8 nurse-led Community Intervention Teams nationally. These teams are not specific to older people but in practice much of the service provided is intended to support older people and avoid or reduce a hospital stay.  New teams are being implemented in Naas, Drogheda and Waterford with an additional 8,000 patients planned to be treated nationally by such teams in 2015.</p></reply>

These are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the Health Service Executive on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics. <br/><br/>The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine in the GMS and community drugs schemes. The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association for the assessment of new medicines. <br/><br/>In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and a fair price for Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website (). <br/><br/>On foot of this, the HSE decided that it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. <br/><br/>It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE for the inclusion of Fampridine on the community drugs schemes incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of the drug, by offering a reduced price or both.  A revised application was received by the HSE on 25th July 2014. The HSE has since been engaging with the company seeking an improved commercial offering. These engagements have been completed and the HSE is now considering the outcome of those commercial engagements. Fampridine will be assessed along with a range of other applications for reimbursement of medicines for multiple sclerosis and other diseases.</p></reply>

There has been significant upskilling of ambulance personnel, greater use of technology, improved response times, development of clinical protocols to promote better outcomes and dedicated aeromedical, paediatric and neonatal retrieval services.  There is much development under way to further improve the outcomes achieved by the National Ambulance Service.    </p>  <p>  Response times only measure one aspect of ambulance performance.  The overall goal is to improve outcomes for patients, so that lives are saved and disabilities are avoided.  Response times do not indicate when treatment was commenced or the outcomes achieved by our highly trained paramedics in deploying their skills.  In 2014, the National Ambulance Service introduced a patient outcome target for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, and more are being developed.  These will provide truer measures of the performance of our ambulance service. </p>  <p>  It is important, in any event, to note that response time performance is improving, in spite of increasing demands on services.  In October 2014, ECHO calls, for life-threatening cardiac and respiratory events, rose by 5% compared to 2013 and DELTA calls, for other life-threatening incidents, rose by 10%.  Despite this, an ambulance arrived within the target time for 76% of ECHO calls and 67% of DELTA calls - an improvement of 3.3% and 4% respectively, which means that treatment by paramedics and advanced paramedics is reaching more patients, more quickly. </p>  <p>  Achieving response time targets in rural and some urban settings is difficult for any ambulance service.  In its recent report on ambulance services, HIQA recommended different rural and urban response targets.  I also understand that a draft summary of the National Capacity Review, circulated to the Joint Committee on Health and Children, suggests that the response targets recommended by HIQA cannot be met, even with substantially increased resources.  However, that report is not finalised and I cannot give a considered view at this stage.  </p>  <p>  In 2015, a &euro;5.4m budget increase will help improve services, particularly in the west, by reforming rostering and staffing additional stations.  The Emergency Aeromedical Service has completed over 800 missions, and will continue to provide rapid access to treatment for very ill patients.  We will also expand community first response, particularly in more rural and sparsely populated areas.</p>  <p>  We are working to improve the service though the finalisation of the single national control centre.  The Intermediate Care Service continues to free up frontline ambulances, and we are focussed on improving hospital turnaround times.</p>  <p>  The three current reviews of our ambulance service will provide us with very good information to improve services.  I have asked the HSE to prepare an action plan on completion of the three reports, with timelines to realise a new vision for our ambulance services, which will build upon recent achievements.</p></reply>

These plans include the opening of additional overflow areas, reopening of closed beds, provision of additional diagnostic scans and Consultants doing additional ward rounds to improve the appropriate flow of patients through the hospital system.  The Government has provided additional funding of &euro;3 million in 2014 and &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges and actions being taken include the provision of additional home care packages, additional transition beds in nursing homes, 300 additional Fair Deal places and an extension in Community Intervention Teams.  </p>  <p>  It is undeniable that in recent years beds have been closed as services develop in acute hospitals.  However, we need to move from the current hospital centric model of care towards a new model of integrated care which treats patients at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient, and as close to home as possible.  This objective would not be best served by the permanent reopening of many of these beds.  The management of competing demands for emergency and scheduled care requires changes in how and where patients are treated.  The movement of care and treatment from in-patient to day case and from day case to OPD is most important as is ensuring the appropriate ratio of new to return appointments, reducing unnecessary return appointments.</p>  <p>  Improved collaboration across hospitals and between acute, primary and community care has shown clearly that much can be achieved by encouraging local leadership, management, staff and unions to develop a common understanding of the issues and solutions which apply to their own hospitals and supporting them to implement appropriate responses. Following a second meeting of the ED Taskforce last week, the HSE is working on an action plan to be finalised by the end of the month to specifically address ED issues with a view to a significant reduction in trolley waits over the course of 2015.</p></reply>

The number of acute beds available can fluctuate greatly over time for various reasons, including ongoing refurbishment and maintenance work.<br/><br/>While the number of resourced acute hospital beds is clearly an important factor in meeting service demand, acute hospital care is just one component of a healthcare delivery system.  The understanding and focus has shifted to a more holistic approach in which the aim is to provide services for  the patient or service user in the right place in the system where his/her needs can best be met.  As set out in <i>Future Health  - A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012-2015,</i>the Programme for Government has committed to a fundamental reform of our health services.  Key to achieving this is the need to move from the current hospital centric model of care towards a new model of integrated care which treats patients at the lowest level of complexity which is safe, timely, efficient, and as close to home as possible. <br/><br/>The HSE National Clinical Strategy and Programmes will commence the development of Integrated Care Programmes in 2015 that will provide the framework for the management and delivery of health services which will ensure that patients and clients receive a continuum of preventative, diagnostic, care and support services, according to their needs over time and across different levels of the health system. <br/><br/>The formation of Irish acute hospitals into Hospital Groups, each with its own governance and management, will provide an optimum configuration for hospital services to deliver high quality, safe patient care in a cost effective manner.  In essence, the majority of patients, those who require only a routine straight forward level of urgent or planned care should be safely managed locally, with treatment being delivered at home or as close to home as possible.  Those who require true emergency or complex planned care can and should be safely managed in larger hospitals where all the relevant clinical expertise can be provided with consultant delivered high quality care available round the clock.</p></reply>

My Department is working with the HSE to put in place a plan to eliminate very long waiters by the end of the year.  This will involve both productivity improvement and rigorous waiting list management.  Further increasing day case surgery rates for specific procedures will be important in improving elective access within available capacity.  Priority will be given to adherence to the guidelines in relation to the scheduling of patients for surgery, including chronological scheduling, and this will be monitored by the HSE throughout the year.</p>  <p>  The management of competing demands for emergency and scheduled care requires changes in how and where patients are treated.  The movement of care and treatment from in-patient to day case and from day case to Outpatient Departments is most important, as is ensuring the appropriate ratio of new to return appointments, reducing unnecessary return appointments.  Limiting elective surgery in preparation for, or as a response to, increased Emergency Department attendances is intended to help manage the need for immediate emergency or trauma care.  Where it is necessary to prioritise cancer and other complex cases, the HSE assures me that this is being done.  Inevitably this will affect waiting lists.  The challenge is to minimise the need for cancellation at short notice and to manage the impact of such cancellations effectively, within the hospital and in collaboration with other hospitals.</p>  <p>  As I have stated publicly in the context of significant emergency pressures currently being experienced by hospitals, realistically I do not envisage significant improvement in elective waiting times in the early part of the year. However based upon the high priority attached to this area in the HSE Service Plan and the first overall increase in the HSE budget in 7 years, it is expected that improvement will occur later in the year.</p></reply>

Every person who uses our disability services is entitled to expect and receive supports of the highest standard and to live in an atmosphere of safety and care.  <br/><br/>The safeguarding and protection of vulnerable people in the care of the health service is of paramount importance and the Director General of the HSE has written to all staff instructing them to take personal responsibility for ensuring that individuals supported by the HSE in any setting are treated with dignity and respect.<br/><br/>In December 2014 the HSE initiated both an expert investigation chaired by Mr Christy Lynch, and an independently chaired review of services at this facility led by Dr Kevin McCoy. <br/><br/>Mr Lynch&rsquo;s investigation team is working independently of the HSE and will form an important input into any disciplinary process which the HSE will undertake.<br/><br/>Dr McCoy is undertaking an Assurance Review of the services at &Aacute;ras Attracta and the final report will include an individual plan for improvement in each bungalow within the complex.  The review will identify system wide learning involving engagement with relevant expertise as well as input from staff.  <br/><br/>I welcome the fact that the Garda&iacute; have now cleared the way so that Mr. Lynch&rsquo;s investigation can commence.  I have asked the HSE to keep me informed of progress.<br/><br/>The HSE has undertaken a number of additional initiatives to ensure that quality and safe care in residential services for people with disabilities is appropriately implemented and monitored. <br/><br/>A six-step plan will address this in a systematic way. These steps are:<br/><br/>- The establishment of a National Implementation Taskforce, including a series of National Summits to improve client safety, dignity, respect and  culture; <br/><br/>- Implementation of the <i>National Policy &amp;amp; Procedures on Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse</i>;<br/><br/>- Development of an Advocacy programme;<br/><br/>- Implementation of an evaluation and quality improvement programme in disability residential centres;<br/><br/>- Development of an implementation plan for any recommendations arising from the McCoy review of residential services in &Aacute;ras Attracta when complete, and,<br/><br/>- Development of long term sustainable &amp;amp; evidence-based safeguarding practices and training programmes specific to residential settings.<br/><br/>The HSE is considering plans to monitor practices in social care facilities through the use of surveillance cameras, undercover persons and /or other means. However, it is very conscious of potential difficulties that could arise in relation to privacy and data protection, and given the complex issues involved, has decided to engage expert consultants to advise it on the best way to proceed.  A Prior Information Notice under EU procurement rules was published in mid-December in this regard.<br/><br/>I can assure the Deputy that my Department will monitor progress on the initiatives and processes commissioned by the HSE in relation to &Aacute;ras Attracta, to ensure that the learning from this incident is promulgated throughout our health system.</p></reply>

For ECHO and DELTA calls (life threatening conditions), the 2015 response time target is for 80% of calls to get a patient-carrying vehicle on scene within 19 minutes.  The latest published data shows that, in October, the volume of ECHO calls rose by 5% compared to the same period in 2013, with DELTA calls up 10%.  The response time was met for 76% of ECHO and 67% of DELTA calls.  This is an improvement of 3.3% and 4% respectively on 2013. </p>  <p>  Response time targets only measure one aspect of ambulance performance and should be part of a suite of assessments.  Internationally, many services are moving to patient outcomes as a better indicator of performance.  The National Ambulance Service introduced a patient outcome target for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in 2014, and more are being developed.</p>  <p>  Achieving response time targets in rural settings is a difficult task for any ambulance service.  HIQA has acknowledged, in its own report, our geographic challenges and has recommended different rural and urban response time targets.  While that issue is under consideration, we are adapting ambulance services for the needs of rural populations through, for example, the use of rapid response vehicles and the Emergency Aeromedical Support Service (EAS).  The EAS has been very successful and has provided rapid access to appropriate treatment for very high acuity patients, where this may be have been difficult to achieve by road.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to strive to improve rural response times.  A &euro;5.4 million budget increase in 2015 will help address service gaps, particularly in the west, by reforming rostering and staffing additional stations.  We will also expand the number of Community First Response teams, especially in rural and sparsely populated areas.   The Intermediate Care Service, for non-emergency clinical transport, continues to free up frontline ambulances, and their highly paramedic staff for emergencies. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that, as well as the recent HIQA report, two other major reports on ambulance services, on national capacity and Dublin services, will be published shortly.  All three reports, when taken together, will provide us with very good information which will help drive service improvement.  I have therefore asked the HSE to prepare an action plan on completion of the three reports, with timelines to realise a new vision for our ambulance services.</p></reply>

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating.  The commonest noticeable evidence of infection is a rash called erythema migrans that is seen in about 80-90% of patients.</p>  <p>  Lyme borelliosis is diagnosed by a medical history and physical examination and can be difficult if there has been no erythema migrans rash.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies to B. burgdorferi produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step.  Screening EIA's can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other spirochaete infections including syphilis, and certain viral infections including glandular fever.  In addition, sera from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results.  Samples giving reactive or equivocal tests in screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage immunoblot (Western blot) tests.  Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity.  Using this outlined two stage approach will give a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme Disease. Testing for Lyme borelliosis is currently undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland.</p>  <p>  There is an ongoing publicity campaign regarding Lyme Disease.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE is establishing a Lyme Borelliosis Sub-Committee with the primary aim to examine best practice in prevention and surveillance of Lyme Disease and to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise harm caused by Lyme borelliosis in Ireland.  This will involve raising awareness among clinicians and the general public.  It will explore ways to ensure these messages are brought to the general public with the frequency and in forms in which they can be most effective. </p>  <p>  Each year, as part of its ongoing awareness raising regarding prevention and treatment of Lyme Disease, the HPSC holds a Lyme Disease Awareness Week in which media releases are sent out with the intention that media outlets would take up the important Lyme prevention messages.  As part of last year's Awareness Week, a supply of information was made available to the public and attention was drawn to a "Tickborn Disease Toolkit", developed by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC).  This toolkit was modified for use in Ireland and posted on the HPSC website.  Indeed, the ECDC informed the HPSC that Ireland was the first European Member State to make such extensive use of this material.

These measures are based on the recommendations contained in the <i>Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy</i>, 2012.  The package of measures to be implemented will include provision for minimum unit pricing, regulation of the marketing and advertising of alcohol, regulation of sports sponsorship, structural separation of alcohol from other products in mixed trading outlets and labelling of alcohol products.  Work on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation is continuing and I hope to publish a General Scheme of a Bill early this year.</p></reply>

To manage the available funds throughout the year, the HSE operates a national placement list in order of when the applications are approved, and funding is released in strict chronological order as it becomes available.</p>  <p>  As of 5 January 2015 (the latest figures available) there are 1,188 people on this placement list.  The current wait time for funding is approximately 11 weeks.</p>  <p>  The budget for the Scheme in 2015 is &euro;948.8m which reflects an increase of &euro;10m from the 2014 position.  The additional &euro;10m was allocated to the Scheme as part of a wider initiative to alleviate the problem of delayed discharges in acute hospitals and has resulted in 300 extra approvals under the Scheme to date.  In total since December 2014 funding has been released to provide for 1,200 places.</p>  <p>  Further to this in July of 2014, the HSE allocated &euro;5m for an initiative to improve access to appropriate care for older people.  To date this has funded over 300 transitional care beds for patients in acute hospitals who are on the Nursing Homes Support Scheme national placement list.</p>  <p>  Since the Nursing Homes Support Scheme commenced in October 2009, 56,989 applications for funding under the Scheme have been received.  In 2014, 22,061 people were funded under the Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme which is currently in progress will include consideration of the balance between community and residential services as well as the future financing and sustainability of the Scheme.

Every person who uses our disability services is entitled to expect and receive supports of the highest standard and to live in an atmosphere of safety and care.  <br/><br/>The safeguarding and protection of vulnerable people in the care of the health service is of paramount importance and the Director General of the HSE has written to all staff instructing them to take personal responsibility for ensuring that individuals supported by the HSE in any setting are treated with dignity and respect.<br/><br/>In December 2014 the HSE initiated both an expert investigation chaired by Mr Christy Lynch, and an independently chaired review of services at this facility led by Dr Kevin McCoy. <br/><br/>Mr Lynch&rsquo;s investigation team is working independently of the HSE and will form an important input into any disciplinary process which the HSE will undertake  .<br/><br/>Dr McCoy is undertaking an Assurance Review of the services at &Aacute;ras Attracta and the final report will include an individual plan for improvement in each bungalow within the complex.  The review will identify system wide learning involving engagement with relevant expertise as well as input from staff.  <br/><br/>I welcome the fact that the Garda&iacute; have now cleared the way so that Mr. Lynch&rsquo;s investigation can commence.  I have asked the HSE to keep me informed of progress.<br/><br/>The HSE has undertaken a number of additional initiatives to ensure that quality and safe care in residential services for people with disabilities is appropriately implemented and monitored. <br/><br/>A six-step plan will address this in a systematic way.  These steps are:<br/><br/>- The establishment of a National Implementation Taskforce, including a series of National Summits to improve client safety, dignity, respect and culture;<br/><br/>- Implementation of the <i>National Policy &amp;amp; Procedures on Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse</i>;<br/><br/>- Development of an Advocacy programme;<br/><br/>- Implementation of an evaluation and quality improvement programme in disability residential centres;<br/><br/>- Development of an implementation plan for any recommendations arising from the McCoy review of residential services in &Aacute;ras Attracta when complete, and,<br/><br/>- Development of long term sustainable &amp;amp; evidence-based safeguarding practices and training programmes specific to residential settings.<br/><br/>The HSE is considering plans to monitor practices in social care facilities through the use of surveillance cameras, undercover persons and/or other means.  However, it is very conscious of potential difficulties that could arise in relation to privacy and data protection, and given the complex issues involved, has decided to engage expert consultants to advise it on the best way to proceed.  A Prior Information Notice under EU procurement rules was published in mid-December in this regard.<br/><br/>I can assure the Deputy that my Department will monitor progress on the initiatives and processes commissioned by the HSE in relation to &Aacute;ras Attracta, to ensure that the learning from this incident is promulgated throughout our health system.</p></reply>

These plans include the opening of additional overflow areas, reopening of closed beds, provision of additional diagnostic scans and Consultants doing additional ward rounds to improve the appropriate flow of patients through hospitals.</p>  <p>  The Government has provided additional funding of &euro;3 million in 2014 and &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges and actions being taken include the provision of additional home care packages, additional transition beds in nursing homes, 300 additional Fair Deal places and an extension in Community Intervention Teams.  Where it is necessary to prioritise emergency and trauma surgery, cancer and complex non-urgent cases, the HSE assures me that this is being done.  Inevitably this will affect waiting lists and waiting times.  The challenge is to minimise the need for cancellation at short notice and to manage the impact of such cancellations effectively, within the hospital and in collaboration with other hospitals.  It may be necessary to increase elective activity in the summer. </p>  <p>  I convened the Emergency Department Taskforce last month to develop long term solutions to overcrowding by providing additional focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by the current trolley waits.  My Department and the HSE are currently working together on a plan which will ensure that trolley waits are contained throughout the year, operational arrangements within acute hospitals and across acute and community are designed and implemented consistently so as to contribute to sustainable improvement into the future and there is a strong basis to evaluate and manage performance.</p></reply>

All hospitals, including Beaumont have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care.  These plans include the opening of additional overflow areas, reopening of closed beds, provision of additional diagnostic scans and Consultants doing additional ward rounds to improve the appropriate flow of patients through the hospital system.  </p>  <p>  Beaumont Hospital has undertaken a number of initiatives to improve the patient pathway both through the ED and the hospital, in addition to working closely with the community.  All available bed capacity is open and off-site capacity is also being utilised.  Elective surgeries (with the exception of cancer cases) have been cancelled and this option is being kept under constant review.</p>  <p>  The Government has provided additional funding of &euro;3 million in 2014 and &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges and actions being taken include the provision of additional home care packages, additional transition beds in nursing homes, 300 additional Fair Deal places and an extension in Community Intervention Teams.</p>  <p>  I convened the Emergency Department Taskforce last month to find long term solutions to overcrowding by providing additional focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by the current trolley waits.  Following a second meeting last week, the HSE is working on an action plan to be finalised by the end of the month to specifically address ED issues with a view to a significant reduction in trolley waits over the course of 2015.</p></reply>

Hospitals are expected to accept all patient referrals and prioritise on the basis of strict chronological order, other than in cases of evidenced clinical urgency including relevant cancer cases.  It is not unreasonable for larger tertiary referral centres to query why patients are bypassing recently developed suitable services in hospitals closer to them.  Attendance at the larger centre may well result in the patient travelling longer distances, to a hospital which is under greater pressure and may have longer outpatient waiting times. </p>  <p>  The Special Delivery Unit protocol on the management of outpatient services sets out the process for referral and management of outpatient services.  The protocol also helps to maximise efficiency and reduce duplications.  In any instance where a decision has been made to refuse referrals, each hospital Clinical Director has to be apprised of the situation and the decision to issue notice to GPs should be done by the senior management team, within the context of good clinical governance. </p>  <p>  Improving waiting lists for in patient and day case treatment is a key priority for me and for the Government.  My Department is working with the HSE to put in place a plan to eliminate very long waiters by the end of the year.  This will involve both productivity improvement and rigorous waiting list management.  Further increasing day case surgery rates for specific procedures will be important in improving elective access within available capacity.  Priority will be given to adherence to the guidelines in relation to the scheduling of patients for surgery, including chronological scheduling, and this will be monitored by the HSE throughout the year.  </p>  <p>  The management of competing demands for emergency and scheduled care requires changes in how and where patients are treated.  The movement of care and treatment from in-patient to day case and from day case to Outpatient Departments is most important, as is ensuring the appropriate ratio of new to return appointments, reducing unnecessary return appointments.  Limiting elective surgery in preparation for, or as a response to, increased Emergency Department attendances is intended to help manage the need for immediate emergency or trauma care.  Where it is necessary to prioritise cancer and other complex cases, the HSE assures me that this is being done.  Inevitably this will affect waiting lists.  The challenge is to minimise the need for cancellation at short notice and to manage the impact of such cancellations effectively, within the hospital and in collaboration with other hospitals.  As I have stated publicly in the context of significant emergency pressures currently being experienced by hospitals, realistically I do not envisage significant improvement in elective waiting times in the early part of the year.  However based upon the high priority attached to this area in the HSE Service Plan and the first overall increase in the HSE budget in 7 years, it is expected that improvement will occur later in the year.</p></reply>

In 2013 HIQA issued a regulatory notice in relation to Standard 25, which addresses the physical environment, advising the sector that <i>&ldquo;where particular criteria regarding premises are not met in the Centre, the provider must provide clear evidence of the other ways by which they are reaching the Standard and must demonstrate to the Chief Inspector that these alternative arrangements are delivering on the Standard for each individual resident. In the case of Standard 25, the Chief Inspector will require substantial and exceptional justification for any premises which purports to meet Standard 25 without implementation of the individual criteria.&rdquo;  </i><br/><br/>Registration renewals for the majority of public nursing homes are due from the middle of this year.  Bearing in mind their age and structure, public nursing homes face real challenges and require investment in excess of the funding that will be available in the short to medium term.<br/><br/>It is important that we do everything possible to apply appropriate standards to all facilities.  It is also important to recognise that publicly-run facilities provide bed capacity which is critically needed by older people, particularly by those with high or complex care needs for whom public facilities are often the only place that can meet their needs.  Notwithstanding the problems that some facilities face with structures and facilities, the vast majority of their residents receive excellent levels of care.  Without these public facilities many older people would simply have nowhere to go, other than our acute hospitals which are already under pressure.<br/><br/>Discussions are ongoing between the HSE and HIQA on the issues that arise for facilities around the country in applying the relevant statutory provision.</p></reply>

In 2013 catering non pay cost in the HSE owned hospitals and residences was approximately &euro;54m.  The HSE National Procurement Office seeks to negotiate national contracts for food and catering products.  Professionally qualified catering managers are employed in all of the HSE run hospitals and residences to ensure that catering services are provided to a high standard appropriate to the clientele availing of the service.  This will include engagement with key stakeholders on the issue of patient and staff/visitor food; reviewing current hospital food guidelines and practice; establishing best practice, policy and developing an implementation plan. <br/><br/><b>Hospital and Patient Food Policy and implementation plan</b><br/><br/>The HSE has advised that the Health and Wellbeing Division has recently appointed a National Dietetic Adviser to lead on work in this area for the Division.  This role will provide expert leadership guidance and support in the context of the delivery of<i>Healthy Ireland</i>and in implementing the actions set out in the HSE&rsquo;s Service Plan and the Health and Wellbeing Division&rsquo;s Operational Plan 2015.  This will include the development of a Hospital and Patient Food Policy and implementation plan in consultation with colleagues across the service. <br/><br/><b>HSE Policy initiatives </b><br/><br/>A procurement policy in relation to fresh, dried, and frozen food has been developed.  A Healthy Vending machine policy was approved by the HSE in 2014 and is in the process of being introduced.  The policy covers all cold soft drinks, confectionery and snack vending machines (including fruit products) which must carry a greater provision of clearly labelled &ldquo;Better Choice&rdquo; and &ldquo;Other Choice&rdquo; food and drink products to make the healthy choice the easier choice in all HSE facilities.  The purpose of the policy is to promote healthy vended food and drink options to the public and HSE staff using HSE facilities.<br/><br/>Calorie posting on menus is being rolled out &ndash; a policy has been developed and is in an approval process at present. All vended products will be calorie posted as part of the Healthy Vending machine policy.<br/><br/><b>Strategic initiatives - </b><b><i>Healthy Ireland</i></b><b>Implementation Plans </b><br/><br/>In addition the Saolta (formerly West North West Hospital Group) 3 year implementation plan for <i>Healthy Ireland</i>outlines the breadth of work that is to be implemented and recommends that &ldquo;the groups would undertake a review of nutritional adequacy and quality of hospital food for staff and patients and agree nutritional standards in line with policy document &quot;Food and Nutritional care in Hospitals &ndash;Guidelines for Preventing under Nutrition in Acute Hospital&rdquo;.  These guidelines will sit hand in hand with policies for staff and visitors such as the vending machine policy and calories posting on menus. It will also encompass food provision for staff at meetings.<br/><br/>Other site specific plans for Hospital Groups and CHOs will be developed in a three year implementation plans as they emerge.  This will address actions relating to the provision of healthy and nutritious food across HSE facilities.<br/><br/>The HSE also fund and support the work of the Irish Heart Foundation in delivering the Happy Heart at Work Healthy Eating Award.

This work includes considering the best way to make medical aids and appliances available to persons who do not hold a medical card, the provision of services to children with severe disabilities, and to enable people with particular needs to have these met on an individual basis rather than awarding a medical card to all family members.</p></reply>

Further, in December 2009, the European Court of Human Rights heard a case brought by three women in respect of the alleged breach of their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights in regard to abortion in Ireland.

Since January 5th 2015, the HSE has been working to match patients whose acute care has been completed but who require ongoing residential care with suitable placements.

The HSE has appointed a senior manager to lead the reform of the systems for handling medical card application and reviews. </p>  <p>  The HSE is developing a single, integrated process for people to apply for a medical card, a GP visit card, the Long-Term Illness Scheme and the Drugs Payment Scheme. Access points will be established around the country in health offices to support and assist people to make applications. </p>  <p>  The HSE is taking steps to establish a clinical advisory group to develop a methodology and guidance for the assessment of applications involving significant medical conditions so as to take account of the burden involved and the needs arising from the condition and to ensure that appropriate services are provided to people who need them. </p>  <p>  The Minister and I have asked the HSE to examine, with the Department of Health, the best way to meet the needs of people with significant medical conditions who need the support of the public health system. This work includes considering the best way to make medical aids and appliances available to persons who do not hold a medical card, the provision of services to children with severe disabilities, and to enable people with particular needs to have these met on an individual basis rather than awarding a medical card to all family members.</p></reply>

While these guidelines refer to specific disabilities, if we take steps to routinely provide accessible services for all, we will positively influence the experience of everybody who uses our services.</p>  <p>  The guidelines, developed in conjunction with the National Disability Authority, will help all staff to build on their existing knowledge and to recognise that people with disabilities are often experts in what they need.  The key message reinforced throughout the guidelines is Ask, Listen, Learn, Plan and Do.  </p>  <p>  The issue in accessible health services is not a requirement for additional funding or a right to services. It is part of a wider universal access agenda across all public services.  The appointment of access officers throughout the country will embed improvements in the quality of our health services.  Given that health and social services are provided in hundreds of locations throughout the country, access officers are necessary where there are service users, patients and clients e.g. in hospitals, primary care centres, health and social care clinics or other locations where health and social care is delivered. A plan for the appointment and training of access officers is underway for 2015.</p>  <p>  The first challenge is to acknowledge that access is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility.  The second challenge is to help staff understand that access is about more than wheelchair ramps and automated doors - it is about the big and the small things - how consent is obtained, how medication is explained, how appointments are managed and assigned, how bad news is broken - whether a person is blind, deaf or hard of hearing, has autism, an intellectual disability or any other condition.</p></reply>

The performance management system applying to all HSE staff can be found within the Staff and Benefits section of the HSE website. It should be noted that top-level management in the HSE (National Directors) are line-managed personally by the Director General.  </p>  <p>  The Consultant Contract 2008 provides for a structured work planning and performance management mechanism at Appendix III &lsquo;Clinical Directorate Service Plan&rsquo;. In addition, the Contract requires that consultants:</p>  <p>  - &ldquo;co-operate in giving effect to such arrangements as are put into place to verify the delivery of the Consultant&rsquo;s contractual commitments. </p>  <p>  - &ldquo;are subject to statutory and regulatory requirements and corporate policies and procedures.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  - &ldquo;participate in development of and undertake all duties and functions pertinent to the Consultant&rsquo;s area of competence, as set out within the Clinical Directorate Service Plan </p>  <p>  - &ldquo;ensure that duties and functions are undertaken in a manner that minimises delays for patients and possible disruption of services.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  - &ldquo;work within the framework of the hospital / agency&rsquo;s service plan and/or levels of service (volume, types etc.) as determined by the Employer. </p>  <p>  - "the contract also provides that service planning for individual clinical services will be progressed through the Clinical Directorate structure or other arrangements as apply.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  - &ldquo;formally review the execution of the Clinical Directorate Service Plan with the Clinical Director / Employer periodically. </p>  <p>  In addition, the agreement between health service management, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and the Irish Medical Organisation under the Public Service Agreement entitled &lsquo;Consultants Implementing the Public Service Agreement &ndash; 17th September 2012&rsquo; introduced strengthened working arrangements for consultants.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced in Budget 2014 that he intends to delegate greater autonomy to Departments and Agencies to manage their own staffing levels.  The change from the application of a rigid employment control framework, with its particular focus on a moratorium on recruitment and compliance with employment ceilings and targets, to a system where the HSE must manage their staffing within an overall pay budget framework will allow for recruitment where it is determined that this can achieve more economical service delivery. </p>  <p>  In this regard the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has requested that the HSE and Department of Health submit a 2015 Pay and Numbers Strategy to support the move to the new framework.  Following approval of the strategy by DPER, a letter of delegated sanction for staffing will be issued.</p></reply>

I have therefore written last week to the President of the Board of NMBI and asking that options be explored to bring a resolution to issues surrounding the annual retention fee.  I recognise that the Board must meet its obligations within the financial resources available. At the same time this demands that obligations are met on the most economic basis possible and all planned expenditure can be demonstrated as necessary. </p>  <p>  I have again requested that the Board of NMBI re-engage in discussions with the staff associations, as a matter of urgency. An outcome must be found which secures the Board&rsquo;s minimum financial operating requirements but avoids a scenario where nurses and midwives are removed from the Register for non-payment of fees with potential consequences for service availability.</p>  <p>  I will continue to monitor the situation closely in the interests of patient safety and continuity of care. </p>  <p>  I have offered that both my officials and I are available to engage with the Board should that be of assistance.</p>  <p>  The board is an independent body, answerable to the Oireachtas, with the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all its legal obligations.  The cost of enacting the additional requirements under the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011 was set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis that was carried out prior to the enactment of the legislation.  </p>  <p>  It was also made clear at the time of the legislation that the Board would continue to be self-funding and needed to plan and cost how it would fulfil its legal obligations.  Following detailed negotiations with the Executive and Board members in 2013 it was agreed in October 2013 that an initial once-off sum of &euro;1.6m would be granted by the Department to the Board to cover 2013/2014 costs, but that the Board would have to increase its income in 2015 to undertake its commitments in the legislation.  The Board of the NMBI made the decision to increase the annual registration fee at its meeting on 17th September, 2014.</p></reply>

Every person who uses our disability services is entitled to expect and receive supports of the highest standard and to live in an atmosphere of safety and care.  <br/><br/>The safeguarding and protection of vulnerable people in the care of the health service is of paramount importance and the Director General of the HSE has written to all staff instructing them to take personal responsibility for ensuring that individuals supported by the HSE in any setting are treated with dignity and respect.<br/><br/>In December 2014 the HSE initiated both an expert investigation chaired by Mr Christy Lynch, and an independently chaired review of services at this facility led by Dr Kevin McCoy. <br/><br/>Mr Lynch&rsquo;s investigation team is working independently of the HSE and will form an important input into any disciplinary process which the HSE will undertake.<br/><br/>Dr McCoy is undertaking an Assurance Review of the services at &Aacute;ras Attracta and the final report will include an individual plan for improvement in each bungalow within the complex.  The review will identify system wide learning involving engagement with relevant expertise as well as input from staff.  <br/><br/>I welcome the fact that the Garda&iacute; have now cleared the way so that Mr. Lynch&rsquo;s investigation can commence.  I have asked the HSE to keep me informed of progress.<br/><br/>The HSE has undertaken a number of additional initiatives to ensure that quality and safe care in residential services for people with disabilities is appropriately implemented and monitored. <br/><br/>A six-step plan will address this in a systematic way. These steps are:<br/><br/>-  The establishment of a National Implementation Taskforce, including a series of National Summits to improve client safety, dignity, respect and  culture; <br/><br/>- Implementation of the <i>National Policy &amp;amp; Procedures on Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse</i>;  <br/><br/>- Development of an Advocacy programme;<br/><br/>- Implementation of an evaluation and quality improvement programme in disability residential centres;<br/><br/>- Development of an implementation plan for any recommendations arising from the McCoy review of residential services in &Aacute;ras Attracta when complete, and,<br/><br/>- Development of long term sustainable &amp;amp; evidence-based safeguarding practices and training programmes specific to residential settings.<br/><br/>The HSE is considering plans to monitor practices in social care facilities through the use of surveillance cameras, undercover persons and /or other means. However, it is very conscious of potential difficulties that could arise in relation to privacy and data protection, and given the complex issues involved, has decided to engage expert consultants to advise it on the best way to proceed.  A Prior Information Notice under EU procurement rules was published in mid-December in this regard.<br/><br/>I can assure the Deputy that my Department will monitor progress on the initiatives and processes commissioned by the HSE in relation to &Aacute;ras Attracta, to ensure that the learning from this incident is promulgated throughout our health system.</p></reply>

All hospitals, including the Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care.  </p>  <p>  The Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore enacts its escalation policy at peak activity times, the main elements of which include twice daily ward rounds as required by Consultants, twice daily bed management meetings, fast tracking of all home help-home care packages, the prioritisation of diagnostic requests, funding of patients in private nursing homes until Fair Deal is granted, and opening of additional beds where necessary.  The HSE has advised that this policy, along with additional measures such as the establishment of a short-stay ward, have ensured that the Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore is in a position to respond quickly to peak activity levels. </p>  <p>  The Government has provided additional funding of &euro;3 million in 2014 and &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges and actions being taken include the provision of additional home care packages, additional transition beds in nursing homes, 300 additional Fair Deal places and an extension in Community Intervention Teams.  </p>  <p>  I convened the Emergency Department Taskforce last month to find long term solutions to overcrowding by providing additional focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by the current trolley waits.

I would like to clarify that response time performance is improving in the face of increasing demands on the service.  The latest published data shows that nationally, in October 2014, the volume of ECHO calls rose by 5% compared to the same period in 2013, and DELTA calls by 10%.  Despite this, an ambulance arrived within the target time for 76% of ECHO calls and for 67% of DELTA calls - an improvement of 3.3% and 4% respectively on the same period in 2013. </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that response time targets only measure one aspect of ambulance performance and they should be part of a suite of assessments.  Internationally, many services are moving to patient outcomes as a better indicator of performance.  The National Ambulance Service introduced a patient outcome target for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in 2014, and more are being developed.  </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the National Ambulance Service, will in 2015, continue to focus on service improvements.  A significant programme of reform and modernisation is ongoing, and, this year we will see a number of further developments.  A key component of the reform programme is the single national control system.  This will be completed later this year and will, along with the single Computer Aided Dispatch system, further improve call taking and dispatching.  The Intermediate Care Service, which received additional vehicles and staff in 2014, will continue to free up emergency vehicles for emergency calls and we are focussed on improving hospital turnaround times.  </p>  <p>  A &euro;5.4m  budget increase in 2015 will help address service gaps, particularly in the west, by reforming rostering and staffing additional stations.  We will also expand the number of community first response teams, particularly in more rural and sparsely populated areas.  In addition, the Emergency Aeromedical Support Service, which has been very successful, will continue to provide rapid access to appropriate treatment for very high acuity patients where this might be difficult to achieve by road.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that there are currently three major reviews of ambulance services, the recently published  HIQA review, as well as the awaited national capacity and  Dublin ambulance service reviews.  These three reviews, when taken together, will provide us with very good information which will help drive further service improvement.

I also understand that the draft executive summary of the National Capacity Review, recently circulated to the Joint Committee on Health and Children, suggests that the response time targets recommended by HIQA cannot be met, even with substantially increased resources.  However, as that report is not yet finalised, I believe it is premature to make any concrete decisions in relation to response time targets.  </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that response time targets only measure one aspect of ambulance performance and they should be part of a suite of assessments.  Internationally, many services are moving to patient outcomes as a better indicator of performance.  The NAS introduced a patient outcome target for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in 2014, and more are being developed.  </p>  <p>  In relation to rural response time targets, I think it is accepted that these are difficult to achieve for any ambulance service.  However, I can assure the Deputy that we are already adapting our ambulance services for the needs of rural populations through, for example, the use of rapid response vehicles.  In addition, the Emergency Aeromedical Support Service which has proven to be very successful, will continue to provide rapid access to appropriate treatment for very high acuity patients where this might be difficult to achieve by road.  A &euro;5.4m budget increase in 2015 will help address service gaps, particularly in the west, by reforming rostering and staffing additional stations.  We will also expand the number of community first response teams, particularly in more rural and sparsely populated areas. The Intermediate Care Service, for non-emergency clinical transport, will continue to free up frontline ambulances, and their highly skilled paramedics and advanced paramedics, for emergency calls. </p>  <p>  In addition to the recent HIQA review, the national capacity review and the review of Dublin ambulance services are awaited. These three major reviews of our ambulance service, when taken together, will provide us with very good information which will help drive service improvement.  I have therefore asked the HSE to prepare an action plan on completion of the three reports, with timelines to realise a new vision for our ambulance services.</p></reply>

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria. The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating. The commonest noticeable evidence of infection is a rash called erythema migrans that is seen in about 80-90% of patients.</p>  <p>  Lyme borelliosis is diagnosed by a medical history and physical examination and can be difficult if there has been no erythema migrans rash. The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies to B. burgdorferi produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection. These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease. The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step. Screening EIAs can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other spirochaete infections including syphilis, and certain viral infections including glandular fever. In addition, sera from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results. Samples giving reactive or equivocal tests in screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage immunoblot (Western blot) tests. Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity. Using this outlined two stage approach will give a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme Disease. Testing for Lyme borelliosis is currently undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland.</p>  <p>  There is an ongoing publicity campaign regarding Lyme Disease. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE is establishing a Lyme Borelliosis Sub-Committee with the primary aim to examine best practice in prevention and surveillance of Lyme Disease and to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise harm caused by Lyme borelliosis in Ireland. This will involve raising awareness among clinicians and the general public. It will explore ways to ensure these messages are brought to the general public with the frequency and in forms in which they can be most effective. </p>  <p>  Each year, as part of its ongoing awareness raising regarding prevention and treatment of Lyme Disease, the HPSC holds a Lyme Disease Awareness Week in which media releases are sent out with the intention that media outlets would take up the important Lyme prevention messages. As part of last year's Awareness Week, a supply of information was made available to the public and attention was drawn to a "Tickborn Disease Toolkit", developed by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC). This toolkit was modified for use in Ireland and posted on the HPSC website. Indeed, the ECDC informed the HPSC that Ireland was the first European Member State to make such extensive use of this material. Following the Awareness Week, a 100% increase of web traffic to the various Lyme Disease sections of the HPSC website was noted.</p></reply>

The average appeal processing time for supplementary welfare allowance appeals during 2014 was 21 weeks, of which 9.3 weeks is attributable to appeals processing in the Social Welfare Appeals Office and 11.5 weeks in the Department.</p>  <p>  Appeal processing times peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 the average processing time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks and the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  Further improvements were achieved in 2013, when the average appeal processing time reduced to 33.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.8 weeks for a summary decision.  As at December 2014 the average time taken to process an appeal requiring an oral hearing has reduced to 28.7 weeks and for a summary decision to 21.4 weeks.</p>  <p>  The reduction in processing time reflects the significant resources which have been invested in the Social Welfare Appeals Office over the last number of years.</p>  <p>  In addition to the improvement in processing times, these measures have also led to a significant reduction in the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 9,480 at 12 January 2015.</p>  <p>  Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system. By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.</p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p></reply>

This special provision ensures that OFP recipients who care for a disabled child will continue to receive support until that child reaches the age of 16 years and can apply for the disability allowance (DA) in their own right.  </p>  <p>  As a result of this special provision, 1,650 lone parents will continue to receive the OFP payment and will not be affected by the OFP scheme age change reforms on 2 July, 2015.  Many of these individuals will also be in receipt of a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.

These customers will transition out of the OFP scheme on 2 July, 2015, and will have their carer&rsquo;s allowance claim automatically assessed and re-rated to a full-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance payment of &euro;204 per week and &euro;29.80 per week for each qualified child.  </p>  <p>  This results in an income loss of &euro;86 per week as these lone parents are moving from one-and-a-half payments to a single full-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance payment.  This is the most advantageous option that is available to these lone parents.  These individuals will retain their existing secondary benefits such as the respite care grant, the household benefit package and free travel. </p>  <p>  Historically, the transition of recipients from the OFP scheme to the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme has always occurred in this manner, with concurrent OFP and half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance entitlement being replaced with full-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance entitlement once the maximum age limit of the youngest child is reached.</p></reply>

The cost of the OFP scheme is estimated to be approximately &euro;607 million in 2015.</p>  <p>  The final phase of the OFP scheme age change reforms will be taking place on 2 July, 2015, when the maximum age limit of the youngest child at which an OFP recipient&rsquo;s payment ceases will be reduced to 7 years for all recipients.  It is anticipated that approximately 30,200 OFP recipients will transition out of the OFP scheme on that day.  </p>  <p>  The majority of affected lone parents are expected to transition to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) payment including to the JA transitional arrangement, the family income supplement (FIS) or the carer&rsquo;s allowance (CA) payment.</p>  <p>  Some 19,800 OFP recipients, or approximately 65.6% of the total, are expected to transition to the JA payment, including the JA transitional arrangement.  Of these:</p>  <p>  - 13,400 have earnings of less than &euro;60 per week and will incur no loss of income.  These customers are not working and, as such, will not suffer any reduction in their new income support payment as the JA payment pays the same personal and qualified child rates as the OFP payment. </p>  <p>  - 6,400 have earnings of between &euro;60 and &euro;200 per week and will lose between &euro;1 and &euro;36.50 per week.</p>  <p>  Some 9,600 OFP recipients, or approximately 31.8% of the total, are expected to transition to the FIS scheme on 2 July, 2015.  These customers will be entitled to avail of the back to work family dividend (BTWFD), which was announced in Budget 2015, and will include those who transition from both the OFP and FIS payments to a re-rated FIS payment only, as well as those who become new FIS recipients.  These customers will be able to retain their increase for qualified child (IQC) payment of &euro;29.80 per week per child (up to a maximum of &euro;119.20 per week for four children) for two years, with full IQC entitlement for the first year and 50% entitlement for the second year.  Of the aforementioned 9,600 OFP recipients:</p>  <p>  - 4,500 customers whose FIS will be re-rated will lose between &euro;0.50 and &euro;57 per week;</p>  <p>  - 1,000 customers whose FIS will be re-rated will gain between &euro;2 and &euro;42 per week, and</p>  <p>  - 4,100 may become new FIS recipients and will gain between &euro;20 and &euro;160 per week.  This assumes that customers earning over &euro;200 per week will become new FIS recipients rather than moving to a JA payment.</p>  <p>  These figures include the first year of the BTWFD payment.</p>  <p>  Some 800 OFP recipients, or approximately 2.6% of the total, who are claiming both the OFP and half-rate CA payments, will have their CA claim automatically assessed and re-rated to a full-rate CA payment of &euro;204 per week, plus an IQC of &euro;29.80 per week per child, on 2 July, 2015.  These customers will lose &euro;86 per week when their OFP entitlement ceases.  This loss occurs as these lone parents are moving from one-and-a-half payments to a single full-rate CA payment.  This is the most advantageous option that is available to these lone parents and, also, they will retain their entitlement to existing secondary benefits such as the respite care grant, the household benefits package and free travel.  Historically, the transition of recipients from the OFP scheme to the CA scheme has always occurred in this manner, with concurrent OFP and half-rate CA entitlement being replaced with full-rate CA entitlement once the maximum age limit of the youngest child is reached.</p>  <p>  The figures outlined above are estimates based on various customer scenarios and are for indicative purposes only.</p></reply>

It sets out new, stronger EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the key aim of increasing policyholder protection.  It is expected that this new regime should reduce the possibility of consumer loss or market disruption in insurance.  As Solvency II is a maximum harmonisation Directive it should result in a more harmonised approach across all EU Member States in terms of the regulation by supervisory authorities of insurance undertakings.  Solvency II will enter into force on 1 January 2016 and work on its transposition is currently underway in my Department, following the holding of a public consultation process late last year.</p>  <p>  The Insurance Bill, however, is intended to provide a statutory regime for those insurance companies not covered by the Solvency II Directive.  Solvency II does not apply to firms that are winding down (and therefore not taking on any new business) or firms with an annual gross written premium income that does not exceed &euro;5 million.</p>  <p>  Based on these criteria, if Setanta were still in operation it would be subject to the Solvency II regime and not the alternative regime to be covered by the forthcoming Insurance Bill.</p></reply>

This does not, however, preclude the development of economic and trade relations.  Ireland, together with our EU partners, sees the benefit of encouraging trade with Taiwan and will continue to explore all appropriate opportunities which arise.</p>  <p>  Since Taiwan is not recognised as a State by Ireland we cannot enter into a legally enforceable agreement which would be governed by international law.  However a number of other EU countries have negotiated commercial agreements with Taiwan along the lines of Double Taxation Agreements.  Therefore it should be possible to negotiate an agreement with Taiwan that is consistent with this policy.  I can advise the Deputy that Double Taxation Agreements are negotiated by the Revenue Commissioners on behalf of the Government.</p>  <p>  It is my Department's policy to treat double taxation agreements as confidential until they are signed, at which point they are published on Revenue's website.  I am informed that this is a normal practice for most jurisdictions which respects the confidential nature of the negotiation process.

Profits are recovering, balance sheets have been restructured and we have started the process of returning cash to the taxpayer following the huge investments that were made over the 2009-11 period.</p>  <p>  Much of the banking-related work in the Department of Finance this year will focus on AIB. Given the scale of the State's investment of some &euro;20.8 billion and the range of options available to recoup value from the bank, officials within my department are working with AIB on reconfiguring its capital structure.  Goldman Sachs International has been appointed to provide financial advice to the Department  in this regard.</p>  <p>  The focus will be on ensuring that the best decisions are made regarding potential capital restructuring options and sequencing in order to maximise the return of cash to the State from our AIB investments over time.  While this is just the start of the process, it is an essential first step on the road to recovering value for the taxpayer.  All options remain on the table and it is too early to specify what steps will be taken next or to put a timeline on decisions.</p>  <p>  As I have previously stated on numerous occasions, Government policy is that we will not remain a holder of our banking investments in the long term.  Given our high debt to GDP ratio, we do not have the luxury of holding all of these investments indefinitely and I envisage receipts from the gradual sale of these investments helping to play their part in reducing the State's overall debt burden in the coming years.</p></reply>

The purpose of awarding the contract is to engage a firm with the appropriate experience to provide advice to assist the Department in making the bank's balance sheet fit for purpose and in designing a roadmap that will see the bank start to return cash to the State.  As I have indicated previously, no decision has been taken in relation to the State exiting any of its investments in the bank.</p>  <p>  The award follows the establishment by the Department last year of three separate panels of financial advisers after an extensive process that followed EU procurement rules.  These panels were put in place to principally facilitate the provision of timely advice in relation to our banking investments though the panels are available for the wider Department to use in other areas if deemed necessary.</p>  <p>  The award of the current contract followed a competitive tendering process with each of the eleven firms on Panel 1 (which covers capital markets, strategic, M&amp;A and restructuring advice) being invited to submit a tender.  Prior to the year end, each of the firms accepted the invitation and the tendering process included face-to-face presentations by each of the firms to a panel of Department of Finance officials.  Arising from these presentations, each of the firms was scored across a number of standard criteria with Goldman Sachs International being adjudged to have achieved the highest aggregated score. Accordingly, they were awarded the contract.</p>  <p>  As part of the process for assessing the award of a contract by the Department, all firms who are invited to submit a tender are required to provide a declaration that no conflicts of interest exist. Should a firm be in a position to be unable to provide such a declaration, any tender submitted by the firm would be disqualified from further consideration.  I can confirm that Goldman Sachs International provided the Department with the appropriate declaration.</p>  <p>  As part of the terms of the contract, Goldman Sachs International has been engaged on a pro bono basis.  This is a good outcome for the State and we understand is not unusual internationally given firms desire to be associated with such high visibility government work.  In fact a number of the tenderers offered their services on a pro bono basis.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that Goldman Sachs is one of the leading investment banks worldwide with vast experience in a number of areas, including corporate finance.  The firm has ongoing engagements with a wide variety of clients including large corporates and sovereign states.  The Federal Reserve Board is the primary regulator of the Goldman Sachs group.  In addition to this, Goldman Sachs International is regulated by the PRA and FCA in the U.K.  With its vast experience and high degree of regulation, I am not aware of any reason not to proceed with their engagement, be it probity or otherwise.</p></reply>

There is no specific exemption in the case of interest paid on deposit accounts held by children.  The wider tax code does not provide for an exemption from tax for children.  Children could be liable to a range of taxes.  Not many children have an income that exceeds the relevant thresholds, but those that do are taxable on it.</p>  <p>  While all taxation measures are kept under review, there are no plans to provide that interest payable on children's accounts should not be subject to DIRT.  To provide an exemption from DIRT to children's accounts could be difficult to administer, from the point of view of establishing the beneficial ownership of the account.</p>  <p>  A number of State Savings Products offered by the National Treasury Management Agency through An Post are tax free, subject to certain conditions.</p></reply>

Either the taxpayer authorises the agent to act on their behalf or the agent advises Revenue that they are now the taxpayer s representative.  Where the taxpayer authorises the agent, they submit a letter to their Revenue office providing details of the agent and the taxes the agent will deal with.  Links are then established on Revenue's systems to grant the agent access and to copy the agent on all relevant correspondence.</p>  <p>  Where an agent advises Revenue that they have started acting for a particular taxpayer they must request the link electronically via ROS, Revenue's Online Service, and the eRegistration system, Revenue's online registration facility and attach the authorisation provided by the taxpayer.  Again the necessary links are established but in these instances the taxpayer is advised that the agent has requested access and the taxpayer then has an opportunity to ask that these links are removed, if the client/agent relationship is not valid.  This additional step acts as a safeguard in instances where a request may have been made in error or without the taxpayer s permission.</p>  <p>  The taxpayer can at all times request to have the agent links removed or new agent links created.</p>  <p>  I am advised that there are very precise operating protocols in respect of access to customer information and they are strictly adhered to by Revenue staff.  I am also advised that Revenue officials will not provide taxpayer details to any person who does not satisfy the relevant security protocols and, in agent/representative cases, details are only provided where the agent is actually linked to the taxpayer for the specific tax type.  Where an agent is so linked, they have direct access, via Revenue's Online Service, to the records of any taxpayers that they represent.  In those instances, Revenue will not provide copies of taxpayer records to the agent as the information is directly available to the agent to view for themselves in ROS.</p>  <p>  The Revenue website is regularly updated with changes in operating procedures and all agent related changes are advised by means of Revenue eBriefs.  These information bulletins are all available on the Revenue website in the Tax Practitioner section of the website.</p></reply>

The administrative burden on legitimate door-to-door traders, and the cost to the State, that would result from such a requirement would, in my view, outweigh the potential benefits. Given the informal nature of a sizeable proportion of door-to-door trading, such a requirement would also be difficult to enforce effectively. My Department is aware of only 3 of the 28 European Union Member States, which have a licensing requirement for door-to-door traders.</p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulations 2013 which came into operation in June 2014 have significantly strengthened the protections for consumers purchasing goods or services on a doorstep or off-premises basis. As well as giving consumers enhanced information rights, the Regulations increased from 7 to 14 days the cooling-off period within which off-premises contracts can be cancelled by the consumer, and extended the right of cancellation to contracts concluded following solicited as well as unsolicited visits to the consumer&rsquo;s home or place of work. Contracts commenced but not fully performed during the cooling-off period can now also be cancelled by the consumer subject to pro-rata payment for services provided up to the point of cancellation.</p></reply>

The Unemployment Rate for the Midlands and South East regions, for example, stand at 14.5% and 13.7% respectively.  This compares to the national average of 11.1% in the latest Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) published by the Central Statistics Office.  The Unemployment Rate for the West in the QNHS, which relates to the third Quarter of 2014, was 11.4%.</p>  <p>  The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs contained a number of commitments to support competitive regions, including the development a framework for Regional Enterprise Strategies.  This framework, which has been developed by my Department, provides a model which will be used to produce action-oriented plans to maximise the jobs potential of each region through a coordinated approach across Government Departments and other public bodies.</p>  <p>  I have previously indicated that the first two Regional Enterprise Strategies to be developed will cover the Midlands and the South East regions respectively.  Following a consultation process in the Midlands, my officials are currently finalising the preparation of the Regional Enterprise Strategy for that particular region.  Consultation with stakeholders on the Strategy for the South-East region will commence in February.     </p>  <p>  The order in which subsequent Regional Enterprise Strategies are to be developed has not yet been finalised, but the decision will be informed by factors such as regional unemployment levels. It is my intention that each plan is drafted and published by July of this year.</p>  <p>  It is not intended that specific job creation targets will be set for each county in the Regional Enterprise Strategies, but, rather, that the Strategies will identify measures that can be taken to enable the region as a whole to realise its economic potential and create jobs, building on its existing competitive strengths. </p>  <p>  Last week, the Government set out its ambition to achieve full employment by 2018.

However as no grants were paid, there is no liability attaching to the agreement with the IDA.  In all instances where financial assistance is approved by the IDA for a company, the Agency and the client enter into a legal and binding contract, the terms of which must remain confidential. The company are not in breach of the terms of that contract and it is not feasible to specify minimum operational periods.</p>  <p>  The company had planned to increase employment to 30 staff in their new International Operations Centre over the next two to three years, and at the time of the closure announcement last week, staff numbers had reached nine, who were engaged in shared services activities, including finance and supply chain management. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately for the Irish operation, a recent change of strategic policy by the company, involving a restructuring of its worldwide operations, resulted in a decision that its European facilities would be consolidated in Amsterdam, where the company has a major Centre of Excellence.  Consequently a decision was made to close the Waterford operation by mid- year. </p>  <p>  I would like to emphasise that the vast majority of Foreign Direct projects secured by IDA Ireland, remain here and, indeed, thrive in Ireland. Waterford is home to several major corporations which have embedded themselves in the local and national economy, with solid employment growth since their establishment. However, the strategic policy of multinationals sometimes means that decisions are made which have an adverse impact on their Irish operations and this has been the case on this occasion.  I have asked both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to ensure that they continue to make every effort to drive job creation in the South East and Waterford itself.  It is heartening that the latest unemployment figures for the South East region show the unemployment figure having fallen again and now stands at 13.7%, down from 19.4% two years previously, with almost 20,000 additional jobs now in place over that period.  While much more needs to be achieved, we have made significant progress in the region over a short period.</p></reply>

The aim of this initiative was to create 250 cross sectoral jobs in the Killybegs area by 2014.  To drive forward the initiative, I established a High Level Group on Job Creation in the Killybegs Region and requested that the Group identify the potential actions required to deliver job creation in the following five key areas, that is; promoting seafood value added activity; enhancing ancillary services; developing offshore supports; promoting tourism and marine leisure; and promoting the green economy and renewable energy.<br/><br/>The High Level Group comprised representatives of the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation (who chaired the Group), Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Donegal County Council, Letterkenny Institute of Technology, Enterprise Ireland, local industry and from my Department. BIM provided secretariat services to assist the chair. The Group finished its work in 2011 and its Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: <br/><br/>The Report of the High Level Group identified how the original target of creating 250 new jobs could be achieved and set out cross-sectoral recommendations under 8 headings to address constraints that may impact on achievement of the jobs target. From 2012, the High Level Group met periodically to review and drive progress. It established a local implementation group in 2012 to further enhance delivery on the action items identified within the 2011 Report. I understand that figures are not yet available on the extent of job creation achieved by 2014.<br/><br/>In relation to expenses, I expect that the public sector representatives on the Group would have claimed their normal travel and subsistence expenses at public sector rates, but I had no role in that matter. There was no arrangement for payment from public monies of expenses to non-public sector members of the Group.</p></reply>

Under these regulations each Member State is allocated a volume quota of milk, above which a super levy fine (of 28.6 cents/litre) has to be paid to the EU Commission by producers who contribute to the over production. It is not possible for me on a unilateral basis to adjust super levy rules.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the foregoing, I have, on numerous occasions, called on the Commission to take action to mitigate the impact of super levy fines, primarily via utilisation of an adjustment to the butterfat coefficient, as this would not have required an amendment to existing regulations. Other options previously discussed included the front-loading of the remaining quota increases, a reduction in the super levy, or a type of EU flexi-milk arrangement which would have operated providing EU production overall was within quota.  However, given the reaction of the Commission, and the opposition of a blocking minority of Member states, some of which have gone so far as to seek to link the issue to possible measures to regulate supply after quotas are gone, there is no realistic prospect of any movement on the super-levy. This is also true of a butterfat adjustment, and coming into the final year of milk quotas, farmers should manage their milk supply with this in mind. <br/><br/>At national level I have impressed on the major banks the need to show flexibility in their dealings with farmers experiencing temporary cash flow difficulties in 2015. Co-ops may have a role in mitigating the impact of the global price downturn on their suppliers, and have some flexibility in relation to the phasing of superlevy bills to farmers. Furthermore Teagasc has recently commenced a series of dairy seminars throughout the country to help dairy farmers manage through 2015, while also planning the efficient development of their dairy business in a non-quota environment. <br/><br/>There is evidence that milk suppliers are taking steps to manage their milk supply in the final months of the quota regime. The milk quota position for the period up to end-December 2014 leaves Ireland 5.93% over quota when account is taken of the butterfat content of the milk deliveries. This figure continues the downward trend in the over-quota figure, coming from a peak of 7.15% in October 2014.<br/><br/>This downward trend is welcome and <i>I would encourage milk producers to continue to manage production, with the help of their advisors, </i>into the important production months of February and March.<br/><br/>At EU level, the end of the 2013/14 milk quota year saw total milk deliveries come in at 4.6% below quota. It is difficult to project what the end of quota year position will be in the EU next April. Data taken from the EU Milk Market Observatory show that deliveries for the whole of the EU for the period from January to the end of October 2014 are 5.4% above the same period last year. For the same period it is worth noting that production has increased in 26 of the 27 countries reporting to the EU Milk Market Observatory, with half those countries experiencing increases above 5%. Notwithstanding the possibility of softening of milk prices impacting on the final outcome, these EU production trends would appear to suggest that overall EU deliveries may be nearer to quota than in previous years.</p></reply>

Over the years, the vast majority of serving personnel have returned vacant possession of married quarter properties when required to do so. Those who fail to return vacant possession of such properties are termed &ldquo;overholders&rdquo; and the Department seeks to recover possession from this group. The legal process for the recovery of the property commences with the issue of a &ldquo;Notice to Quit&rdquo;.<br/><br/>In the period since January 2013, 15 of such properties have been returned to the Department, many of which had been occupied by former spouses or family members of those who had origionally been allocated the property. <br/><br/>Where married quarter properties are located outside barracks they are offered for sale to the occupant and many have been disposed of in this manner. The majority of properties being overheld at this point however are located within barracks and it is not possible to offer these for sale as they must be retained for military use.<br/><br/>The Department assists in whatever way it can in order to resolve the cases of overholding without recourse to legal action. However, any initiative to resolve overholding must support and complement the current policy, which dates back to 1997, of withdrawing from the provision of married quarters.<br/><br/>In cases where the occupants are unable or unwilling to purchase a property being overheld, the Department provides whatever documentation it can to support applications for housing assistance and officials from my Department have had discussions with relevant local authorities to determine what if any supports are available for overholders in this regard.<br/><br/>There are also a number of advice and support services available to Defence Forces personnel and their families.

The PSS is a central aspect of human resource management that provides a confidential information, training and education, support and referral service for Defence Forces personnel. There is a PSS office in every major installation in the Defence Forces, with one or more qualified Barrack Personnel Support Service Officer(s) (BPSSO). <br/><br/>The role of the BPSSO includes providing information, assistance and counselling on a range of matters including:<br/><br/>- Interpersonal problems<br/><br/>- Stress in many forms (personal, due to family and/or financial problems etc.)<br/><br/>- Bereavement (in its many forms, including family breakup)<br/><br/>- Housing (including stress from mortgages, inability to sell property to relocate family nearer the military workplace etc.)<br/><br/>Each Brigade/Formation also has a civilian Defence Forces Social Worker (full-time or part-time) whose tasks are to provide assistance and support to service personnel and their families where required.<br/><br/>In addition, there is an Independent Confidential Helpline and Counselling Service for Permanent Defence Force personnel. Since 2013 this independent and confidential service was extended to the Reserve Defence Force, Civilian Employees of the Department of Defence and Civil Defence Personnel and a broader range of services was introduced, including family and couple counselling.</p></reply>

However, before the Bill could be taken at Report Stage, a 2013 UK Court of Appeal judgment necessitated a review of the disclosure provisions in both the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the Spent Convictions Bill.  That review has been completed and amendments to the Vetting Act and consequential amendments to the Spent Convictions Bill are currently being drafted.  The Bill will be enacted at the earliest opportunity. Pending the amendment of the Bill, an Administrative Filter for Garda Vetting Disclosures has been introduced, which provides that certain minor offences that are over 7 years old are no longer disclosed.</p></reply>

This will involve repealing the Landlord and Tenant Law Amendment Act Ireland 1860 (more commonly referred to as Deasy&rsquo;s Act) and other pre-1922 statutes, together with some statutory provisions or more recent origin, and replacing them with a statutory framework more suited to modern conditions.  The draft Bill contains reforms which seek to clarify the respective obligations of both landlords and tenants and improve protection levels for tenants.  It will, for example, abolish certain eviction remedies currently available to landlords and replace them with an updated statutory redress scheme.</p>  <p>  It is not intended that the draft Bill will contain amendments to the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011.  The primary purpose of this Act is to provide a statutory framework for the ownership and management of common areas of multi-unit developments and to facilitate the fair, efficient and effective functioning of owners' management companies (OMCs) which are established for the purposes of owning and managing such common areas.

To that end full vetting checks are conducted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.</p>  <p>  The current procedures for Garda vetting ensure the integrity of the system.  This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Garda Vetting Disclosure would not include information regarding any recent criminal convictions, and the second employer could not safely rely on it.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the Data Protection Acts, any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date and employers would be exposed to civil liability if they knowingly recruited staff based on out-of-date criminal records information where the person in fact had a more recent criminal conviction.  Effectively, the non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service and such procedures are in line with best practice internationally.</p>  <p>  There are, however, certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.  For example, persons involved in voluntary work may be doing work with more than one voluntary organisation at the same time, and may agree with the vetting applicant to share a single vetting disclosure.  Similar arrangements arise in the health sector in regard to persons working as locums, agency nurses or other temporary employees in a number of different organisations, or in the education sector where substitute teachers are on panels for substitute teaching in more than one school.</p>  <p>  Finally, the current average processing time for vetting applications is four weeks.  Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, taking into account the need to protect children and vulnerable adults while providing an effective and efficient service, I do not think that this time period is unreasonable.</p></reply>

The Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel among the Garda Regions, Divisions, and Districts.  Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of Ballyjamesduff Garda station on 30 November 2014, the latest date for which figures are readily available was three.  Ballyjamesduff forms part of the Bailieboro Garda District in the Cavan/Monaghan Garda Division.  The personnel strength of Bailieboro Garda District and the Cavan/Monaghan Garda Division on the same date was 62 and 324, respectively.  There are also 22 Garda Reserves and 36 civilians attached to the Cavan/Monaghan Division of which three Garda Reserves and six civilians are attached to the Baileboro District.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, 100 new recruits entered training at the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014, the first intake of Garda recruits since 2009.  This was followed by an intake of a further 100 new recruits in December.  A further intake of 100 is due to enter training at the end of this month.  This will bring to 300 the number of recruits in the Garda College since last September and is a measure of this Government's commitment to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The first intake of recruits will attest as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in May of this year and will be assigned to Garda Stations by the Garda Commissioner.  The Garda Commissioner, will of course, continue to keep the needs of the Ballyjamesduff station under review within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.</p></reply>

The 2015 Budget increased the funding available for health and social care services by &euro;635 million - the first increase after a period of seven years of significant retrenchment -  and this increased level of investment is reflected in the provisions of the Plan.<br/><br/>It is acknowledged that the opening weeks of the year have witnessed very considerable pressure in the Emergency Departments of our hospitals.  In setting scheduled care (elective) activity targets within the National Service Plan the following is taken into account:<br/><br/>- Requirement to schedule activity in line with peaks and troughs in demand<br/><br/>- Agreement to implement scheduled care improvement plan including:<br/><br/>- Increase Day of Surgery admission rates;<br/><br/>- Increase Day Surgery rates in line with Clinical Care Programme Guidelines;<br/><br/>- Reductions in Average Length of Stay;<br/><br/>- Shift Care to appropriate settings,<br/><br/>In this context there is provision for a 2.5% increase in Day Surgery set out in NSP 2015.

Minimum benefit is one of the key principles on which the Irish private health insurance regulatory system is based. Minimum Benefit Regulations, made under the Health Insurance Acts, require insurers to offer a minimum benefit to every insured person.  The key purpose of the Regulations is to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population and to ensure that individuals do not significantly underinsure.</p>  <p>  The Minimum Benefit Regulations ensure that all consumers obtain an appropriate minimum level of health insurance cover regardless of what plan they purchase and that every plan available is inclusive of a minimum suite of benefits/procedures, some of which are available to the market as a whole and some of which will be applicable specifically to either men or women.  By way of example, the Regulations include provision for such medical treatments as a prostatectomy or testicular biopsy (in the case of men) and cervical biopsy or maternity services (in the case of women).</p>  <p>  Therefore, the broad base line of procedures provided by minimum benefit should not be looked at in gender specific or age-related terms, but rather as a cohort of benefits and procedures that are important and of benefit to the community of the insured population and thus should be protected and provided as a minimum base to all.</p></reply>

It is regrettable that to date the company has not been able to provide this drug at a more sustainable price to the HSE to reflect the clinical evidence. </p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that I fully understand the concerns of patients regarding the availability of this drug and that every effort is being made to achieve a satisfactory outcome.  While I appreciate that some may take the view that the taxpayer should reimburse every licensed medicine for whatever the price the drug company demands, the better interests of the health service require that we reimburse only the most effective medicines and only at a fair price.</p></reply>

These plans include the opening of additional overflow areas, reopening of closed beds, provision of additional diagnostic scans and Consultants doing additional ward rounds to improve the appropriate flow of patients through hospitals.  The Government has provided additional funding of  &euro;3 million in 2014 and &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges and actions being taken include the provision of additional home care packages, additional transition beds in nursing homes, 300 additional Fair Deal places and an extension in Community Intervention Teams.  </p>  <p>   I convened the Emergency Department Taskforce last month to find long term solutions to overcrowding by providing additional focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by the current trolley waits.

In Budget 2015 the Government allocated &euro;25m to tackle the problem of delayed discharges and this additional funding is being applied across residential and community services to reflect the varying needs of patients. </p>  <p>  Of this &euro;25m &euro;10m has been allocated to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme which has resulted in 300 extra approvals and shortening the waiting time for approval from 17 weeks to 11 weeks, 145 of which were in acute hospitals and 107 of these are now in long-term residential care; &euro;8m is being used to augment short-term residential care capacity and has provided for 50 additional short stay beds which have been sourced from the private sector. An additional 65 are to come on stream on a phased basis from March 2015; &euro;5m is being used for home care services which will provide 400 additional Home Care Packages to benefit 600 discharges across targeted hospitals; and &euro;2m is being used to strengthen Community Intervention Teams which to date has facilitated 571 people to be seen in their own home.</p>  <p>  Further to this in July of 2014, the HSE allocated &euro;5m for an initiative to improve access to appropriate care for older people.  To date this has funded over 300 transitional care beds for patients in acute hospitals who are on the Nursing Homes Support Scheme national placement list.</p>  <p>  The HSE is looking at every possible option for alternative accommodation, including vacant beds in private nursing homes to address delayed discharges.  Since January 5 2015, the HSE has been working to match patients whose acute care has been completed but who require ongoing residential care with suitable placements.  This will see a potential movement of 250 patients across the country from acute hospitals to other suitable facilities.</p></reply>

The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is the statutory body responsible for planning, designing, building and equipping the new children's hospital.  Since the decision to locate the hospital at the St. James's campus, the Board's initial focus was on decant planning; site surveys and investigations; design team procurement; and review and update of the Project Brief to take account of the new site.  The revised Project Brief also took account of the outcome of a review of the location, model and number of urgent care centres which was undertaken in 2013.  Following that review, which involved significant consultation with the relevant stakeholders, it was decided that satellite centres, which will share governance and staffing with the new children's hospital, will be built on the campuses of Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals.</p>  <p>  The Project Brief was approved in June 2014 and sets out details of the specialties to be provided and the planned accommodation.  This will include 384 in-patient beds, all in single en-suite rooms with in-room parent accommodation, a further 85 day-care beds and 14 theatres, including three hybrid theatres to facilitate access to imaging during surgery, all in the main hospital.  There will be 111 outpatient consulting examination rooms across both the main hospital and the two satellite centres, as well as Emergency Department and urgent care facilities.</p>  <p>  Accommodation will also include family accommodation near the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit/Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, as well as in-room parent accommodation and separate family accommodation adjacent to the hospital (planned to be provided on a philanthropic basis by a charitable agency); play areas, external gardens and courtyards; specialist therapy area with hydro-pool and gym; and a family resource and information centre.  The Project Brief also sets out the design principles which will be applied in the design. In this context it affirms that it is important that the design created is consistent with the campus-wide site masterplan for the joint campus with St James&rsquo;s Hospital and with the Dublin City Council Local Area plan, and that it can constitute a landmark feature that can be welcomed by the community as a contribution to urban regeneration.</p>  <p>  The design team is now working on detailed design development, with the aim of submitting a planning application in June 2015.  Subject to planning, work will commence at the main site at St. James's, and at satellite centre sites at Connolly and Tallaght, in January 2016.  It is intended that a maternity facility will be developed in due course on the St James&rsquo;s campus, achieving tri-location of adult, paediatric and maternity services on one campus.</p></reply>

While the exact cause of these developmental abnormalities remain unclear, genetic and other non genetic factors such as brain development during pregnancy are thought to play a role.  Autism is described as a spectrum disorder (Autism Spectrum Disorder or ASD) that can have a varied presentation of characteristics ranging from mild to severe.  Many individuals with autism, due to the complexity of their presentation, may have a primary diagnosis of intellectual disability or mental health co-morbidity.</p>  <p>  Although there has been an increased demand in recent years for assessment for ASD it is not clear whether this is due to increased prevalence or to a greater awareness and recognition of the need for earlier intervention.  The Health Service Executive does not currently collect information specifically on adults and children identified with Autism on a national basis on the basis of diagnosis. Information pertaining to diagnosis is specifically excluded from the National Intellectual Disability Database as the database is not designed as a medical epidemiological tool.  Accordingly the database does not record the incidence of autism or any other disability.  The 2011 National Council for Special Education (NCSE) study on prevalence of special educational needs in Ireland (A Study on the Prevalence of Special Educational Needs, Joanne Banks and Selina McCoy, Economic and Social Research Institute) includes autism and estimates that prevalence for ASD is 1 in 100.  This is in line with the figure of .9% reported by the Centre for Disease Control in the US.</p>  <p>  Research was initiated in 2004 into autism under the auspices of the HRB as part of the Autism Genome Project - a collaboration of autism researchers internationally aimed at understanding susceptibility to ASD.  The research groups for this work were based in Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin.  This research investigated the genetic risk factors in ASD by pooling DNA obtained from a large international sample of individuals and their families, including many Irish families.  Genetic screening was then employed to identify (i) genetic variants that might increase the risk of autism and (ii) structural changes in the DNA of people with autism.  In parallel, complete clinical information was gathered on participants and the clinical and genetic information was combined in the analysis.  The main outcome showed that although ASDs have a substantial genetic basis, most of the known genetic risk has been traced to rare structural gene variants.  These gene variants were both de novo (arising for the first time in individuals) or inherited, implicating many novel ASD genes and genes involved in neurodevelopment.</p>  <p>  In relation to ongoing research, I understand that an Autism Research Group in Trinity College Dublin is focusing on understanding the genetic and neurobiological underpinnings of autism using genetic and neuroimaging methodologies.  The Group is funded through a variety of funding agencies and collaborates widely nationally and internationally.</p></reply>

Applications are being assessed by former High Court Judge Maureen Harding Clark.  The Scheme has in the region of &euro;34 million available and participants will receive awards at three levels - &euro;50,000, &euro;100,000 and &euro;150,000.  The Scheme was designed to be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial, and aims to minimise the stress for all women concerned.  It was designed following meetings with all three support groups, two of which have welcomed its establishment.  It was established to give women who do not wish to pursue their cases through the courts an alternative, simple, non-adversarial option.</p>  <p>  Applications had to be made within 20 working days of the Commencement Date. The closing date for receipt of applications was therefore Friday 5 December 2014.  In exceptional circumstances, Judge Clark had discretion to extend the time for receipt of applications by an additional 20 working days, that is, to Wednesday, 14 January 2015.</p>  <p>  Judge Clark has informed my officials that a total of around 590 applications had been made to the Scheme by the final closing date.  Fifty five awards totalling &euro;3,850,000 have been made to 19 January 2015.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that where there was a delay arising in the compilation of a woman's supporting documentation due to difficulty in obtaining medical records, applications were accepted by the Scheme, provided the application was received within the time period set out in the Scheme, with a written explanation of the reasons for the absence of the documentation.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is voluntary and women do not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a precondition to participating in the Scheme.  Women may opt out of the Scheme at any stage in the process, up to the time of accepting their award.  It is only on accepting the offer of an award that a woman must agree to discontinue her legal proceedings against any party arising out of a symphysiotomy or pubiotomy.</p>  <p>  The Government hopes the implementation of this Scheme will help to bring closure on this issue for the women concerned and their families.</p></reply>

These payrolls have become increasingly complex over the past five years, due to the following:<br/><br/>- Introduction of two salary scales, by comparison to a single salary scale for special need assistants, prior to 2010;<br/><br/>- Introduction of the Universal Social Charge (USC), Pension related Deduction (PRD) and the single pension scheme;<br/><br/>- Implementation of new sick leave regulations for school employees etc.<br/><br/>  In addition, the school employee payrolls have a high volume of substitute and casual appointments for payment, which is not a feature of other comparable payrolls for Civil Servants, Army, Garda Sioch&aacute;na etc.  Work is ongoing at present to incorporate payments to home tutors through the payroll, which will broaden the range of payees coming within the remit of the school employee payrolls.<br/><br/>  Accordingly, the development of the software to implement the Haddington Road Agreement (HRA) in the context of the overall numbers being paid on the payroll (including substitute and casual appointees), the payroll complexities referenced above and the complexity of the agreement itself has been a very difficult and complex task.  A further complication is the fact that the software programme in addition to dealing with the deferred increments has to calculate/re calculate the salary reduction provisions of the HRA for those reaching &euro;65,000 taking account of the impact of increments and allowances. <br/><br/>  The development of the programmes together with the comprehensive testing necessary to ensure the correct application of the terms of the agreement has taken longer than projected to implement.<br/><br/>  The target dates for the payment of the deferred increments and arrears to special need assistants is the 12th February.  The normal taxation arrangements will apply.</p></reply>

The Department's capital budget will be focused on providing those place to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place. <br/><br/>  My Department uses a Geographical Information System to analyse demographic data to determine the areas where additional school accommodation may be required.  A variety of data sources are used in this analysis, including census data, school enrolment data and child benefit data obtained from the Department of Social Protection.<br/><br/>  Where new primary schools are needed, the model of provision is decided by an open patronage determination process, which is overseen by the New Schools Establishment Group.  The criteria for awarding patronage place an emphasis on parental choice and diversity of provision, including language medium of instruction.  <br/><br/>  Where new schools are not needed but some level of additional accommodation is required in an area to meet demographic demand, a range of factors are considered as to which school or schools should be provided with this accommodation.  These factors include the level of diversity of provision in the area and the ability or otherwise of existing school sites to facilitate the extra accommodation.  <br/><br/>  The Deputy will be aware that a recent nationwide demographic exercise was carried out to determine where additional primary school accommodation will be needed from 2015 onwards at primary level.  This exercise concluded that there is sufficient primary educational infrastructure in the north Kildare area for the foreseeable future.  The schools in the area are, therefore, expected to cater between them for the level of demand presenting for pupil places.  This may result in pupils not obtaining a place of first choice.  <br/><br/>  With regard to an update on the reform of patronage models, I assume the Deputy is referring to the patronage divesting process.  Five schools have so far been opened under this process.  All of these schools are under the patronage of Educate Together.  Four commenced operation in 2014 and one commenced operation in 2013.

As part of this, certain allowances were withdrawn for new beneficiary teachers, including qualification allowances.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.</p>  <p>  Under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013 &ndash; 2016 (Haddington Road Agreement), revised pay scales for post-1 January 2011 and post-1 February 2012 entrants to teaching were agreed and implemented with effect from 1 July 2013.</p>  <p>  The Haddington Road Agreement further provided that the salary imbalance between those who entered the public service since 2011 and those who entered before that date would be addressed.  In that regard, my Department implemented a further revised incremental salary scale for teachers who entered teaching between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2012 with effect from 1 November 2013. Allowances payable to post-1 January 2011 entrants and such allowances as remain payable to post-1 February 2012 entrants were restored to pre-2011 levels as part of this measure.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Haddington Road Agreement provided for the establishment of an Expert Group to consider and report on the level of fixed-term and part-time employment in teaching, having regard to the importance for teachers of employment stability and security and taking account of system and school needs and Teaching Council registration requirements.</p>  <p>  The independent chairperson of the Group (Peter Ward SC) presented his report to me on 17 September 2014, following extensive consultation with all stakeholders and interested parties.  The report recommends a suite of measures which will allow fixed-term teachers to acquire permanent positions more easily and quickly and enable part-time teachers to gain additional hours.  The report also provides for extended redeployment arrangements in the event of mismatch between teacher qualifications and the curricular needs of schools, giving school management increased flexibility. </p>  <p>  The report recommends that seven changes should take place from the commencement of the 2015 school year and I intend to proceed with the implementation of those recommendations with effect from that date.  These reforms will represent a significant improvement in the job security and stability of employment for existing and future young teachers. </p></reply>

On foot of this commitment the PRTB commissioned research on such a scheme and reported back to my Department with recommendations in that regard. The subsequent report assessed a number of different options for delivery of a scheme ranging from one where all elements are delivered by the PRTB to one where all elements are outsourced to a private operator. The report examined each option in terms of both insurance and custodial type schemes.<br/><br/>All of the options presented in the report were considered and Government approval was secured for the establishment of a tenancy deposit scheme based on a custodial model. In a custodial scheme, tenancy deposits are transferred to the scheme for the duration of the tenancy. They are then repaid by the scheme operator following agreement between the landlord and tenant or following the outcome of a dispute resolution process in cases where there is no agreement.<br/><br/>It is my intention to introduce the legislative amendments in relation to the scheme at Committee Stage of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 in the Seanad in the first quarter of 2015.</p></reply>

The groups involved in overseeing the work on setting targets, namely the Dublin Social Housing Delivery Taskforce and the Social Housing Strategy Project Board, have met and commenced the process on setting targets with each local authority.

The cost to the Exchequer of building, acquiring, or leasing these 35,000 units over the period to 2020 is estimated to be &euro;3.8bn. <br/><br/>Budget 2015 marked a significant change in the trajectory of social housing funding with an increase in 2015 of some &euro;210m to &euro;800m and provides a commitment to multi-annual funding envelopes for social housing with clear capital commitment over the period to 2017. Budget 2015 also provided that off-balance sheet and more sustainable forms of funding will come into operation, with the announcement of an extension to the NAMA Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), a large scale Public Private Partnership (PPP) and a commitment to establish a Financial Vehicle. The Strategy provides a coherent policy and institutional framework within which these initiatives can be executed, connected and developed.<br/><br/>In 2015, I expect that 3,000 units will be provided through the leasing initiative; 1,000 vacant local authority units will be returned to use through a programme of refurbishment; with a further 1,400 units to be built or acquired by local authorities and approved housing bodies through the Social Housing Investment Programme and the Capital Assistance Scheme. In addition, a further 2,000 new Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) units will be delivered and 8,400 households will be assisted through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). <br/><br/>Under the Strategy&rsquo;s Governance structure, a dedicated Finance Working Group, with appropriate membership from within my own Department, the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Housing Finance Agency will progress the delivery of off sheet balance mechanisms within the time-frames outlined in the Strategy. <br/><br/>This Group will build on previous experience in developing off-balance sheet mechanisms such as the NAMA Special Purpose Vehicle and the National Asset Residential Property Service (NARPS) and will identify the necessary financial mechanisms which are capable of raising finance in a sustainable manner to ensure an appropriate supply of finance is available to support the provision of new social housing.<br/><br/></p></reply>

Under the terms of the facility, interest and commitment fees on the loan are rolled-up and added to the amount repayable by Irish Water at the end of the loan's term.  These rolled up amounts are expected by Irish Water to be approx. &euro;14m by September 2015.<br/><br/>As the loan facility was entered into prior to the introduction of the Water Service (No. 2) Act 2013 and the water regulatory regime, the facility was guaranteed by the Minister for Finance in accordance with Section 13 of the Water Services Act 2013.  A fee is payable quarterly by Irish Water to the Minister for Finance under the terms of the guarantee provided by the Minister.  The guarantee fee is expected to amount to &euro;10.4m over the life of the loan.<br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives and has contacted all Oireachtas members to provide details of an improved level of service which it is aiming to provide.  The team can be contacted via email to or by telephone on a new dedicated number, 1890 578 578.</p></reply>

The overall budget for the LEADER element of the RDP is &euro;250m.  </p>  <p>  In this context and coupled with the need to ensure sufficient budgetary resources to Local Action Groups (LAGS) to facilitate full and effective implementation of LEADER LDS Ireland will apportion the overall programme complement of &euro;250 million on the basis of 28 sub-regional administrative areas using evidence based open and transparent criteria.  These 28 areas consist largely of areas defined by the county boundaries including both Cavan and Monaghan.  There are two exceptions due to population size: Dublin, where the rural areas of the whole of Dublin County will make up one sub-regional area for LEADER purposes, and Cork, where three sub-regional areas will be required for LEADER purposes. </p>  <p>  The LEADER LDS selection process will be open and transparent and will consist of two separate stages providing the opportunity for all interested LAGs to participate.  Stage one, a call for Expressions of Interest to design and implement LEADER Local Development Strategies for the 2014-2020 programme period, will commence shortly.  This stage will be open to any entity that can show broad local and community participation and that has a coherent vision for the development of their area.  Interested groups will also be asked to outline the preparatory resources they may require in order to support the design and development of their LDS.   </p>  <p>  While the Government's preferred outcome is one LDS for each area, there will be no limit on the number of LAGs that can express an interest from within a sub-regional area.  The EOIs will be evaluated and entities selected to develop prospective LDSs by an independent Evaluation Committee, comprising an independent chair, my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine along with external rural and local development expertise.  In addition, my Department is developing operational procedures and systems in order to ensure full compliance with EU and National rules and regulations.  Notwithstanding the level of work to be done in advance of the programme becoming operational I expect that the programme will be in a position to start accepting funding applications by mid-2015.</p></reply>

No. 477 of 2006), the Road Safety Authority (RSA) has responsibility for the delivery of the National Car Test.  The RSA has overall responsibility for the operation, oversight, development, quality assurance and delivery of vehicle testing arrangements.     </p>  <p>  I understand from the RSA that the first two months of the year are traditionally the busiest time for the National Car Testing Service (NCTS) because most cars are sold in the first few months of any year. This, however, was anticipated by the NCTS and over 60 additional staff are being made available, bringing the number of Vehicle Inspectors in place this month to approximately 565, the highest in the history of the NCT.</p>  <p>  The RSA has also repeatedly emphasised that the availability of appointments on the NCTS website is not a reflection of the total number of test slots available to customers. If a person requires an early test, they should follow the advice on that website which clearly advises that if a suitable slot cannot be obtained online, to contact the NCTS call centre directly on (01) 413 5992.</p>  <p>  I understand from the RSA that it remains the position that any car owner, including those who may require an early test, should receive an NCT appointment within 28 days. In order to meet this standard, in some cases, the NCTS holds requests on a waiting list until a suitable slot is found. In the majority of cases, customers are given a slot within the required timescale.  </p>  <p>  The RSA has also been encouraging people to book early, as the test may be undertaken up to 90 days in advance of the due test date without affecting the expiry date of the new certificate. This system is to ensure that owners have ample time to have their vehicle tested before their current NCT certificate expires and I would encourage people to avail of this early facility for booking car test appointments.</p>  <p>  Enforcement of the relevant legislation is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. If a person&rsquo;s NCT test date is imminent, it will be a matter for the Garda&iacute; to use their discretion. However, responsibility rests with owners to ensure their vehicles are in compliance with the law.</p></reply>

Our Road Safety Strategy 2013 to 2020 incorporates many of the same principles. Our Strategy is based on the Safe Systems approach to road safety which is built on the principles of human behaviour, human frailty and forgiving systems. This approach reinforces the concept of shared responsibility across organisations, businesses and communities. It seeks to continue to reduce road fatalities, but also has a new focus on reducing the number and severity of injuries on our roads. It covers a wide variety of sectors that contribute to, and impact, on road safety including education, law enforcement, health as well as the many aspects of transport.<br/><br/>Our Road Safety Strategy 2013-20 has two main objectives. The first is a reduction of road collision fatalities on Irish roads to 25 per million population or less by 2020. This means reducing deaths to 124 or fewer by 2020. The second is a provisional target for the reduction of serious injuries by 30% from 472 in 2011 to 330 or fewer by 2020 (or 61 per million population).<br/><br/>The Road Safety Strategy 2013 - 2020 is available to download for the Road Safety Authority website at .</p></reply>

It is a cause of deep concern that road fatalities rose in 2013 and in 2014, despite the best efforts of the Road Safety Authority, the Garda&iacute; and other responsible agencies.     </p>  <p>  The Road Safety Strategy 2013 to 2020 contains 144 Actions to be implemented by the various agencies concerned in order to build on the previous Strategies with the objective of making Ireland among the safest countries for road safety.  My officials and I meet regularly with these agencies to ensure that all necessary measures are identified and taken to improve safety on our roads.  The Ministerial Committee on Road Safety meets twice per year, most recently on 8 December 2014, to review implementation of the Strategy.   </p>  <p>  Aside from the Strategy, the Road Traffic Act 2014, was signed into law by the President on 25th February 2014.  This legislation introduces measures which will further contribute to road safety in the years to come. The Act provides for further Graduated Driver Licensing measures, adjustments to the penalty points system, increasing demerits for the most dangerous offences such as speeding and operating a mobile phone while driving.  My officials are also in the early stages of drafting the Road Traffic Bill 2015 which will contain further measures to improve safety on our roads. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the actions set out in the Road Safety Strategy will be sufficient to allow Ireland to improve road safety and to make progress towards the objectives of reducing road deaths set out in the Strategy.   </p>  <p>  I would point out that all Gardai have responsibility for the enforcement of road traffic laws.  More specifically, the Garda Traffic Corps has been established for some 10 years and has made an important contribution to the improvement in road traffic law enforcement and road safety over the past decade.</p></reply>

However, at congested airports, such as Heathrow, a secondary market has developed that has allowed airlines trade slots to meet their changing business needs.</p>  <p>  The allocation of slots at congested airports in the EU is governed by EU Regulation.  Aer Lingus has access to a significant portfolio of slots at London Heathrow on the basis of so-called 'grandfather rights' under the Regulation.  The airline has these rights because it has been operating services to Heathrow for many decades.  As long as Aer Lingus continues to use these slots, it will retain the rights to them from season to season.</p>  <p>  Following the announcements on 18 December and more recently on 9 January that IAG had made approaches to Aer Lingus about a possible offer for the company, the Irish Takeover Panel has deemed that Aer Lingus is now in an 'offer period'.  The Takeover Panel Rules in relation to communications apply to all parties during an offer period, including the Government as a shareholder, and all parties must apply the highest standards of care to any statements made on the matter.</p>  <p>  Currently, no formal offer has been made to Aer Lingus' shareholders.  If an offer is made it will, of course, be given very careful examination before the Government takes any decision in relation to its shareholding.  In late 2012, following a third hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus, the Government indicated that it would not be prepared to sell the shareholding in circumstances which could significantly impact on competition and connectivity in the Irish market.  Such considerations would also be foremost in our minds if a further offer is made for the company.</p></reply>

More information on the Programme is available at .<br/><br/>In 2011 I allocated &euro;1.25m to the Irish Amateur Boxing Association to improve the standard of facilities of boxing clubs throughout the country.  This grant was overseen by the IABA and all affiliated clubs could apply for a maximum grant of &euro;25,000 to improve the standard of their premises.  In 2013 I decided to continue this successful scheme and allocated an additional amount of &euro;1m to the IABA.  In July 2014 I announced a further special allocation of &euro;975,000 to the IABA.  Most of the allocation (&euro;750,000) was to further extend the 2011 facilities initiative.  A smaller portion of the allocation (&euro;150,000) was to enable the IABA to purchase equipment for boxing clubs, while &euro;75,000 was provided for works at the National Stadium.  While all of the grants in this scheme have been allocated, the IABA will still accept applications to place on a waiting list in the event that any existing clubs in the scheme fail to take up their grant.</p></reply>

While my Department has responsibility for the promotion of the Per Cent for Art Scheme, it does not have a budget for it.  It therefore does not provide funding for the individual art projects and does not directly collect statistics on the scheme.<br/><br/>The scheme does not operate on the basis of a specific public art fund from which moneys are drawn to undertake or to commission works of an artistic nature.  Rather, under the terms of the Scheme, such works are factored into and funded from the overall budget of each capital project by the public body undertaking it. This is a matter for each project promoter or commissioning body and I, as Minister, have no statutory function in this regard.<br/><br/>Guidelines on the Per Cent for Art Scheme are available on the Public Art website <i>www.publicart.ie</i>.  The guidelines set out how project managers are to operate the scheme and provide a common national approach to its implementation. The Public Art website is also a comprehensive Public Art resource, which offers information on the operation of the scheme, as well as much of the output of the scheme. This includes a continuously updated of almost 250 permanent and temporary, public and socially engaged artworks made in Ireland, or of artwork made by Irish artists abroad. Many of these artworks were produced under the Percent for Art Scheme.</p></reply>

Following a Departmental review the landowners opted to take their cases to the Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board, an independently chaired Board which makes recommendations to me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, on such cases.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Board had not been in a position to meet for a number of months in late 2013 and early 2014, resulting in some delay. The matter was considered by the Board on 17 April 2014 when the recommendations were finalized and subsequently submitted to the then Minister.  </p>  <p>  Ministers must ensure that the designations appeals process is completed in the appropriate manner to meet the requirements of the relevant European Union legislation. Following receipt of the recommendations, my predecessor felt it would be useful to arrange a meeting between the Board members and officials of the Department to review the process followed. As a result, no decision was taken on the recommendations pending this meeting, which took place on 20 October 2014. </p>  <p>  Following that meeting and having considered fully the recommendations, I have recently decided upon all these cases. My Department is currently in the process of notifying the appellants of the outcome.</p></reply>
