It is committed to removing any barriers that remain which prevent persons with disabilities from participating in activation programmes and employment.  To this end, the Department provides a wide range of work related supports for people with disabilities.  The principal support is the EmployAbility service, which provides job coach support to people with disabilities in accessing jobs in the open labour market, and the service currently supports over 3,000 people.  Funding is also provided to AHEAD (Association for Higher Education Access and Disability) for the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) programme, an employment placement programme for graduates with disabilities.  Other supports include the provision of employment subsidies, workplace adaptation grants and specialist training courses that are specially designed for people with disabilities.  These supports, which cost an estimated &euro;37 million in 2015, play an important role in supporting increased participation in the labour force by people with disabilities.  In addition people with disabilities have access to nearly all of the standard supports available to other jobseekers.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s commitments to facilitating increased participation in employment for people with disabilities are reflected in the Comprehensive Employment Strategy.  A key part of this strategy will be the setting up an interdepartmental group, under an independent chair, to review and make recommendations on making work pay for people with disabilities through the examination of the complex interactions between the benefit system, the additional costs associated with work for people with disabilities and net income earnings from employment.</p>  <p>  A young person with a disability is free to avail of the Intreo service, where a range of supports are available.  Currently young people with disabilities presenting themselves at an Intreo Centre seeking employment supports are referred, without delay, to a Case Oficer, or to the Local Employment Service (LES).  </p>  <p>  The Youth Guarantee is focused in accordance with the EU recommendation on the young unemployed in receipt of jobseekers payments, and involves the conditionality related to such payments in respect of job search activity, availability for work, and willingness to take up appropriate offers of employment, training or temporary employment programmes.</p>  <p>  Although young people with disabilities have access to the Intreo services they are not, however, subject to the same conditionality in terms of a requirement to engage with those services.  The employment supports in place for them are of a voluntary nature and are tailored to individual circumstances and a person&rsquo;s capacity to engage with education, training or job-search programmes.  No minimum timeframe in which an offer of a job, further education, training, or apprenticeship applies.</p></reply>

The number of appeals received increased from an average of 15,000 per year up to 2009, to a peak of 35,500 in 2012, reducing annually thereafter to just below 25,000 in 2015. </p>  <p>  Significant effort and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeals process resulting in a substantial improvement in processing times in recent years. The average time for an appeal requiring an oral hearing reduced from 52.5 weeks in 2011 to 25.5 weeks in 2015 and for a summary decision from 25.1 weeks to 18.1 weeks.  In addition, the number of appeals on hands at the end of 2015 has decreased by 57.4% from a year-end peak of 20,414 in 2012 to 8,697 appeals on hands at 31 December 2015.</p>  <p>  There is no simple solution. The quasi-judicial nature of the appeals system means that there are inevitable time-lags involved. The system is flexible and fair and allows for review and submission of further information up to and including the oral hearing. The time taken is proportionate to the complexity of many of the issues under appeal, which require a high level of judgement and often involve complex legal questions.  </p>  <p>  A number of elements within the process are time-consuming including the need to ensure due process, natural justice and compliance with the statutory obligation to obtain the Department&rsquo;s appeal submission. If an oral hearing is requested by the appellant or is required to resolve conflicts, the processing time is prolonged. </p></reply>

Farm assist recipients retain the advantages of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme such as the retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.  The 2015 Revised Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure of almost &euro;89 million on the farm assist scheme.</p>  <p>  Changes introduced in Budgets 2012 and 2013 brought farm assist into closer alignment with the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme&rsquo;s treatment of self-employed persons.  Farm families with the lowest income were least impacted by these changes as the headline rates of farm assist were maintained.</p>  <p>  In December last all long term welfare recipients, including recipients of farm assist, benefitted from a 75% Christmas Bonus payment.  All recipients of farm assist with children are benefiting from the &euro;5 increase in child benefit rates payable from this month.  In addition, farm assist recipients eligible for the fuel allowance will gain from the increase of &euro;2.50 per week, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week over the fuel season.  This increased fuel allowance is in payment from last week.  </p>  <p>  All measures introduced, including proposals relating to the farm assist scheme, are assessed and analysed in terms of the impact they have.  Farm assist is kept under ongoing review from a policy and an administrative point of view by my officials.  Farmers affected by the recent flooding and who will suffer a severe deterioration in their annual income can apply for farm assist, subject to satisfying the usual rules of the scheme.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to change the current scheme criteria.</p></reply>

This endeavour is well underway and we are already reaping the benefits of these policies, including the ability to invest in the improvements I have announced over the last two years in welfare supports.</p>  <p>  One of the key Government&rsquo;s commitments made in 2011 was to maintain the value of the core weekly welfare rates, including rates for pensioners, while at the same time providing additional welfare funding to cater for the ongoing rise in the number of pensioners. We have delivered on this commitment.</p>  <p>  In addition, I reintroduced a Christmas Bonus payable at 25% of the weekly rate in 2015. The Bonus had been abolished by the previous Government in 2009. In Budget 2016, I was pleased to be in a position to provide a 75% Christmas Bonus payment for all welfare recipients. This means that a contributory pensioner couple (both aged 66 and over) received a bonus of   &euro;327.45 last December. </p>  <p>  Weekly personal rates of payment for all those aged 66 and over increased by &euro;3 per week from January with proportionate increases on qualified adult rates. These increases build on the increase in the living alone allowance I announced in Budget 2015.  In addition, all of those eligible for the Fuel Allowance, including pensioners, gain from the increase in January of &euro;2.50 per week, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week over the fuel season.</p>  <p>  Funding for the Free Travel scheme, which benefits a large number of persons with disabilities, carers and pensioners, is being increased by &euro;3m, from &euro;77m to &euro;80m, to meet increased numbers eligible for the scheme and therefore fully protect entitlements under the scheme. </p>  <p>  The Respite Care Grant, now renamed the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant to better reflect the usage of the grant, is being increased by &euro;325, from &euro;1,375 to &euro;1,700 per annum.  Furthermore, payment of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will be extended by 6 weeks, from 6 weeks to 12 weeks, after the death of the care recipient. These payments directly benefit full time carers including many who care for pensioners.</p>  <p>  Last year &ndash; much quicker than most economists had expected in 2011 &ndash; we were able to introduce a Budget that began the process of raising living standards and reinvesting in our communities, families and older people. We have kick-started the social recovery. We are continuing that process this year. </p></reply>

However, the Department of Social Protection has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as flooding</p><p>The Department has activated its humanitarian assistance scheme, which is means tested, administered by the local Community Welfare Service (CWS) to assist affected householders.  I can assure the Deputy that the necessary CWS staff are in place who are engaging with local authorities and emergency personnel to ensure supports are provided to those affected as swiftly as possible.  Department staff are proactive in assessing and meeting the demand for assistance through the establishment of emergency clinics and home visits.  </p><p>Emergency payments have already been made to 270 households with expenditure of over &euro;235,000, with further claims being processed presently.  These are mainly payments covering essential clothing, food, toiletries, meals for families relocated to emergency accommodation and fuel costs.  It is expected that the number of claims will increase in coming weeks, including the replacement of furniture and white goods and longer term financial supports.</p><p>The Government has not set a limit on the amount that can be paid to an individual household under this scheme.  Levels of payment depend on the severity of damage experienced and the household&rsquo;s ability to meet these costs.</p><p>Householders requiring assistance under the scheme should contact their local Department office for assistance.

The assessment found that employed lone parents experienced an increase of 2% in their household income while unemployed lone parents experienced an increase of 1.8%.  The cumulative impact of Budgets 2015 and 2016 also shows that budgetary policy would increase average household incomes for working lone parents by 2.8%.  Non-earning lone parents also experience above average gains of 2.4% per cent.</p>  <p>  Research shows that being at work reduces the at-risk-of-poverty rate for lone parents by three-quarters - compared to those who do not work, highlighting that the best way to tackle poverty among lone parents is to assist them into employment.   </p>  <p>  The one-parent family payment scheme reforms were introduced to address long-term social welfare dependency and poverty levels among lone parents and, also, to provide them with enhanced access to the Department&rsquo;s range of education, training, and employment supports to facilitate their progression into sustainable employment.</p>  <p>  The positive outcome of the reforms can be seen from the increase in the number of lone parents becoming new family income supplement recipients.  Of the lone parents affected by the reforms in July 2015, more than 3,000 became new family income supplement recipients by the end of 2015.  This indicates that these customers entered or increased their employment.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-01-13a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016011300062#WRA02400"><p>The CSO published the 2014 release of the Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) in November 2015. The key measure of poverty from a policy perspective is consistent poverty - the combination of at-risk-of-poverty and basic deprivation - as this is the basis for the national social target for poverty reduction. The rate of consistent poverty in 2014 was 8%, a slight though not statistically significant decrease on 2013.</p>  <p>  This survey found that the 29% of the population were affected by basic deprivation. This is a reduction of 1.5 percentage points on the 2013 rate, which in turn is the first reduction since 2007. A significant finding is that the vast majority of those experiencing basic deprivation are not at-risk-of-poverty, but are in low to middle income households.</p>  <p>  As noted, the basic deprivation data relate to 2014, and therefore do not reflect the full impact of the recovery underway in economic growth and employment. The unemployment rate, which was 10.4 in 2014, down from the crisis peak of 15.1% in 2011, has since fallen to less than 9% by the end of 2015.  As unemployment is strongly linked to poverty, we can expect to see further decreases in basic deprivation and other poverty indicators.  </p>  <p>  To reinforce the impact of the recovery on households, Budgets 2015 and 2016 have focused on measures to improve the lives and living standards of every family in the country.  For example, in Budget 2016 the Government committed over &euro;200 million to support families with children through higher income supports and increased provision of early childhood care and education and other forms of childcare.  </p>  <p>  The social impact assessment of these budgets show that average household incomes increased by a cumulative 2.3%. Furthermore, households with children are the biggest beneficiaries of Budget 2016, in particular working lone parents.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that the recovery continues and is felt by low and middle income working families. </p></reply>

In the period since the economic crisis (2009-2014), the average rate of child poverty was 9.9 per cent.  This compares with an average rate of 8.7 per cent in the years preceding the crisis (2005-2008), an increase of 1.2 per cent.</p><p>A key driver in preventing poverty among children is social transfers, such as welfare payments and child benefit.  In 2014, social transfers reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children from 44.6 per cent to 18.6 per cent, thereby lifting a quarter of all children out of income poverty.</p><p><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the national policy framework for children and young people 2014-2020</i>, published by my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in 2014 and approved by Government includes a specific target to reduce child poverty by two-thirds by 2020.  Meeting this target means lifting upwards of 100,000 children out of poverty. Under <i>Better Outcomes, Better Futures</i>, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in collaboration Departments such as my own and other relevant government departments is taking a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty.</p><p>In Budget 2016, the Government committed over &euro;200 million to support families with children by increasing child benefit and FIS rates and by investing in the provision of childcare.  The social impact assessment of the Budget, published by the Department of Social Protection, shows that families will gain up to 2 per cent in average household income.  Finally, a key way to tackle child poverty is to help unemployed families to take-up work and to improve the rewards from work. Government employment policies, such as <i>Pathways to Work</i>and the <i>Action Plan on Jobs</i>, along with income supports such as the family income supplement and the back to work family dividend, are clearly working in this regard.</p></reply>

These measures were further extended in 2014. Reduced JA rates for jobseeker&rsquo;s who are under 26 years of age is a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency. It aims to incentivise young jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.</p>  <p>  To guard against the development of welfare dependency I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If they do not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long term unemployed from a young age. Reduced rates of JA are a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.  Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of employment for young people.  </p>  <p>  Reflecting the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall.  The youth unemployment rate rose relatively rapidly in the recession, up to an average of over 30% in 2012. It has fallen in line with the overall recovery, to an average 19.2% by December 2015. However, these unemployment levels are still unacceptably high and the Government recognises that there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan and the Pathways to Work Strategy. In fact Pathways to Work 2016-2020 will be published shortly and will continue to prioritise measures to address youth unemployment with monthly engagement by case officers with all young unemployed jobseekers.</p>  <p>  Any proposal to increase the rates of JA for people under 26 would be a matter for Government to consider in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

Departmental staff administering rent supplement have a statutory discretionary power, provided for under Article 38 of Statutory Instrument 412 of 2007, to award or increase a supplement for rental purposes, for example, when dealing with applicants who are risk of losing their tenancy or in danger of homelessness.  There are no plans to amend or restrict this statutory power.</p><p>In addition, the Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute, with plans underway to extend this to Galway City.  </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s flexible approach has assisted approximately 5,800 households nationwide to retain their rented accommodation through increased rent payments, of which some 610 cases were approved in December 2015.  A county breakdown of the increased payments is provided in the attached tabular statement.</p><p>I believe that these measures and the recent reforms to the private rental sector will provide increased stability in what has become a highly volatile rental market.

Abolishing the bereavement grant provided an annual saving of &euro;22 million. This allowed the Department to protect other more fundamental social welfare payments such as the State pension. Accordingly, I have no plans to reinstate the bereavement grant</p>  <p>  There are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant. These include a weekly-paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pension based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.</p>  <p>  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension continue in payment for six weeks following a death while in budget 2016 I increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance. Guardian payments are available where someone is looking after an orphaned child. A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure including help with funeral and burial expenses which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. However, there is no automatic entitlement to such a payment. An ENP is a means tested payment payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances.</p></reply>

These ensure that people have an adequate income in old age.  This range of supports has resulted in very similar outcomes for male and female pensioners in Ireland.  Consistent poverty rates for women and men over 65 have effectively been at parity over a number of years, despite many women having lifetime lower earnings than men.</p>  <p>  The State pension contributory is one of the State pension schemes, and its rate of payment is related to contributions made over the years into the Social Insurance Fund.  As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid under that scheme.</p>  <p>  Entitlement to the contributory pension is determined by means of a &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; calculation, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life.  Payment rates are banded.  For example, someone with a yearly average of 48 contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a yearly average of 20 will qualify for a pension at the 85% rate. </p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Work has commenced on changing this to a total contributions approach where the number of contributions recorded over a work life will more closely reflect the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation. </p>  <p>  When proposals are agreed, legislation will be brought forward to underpin the necessary changes.  I believe that it is important that the changes be announced well in advance of introduction, to enable those workers affected to include the new factors into their retirement planning.  This new method will provide greater benefit for some, but not all, future pensioners than they would have had under the current system.  It is not anticipated that the changes will apply to existing pensioners.  Any reforms are required to contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the pensions system and not increase costs.   </p></reply>

In view of the reduction of supply in the private rented market and increasing rents at this time, the Department has implemented a policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits for both existing customers and new applicants.  The circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents are being increased above prescribed limits, as appropriate.  In addition, the Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute, with plans underway to extend this to Galway City.This flexible approach has assisted approximately 5,800 households nationwide to retain their rented accommodation through increased rent payments, of which some 4,500 cases were approved in 2015.  A county breakdown of the increased payments is provided in the attached tabular statement, a breakdown by local authority area is not available.</p><p>I believe that these measures and the recent reforms to the private rental sector will provide increased stability in what has become a highly volatile rental market.

The CSP provides a contribution to the wage costs on the basis that the services are not fully self-financing or the cost of provision would be prohibitive on users.  The Department does not set the wage rate but requires the payment of appropriate wage rates consistent with local norms.</p>  <p>  At December 2015, 398 companies employing some 2,800 employees were directly supported by the CSP.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.</p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for SPC also being satisfied.</p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. </p>  <p>  The most recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund confirms that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  It further confirms that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories, mostly women, have and will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund due to the distributive nature of the Fund. </p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation.  The position of women who were homemakers will be considered very carefully in developing this reform.</p></reply>

This international &lsquo;norm&rsquo; held true for Ireland before the recession, during the recession and again during the recovery period since 2012.  Youth unemployment rate rose relatively rapidly in the recession, from 9% on average in 2007 to over 30% in 2012. It has now fallen substantially in line with the overall recovery, to 19.2% by December 2015.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.  The fall in youth unemployment to date indicates that this strategy is working.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.</p>  <p>  Within this framework, the Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed. The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs. In 2015 monthly engagement by case officers with the young unemployed was implemented. For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for. Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training. Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and Tus, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment. </p>  <p>  The Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan provided for over 28,000 programme opportunities for unemployed young people in 2014 and the same in 2015.  This figure excludes some 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships. These PLC and apprenticeship places, together with the wide range of vocational third-level courses provided for the young, although not reserved for unemployed jobseekers, nevertheless contribute to the spirit of the guarantee.</p></reply>

This strategy has been succeeding; by Q3 2015 the level of employment is up by 140,000 from the lowest level reached in 2012.</p><p>The long-term unemployment rate peaked at 9.5% in Q1 2012 before falling to 5.0% in Q3 2015.  At the latter date, the long-term unemployed accounted for 54.1% of all those unemployed, down from almost 65% in early 2012.</p><p>Despite these improvements, the level of long-term unemployment, continues to be of concern.

In addition to ongoing reforms, the 2015 iteration of the strategy prioritises additional measures to enhance engagement with the long-term unemployed.  This includes a structured process of engagement with long-term unemployed people being referred to the activation process (Group Engagement followed by regular one-to-one case officer contact).  Second, a new contracted employment services model for the long-term unemployed, JobPath, began in the second half of 2015 and it will be fully rolled out to all Intreo offices by Q1 2016.  It is a payment by results contract model with third party providers of employment services that will provide additional capacity in order to engage more systematically with long-term unemployed jobseekers.  </p><p>In support of these enhanced engagement processes, 57,000 FET places were reserved for the long-term unemployed in 2015.  A minimum of 16,000 places for the long-term unemployed were also provided through key public employment programmes.  This includes an expansion of the JobsPlus initiative, an employment subsidy that incentivises employers to recruit the long-term unemployed.</p><p>A core focus of the <i>Pathways to Work</i>strategy for the period 2016-2020 will be continued prioritisation of those long-term unemployed.</p><p>Youth unemployment was 19.2% (36,200 persons) in December 2015 and has fallen from a peak of 31.1% in July 2012.  The Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.</p><p>Within this framework, the Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed.  The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  In 2015 monthly engagement by case officers with all young unemployed was implemented.  For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training.  Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and Tus, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment. </p><p>The Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan provided for over 28,000 programme opportunities for unemployed young people in 2014 and the same in 2015.  This figure excludes some 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships.  These PLC and apprenticeship places, together with the wide range of vocational third-level courses provided for the young, although not reserved for unemployed jobseekers, nevertheless contribute to the spirit of the guarantee.  </p><p>A number of the programmes provided for both young and long-term unemployed, across a range of government departments, benefit to varying degrees from support under EU structural funds.</p></reply>

An additional &euro;3 million was allocated to the programme as part of Budget 2016, bringing the allocation to &euro;42 million in 2016.</p>  <p>  There are two schemes operated under the school meals programme.

The second is the school meals local projects scheme through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects.</p>  <p>  In recent years priority for new applications for funding has been given to schools which are part of the Department of Education and Skills initiative for disadvantaged schools &ldquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rdquo; (DEIS).

However, the Department of Social Protection has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as flooding.</p><p>In early December 2015, the Department of Social Protection activated its humanitarian assistance scheme, administered by the local Community Welfare Service (CWS), to assist householders affected by the severe weather conditions. The situation in all affected areas is being monitored and CWS staff are engaging with the local authorities and other agencies to ensure supports are being provided to those affected as swiftly as possible. Emergency clinics have been opened in towns where required including Ballinasloe, Crossmolina, Athlone, Gort, Carrick on Suir and a number of towns in Kilkenny and staff are assessing and meeting the demand for assistance by the public as the needs arise and are visiting the homes of persons affected.</p><p>In dealing with emergency events of this nature, the Department generally adopts a three stage approach as follows: </p><p>- Stage 1 is to provide emergency income support payments (food, clothing and personal items) in the immediate aftermath of the event.  A relatively small amount of financial assistance is generally provided initially with payments around the country ranging from &euro;100 to &euro;500 depending on family size. </p><p>- Stage 2 generally involves the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items. It is not until the flood water abates and houses dry out that the full extent of the damage to homes will become known. </p><p>- Stage 3 is to identify what longer term financial support or works are required. It could take several months before this stage of response commences and this involves a cross Departmental/Agency response. Works carried out can include plastering, dry-lining, relaying of floors, electrical re-wiring and painting.</p><p>There has been over &euro;3.9m spent under this scheme since 2009. Since 4 December 2015 emergency payments have been made to 270 households with expenditure of over &euro;235,000 with further claims being processed. These are mainly payments covering essential clothing, food, toiletries, meals for families relocated to alternative accommodation and fuel costs. Support has been provided to 28 households in County Mayo to date under the scheme with expenditure of &euro;40,000.  A breakdown of payments by county is provided in the tabular statement below. <i></i>Statistics are not maintained for individual towns.</p><p>The scheme is demand led and there is a time lag between the flooding event and actual claims for financial support. It is expected that the number of claims will increase in the coming weeks as we move into stage 2 and stage 3 supports which cover the replacement of furniture and white goods and longer term financial supports.  I can assure the Deputies that CWS staff are working hard to ensure that supports are provided to people as quickly as possible. Statistics are not maintained on the number of applications received or their outcome.  </p><p>Assistance is not provided for losses which are covered by insurance or for commercial and business losses, or generally any loss or damage to private rented accommodation or local authority accommodation. However, the Department&rsquo;s focus at this time is on ensuring that persons, including tenants, immediate needs are met and emergency stage 1 payments are being made to tenants to ensure that basic requirements are provided.</p><p>Emergency payments under the Department&rsquo;s urgent needs payment (UNP) scheme may be considered in exceptional circumstances for landlords to cover essential items that have been damaged by flooding.  The normal conditions that apply to the UNP scheme would apply including that any subsequent insurance recovery may be used to reimburse the Department. Consideration will also be given to the ability of the landlord to meet these immediate costs.  Details on the UNP scheme is at  </p><p>The Department has been advised that the residents in the area referred to by Deputy Kelleher were affected on 29th/30th December when the river Glashaboy burst its banks.  The flooding appears to have been fluvial which is within the remit of the OPW.  The local authority is the principal response agency and Cork County Council responded to the flooding event by providing pumping equipment, where appropriate, and sandbags.  The purpose of the Department&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance scheme is to provide assistance to households who have been affected by flooding and other severe weather events, this can include hire of pumps for private houses in conjunction with the local authority as required, however, would not generally include the purchase of preventative equipment. </p><p>People seeking assistance under the scheme should contact their local DSP Intreo Centre or CWS office who will be able to offer assistance. Department contact phone numbers for persons in affected areas are available on the Department&rsquo;s website, as follows:</p><p><b>Humanitarian Assistance Payments by County ( 4 December 2015 &ndash; 8</b><b><sup></sup></b><b>January 2016)</b><table><tr><th>County </th><th><div>Number of Households</div></th><th><div>Expenditure</div></th></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td><div>93</div></td><td><div>&euro;58,398</div></td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td><div>32</div></td><td><div>&euro;56,173</div></td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td><div>28</div></td><td><div>&euro;39,904</div></td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td><div>26</div></td><td><div>&euro;9,200</div></td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td><div>21</div></td><td><div>&euro;5,814</div></td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td><div>13</div></td><td><div>&euro;7,400</div></td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td><div>11</div></td><td><div>&euro;9,073</div></td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td><div>9</div></td><td><div>&euro;13,622</div></td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td><div>7</div></td><td><div>&euro;2,250</div></td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td><div>7</div></td><td><div>&euro;6,435</div></td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td><div>7</div></td><td><div>&euro;3,400</div></td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td><div>5</div></td><td><div>&euro;9,710</div></td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>&euro;8,653</div></td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>&euro;1,500</div></td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>&euro;2,810</div></td></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>&euro;500</div></td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>&euro;230</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>270</div></td><td><div>&euro;235,072</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

It also belies the assertion that fiscal consolidation has disproportionately impacted on the most vulnerable in society. Central to this significant social policy outcome has been the Government&rsquo;s commitment to maintain the value of the core welfare rates, while at the same time providing additional welfare funding to cater for increases in the number of welfare recipients including, in particular, the ongoing rise in the number of pensioners. </p><p>The impact of social transfers (that is all welfare payments excluding pensions) on poverty and income inequality for the period 2008-2014 is set out in the tables appended to this reply using official EU indicators and data from Eurostat. </p><p>In 2014, social transfers reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate from 37.2% to 15.3%; thereby lifting over a fifth of the population out of income poverty. This is equivalent to a poverty reduction effect of 58.9%. Ireland is the best performing EU member state in reducing poverty through social transfers, higher even than the Scandinavian countries such as Denmark, Finland and Sweden. </p><p>Furthermore, Irish social transfers are almost twice as effective in preventing poverty as the EU average and up to four times more effective than the member states worst affected by the economic crisis.</p><p>With regard to income inequality, in 2014, Irish social transfers reduced the Gini coefficient from 45.6 to 30.7, an inequality reduction effect of 32.7% and the highest in the EU.  </p><p>The data in the tables shows the impact of social transfers and income inequality excluding pensions. Equivalent Eurostat data including the impact of pensions (social security and occupational) show equally strong impacts for Ireland and can be viewed at </p><p>The key achievement of this Government has been to stabilise the nation&rsquo;s finances, to increase employment and to achieve economic growth.  This endeavour is well underway and we are already reaping the benefits of these policies, including, the ability to invest in the improvements I have announced over the last two years in welfare supports.  </p><p>The recent Budget was designed to improve the lives and living standards of every person and every family in the country.  The 2016 Budget package I introduced had four key aims, as follows:</p><p>- To increase supports for pensioners aged 66 and over;</p><p>- To strengthen supports for families with children;</p><p>- To increase the momentum to date in helping jobseekers back to work; and</p><p>- To provide targeted assistance for vulnerable groups.</p><p>In Budget 2015, I reintroduced a Christmas Bonus payable at 25% of the weekly rate. The Bonus had been abolished by the previous Government in 2009. In Budget 2016, I was pleased to be in a position to provide a 75% Christmas Bonus payment for all welfare recipients. </p><p>Weekly personal rates of payment for all those aged 66 and over increase by &euro;3 per week from January with proportionate increases on qualified adult rates. In addition, all of those eligible for the Fuel Allowance, including jobseekers and lone parents, gain from the increase in January of &euro;2.50 per week, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week over the fuel season.</p><p>Funding for the Free Travel scheme, which benefits a large number of persons with disabilities, carers and pensioners, is being increased by &euro;3m, from &euro;77m to &euro;80m, to meet increased numbers eligible for the scheme and therefore fully protect entitlements under the scheme. </p><p>Families with children will benefit from the &euro;5 increase in the monthly rate of Child Benefit while lower income working families will also benefit from increases in the Family Income Supplement thresholds. &euro;3 million extra is also being provided for the School Means scheme.</p><p>The Respite Care Grant, now renamed the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant to better reflect the usage of the grant, is being increased by &euro;325, from &euro;1,375 to &euro;1,700 per annum.  Furthermore, payment of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will be extended by 6 weeks, from 6 weeks to 12 weeks, after the death of the care recipient. </p><p>These improvements show that we are on the right path. Our goal is an Ireland visibly better for all including those less well off. The last Budget was our fifth Budget. The first three were immensely difficult but they were necessary to restore our public finances to health, help sustain and create employment, and chart a course towards strong economic growth.

Payment of the bonus was abolished by the previous Government in 2009.  </p>  <p>  I was pleased to re-introduce the bonus in December 2014 at a rate of 25%.  On Budget Day, I announced a 75% Christmas bonus for 2015, which was paid to over 1.2 million beneficiaries in December last at a cost of circa &euro;197 million. </p>  <p>  The bonus paid in 2014 and in 2015 applied to all of the schemes to which it previously applied as well as the new back to work family dividend in 2015. The bonus was never paid to short-term welfare recipients including jobseekers with a duration of less than 15 months and illness benefit recipients generally. These arrangements have been continued and I have no plans to revisit the bonus arrangements for 2015. </p>  <p>  The key achievement of this Government has been to stabilise the nation&rsquo;s finances, to increase employment and to achieve economic growth.  This endeavour is well underway and we are already reaping the benefits of these policies, including, the ability to invest in the improvements I have announced over the last two years in welfare supports. These improvements have included the re-introduction of the bonus as well as a wide range of other Budget measures such as increases for pensioners, families and carers in Budget 2016 which cost an additional &euro;264 million. </p></reply>

Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years. This began in January 2014 with the standardising of State pension age for all at 66 years and the cessation of State pension transition. The State pension age will increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the specific compulsory retirement age and minimum pension age provisions which affect an individual public servant will reflect his or her particular employment sector and time of original recruitment. Public servants who must retire at age 65 can draw their public service pension at age 65. The State pension changes have no impact on such persons where they are in the modified social insurance category. </p>  <p>  Where alternatively they are in the full social insurance category, their public service pensions (and contributions) are, as with many occupational schemes, integrated (or co-ordinated) with social welfare benefits. This means the occupational pension paid is based on the assumption that the pensioner also receives the State pension. The State pension (contributory) entitlement is calculated with reference to the complete PRSI record, including contributions made while working in the public and private sectors. </p>  <p>  In the case of retirements of fully insured public servants at age 65, a discretionary supplementary pension may be payable under the rules of the public service scheme to bridge the gap until State Pension commencement at age 66 years. This supplementary pension is only payable where the individual, through no fault of his own or her own, does not qualify for social welfare benefit or qualifies at less than the maximum personal rate. It is therefore necessary to claim the available social welfare benefits in order to receive a supplementary pension. This situation is not new and already applies to public servants with a retirement age below 65 years.</p>  <p>  The current provisions, which apply to someone claiming jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit from a date after their 65th birthday, is that they may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.  While this is currently up to their 66 birthday, this approach will continue to extend their jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit entitlement continuing for another year when the pension age rises to 67, and indeed a further year when it rises to 68 in 2028.  This eligibility is of course still subject to satisfying conditions such as the &lsquo;genuinely seeking work&rsquo; condition. </p></reply>

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available at 65, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  State pension age will increase further to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  The changes introduced in 2011 were on foot of a Government commitment included in the National Recovery Plan published in 2010 and in the subsequent Memorandum of Understanding with the EU/ECB/IMF. </p>  <p>  The purpose of these changes is to make the pension system sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  More people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  In this context, the duration for which an average pension will be paid will continue to increase.  The number of pensions is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually as a result of this demographic change.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years. </p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  It was estimated at the time that the net saving resulting from its abolition, when taking into account that many people were instead in receipt of other payments at the lower rates applicable to those under 66, would amount to &euro;33.5m in 2014 and would amount to approximately &euro;65 million in 2015. </p>  <p>  There is no legal retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  In terms of financial supports, social welfare benefits will continue to be available to the age of 66 for those who are contractually obliged to leave employment.  Jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66.  </p>  <p>  There are no plans to introduce legislation to change from the current position. </p></reply>

The 2016 Budget package I introduced had four key aims, as follows:</p><p>- To increase supports for pensioners aged 66 and over;</p><p>- To strengthen supports for families with children;</p><p>- To increase the momentum to date in helping jobseekers back to work; and</p><p>- To provide targeted assistance for vulnerable groups.</p><p>While recipients of Disability Allowance and Invalidity Pension did not benefit from a weekly rate increase, they will benefit from a number of other Budget 2016 measures.  </p><p>In Budget 2015, I reintroduced a Christmas Bonus payable at 25% of the weekly rate. The Bonus had been abolished by the previous Government in 2009. In Budget 2016, I was pleased to be in a position to provide a 75% Christmas Bonus payment for all welfare recipients, including recipients of both Disability Allowance and Invalidity Pension.  A single person in receipt of Disability Allowance received a bonus payment of &euro;141 and a couple, with a qualified adult and no children received a bonus of &euro;234.60.  A couple in receipt of Invalidity Pension with a qualified adult and two qualified children received a bonus payment of &euro;293.40.  </p><p>In addition, those eligible for the Fuel Allowance will gain from the increase in January of &euro;2.50 per week, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week over the fuel season.</p><p>Funding for the Free Travel scheme, which benefits a large number of both Disability Allowance and Invalidity Pension recipients, is being increased by &euro;3m, from &euro;77m to &euro;80m, to meet increased numbers eligible for the scheme and therefore fully protect entitlements under the scheme. </p><p>Recipients of Disability Allowance and Invalidity Pension who have children will also benefit from the &euro;5 increase in the monthly rate of Child Benefit. </p><p>The Respite Care Grant, now renamed the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant to better reflect the usage of the grant, is being increased by &euro;325, from &euro;1,375 to &euro;1,700 per annum.  Furthermore, payment of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will be extended by 6 weeks, from 6 weeks to 12 weeks, after the death of the care recipient. These measures will benefit the carers of  those Disability Allowance and Invalidity Pension recipients who are relying on another person to provide full time care. </p><p>It should also be noted that as a result of Budget 2015, recipients of Disability Allowance and Invalidity Pension who live alone gained from the &euro;1.30 increase in the weekly rate of the Living Alone Allowance. </p><p>The key achievement of this Government has been to stabilise the nation&rsquo;s finances, to increase employment and to achieve economic growth.  This endeavour is well underway and we are already reaping the benefits of these policies, including, the ability to invest in the improvements I have announced over the last two years in welfare supports.</p></reply>

Various community services and activities are directly and indirectly supported by participants through these programmes and initiatives. </p>  <p>  T&uacute;s and Gateway were introduced and numbers on other schemes expanded as a direct response to the growth in the level of unemployment during the financial crisis.  As the economy continues to recover and the overall level of unemployment falls, the Department recognises the need to adapt these schemes to the changing circumstances, opportunities and needs of jobseekers and others.  The Department has no plans at present for a single scheme, but it will be keeping under review the changing circumstances and underlying rationale and resource commitments for the number of interventions currently being delivered. </p>  <p>  The Department will continue to work with stakeholders in planning the longer term needs of jobseekers and other customers.  It remains committed to ensuring that the social inclusion and community benefits that accrue from these schemes continue to be recognised and supported.  </p></reply>

The person concerned was ineligible for IP under national legislation on the grounds that the contribution conditions for the scheme were not satisfied.  </p>  <p>  EU Regulations provide that insurance contributions made in any other EU Member State may be aggregated with Irish contributions in order to satisfy the contribution conditions for payment of a pro-rata IP.   A request was sent to the Polish social security authorities requesting his Polish insurance record.  Receipt of this information confirmed that the person in question satisfied the contribution criteria for IP under EU Regulations and as he satisfied all other qualifying conditions the person concerned was awarded a pro-rata IP from the 2 April 2015.  He qualified for pro-rata IP at 28.30% of the basic rate thus entitling him a reduced rate.  </p>  <p>  On behalf of the person concerned, on 10 March 2015, this Department made a claim for an equivalent IP payment with the Polish social security authorities.  A decision on this application has not been received to date.   </p>  <p>  The spouse of the person concerned has recently become eligible for an increase in her jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit (JB) in respect of the person concerned as a qualified adult (IQA).  The IQA is payable at a higher rate than his current IP rate.  The person in question requested termination of his IP claim from the 4 January 2016 in order that his spouse may be granted IQA and payment to him of IP has ceased from this date.</p>  <p>  The Department has also received an application for Disability Allowance (DA) from the person concerned on the 21 December 2015.  The DA claim will be processed as quickly as possible and, should he qualify at a higher rate than the IQA rate on his spouse&rsquo;s JB, this payment will be awarded to the person in question in place of the IQA.</p></reply>

The pension was awarded with effect from 1 March 2008.  The decision notification which issued on 22 July 2008, outlined that pension arrears (if due to be paid), would issue shortly thereafter.  Social Welfare legislation requires that, in the first instance, due state pension arrears must be reconciled against any overlapping scheme payments the applicant may have received over the same period.  In this case, the due pension arrears were offset against the total jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit paid to the person and the increase for qualified adult paid on their spouse&rsquo;s state pension (contributory) during the relevant period.  </p>  <p>  The available pension arrears did not fully cover the amount due to be recovered by the Department for the aforementioned payments and accordingly no balance of pension arrears remained due to the person concerned.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-01-13a.203.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016011300065#WRD02800"><p>The overall concern in recent Budgets has been to protect primary social welfare rates. Abolishing the bereavement grant provided an annual saving of &euro;22 million. This allowed the Department to protect other more fundamental social welfare payments such as the State pension.  Accordingly, I have no plans to reinstate the bereavement grant. </p>  <p>  There are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant.  These include a weekly-paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pension based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension continue in payment for six weeks following a death, and in Budget 2016 I increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone is looking after an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease. </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  An application can be made under the ENP scheme for assistance with funeral and burial expenses.  The assistance is toward the costs of the necessary basic requirements for a dignified funeral.  However, there is no automatic entitlement to such a payment.  An ENP is a means tested payment payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the individual applicant and that of the deceased person including any savings, property, insurance policies, etc. that would render the applicant or anybody else liable for the burial costs.  The Department official will also consider if a bereavement grant is available from any other source including former employer, credit union or trade union. </p></reply>

The community services programme (CSP) provides financial support in the form a contribution to the cost of wages to community companies that provide revenue generating services of a social inclusion nature not otherwise provided.  These community companies operate on a community business or social enterprise model. Companies supported by the CSP are funded on the basis that they are allowed to generate and use income from the services they provide to pay staff, meet overhead costs and to contribute to their future development.  The CSP provides a contribution to the wage cost on the basis that the services are not fully self-financing or the cost of provision would be prohibitive on users. The Department does not set the wage rate but requires the payment of appropriate wage rates consistent with local norms.</p>  <p>  Companies employing some 2,800 employees are directly supported by the programme.  At the end of 2015, the Department estimates that some 60% of these employees are paid above the level of the minimum wage, in keeping with the social inclusion and social benefit objectives of the programme.  The Department is committed to working with the remaining companies to achieve the objective of paying a reasonable wage. </p>  <p>  Contracts of up to three year duration are provided for under the CSP.  Arrangements whereby individual companies will be able access additional financial resources to compensate for the welcome increased in the minimum wage are being put in place.

FIS is designed to prevent child and family poverty and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment as compared to social welfare payments.  Expenditure on FIS for 2015 is estimated to be of the order of &euro;349.2 million and it is currently paid to some 55,000 families in respect of almost 121,000 children. </p>  <p>  An integral part of FIS is that the payment continues at the same rate for a period of 52 weeks, assuming the eligibility requirements continue to be met, except in the following circumstances:</p>  <p>- If a claimant starts to care for an additional child in the course of the 52 weeks. </p>  <p>- If a claimant was getting a one-parent family payment and this payment was stopped because their youngest child reached the relevant age limit.</p>  <p>The rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in earnings.  The advantage of this approach, which is unique to the FIS scheme, is that claimants will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period.  This certainty is important to the success of the scheme as it provides an incentive to claimants to maximise their earnings from employment (e.g. more hours, higher wages).  For those who experience a reduction in earnings, the rate of payment will be reassessed at renewal of their FIS claim.    </p>  <p>  This aspect of the FIS scheme is important in minimising the administrative effort associated with the scheme and in speeding up processing times for claims, which could otherwise be subject to delays due to periodic reviews.</p>  <p>  A legislative review of the 52 week rule was carried out in 2013/14 and an amendment was included in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2014 to reflect this policy.  In view of the above, I have no plans to change the legislation.</p></reply>

There are two basic principles which underpin the Irish social insurance system.  Firstly there is the contributory principle which links the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and their entitlement to a range of benefits and pensions.  Where a person has sufficient PRSI contributions, then benefits and pensions may be paid, subject to legislative provisions, where a particular contingency arises, and without a means test.  Secondly there is the solidarity principle where the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons.  PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more likely to have an income need as a result of circumstances that have arisen in their lives.  In this regard, it should be noted that most PRSI contributors do not experience all of the contingencies during their life.  For example, one contributor may never require access to Invalidity Pension whereas it may be a crucial support for another.  It should also be noted that access to Widow&rsquo;s/Widower&rsquo;s/Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory Pension is available to those who have been married or in a civil partnership only, and that scheme will not benefit someone who has been single all their life. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the benefits and pension system is to provide a person with an adequate income.  The rate of payment is set with this objective in mind, and the fact that there are a number of ways one can qualify for a pension does not mean someone may qualify for multiple PRSI-funded pensions.  There is a principle of one person, one payment, which generally applies across the social welfare system.  It can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time.  For example, an unemployed person may also become sick and incapable of work.  The PRSI paid by the person and their employers only provides coverage for one payment at such times.  Under the legislation for the schemes, if a person experiences more than one of these contingencies at the same time, generally he or she can receive only one payment.  Similar legislative provisions apply in the case of PRSI funded pensions, and a person cannot be in receipt of both a State pension contributory and a Widow&rsquo;s/Widower&rsquo;s contributory pension at the same time.  It should be noted, however, that the maximum personal rate of a Widow/Widower&rsquo;s contributory pension is significantly higher for those aged 66 or over than it is for a widow or widower of working age, as it is aligned with the maximum personal rate for the State pension contributory.  This principle of no more than one main payment per person is common to social security systems across the world.</p>  <p>  Arrangements in relation to private pensions vary across the wide range of schemes and investment products available, each of which may have different benefits depending on a scheme&rsquo;s rules or product type.  Private occupational pensions generally require additional contributions to provide survivor&rsquo;s benefits.  In nature they differ significantly from State pensions.  Private pensions do not generally have the broad social solidarity based provisions common to social welfare pensions, nor the high level of direct State subsidy which exists for State pension schemes financed from the Social Insurance Fund.</p>  <p>  Amending the State pensions system, to allow for two pensions be paid to one person, would be a significant change to the system, providing certain people with the pension income considered necessary for two people, and would greatly increase the cost of the pensions system.  This extra cost would have to be financed from either an increase in the rate of PRSI contributions, an increase in the Exchequer subvention to the scheme, or a reduction in the rate of payments. I have no plans to introduce such a change.</p></reply>

Expenditure on pensions at approx. &euro;6.974 billion is the largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2016, representing approx. 35.5% of overall expenditure.  Because of demographic changes, the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  The Department had to make provision for an additional &euro;84 million in 2016 for the increasing number of pensioners.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. </p>  <p>  The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance was estimated to provide annual savings of &euro;48 million, and with the year-on-year increase in the number of people qualifying for the household benefits package, this yearly saving will increase.  These savings meant that the Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence.  The Department will spend approximately &euro;227 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 416,000 customers. </p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and I have sought to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way.  In Budget 2016, I was able to announce the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years, by &euro;3 per week.  This will increase the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  I was also pleased to announce a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.  I believe that, taken together with other changes, such as increasing the Christmas Bonus to 75% of weekly rate, the impact of this Budget will be very positive for older people.</p></reply>

It is typically paid to a person, but where the caring duties are shared on a part-time basis in an established pattern, it can be paid to two people.  In the case of the latter, the annual carer&rsquo;s support grant will also be shared.</p>  <p>  I should point out that there is also provision, where a person has an entitlement to carer&rsquo;s allowance and their spouse, co-habiting or civil partner has an entitlement to another social welfare payment, for half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance to be paid in addition to the primary income support, and I have no plans to introduce any change along the lines proposed in the question.</p></reply>

The Government has provided &euro;30.3 million for the ENP scheme in 2016. </p><p>There is no automatic entitlement to a payment.  The ENP scheme is demand-led and payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.</p><p>An application can be made under the ENP scheme for assistance with funeral and burial expenses.  Relevant circumstances of the applicant and that of the deceased person including any savings, property, insurance policies, etc. are considered in determining an application for support towards funerals and burials.  The Department official will also consider if a bereavement payment is available from any other source including former employer, credit union or trade union.  Approximately 2,700 payments were made in 2015 in respect of funeral and burial costs at a cost of some &euro;4.4 million.</p><p>Statistics are maintained relating to payments under the ENP scheme, however they are not maintained on the number of applications received or the outcome of those applications, or on the number of payments made to families.  The number of ENP payments made in each of the past six years is contained in the tabular statement.  Details of the number of ENP payments made in each of the past 12 months in relation to funeral and burial expenses is also contained in the tabular statement. </p><p><b>Number of ENP Payments for funeral and burial expenses from January to December 2015</b><table><tr><th>Month</th><th>Number of Payments</th></tr><tr><td>January</td><td>239</td></tr><tr><td>February</td><td>288</td></tr><tr><td>March</td><td>305</td></tr><tr><td>April</td><td>240</td></tr><tr><td>May</td><td>269</td></tr><tr><td>June</td><td>230</td></tr><tr><td>July</td><td>229</td></tr><tr><td>August</td><td>186</td></tr><tr><td>September</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>October</td><td>168</td></tr><tr><td>November</td><td>176</td></tr><tr><td>December</td><td>168</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>2,698</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Number of Exceptional Needs Payments for 2010 to 2015</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of Payments</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>218,000</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>226,200</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>197,000</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>133,000</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>107,000</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>96,000</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  </p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.  In this context, even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they may qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances.  </p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied. </p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. </p>  <p>  The combination of measures under the Social Protection code have resulted in very low levels of consistent poverty, both for men and women, aged over 65.  The most recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund confirms that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories, mostly women, have and will continue to obtain the best value for money due to the distributive nature of the Fund. </p>  <p>  There are no statistics available to my Department detailing the numbers who spent period(s) outside the Irish labour market to care for their families, and who, as a direct result of those periods, would not qualify for a State pension.  Such statistics would comprise largely of people who have not paid PRSI for many decades, and who in many cases would not have made a claim under the State pension system.  There are a great number of reasons why someone might cease paying PRSI contributions from a certain date, and the data sought by the Deputy is not, therefore, available to my Department.</p></reply>

The (STEA) provides immediate access to those who qualify for jobseekers benefit wishing to set up a business.  Payment under the scheme is at the same rate and for the same duration as their entitlement to jobseekers benefit. The BTWEA is designed to provide a monetary incentive for people who are on social welfare payments to develop a business while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment over two years - 100% in year 1 and 75% in year 2.  Business proposals must be recommended by a local development company or local enterprise office before an application is considered for payment of the allowance.</p>  <p>  At the end of December 2015, there were 396 people availing of the STEA and 11,881 people availing of the BTWEA.</p></reply>

FIS is designed to prevent child and family poverty and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment as compared to social welfare payments.  There are currently some 55,000 families with some 120,000 children in receipt of FIS. Expenditure on FIS is estimated to be of the order of &euro;349.2 million in 2015. </p><p>To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in insurable employment which is expected to last for at least three months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week. Therefore, self-employed people are not eligible for FIS. </p><p>The rationale for not extending eligibility for FIS to include self-employed persons includes:</p><p>- the practical difficulties in defining and controlling an alternative to the hours worked condition;</p><p>- the difficulty in establishing satisfactorily a self-employed person&rsquo;s hours of employment and certifying this on an ongoing basis;</p><p>- existing arrangements to provide income support to self-employed people on low incomes, such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and farm assist for low-income farmers;</p><p>- the cost of extending the scheme to the self-employed would be considerable.</p><p>Any extension of FIS to other categories of persons such as self-employed persons would have to be considered in a budgetary context. There are no plans for such an extension in present circumstances.</p><p>However, I would bring the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the Back to Work Family Dividend, which helps families to move from social welfare into employment, including self-employment, by retaining their qualified child increase for up to two years. As of December 2015 there were 10,554 families in receipt of the dividend, of whom 94 were in self-employment.</p></reply>

Revenue has also advised me that the granting of charitable status is a question for the Charity Regulator since October 2014. </p>  <p>  The 'exclusion' includes 'approved bodies of persons' (such as sports bodies) as defined by Section 235 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997. For this reason, a sports body is not within the definition of a charitable organisation and cannot be granted a charitable tax exemption. However, Section 235 and various other Sections and Acts provide for certain tax exemptions for approved sports bodies, for example, Income Tax, Corporation Tax, Dividend Withholding Tax (Sec 172C(2)(f)TCA) and Stamp Duty (Sec 82B(1) Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999).</p>  <p>  The VAT treatment of goods and services in the State is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law. The EU VAT Directive (Council Directive 2006/112/EC) provides that the standard rate of VAT (23%) must be applied to various supplies such as sports gear.

This obligation also stems from the Fiscal Compact, to which Ireland acceded following the referendum in 2012, and has also been enshrined in domestic legislation through the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.</p><p>As Ireland is not yet at its MTO, it must improve its structural balance by more than 0.5% of GDP per annum until the MTO is reached. In the Country Specific Recommendations (CSRs) adopted by the Council on 14<sup>th</sup>July 2015 an improvement of 0.6% was stipulated for 2016. The forecasts in the Budget for subsequent years were based on a minimum annual structural improvement consistent with the table below.  </p><p>The required adjustment for 2017 will be set in the CSRs to be adopted by the Council next July on the basis of a European Commission recommendation. The Commission has clarified over the last year the basis on which it will make its recommendation for an appropriate improvement in the structural balance for each Member State. Its analysis takes account of the debt-to-GDP ratio, the size and sign of the output gap and whether the economy is growing faster than potential.  The matrix describing the required structural adjustment based on these criteria has been published by the Commission and is outlined below.  The rationale for the differentiated approach is to better align the required fiscal adjustment with the prevailing economic environment.</p><p><b>Matrix for specifying the annual fiscal adjustment towards the Medium-Term Objective (MTO)</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th></th><th>Required annual fiscal adjustment*</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>% GDP </td><td>Condition</td><td>Debt below 60 and no sustainability risk</td><td>Debt above 60 or sustainability risk</td></tr><tr><td>Exceptionally bad times</td><td>Real growth &amp;lt; 0 or output gap &amp;lt; -4</td><td>No adjustment needed</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Very bad times</td><td>-4output gap &amp;lt; -3</td><td>0</td><td>0.25</td></tr><tr><td>Bad times</td><td>-3output gap &amp;lt; -1.5</td><td>0 if growth below potential, 0.25 if growth above potential</td><td>0.25 if growth below potential, 0.5 if growth above potential</td></tr><tr><td>Normal times</td><td>-1.5output gap &amp;lt; 1.5</td><td>0.5</td><td>&amp;gt; 0.5</td></tr><tr><td>Good times</td><td>output gap 1.5</td><td>&amp;gt; 0.5 if growth below potential,0.75 if growth above potential</td><td>0.75 if growth below potential,1 if  growth above potential</td></tr></table></p><p>Accordingly the minimum level of the required improvement in the structural balance is set for each Member State in the CSRs addressed to them by the Commission and Council in accordance with the above matrix of requirements. </p><p>Projections in Budget 2016 provide for the cost of demographic pressures and the public capital plan over the period to 2021, together with the cost of the Lansdowne Road agreement to 2018. The implied pace of structural adjustment, consistent with these assumptions is set out in the Budget document. Were Ireland to pursue an annual structural adjustment below the level stated in the Budget, in terms of a broad order of magnitude each 0.1% would translate into about &euro;67 million of fiscal space in terms of additional permitted spending each year under the expenditure benchmark. It should be borne in mind, however, that any additional fiscal stimulus would have an economic impact, which would in turn, impact the level of fiscal space available.</p></reply>

The question of invasive tests or examinations based on biological samples (urine, saliva, etc.) arises only where there is a strong suspicion of ingestion.

Revenue reviewed the judgments, and considered that the practice which best ensured the safety of a prosecution while protecting the rights of the individual was to have any samples taken or detention carried out under specific legal authority after arrest.

The scheme operates on the basis that an employer pays for the Travel Pass on behalf of an employee at the start of the year and the payment is deducted from the employee's emoluments over the course of the year.  The incentive operates on the basis that, although such a payment out of an employee's income should be made out of after-tax income, section 118B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that the remuneration foregone shall be exempt from tax.  This has the effect of reducing the cost of the Travel Pass to the employee by the amount of tax that would have been paid on the equivalent amount of income at the employee's marginal rate (the highest rate of tax at which the employee is paying tax).  In this way the employee, over the course of a year, only suffers the net cost of the Travel Pass, deducted on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis, with the total initial cost met by his or her employer.</p>  <p>  Where an employer provides a Travel Pass without charge to an employee, section 118(5A) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that there is no benefit-in-kind charge on the employee in relation to cost of the Pass.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that where an individual's employer does not participate in the Travel Pass scheme, any benefits that could arise under the scheme will not be available to any employees of that employer.  Also, where an employee's income is exempt from income tax, no benefit will arise.</p>  <p>  In general, employees do not pay income tax on the first &euro;16,500 of their income because of the PAYE and personal tax credits, and in some cases, depending on eligibility for additional credits, they may be exempt from income tax at even higher levels of income.</p>  <p>  In addition, individuals can earn up to &euro;18,304 without becoming liable to PRSI.  Furthermore, as a result of the changes introduced in  Budget 2016, a further 40,000 low earners will be exempt from the charge to USC from next year and the remainder within the scope of USC will have their liability reduced through the reductions in the three lowest rates of USC which have taken effect from 1 January.</p>  <p>  Budget 2016 also introduced a new PRSI credit, available only to lower earners, in order to address the PRSI step effect which could act as a dis-incentive for low earners to earn additional income within a band of earnings at around &euro;18,000 to &euro;19,000 per year. </p>  <p>  For the second Budget in a row, taxpayers within the charge to income tax and/or USC on their earnings should see a reduction in their tax liability in 2016, where income remains the same.</p></reply>

I am advised by Revenue that they offer a range of service channels which are adapted to meet the changing demands of taxpayers.  Having regard to the changing nature of the demand for service, Revenue introduced an appointments service in its Tralee Office last November.  A dedicated telephone line for the purposes of making appointments is operated Monday to Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. and appointments are facilitated on a basis agreed with the taxpayer in each instance.  If, during the course of the initial telephone conversation, the Revenue official identifies a more efficient and cost effective means for the taxpayer to carry out their business, the taxpayer will be advised and assisted in this regard. </p>  <p>  The appointments service was flagged in advance on the Revenue website and with public notices around the county from early November.  Despite this, where a taxpayer was unaware of the new appointments service and travelled a long distance to the Office the person was facilitated with an immediate appointment. </p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that the appointments service in Tralee Office is subject to ongoing close monitoring and review.  Taxpayers will continue to be provided with a flexible and responsive service to meet demand.</p></reply>

While they are not required to do so, insurance companies usually pass this charge onto non-life insurance policy holders.  Therefore, the amounts paid into the ICF are paid ultimately by non-life policy holders and not all taxpayers per se.   </p>  <p>  The Insurance Compensation Fund levy has been applied on two occasions, with a total of &euro;442.8m has been collected to date.  The first instance was following the collapse of PMPA in 1983 and the collection of this levy ended in 1992.  The second followed the placing of Quinn Insurance into administration, with the collection of the levy starting in 2012. </p>  <p>  In the case of the insolvency of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland a levy was not applied.  ICI, a subsidiary of Allied Irish Bank, collapsed in 1985.  No levy was placed on the industry then as compensation to meet the company's liabilities was provided by a combination of AIB funding, commercial loans and State loans which have since been repaid. </p>  <p>  The Insurance Act 1964 provides that the Minister for Finance may, on the recommendation of the Central Bank of Ireland, advance monies to the ICF on such terms as to repayment, interest and other matters as may be determined by the Minister, so as to enable payments out of the Fund to be made expeditiously.  </p>  <p>  In relation to Quinn Insurance in Administration (QIL) I, as the relevant Minister, have since November 2011 advanced a total of &euro;1,012.3m to the ICF, &euro;200m of which has been refunded by QIL.  The remaining balance of &euro;812.3m is a loan which is required be repaid to the Exchequer from the ICF over time with interest.  </p></reply>

However, credit unions differ from banks in that they exist to attain the economic and social goals of the people who comprise their membership. </p><p>Credit unions have a key role to play in providing access to credit and other important services in local communities throughout the country.  This Government recognises this and has put in place a number of measures to ensure that credit unions can continue to provide these vital services to their members and to ensure the stability of the sector into the future.  These measures include:</p><p>- the establishment of the Commission on Credit Unions;</p><p>- the publication of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012;</p><p>- the establishment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board ReBo;</p><p>- the establishment of a stabilisation levy to support credit unions that are undercapitalised but are otherwise viable;</p><p>- the availability of &euro;250 million for voluntary restructuring of credit unions facilitated by ReBo; and</p><p>- the availability of &euro;250 million for resolution purposes.</p><p>These measures stemmed from recommendations made by the Commission on Credit Unions in its final Report and have been implemented over the last five years to acknowledge the increasing role for a strengthened and revitalised credit union sector, thus putting credit unions in a position to play an increasing role in the retail financial landscape of the future in this country.</p><p>My Department is always open to considering new proposals in relation to credit unions, particularly those that would see the development of the credit union business model and an increase in income for the sector while protecting members savings.</p></reply>

A large number of financial services taxpayers additional to section 110 companies are assigned to that District.

Assistance is provided to the District by other specialised areas of the Large Cases Division, In addition, other specialised areas of Revenue provide assistance in monitoring section 110 companies, including in the areas of legislative interpretation, tax return processing and collection functions.  Activities are recorded by reference to function (e.g. audit, other risk interventions, customer service) rather than by reference to taxpayer type (e.g. section 110 companies).

The primary purpose of the meetings was to discuss the type of information available to Revenue and agree the format for the transmission of information to meet the requirements of section 88. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-01-13a.600.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016011300075#WRO01550"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 216 and 218 together. </p>  <p>  The original 0.6% levy ended in 2014 and the additional levy of 0.15% for 2014 and 2015 ended last year. No pension fund levy will be applied for 2016 or is planned for future years.</p>  <p>  In both cases the details supplied refer to a particular pension scheme.  Two arguments are made in relation to this scheme.  The first is that the deficit in the scheme's fund has been made worse by the levies.  The second is that members of the scheme have had their pensions reduced as a result of the levies. </p>  <p>  The chargeable persons for the levies are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) responsible for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans.  The payment of the levies is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levies.  It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levies should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible. </p>  <p>  However, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, in no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levies. </p>  <p>  If it is the case that the trustees of the scheme in question have chosen to pass on the cost of the levies then, to the extent to which they have done so, any deficit which the scheme was carrying will not have been increased as a result of the levies. </p>  <p>  It is not the case, as suggested in the details supplied, that any part of the levies will be due for payment in 2016.  The payment date for the final part of the 0.15% levy was the 25th of September 2015.</p>  <p>  In the details supplied it is suggested to return money collected through the levies "in line with the return of money to retired public servants".  While public service pensions are not fund-based and so have not been subject to the pension fund levies, serving and retired public servants have been subject to the Pension Related Deduction (PRD) and Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) as appropriate, reducing, respectively, salaries and pension payments.  While changes to the PRD and PSPR are proposed to start from this year which will result in reductions in the PRD and the PSPR, particularly affecting public servants on low and middle incomes and retired public servants in receipt of low pensions, there is no provision for the repayment of PRD or PSPR deductions which have already been made.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to repay the pension fund levy tax collected as suggested in the details supplied.  The value of the funds raised by way of the levies have been used on reduced tax and increased expenditure measures as part of the Jobs Initiative to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State.  Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levies may have been passed on by the chargeable persons for the levies will benefit from the changes which I began in Budget 2015 and continued in Budget 2016 to reduce the tax burden on low and middle income earners.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is not necessary, as suggested, to rescind the legislation which enabled the levies as it was explicitly time-bound and no longer applies. </p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, the NAMA Chairman and Chief Executive appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on 16 December 2015. At that appearance, the NAMA Chairman provided an updated estimate to the Committee when he stated that, assuming current market conditions prevail, NAMA "will have generated [an upper-range] surplus of the order of &euro;2 billion to hand over to the Exchequer". I am advised that NAMA is currently conducting its end-2015 impairment review and, when that has been completed and approved by the NAMA Board, NAMA will formally update its projection for its terminal surplus position.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that NAMA estimates its projected terminal surplus on the basis of a range and that the projected &euro;2 billion, which is at the upper end of that range, assumes that market conditions will remain favourable. However, even in an adverse scenario, where market conditions deteriorate, NAMA advises that it anticipates a surplus to the State, with a lower-range projection of approx. &euro;0.5 billion.</p></reply>

However, significant regional differences exist particularly as between the Dublin region and the rest of the country. Outside of Dublin, asking prices grew by 13% on an annual basis while the rate of growth in Dublin has continued to moderate, falling from almost 25% in mid-2014 to below 3% by the end of 2015.    </p>  <p>  Changes in property prices reflect a range of interrelated factors on both the demand and supply side of the property market. The strong economic recovery and in particular the increase in employment has brought about a strong increase in the demand for housing. However, owing to a number of constraining factors, the supply response has been sluggish to date, in turn contributing to recent price developments.  </p>  <p>  The Government has taken an active role in addressing the ongoing issues in the housing and rental market. Most recently, Minister Kelly and I announced the Rent Certainty and Housing Supply package, agreed by Government, which is designed to stabilise the rental market in the short run and support the sustainable growth in the housing market over the long term. In terms of specific measures intended to increase housing supply, the package includes changes to planning guidelines and standards, support for housing-enabling infrastructure and a targeted rebate of development contributions for housing supplied below certain price levels in Dublin and Cork where supply constraints are most binding.</p>  <p>  This package builds upon Construction 2020 Strategy: A Strategy for A Renewed Construction Sector which sets out the Government's overall strategic approach to increasing housing supply. Under this Strategy, important progress have been made to date in addressing issues including the planning system, development finance, industry capacity and skill constraints and construction costs. The actions taken under Construction 2020 are complemented by the ongoing implementation of the Social Housing Strategy and the plans by NAMA for the construction of 20,000 residential units by 2020.  </p></reply>

The lending institutions then apply the criteria to the interest payments received from borrowers to calculate the correct amount of relief. Revenue also carries out regular assurance checks to ensure the lending institutions are applying the relief in line with the instructions.</p><p>In regard to the Deputy's question on making the public aware of the relief, Revenue has confirmed to me that it has published very comprehensive notes and guidelines in relation to Tax Relief at Source (TRS) entitlements on its website at and that it also operates a telephone helpline service on 1890 46 36 26 to assist borrowers in correctly claiming their entitlements. </p><p>I am satisfied that the measures already in place by Revenue are sufficient to ensure that mortgage interest relief is applied in accordance with the legislation. </p></reply>

Were the USC abolished, the full year impact, incorporating recent changes to the USC, would cost approximately &euro;3.7 billion. It should be noted these USC projections assumed some indexation of the USC, which increase the cost of abolition. In terms of broad order of magnitude, were the USC abolished over the medium term, this would absorb one third of the currently available gross fiscal space.</p><p>Since coming into Government, I have already made several significant changes to the Universal Social Charge to increase its fairness.  As a result of a Review of USC by my Department, the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum.  This removed an estimated 330,000 individuals from the charge in that year. Further increases in Budgets 2015 and 2016 brought the exemption threshold to &euro;13,000, resulting in a situation in which an estimated 29 per cent of income earners being outside the scope of USC in 2016. </p><p>Furthermore, I also reduced the three lower rates at which USC is charged and increased the thresholds for these rates.  These measures, together with the introduction of a new 8 per cent rate on income over &euro;70,044, further enhanced the existing progressive nature of the USC. </p><p>I have committed, if given the opportunity, to continue to progressively abolish the Universal Social Charge as part of a wider reform of the income tax system to reward work and reduce the marginal rate to no more than 50 per cent for all workers to make Ireland more attractive for mobile foreign investment and skills, including for our returning emigrants. As in the previous two budgets, in which the benefits of USC and income tax cuts have been capped at &euro;70,000 in earnings, it is my intentionshould I be given the opportunity to present further budgetsto claw back some of the benefits of USC abolition for the highest earners. I will be setting out the details of my party's position on this issue in due course.</p><p>The Deputy requested that I provide details of the gain which would accrue on the abolition of the Universal Social Charge for an employee or self-employed worker at specified income levels. These details are outlined in the table below. For this purpose, the average industrial wage is taken from the Central Statistics Office average weekly earnings statistics for the &quot;Industry&quot; economic sector in Q3, 2015 of &euro;833.  Average weekly earnings across all economic sectors in the same period were &euro;689.<table><tr><th>Income</th><th>Annual USC payable<br /><br />(employee)</th><th>Annual USC payable<br /><br />(self-employed)</th></tr><tr><td>Minimum wage - &euro;9.15 x 39 hours - &euro;18,556</td><td>&euro;316 per annum*</td><td>&euro;316 per annum*</td></tr><tr><td>Average Industrial Wage - CSO Q3 2015 Industry (Sectors B-E) - &euro;43,307 (&euro;833 per week)</td><td>&euro;1,675 per annum*</td><td>&euro;1,675 per annum*</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;100,000</td><td>&euro;5,542 per annum*</td><td>&euro;5,542 per annum*</td></tr></table></p><p>*It is important to highlight that the above figures are based on hypothetical gains from a complete abolition of the Universal Social Charge only as requested by the Deputy. As I have stated already in my reply, as in the previous two budgets, in which the benefits of USC and income tax cuts have been capped at &euro;70,000 in earnings, it is my intention- should I be given the opportunity to present further budgets- to claw back some of the benefits of USC abolition for the highest earners. I will be setting out the details of my party's position on this issue in due course.</p></reply>

Data is provided by all entities that hold loans secured on properties located in the Republic of Ireland including inter alia bank and non-bank entities. </p><p>The most recent series (Q3 2015 data) was published by the Central Bank on 11 December 2015 and can be accessed at .  A total stock of 120,806 PDH mortgage accounts were categorised as restructured at end Q3 2015, reflecting an increase of 1.9% when compared with the previous quarter. Split mortgages and arrears capitalisations accounted for 20% and 28.1% of the total PDH restructures respectively, and showed significant increases over the quarter. Reliance on interest only arrangements and reduced payment arrangements fell further during Q3, a common trend over recent quarters. 86.6% of PDH restructures were deemed to be meeting the terms of their arrangement at end Q3 2015, an improvement on the previous quarter.</p><p>During Q3, legal proceedings were issued to enforce the debt/security on a PDH mortgage in 1,687 cases. There were 798 cases where court proceedings concluded but arrears remained outstanding.

This should benefit the consumer in many instances. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank advises me that competitive conditions within the insurance market intensified in recent years and many firms' focus on maintaining market share provided impetus to lower premiums. Competition on premiums was subsidised by investment and other income.  Recent reversals in investment markets have generated investment losses that are a drag on profitability.  In the view of the Central Bank, the recent premium increases will serve to restore core underwriting profitability and to secure the financial position of the firms concerned for the longer term. </p>  <p>  The question of the cost of insurance is a complex one involving a number of Government Departments, State Bodies and private sector organisations. I have asked my officials to examine the factors whic contribute to increasing costs of insurance. This work will continue over the coming months and will involve engagement with a number of parties, both public and private. </p></reply>

The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual's basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement and cannot be imposed on suppliers or contractors. </p><p>It is different to the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis. This Government established the Low Pay Commission to annually assess the appropriate level of the National Minimum Wage. The national minimum hourly rate of pay increased to &euro;9.15 per hour on January 1<sup>st </sup>this year following Government acceptance of the Low Pay Commission recommendation of July 2015 to increase the rate from &euro;8.65 per hour. </p><p>Separately, wage rates and other conditions of employment are provided for in Employment Regulation Orders for the Contract Cleaning and Security sectors. These statutory Orders came into effect on October 1<sup>st</sup>2015 and provide for minimum rates in excess of the National Minimum Wage, with &euro;10.75 per hour payable to workers in the Security sector and &euro;9.75 per hour payable to workers in the Contract Cleaning sector. </p><p>Statutory minimum rates of pay may also be supplemented by social transfers such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement or health, education or housing assistance payments where the need arises and to reflect family circumstances.</p><p>My Department has not had any discussions with suppliers or service contractors in relation to the Living Wage.  However, I can confirm that my Department adheres to all appropriate current wage legislation.</p></reply>

I, as Minister for Finance, have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or in relation to the mortgage interest rates charged.    </p>  <p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.  This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding. </p>  <p>  The current interest rates in Ireland are also determined by nationally specific features such as increased credit risk resulting from high levels of non-performing loans and lengthy and uncertain processes of collateral recovery, weak competition, and the constraints on bank profitability arising from legacy issues of the financial crisis, such as an increased regulatory requirement for capital.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, I have taken steps to ensure that the banks provide options for mortgage holders to reduce their monthly repayments. Last May, I requested a report from the Central Bank on the topic which was subsequently published. I also met with the six main mortgage lenders in May and outlined my view that the standard variable rate being charged to Irish customers was too high. The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for SVR customers.  </p>  <p>  In September I concluded a series of follow up meetings with these banks and the reality is that the majority have put options in place to allow many borrowers reduce their repayments. These options range from lower variable rates to new suites of variable rates based on loan-to-value and reductions in fixed rates. I therefore encourage borrowers to contact their bank to see what is available to them in their circumstances or consider moving to another bank, where possible, if the offer is not satisfactory. In this regard, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) website www.consumerhelp.ie is a valuable source of information on the rates charged by various financial institutions. In addition, the CCPC are currently running a mortgage switching campaign and have a mortgage switching tool on their website which should allow borrowers compare rates charged across institutions.  I also note that some lenders offer repayment of legal fees or cash incentives to borrowers switching mortgage provider.</p>  <p>  I asked the banks to provide options by which borrowers could reduce their monthly repayments and I believe options have been put in place. Furthermore, I am pleased to see that new initiatives and reductions continue to take place. As recently as last week one bank introduced a 0.5% reduction on managed variable rates for new or switcher mortgages with a loan to value of 80% or less. Another bank reduced its SVR in December. These initiatives illustrate the increasing competitive dynamics in the market. </p>  <p>  I note that the Central Bank's statistical release of 11th December 2015 stated that mortgage interest rates generally declined during the third quarter of 2015.

Council that request funding by the Office of Public Works (OPW) at this time, other than the proposed Lower Morrell River Flood Relief Scheme, of which, the Deputy is aware. However, the OPW and KCC continue to work in close consultation on the development of the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) plans for areas of Kildare designated as Areas for Further Assessment or AFAs under the East CFRAM study. Those plans, due to be completed in mid 2016, will identify preferred options for flood alleviation measures as necessary.  The implementation of these measures will be considered in due course by the OPW and KCC.  The Government's Capital Investment Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021 includes total funding of &euro;430m over the period of the Plan for the cost of implementing the schemes and measures that will emerge from the CFRAM process.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, KCC, in consultation with the OPW, engaged Consulting Engineers to carry out a Full Feasibility Study, Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA),  and Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the Lower Morrell River and the surrounding River Catchment in an effort to resolve the outstanding localised flooding issues in the Straffan area. A Steering Group which comprises representatives of KCC, OPW and the consultants, was set up to advance the project.</p>  <p>  KCC and their consultants submitted a Draft Options Report /Feasibility Study to the OPW outlining possible flood relief measures for the Lower Morrell River Catchment in 2014.  Following consideration of the draft report by the OPW, it was agreed by the Steering Group that the consultants would carry out a more detailed review of the proposed scheme with further analysis of the various options considered to assess the benefits of the current works proposals as they have evolved.  The review would also investigate if there are additional or alternative and more cost effective measures that can be put in place to alleviate flooding in the area.  Any changes identified by the review process would need to be incorporated into the Cost Benefit Analysis and Environmental Impact Statement before the scheme can be advanced.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the consultants have completed the review process and KCC has submitted their findings to the OPW for consideration. The OPW and KCC  will meet later this month with a view to finalising the Feasibility Report.  Once the Feasibility Report has been finalised, and provided the scheme is still economically and environmentally viable, KCC and the OPW will decide on how best to advance the proposed works.  The OPW has included provision for the cost of the proposed works in its financial profiles in the period up to 2018.</p></reply>

Engineering consultants have been appointed by the Office of Public Works (OPW) to implement the Programme, through six regional studies. Local authorities and other stakeholders are involved, in partnership with the OPW, on Steering Groups and Progress Groups across the six study areas. </p>  <p>  The Programme is focusing on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs), including 90 coastal areas, identified as being at potentially significant risk from flooding. Two CFRAM studies, the Eastern and the South Eastern, cover the 15 AFAs within Co. Kildare namely Celbridge, Clane, Johnstown Bridge, Kilcock, Leixlip, Maynooth, Naas, Newbridge, Turnings/Killeenmore (Morrell Scheme), Allenwood, Athy, Castledermot, Monasterevin, Rathangan and Suncroft.</p>  <p>  The Programme involves the production of predictive flood hazard and risk mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans. The Plans will be used to determine national priorities for State investment in flood defences, on a systematic and objective basis taking into account social, environmental and economic factors.  </p>  <p>  Under the CFRAM Programme to date, draft flood maps have been produced and were the subject of a series of local Public Consultation Days which concluded in April, 2015.  The draft flood maps will now be finalised following the conclusion of the national statutory public consultation on 23 December, 2015. Work on the next phase, assessment of preliminary flood risk management options is underway. In this regard, a series of Public Consultation Days will be held over the coming months, including one in Athy, to allow the public to view the preliminary options available and provide feedback on them.  </p>  <p>  Following the finalisation of the flood mapping and the identification of appropriate and viable preliminary flood risk management options, the final output from this important project will be integrated Flood Risk Management Plans containing specific measures to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risks identified.

This was based on an analysis of &euro;2.742 billion expenditure across 64 large public service bodies involving over 35,000 suppliers.  Other Key Findings show that 74% of tender notices were of small value (i.e. below EU threshold), with the median contract values by spend categories ranging from &euro;500,000 (Utilities) to &euro;50,000 (Veterinary, Marketing, Print, Stationery, Defence).  Of the &euro;2.742 billion spend data analysed, just over 66% of the value (&euro;1.82 billion) was spent with suppliers whose business was classified as SMEs. The OGP is currently engaged in carrying out analysis for subsequence years.   </p>  <p>  The Government's national portal, eTenders, is the central facility for all public sector contracting authorities to advertise procurement opportunities and publish award notices.  The data collected by the eTenders system assists with the analysis of SME participation in public procurement. One of the objectives of the OGP has been to increase the number of SMEs registering on the system indicating their interest in competing for procurement opportunities. The OGP proactively campaign to get more businesses to register with eTenders, this resulted in 12,300 new supplier registrations in 2014 and a further 11,981 in 2015. </p>  <p>  The OGP also supports the work of Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland in building awareness of public procurement and supporting training for small suppliers in bidding for public contracts.  For example, last year the Office of Government Procurement supported two Meet the Buyer events, the first was held in Belfast in June and attracted 510 suppliers and a further event was held in Dublin in October attended by 693 suppliers. The Office of Government Procurement also supported the 'Go 2 Tender' programme run by InterTradeIreland which was attended by approximately 400 SME's.  </p>  <p>  In 2015 InterTradeIreland also delivered a programme on consortia building to assist SMEs to jointly bid for state contracts.  </p>  <p>  The OGP will continue to work with suppliers and business representatives on behalf of Government to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that public procurement policies are business friendly. </p></reply>

All the observations received from concerned parties have been answered. Detailed design of the scheme is underway which will be followed by a procurement process for a civil works contractor and the formal Confirmation of the Scheme under the Arterial Drainage Acts. Subject to successful completion of the tender and Confirmation processes, it is hoped that construction will start in early 2017.</p>  <p>  The position with regard to the Bandon Flood Relief Scheme is that the second stage of a tender competition for a civil works contractor is underway. Tender documentation has been issued to the short-listed candidates and tenders are due back this month, after which the assessment process will take place. In parallel, the OPW has submitted the Scheme documents to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (PER) for formal Confirmation, as required by the Arterial Drainage Acts. The Minister is required to undertake an independent review of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to ensure that all legislative requirements have been complied with before the Scheme can be approved. It is hoped that the EIS review process will be completed by the Minister for PER in early 2016, which should allow the appointment of a works contractor in mid-2016.</p>  <p>  The Skibbereen Flood Relief Scheme has been submitted to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for Confirmation and is also subject to an independent review of the EIS. Cork County Council is the Contracting Authority for the Skibbereen Scheme and the Council is progressing the process to procure a civil works contractor. Approval for the contractor appointment by the OPW as the sponsoring and funding agent must await the formal Confirmation of the Scheme by the Minister. It is hoped that this process will be completed in early 2016, which will allow construction of the Scheme to be commenced in mid-2016. </p>  <p>  It is expected that construction of the Clonakilty, Bandon and Skibbereen Schemes will each take approximately 24-30 months to complete.</p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the provision of flood relief schemes for the people of Bandon, Skibbereen and Clonakilty, funding for the schemes is available and the OPW has made provision for the cost of implementing these schemes in its financial profiles over the years 2015-2019.  The OPW is fully committed to progressing these flood defence projects as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

The current CFRAM Programme, which comprises a number of regional studies based on River Basin Districts, has assessed 300 areas identified as areas at significant risk and impact from flooding. The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the Local Authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans.  </p>  <p>  Public consultation is a key element of the CFRAM Programme.  A national public consultation process took place during 2011 as part of the Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment which resulted in confirmation of the locations to designated for further assessment under the regional CFRAM Studies.  A nationwide programme of local Public Consultation Days on the draft Flood Mapping was undertaken over the period October 2013 to April 2015.  The draft Flood Mapping will be finalised shortly following the conclusion of the national statutory consultation on 23 December 2015. A nationwide programme of local Public Consultation Days on the Preliminary Flood Risk Management Options development phase of the Study commenced in September 2015 and will conclude during the coming weeks in the Shannon CFRAM study area and in the remaining five regional CFRAM Study areas in Spring 2016.  The publication of draft Flood Risk Management Plans, scheduled for summer 2016, will be followed by further programmes of consultation before the Plans are finalised.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above, members of the public may contact the individual CFRAM Study consultants by phone, post or email.  Further details are available via www.cfram.ie.</p>  <p>  When the OPW undertakes a major flood relief scheme there are opportunities for the public to make observations on any emerging proposals. There are generally two non-statutory local public information days held for a scheme as it is being developed. After the outline design of the preferred scheme is completed, a statutory public exhibition is held. The scheme documents are placed on display in a local venue, as well as local authority offices, for a four week period. During this time there are attendance days advertised when members of the design team are available to meet the public to discuss matters pertaining to the scheme. Interested parties then have a further month to make submissions which have to be considered by the OPW and replied to before the Scheme is approved.</p>  <p>  The OPW does not have a statutory role in the planning process which is a matter for the local authority concerned and, where appropriate, An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p></reply>

Athlone is one of 66 locations in the Shannon River Basin District and 300 locations nationwide that are being assessed under the Programme the purpose of which is to implement the EU Floods Directive and national flood policy.  The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the Local Authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans.  Under the Shannon CFRAM Study, draft predictive flood maps for Athlone have been produced and were the subject of a Public Consultation Day in Athlone on 17 February 2015. The draft maps will be finalised in early 2016 following the conclusion of the national statutory public consultation process on 23 December, 2015. </p>  <p>  A Public Consultation Day was held in Athlone on 17 December 2015 to present and discuss preliminary options to manage the assessed flood risks for the area. An additional Public Consultation Day on the flood risk management options will be held in Athlone during the coming weeks; details of which are being arranged with the local authority and will be published on the Study website www.shannoncframstudy.ie and in the local press. </p>  <p>  Following the finalisation of the flood mapping and the identification of preliminary flood risk management options, the final output from this important project will be integrated Flood Risk Management Plans containing specific measures to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risks identified in the Shannon River Basin District. </p>  <p>  As I stated during my recent visit to Athlone, it is open to Westmeath County Council, pending the finalisation of the CFRAM Programme, to submit an application to the OPW for funding under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme for any interim flood mitigation measures that may be identified, pending the CFRAM Plans. Under the scheme, applications are considered for projects that are estimated to cost not more than &euro;500,000 in each instance. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects.  It is also open to Westmeath County Council to carry out flood mitigation works using its own resources.</p></reply>

Given the wide ranging nature of the issue and the complexities involved across the economy, my intention is to bring a Memorandum to Government to establish an Interdepartmental Working Group to facilitate the necessary detailed consideration of the issue.</p></reply>

I understand that PeopleTalk seeks to rebuild trust in public life and give citizens a say in public sector reform and I welcome any proposals that strengthen the voice of citizens, particularly at local level.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, rebuilding public trust in government and state institutions has been a major priority of the Government since we took office in 2011. In this context, we have demonstrated our commitment to improving how we encourage and facilitate the participation of citizens in decisions that affect their daily lives. </p>  <p>  We recognise that effective engagement with citizens, be that in the design and delivery of services or in the development of legislative proposals, for example, is hugely important for achieving improved outcomes.  A number of reforms have recently been implemented to better listen to citizens and businesses and to foster participatory decision making. </p>  <p>  Ireland became a full member of the Open Government Partnership (OGP) in July 2014 on publication of its first OGP National Action Plan (NAP).  Prior to this, an intensive process of consultation was undertaken in the development of the Plan. This culminated in a two day OGP Europe Regional Conference which was held in Dublin in May 2014, which brought officials and civil society together to discuss many topical issues and policies. A draft version of the OGP plan was published for public comment during the event. A number of open events have subsequently been held under the OGP banner to allow citizens, civil society, business and researchers to engage, give their views, inform and seek information.  </p>  <p>  The Constitutional Convention is an example of effective engagement with citizens in public policy. The convention ran from December 2012 to March 2014. Its membership comprised 66 randomly-selected citizens, 33 politicians from both Houses of the Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland Assembly and an independent chair. The Convention made 38 recommendations including holding a referendum on marriage equality which took place on 22 May, 2015. The referendum was passed by a decisive majority and was the first time that a proposal for constitutional change put forward by a Constitutional Convention has resulted in actual Constitutional change.  </p>  <p>  One of the actions in the OGP Plan was to review existing public consultation guidance nationally and internationally and develop new proposals. A draft principles-based set of guidelines have been approved by the Government and were put out for public consultation.  A total of 50 submissions have been received on foot of that consultation process and these raise a lot of important issues, which my Department is currently considering. I will arrange to add PeopleTalk to the list of those who contacted the Department in this regard, so that they can be updated as this process is advanced.  </p>  <p>  Separately, public consultations have taken place on a range of services and advisory groups are established where it is considered appropriate to assist in policy development.  Some examples in my own Department include consultations on Open Data Initiatives, Data Sharing, Accountability proposals and Corporate Governance arrangements for the Civil Service and just last month I launched a public consultation on Commissioning Human, Social and Community Services. </p>  <p>  More generally, we have implemented a significant programme of reforms aimed at making the Public Service more open, transparent and accountable. Examples include changes to how appointments are made to State Boards, reforming legislation in areas such as Freedom of Information, Protection of Whistleblowers, the scope and powers of Parliamentary Inquiries, the role of the Ombudsman, the regulation of Lobbying, and revision of the legislative framework for the management of conflicts of interest and standards of conduct of public officials.   </p>  <p>  Finally, it is worth noting that there was extensive consultation at all of the key stages in the development of the above legislative reforms and they were among the  Bills that have been subjected to the pre-legislative scrutiny process by Oireachtas Committees.  Under this process, Oireachtas Committees seek written submissions on the Heads of the Bill or on the general subject matter from individual experts, stakeholder groups or interested parties; consult with the general public; and hold public hearings inviting individuals or groups to make presentations to the Committee.</p></reply>

The amounts shown for this heading provide for the preparation and design of flood relief schemes, the construction of flood relief works, the payment of compensation costs arising from these works and the carrying out of minor coastal or non-coastal works by Local Authorities with funding provided by the OPW under the Minor Works Scheme.  It also provides for the carrying out of CFRAM studies.  The 2015 figures also include an amount in respect of specific funding approved by Government for Local Authorities for the repair of coastal protection infrastructure damaged in the storms of winter 2014.  The 2016 allocation includes a deferred surrender or capital carryover of &euro;7m from the 2015 allocation.</i></p><p>Expenditure on the flood relief programme in 2015 was less than budgeted for due primarily to delays in the planned commencement of construction of certain capital projects.  However, a significant element of the underspending in this or other years on the OPW's capital allocation is dealt with normally through the system of deferred surrender or capital carryover.  This ensures that the funding is not lost to the flood capital investment programme. </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that the OPW has had and will continue to have sufficient funding available to it to meet its requirements for flood relief in any year.  There is no issue in relation to underfunding of the flood relief programme. </p><p>The allocation of  &euro;52.561 million for capital flood relief measures in 2016 allows for the design, planning and construction of major flood relief schemes and the funding of minor works projects undertaken by local authorities.  Major schemes in Waterford, Ennis and the river Wad in Dublin will be completed and schemes at Claregalway, Bandon, Skibbereen, Foynes and Templemore are expected to commence construction works in 2016.  Another 21 schemes will continue to be advanced through design and planning stages.  </p></reply>

Following consideration of the draft report by the OPW, it was agreed by the Steering Group that the consultants would carry out a more detailed review of the proposed scheme with further analysis of the various options considered to assess the benefits of the current works proposals as they have evolved.  The review would also investigate if there are additional or alternative and more cost effective measures that can be put in place to alleviate flooding in the area.  Any changes identified by the review process would need to be incorporated into the Cost Benefit Analysis and Environmental Impact Statement before the scheme can be advanced.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the consultants have completed the review process and KCC has submitted their findings to the OPW for consideration. The OPW and KCC  will meet later this month with a view to finalising the Feasibility Report.  Once the Feasibility Report has been finalised, and provided the scheme is still economically and environmentally viable, KCC and the OPW will decide on how best to advance the proposed works.

I understand that equivalent policies are in place on a sectorial basis throughout the public service.  If the matter of concern raised by a public servant amounts to a defined wrongdoing (for example, something that could be regarded as an act or omission that is grossly negligent or constitutes gross mismanagement) it may also be covered by the Protected Disclosures Act, which provides a number of robust protections for workers who consider themselves to have been unfairly treated because they raised concerns about wrongdoings that came to their attention in the workplace.</p>  <p>  The Protected Disclosures Act applies to both the public and private sectors and covers a range of persons connected with the workplace (direct employees, contractors etc.). Under the Act, workers who are direct employees are provided with access to the existing industrial dispute resolution mechanisms of the state (Rights Commissioner, the Labour Court etc.) and compensation payable under those mechanisms is increased in respect of persons penalised for having made a protected disclosure. An employee dismissed for having made a protected disclosure can claim unfair dismissal and seek interim relief pending final determination of their case. The Act also provides immunity against civil and criminal liability relating to the disclosure and a duty of protection for the identity of the discloser.</p>  <p>  All public bodies are obliged under the Protected Disclosures Act to have procedures to deal with protected disclosures in place and made available to their workers. A number of public bodies have already prepared and published detailed written procedures and my Department has prepared guidance for public bodies on their implementation of the Act which is intended to be issued, in its final form following a recently completed public consultation, over the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual's basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement and cannot be imposed on suppliers or contractors.</p>  <p>  It is different to the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis. This Government established the Low Pay Commission to annually assess the appropriate level of the National Minimum Wage. The national minimum hourly rate of pay increased to &euro;9.15 per hour on January 1   this year following Government acceptance of the Low Pay Commission recommendation of  July 2015 to increase the rate from &euro;8.65 per hour.</p>  <p>  Separately, wage rates and other conditions of employment are provided for in Employment Regulation Orders for the Contract Cleaning and Security sectors. These statutory Orders came into effect on October 1 2015 and provide for minimum rates in excess of the National Minimum Wage, with &euro;10.75 per hour payable to workers in the Security sector and &euro;9.75 per hour payable to workers in the Contract Cleaning sector. </p>  <p>  Statutory minimum rates of pay may also be supplemented by social transfers such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement or health, education or housing assistance payments where the need arises and to reflect family circumstances.</p></reply>

These options were identified under the Eastern Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (ECFRAM) study.  The proposals for flood mitigation measures on the River Poddle also involve some downstream defence works.  The proposed works at the location referred to are likely to be progressed first and consist in the main of the creation of additional storage capacity to attenuate downstream flows in the river in flood conditions.</p>  <p>  The proposed works for the overall scheme cross two Council boundaries and South Dublin County Council (SDCC) working in collaboration with Dublin City Council (DCC) will take the proposals forward through planning and eventual construction.  Documents for the procurement of the design and environmental consultants for the Scheme are currently being finalised.  The consultants will also prepare a detailed Cost Benefit Analysis for the proposed works. </p>  <p>  Subject to the identification of an environmentally viable and cost beneficial scheme and successful completion of the planning process it is hoped to be in a position to commence construction of the main scheme works in 2017.  As indicated it would be the intention to commence works in the location mentioned in advance of the main scheme works.</p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works (OPW) has given a commitment, in principle, to funding a viable, cost beneficial and environmentally acceptable scheme for the Poddle and has made indicative provision for its cost in its Multi-Annual Capital Budget Profiles.  The construction of any proposed scheme is expected to take at least two years.</p>  <p>  The works proposed to alleviate flooding on the Poddle are to be designed to the standard level of protection often referred to as the 100-year flood, which is to prevent flooding during events with a 1% annual exceedance probability (AEP) for fluvial floods. The design will take account also of climate change. </p>  <p>  I am advised that Interim works carried out to date by SDCC involve new debris screens placed on culverts on the river which are monitored remotely by telemetry. Any alarms can be responded to quickly so that debris built up can be removed in good time.</p></reply>

It operates a range of business development activities and is traditionally co-funded by my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland on a 2:1 (South:North) basis.   My Department&rsquo;s contribution to the Body&rsquo;s total annual budget for the last five years has ranged from &euro;6.638m to &euro;8.164m. The variation in these figures is partly attributable to the fact that InterTrade Ireland&rsquo;s  main operating currency is sterling.  The fluctuating exchange rate, together with other related factors, has therefore necessitated adjustments which are reflected in the relevant yearly allocations. The contribution paid by the Northern Ireland authorities for 2015 was also reduced and their contribution for 2016 has not yet been settled.   </p>  <p>Other Development organisations which come within my remit, such as Enterprise Ireland and the border counties&rsquo; Local Enterprise Offices,   have, on occasion, engaged in North-South activities.

This translates into a net increase of 10,169 jobs for 2015 (taking account of job losses) in Enterprise Ireland supported businesses and brings total employment in these companies to 192,223 - a record high for the agency. Almost two thirds of the new jobs created were outside Dublin and all of the regions recorded increases in full-time employment over the period.  Enterprise Ireland attributes this strong, mainly export led, job creation by Irish businesses to an improving entrepreneurial climate for start-ups, dynamic Irish companies innovating and scaling up in key sectors such as food, financial technology and business process outsourcing and improving international economic conditions.  Employment data for Enterprise Ireland is collected annually as part of my Department&rsquo;s Annual Employment Survey which measures the number of jobs in Agency assisted client companies on the 31   October in a given year.  As a result, it is not possible to provide specific employment figures for the 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2015 as requested.  I will forward data when it is available. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-01-13a.868.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016011300082#WRV01500"><p>My understanding is that the Deputy is referring to the requirements of the Sustainable Dairy Assurance Scheme (SDAS) as implemented by Bord Bia.  This same scheme seeks to underpin Ireland&rsquo;s sustainability credentials in the area of dairy production and represents a key distinguishing factor for our export focussed dairy products.  Sustainability considerations are becoming an ever increasing factor in purchasing decisions among international buyers of dairy products.    </p>  <p>  The Bord Bia SDAS is a voluntary scheme and was developed in co-operation with milk producers, farm organisations, processors and regulatory authorities.  It has been designed to assist in securing new and existing markets for Irish dairy produce as farmers look to increase milk production in a post quota era.  It can therefore provide the necessary proof to customers of dairy products that milk has been produced under both Sustainability and Quality Assurance criteria.</p>  <p>  The scheme is open to all milk producers with a valid herd registration, supplying milk processors in the Republic of Ireland.  To apply for membership the producer will complete an application form which can be returned to Bord Bia via their milk purchaser or directly to Bord Bia. The application will then be evaluated and, as appropriate, a full independent audit of the milk producer may be carried out to evaluate the capability of the applicant to meet all the requirements of the Standard.  When the producer is deemed to have complied with the requirements of the Standard, the herd will be considered for certification under the Scheme.  When certified, the producer will be issued with a certificate for the herd which will be listed on the Bord Bia register/database. </p>  <p>  In 2015 Ireland exported over &euro;3.2 billion in dairy products to 130 different countries.  The SDAS, as part of an overall approach to demonstrating our sustainability credentials which includes the Origin Green programme at industry level, assists in the process of giving Irish dairy products a competitive advantage in third country markets. </p></reply>

Sections 11 and 12 of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, which I introduced, contain rules relating to the welfare of animals and outlawing cruelty.  These rules provide that a person having an animal in his or her possession or control must safeguard and not threaten the health and welfare of the animal.  In addition, a person cannot cause unnecessary suffering or endanger the health and welfare of any animal or neglect or be reckless regarding the health or welfare of any animal.  The Act also provides for increased levels of penalties.  For major cases taken on indictment, the maximum penalty has been raised from &euro;100,000 to &euro;250,000, with a maximum custodial sentence of five years imprisonment.  These penalties are in keeping with Irish jurisprudence and therefore I do not envisage further changes. </p></reply>

A subsequent field visit, to verify the position on the ground, identified discrepancies between the area declared and the area determined resulting in an over-declaration in area of greater than 50%.

The person named was notified of this decision on 27 April 2015. </p>  <p>  As payment had already issued in respect of 2014, based on the results of the initial Remote Sensing inspection, my Department was required to recoup the amount of the payment issued from payments due under the REPS and the Beef Data Schemes. </p>  <p>  The administrative fine to be applied in 2015 was calculated and the amount of &euro;3,950.10 was deducted from the total amount of &euro;9,036.04 due under the 2015 Direct Payments Scheme. </p>  <p>  The person named sought a review of the decision in respect of the 2014 inspection.  This review process included a re-inspection of the lands being claimed. The outcome of this review was to uphold the original decision.

My Department established a new Farm Partnership Register that contains those MPPs who wished to remain in a farm partnership, as well as new farm partnerships - including those in enterprises other than dairying.</p><p>The new Register came in to effect on April 1 2015 and currently has over 1,000 farm partnerships registered on it &ndash; c.550 of which are former MPPs.  While the vast majority of the new farm partnerships continue to be dairying, about 15% are of enterprises other than dairying such as beef and tillage.  One of the inducements to encourage the maintenance and development of farm partnerships is the granting of an enhanced 50% stock relief to members of registered farm partnerships.  I am satisfied that this process of registration is operating efficiently and effectively.</p><p>This Government has introduced a number of incentives for the creation of farm partnerships.  For example members of farm partnerships can avail of enhanced 50% stock relief under the tax code.  In addition my Department has introduced a Support for Collaborative Farming Grant Scheme under the new Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.<b></b>The grant is aimed at covering part of the legal, advisory and financial services costs incurred in the drawing up of the Farm Partnership Agreement, a prerequisite for any partnership adopting best practice.  The first tranche of payments issued in late December. </p><p>A major new initiative on &lsquo;Family Transfer Partnerships&rsquo; to assist succession in agriculture was announced in Budget 2016.  It is a structure in which family members enter into a partnership, and appropriate profit-sharing agreement, with the provision for the transfer of the family farm to the younger farmer at the end of a specified period (not exceeding ten years).  To support this transfer a tax credit of up to a maximum of &euro;5,000 per annum for five years can be allocated to the partnership, thereby incentivising the transfer and mitigating some of the financial issues involved.  The partnership model enables a gradual transfer of control and also facilitates knowledge transfer from one generation to another.  The commencement of the Scheme is subject to State Aid approval by the EU Commission and the Scheme&rsquo;s administrative procedures, including the application process, will not be finalised until that approval is received.  As the Finance Act 2015 (the legislation providing for the Scheme) has just been enacted, the formal application to the Commission for State Aid approval is expected to be submitted shortly.</p></reply>

Hunting also operates under codes laid down by the Hunting Association of Ireland. These guidelines must be observed at all times. </p>  <p> My Department&rsquo;s responsibilities in relation to hunting derive from the Animal Health &amp;amp; Welfare Act 2013. Section 12 of the Act provides that the activity is lawful unless the animal is hunted having been released in an injured, mutilated or exhausted condition. The Animal Health &amp;amp; Welfare Act 2013 contains robust measures relating to the ill-treatment of animals and these can apply where hunting is not conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Therefore I do not envisage any further legislation in this area.</p>  <p>  A small number of complaints about specific cases have been reported to my Department over the time period referred to by the Deputy, and where appropriate, these have been brought to the attention of An Garda Siochana.   </p></reply>

The National Inshore Fisheries Forum has invited the Department of Social Protection to its forthcoming meeting on 21 January to discuss social protection policies relevant to the inshore sector. It is important that the fishing industr y   take every precaution to avoid risk of injury or worse during this period and have full regard to local weather warnings before venturing to sea. </p>  <p>  The new Seafood Development Operational Programme under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund was adopted by the European Commission in December 2015. That Programme provides a comprehensive range of supports for the seafood sector, including a dedicated scheme of supports for the inshore sector to address the various economic and sustainability challenges facing the sector. In relation to specific measures to support inshore fishermen affected by significant losses arising from adverse weather events, the EMFF and the Operational Programme provide for the establishment by fishermen of a Mutual Fund for Adverse Climatic events and Environmental Incidents, which when established can provide aid to fishermen affiliated to the Fund in line with pre-defined rules. The Operational Programme will co-fund the Mutual Fund, together with subscriptions from member fishermen. In that sense, the viability of such a Mutual Fund is dependent on the extent to which fishermen commit to membership of that Fund.</p>  <p>  Following the December adoption of the Programme, I am now rolling out new schemes and will be launching the first schemes later this month, with others to follow during 2016.

GLAS Tranche 1 resulted in the approval of in excess of 26,000 applications. In addition in October 2015 I launched a second tranche of GLAS which closed for submission of applications in mid December. This second tranche has resulted in a further 14,000 applications to GLAS and my Department will be assessing these applications in line with the requirements set out in the scheme Terms and Conditions over the coming weeks to ascertain which applications can be approved for GLAS.</p>  <p>  This level of applications, which has exceeded expectations, underlines the success of GLAS in supporting Irish farmers&rsquo; commitment to further enhancing the environmental sustainability of their farm enterprises. </p>  <p>The level of applications to GLAS under both tranches in 2015 will result in the funding committed to the Scheme for 2016 be ing fully utilised. The full details of the funding required for GLAS in 2016 will be not fully finalised until the Tranche 2 approval process has been completed at the end of January.</p>  <p>  However the value of the average contract submitted under both Tranches is over &euro;4,000, not including GLAS Plus cases. Current indications are that some 1,400 applications from the first tranche will qualify for GLAS Plus, increasing their annual payment to around &euro;6,500 on average.</p></reply>

A number of inspections of this parcel of land were carried out in 2010 and 2011 resulting in a reduction of the determined area of this commonage. There was one inspection, which the claimants are seeking to rely on, which resulted in a large area of the commonage being deemed eligible for the above schemes, however, a number of subsequent inspections have resulted in a much reduced area being deemed the determined eligible area for the purposes of both Schemes. The circumstances in which the first inspection was carried out are currently the subject of litigation and, therefore, I am precluded from commenting any further on this particular inspection.</p>  <p>  The findings with regard to Keelderry have been the subject of a number of legal actions and appeals. The appeal referred to concerns the 2012 SPS, DAS and other area based schemes of one of the claimants. The Decision of the independent official was to partially allow the appeal. However, the findings of the Appeals Officer in relation to that specific case are not a finding on the inspection criteria or that the inspectors&rsquo; interpretation or methodology cannot be relied upon. </p>  <p>  The relevant extract from the Appeals Office decision from August 2015 states: &ldquo;Both sides provided evidence at the oral hearing as to the nature of the growth that exists on parcel G30106047, and while there are obviously roadways, active turbary and quarry areas, I must rely on the inspection reports provided by the Department and those reports provide no quantification or description on which to rely for the deductions made within parcels G30106047, G30106046 and G30106057.&rdquo; Most importantly the decision adds &ldquo;In any event the question at appeal is whether or not these parcels met the 2012 eligibility requirement for you [sic - use] of agricultural activity as defined.&rdquo; Therefore the areas of the parcels were not to be determined by the Appeals Office but rather whether the applicant carried out an agricultural activity.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding documentation submitted by the applicant as part of his 2015 Basic Payment Scheme application, the Department maintains its position, as the competent authority on this matter, on the eligible area of this commonage.   </p></reply>

Following two devastating collapses of the Celtic Sea Herring Fishery, the recovery plan identified the special area known as the &ldquo;Dunmore Box&rdquo; as an important area for herring reproduction. The Sentinel fishery was established in order to have a small fishery which would act as a sentinel or indicator of the state of the overall herring stock in the area. This sentinel fishery is in addition to the Main Celtic Sea Herring Fishery. Under current policy arrangements, the Sentinel is allocated 11% of the overall adjusted Celtic Sea Herring quota.</p><p>Following a request from the Celtic Sea Herring Management Advisory Committee in 2015, I approved extended opening arrangements for the sentinel fishery arising from the poor fishing during the bad weather.The Sentinel fishery remained open until midnight on 22 December.  It re-openedat 00.01 hours on Tuesday 29 December and was closed again at midnight on 31 December.  The fishery opened for 2016 on Sunday 03 January 2016 for a two to three week fishery, as requested by the Celtic Sea Herring Management Advisory Committee.  </p><p>In terms of quota, under national management arrangements, quotas are allocated within the year. Under long standing policy quotas may not be carried forward into the following year in respect of individual boats or groups of boats within a fishery e.g. the sentinel herring Celtic Sea fishery. This policy protects the public ownership of quotas and protects against property rights being established which would transfer ownership of quotas into private hands.  All uncaught quota is carried forward to the following year, in line with provisions of the EU Regulation. Uncaught quota may be carried forward from 2015 into 2016 up to a 25% limit of the 2015 quota. The total available quota for the year is made available to operators in line with the policy set down by the Minister for the management of the Celtic Sea Herring fishery.  </p><p>The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority has provided details on the out turn for these two fisheries for 2015 as follows:<table><tr><th></th><th>Quota</th><th>Landed</th><th>Uncaught</th></tr><tr><td>Sentinel Fishery:</td><td>2,212 t</td><td>990 t</td><td>1,222 t</td></tr><tr><td>Main Fishery:</td><td>16,895 t</td><td>14,795 t</td><td>2,100 t</td></tr></table></p><p>In view of the large amount of quota carried over from the Sentinel fishery in 2015, I have sought a recommendation from the Celtic Sea Herring Management Advisory Committeeon increasing the 11% of quota allocated to the Sentinel, to a higher amount for 2016, as an exceptional measure to take account of the poor fishing conditions in 2015. </p><p>Having considered a request from the National Inshore Fisheries Forum for a representative place on the Celtic Sea Herring Management Committee, I have written to the Chair of the Committee advising her that henceforth the National Inshore Fisheries Forum will be entitled to two representatives on the Committee. I hope that the representation of the NIFF on the Committee will further support the very good work of this Committee in providing advice on management arrangements for the Celtic Sea herring fishery.</p></reply>

To be eligible for a part-year payment, it was necessary to have an approved start-date of 1 October 2015 for the GLAS contract start, have GLAS actions which are payable in 2015, and to have passed the Department&rsquo;s payment validation checks. These first instalment payments represent up to 85% of the estimated value of the 2015 part-year payment.</p>  <p>  Some 17,500 applicants received their first instalment 2015 payment in December, with an average payment of &euro;650 per applicant. The Department is continuing to process applications which are eligible for a 2015 part-year payment and further payments will be processed by the end of January. The balancing payments in respect of 2015 part-year payments are scheduled to be processed in May 2016 when all GLAS 2015 inspections have been completed. This 2015 part-year balancing payment will include the GLAS+ payments for eligible applications.   </p>  <p>  It is important to note that these part-year payments are purely in respect of actions that were applicable to 2015 and cannot be used as a basis to extrapolate the average value of a GLAS contract over a full year. Farmers will only see the full value of their contracts when payments are calculated for 2016, the first full year of their five-year contracts. Current indications are that for Tranche 1 applications, the average value will be of the order of &euro;4,200, not including any GLAS Plus payments. Current indications are that some 1,400 applications from the first tranche will qualify for GLAS Plus, increasing their annual payment to around &euro;6,500 on average. </p></reply>

To date Ireland remains the only EU MS to have secured this access. There are now six plants approved to export but as with any new market it takes time to build reputational brand and a customer base and the real time to assess its value is when these are bedded down.</p>  <p>  In volume terms, beef exports to the USA had reached approximately 330 tonnes by early September. This would have an approximate value of &euro;2.1 million. It must be remembered that only two plants were eligible to export up to mid-May and June respectively. </p>  <p>  As of the start of November 2015, an estimated 1,300 tonnes valued at &euro;8.5 million had already been exported. By the end of December this figure had risen to an estimated 1,800 tonnes which would have an approximate value of &euro;11.5 million. This is an exceptionally strong start to this trade considering that the first exports only went in March 2015 and some of the plants were only approved for export as recently as September. Also trade   is confined to the market for intact cuts as we currently await approval to export beef intended for grinding. </p>  <p>  More importantly the relatively high prices available for beef in Europe in 2015 meant that US buyers may have been priced out of the market as Irish exporters chose to send product to more valuable markets in the UK and on the continent. By the end of October exports to the UK were up 7,200 tonnes compared with the same period in 2014 and this coincides with a reduced kill overall (back about 4% year on year) highlighting further the strength of Irish beef exports in the UK. In value terms this equates to &euro;137 million euro more of beef going to this market.  This of course is helped by a strong sterling and weak euro.</p>  <p>  There has also been significant progress in facilitating trade in other international markets for Irish beef. For example in 2015 the Canadian beef market opened for Ireland and other Member States and on a bilateral basis the market in Iran was re-opened, while Oman and the Maldives opened to Irish beef exports. I also concluded an extension to our market access to the Philippines, where up to the end of quarter three there had been &euro;11 million   of beef exports from Ireland, making us the second largest exporter of beef into the Philippines. Furthermore we are currently in the process of trying to secure beef access to other third countries including Korea, Vietnam and Mexico. It is my intention to continue to focus on developing as many third country markets as possible in order to provide exporters as many commercial opportunities as possible in a competitive global marketplace. </p></reply>

I established the Beef Roundtable in April 2014 in order to bring all relevant stakeholders together and to facilitate open discussion between industry, farming organisations and others on the strategic path forward for the beef sector. The Forum has met on seven occasions, and has been a useful vehicle for engagement for all those involved in the sector.</p>  <p>  At December&rsquo;s meeting I updated the attendees on the progress made on legislating for Producer Organisations in the Beef Sector. My Department is now in the final stages of drafting the SI, taking into account some of the views expressed at the round table. I am hopeful that I will be in a position to sign into law this legislation before the end of January. Along with the Statutory Instrument and application form, my Department will also publish guidelines for groups applying for recognition. </p>  <p>  The Forum also received presentations from Bord Bia on the market outlook for the sector and from Animal Health Ireland on its plans for initiatives in beef health. Teagasc also provided an update on the publication of its production blueprints for farmers since the previous meeting of the Roundtable. </p>  <p>  I also used the Roundtable to update on significant strategic issues, including developments in Paris COP21 on climate change, and developments in relation to international trade agreements such as Mercosur and TTIP. </p>  <p>  I have already made it clear that t  he forum is not a substitute for the market and that it does not obviate the need for continuing, frequent and open engagement between processors and suppliers on market issues. There were discussions on certain aspects of customer specifications for beef on which there continues to be some disagreement and I urged the parties to remain in contact to try and resolve these market issues. </p>  <p>  My role as Minister in relation to the beef sector is to create a policy and support environment that allows it to flourish in line with standard market principles. In this context, I am guided by the long-term sectoral development strategies set out in Food Wise 2025 and am confident that these initiatives, in conjunction with the Rural Development Programme, will lead to continued growth in terms of profitability and efficiency of the sector as whole. The forum has been a vital tool for facilitating constructive engagement between all of the relevant stakeholders in pursuit of these objectives.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-01-13a.1091.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016011300087#WRAA01100"><p>Live exports serve a vital purpose as a means of satisfying market demand for live animals and providing essential alternative market outlets for Irish cattle farmers. I have always attached major importance to the live cattle export trade, and my Department, along with Bord Bia, has been extremely proactive during my time as Minister in both encouraging and facilitating shipments abroad and the cross border live trade to Northern Ireland.</p><p>In 2015, Ireland exported live cattle to eighteen different countries and the total figure for live cattle exports stands at just over 178,500 head. Our most important markets in 2015 were the Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Spain, Italy, Britain and France. Full details of exports are set out below. The Dutch calf market in particular has seen sharp growth, with almost 44,000 calves sent there in 2015 as opposed to 39,000 head in 2014. IBR restrictions and geopolitical instability have impeded previously large-scale exports to Belgium and North Africa respectively. </p><p>Trade to Northern Ireland has improved sharply. The total figure for the year stands at 55,000 head. It should be noted that the weaker euro has been creating more favourable conditions for live exporters. Currency fluctuations are one of the major factors in determining the relative economic attractiveness of Irish exports to the United Kingdom. </p><p>Improved domestic demand and a tightening supply led, in 2015, to a situation where producers received the best prices on record at marts. This internal demand is also a significant factor in the overall drop in live exports in 2015 compared to 2014 and is indicative of the generally positive trends that were present in the beef sector in 2015.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland has in place a good system of transport links to facilitate live exports with the highest standards of animal welfare being at the forefront of procedures for approving transportation options.<b></b>There are currently three dedicated vessels, the MV Express 1, the MV Atlantic M and the MV Holstein Express approved for the carriage of livestock by sea from Irish ports. Two roll-on roll-off vessels are approved for transport to the UK, and one to the France. Three other vessels are currently at various stages of the necessary processes for approval for carriage of livestock abroad. </p><p>As of the week ending December 20, the following totals of cattle of all ages had been exported from Ireland;<table><tr><th>Northern Ireland </th><th>55,636 </th><th>Germany </th><th>291 </th></tr><tr><td>The Netherlands </td><td>43,789 </td><td>Slovenia </td><td>81</td></tr><tr><td>Spain </td><td>29,501 </td><td>Hungary </td><td>51 </td></tr><tr><td>Italy </td><td>24,930 </td><td>Portugal </td><td>40 </td></tr><tr><td>Britain </td><td>9,169 </td><td>Bulgaria </td><td>37 </td></tr><tr><td>France </td><td>8,552 </td><td>Kosovo </td><td>34 </td></tr><tr><td>Tunisia </td><td>3,923 </td><td>Albania </td><td>31 </td></tr><tr><td>Greece </td><td>735 </td><td>Libya</td><td>433</td></tr><tr><td>Belgium </td><td>606</td><td>Morocco</td><td>355</td></tr><tr><td>Romania</td><td>306</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Only the EU Commission may propose changes and any such proposal must be adopted under the co-decision process by the EU Parliament and EU Council. Member States, in consultation with the Commission, Member States affected and stakeholders are only permitted to introduce non-discriminatory measures for the conservation and management of fish stocks within the 12 mile zone subject to compliance with policy and procedures set down in CFP Regulation. </p>  <p>  The monitoring and control of fishing vessels within Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Fisheries Zone are matters for the Irish control authorities. Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, all operational issues of this nature concerning sea fisheries control are, as a matter of law, exclusively for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service. As Minister, I am precluded from getting involved in operational matters including in relation to law enforcement. </p>  <p>  In relation to the overall framework for fisheries control in the EU, in October 2009 a new regulation dealing with fisheries controls was adopted. Council Regulation 1224/2009 establishes a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy. Control and inspection is now focused where it is most effective through an approach based on systematic risk analysis. Inspection procedures are standardised and harmonised for all stages in the market chain, including transport and marketing.  The Control Regulations were introduced so that there is a common EU level playing field and to provide for an effective range of controls across EU waters.</p>  <p>  The SFPA and the Naval Service through the Fisheries Monitoring Centre have monitored the movements of these vessels when in our Exclusive Fisheries Zone, using the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), Automatic Identification System (AIS) and declared catches through Electronic Reporting System (ERS). I am advised that there are a number of freezer vessels currently in our EFZ.</p>  <p>  The SFPA is reliant on the seagoing fishery patrol activity of the Naval Service to verify compliance of vessels not landing into Ireland. The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority has advised that pelagic freezer trawler activity in the Irish Exclusive Fisheries Zone decreased significantly over the Christmas period with most of the vessels returning to port in the Netherlands in late December. It advises that several vessels have returned and despite problematic weather conditions the Irish Navy conducted two inspections within this group of vessels late in 2015, and one further inspection within a day of their return this month. It advises that additional inspections will be undertaken as appropriate and practicable.</p></reply>

This inspection resulted in findings of an over-declaration in area of greater than 50%.

This re-planting obligation will remain even if the land is sold. </p>  <p>  In relation to the interest expressed by a third party about possible acquisition of the land, land transactions are an operational matter for Coillte who has advised, in this regard, that they are willing to engage directly with the stakeholder involved to discuss their interest and assess the options. </p></reply>

Arising from farm visits by Teagasc and Department personnel, as well as requests to the animal welfare Helpline, emergency arrangements were put in place to provide feed under Department Emergency Feed Provision Arrangements for the worst affected farms. Almost 300 tons of concentrate feed has now been provided to over 100 farmers, avoiding welfare issues arising. </p>  <p>  In addition to these emergency provisions funding has been provided by the Government for a new Fodder Aid scheme for farmers who have suffered fodder losses as a result of this flooding. Support under this scheme will apply to the loss of silage, hay, straw and concentrates where there is evidence of damage caused by flooding during the months of December 2015 and January 2016. It is anticipated that assistance will be provided to up to 300 farmers and will be subject to the de minimis provisions of EU state aid rules. </p>  <p>  Application Forms for the scheme are available on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s website, the Department&rsquo;s local office network and from Teagasc offices. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that, to ensure swift payments under the scheme, the closing date for applications for this scheme is Friday 22 January 2016. </p>  <p>  A further measure is under consideration to cover a very small number of farmers who have experienced extreme hardship, including through the loss of livestock. Any such measure must comply with European Commission State Aid rules.   </p></reply>

It is planned that the new arrangements for non-EEA workers in the Irish fishing industry to which the Deputy is referring will be operational very shortly. The Department of Justice and Equality has advised that no applications have yet been made.</p>  <p>  The Task Force recognises the importance of employment in the fishing industry to Ireland&rsquo;s coastal communities. Therefore, in recommending that the number of Atypical Worker Permissions under the new Scheme, which applies to non officers, be capped at 500, the Task Force was cognisant that any mechanism designed to assist with the employment of non-EEA workers should not impact unduly on the employment of local populations in coastal communities. The Task Force based the cap on employment data from the Marine Survey Office and BIM and took account of the longstanding sea-fishing boat licence condition that at least 50% of the crew on Irish fishing vessels are EU nationals.</p>  <p>  The Task Force sought the views of representative groups, none of these groups sought an increase in the cap of 500 Atypical Worker Permissions in the submissions made.</p></reply>

In accordance with agreed arrangements, all of the available resources of the Defence Forces and Civil Defence, are made available, upon request, to support these principal response agencies.</p><p>During the recent period of severe weather from the 4 December to date, the Defence Forces have responded positively to all requests for support received from all three principal response agencies. Most requests are from the Local Authorities, given their central role in the flood response. The extent of support provided has been considerable with the Defence Forces being deployed to multiple locations in counties Donegal, Sligo, Mayo, Galway, Kerry, Clare, Kilkenny, Wexford, Westmeath, Limerick, Tipperary and Cork.</p><p>The main ways the Defence Forces have provided support include:</p><p>- assisting with the evacuation of people from flooded areas;</p><p>- assisting nurses and patients to get to hospital from flooded areas;</p><p>- maintaining flood defences, including the delivery;</p><p>- making and placing of sandbags;</p><p>- provision of pumps and maintaining pumping infrastructure including general oversight, clearing blockages in pipes and pipe intakes, and  general cleaning and housekeeping in vicinity of pumping operations;</p><p>- delivery of fodder for livestock; and assisting OPW with air reconnaissance of rivers and coastal areas.</p><p>The Defence Forces remain on standby at multiple locations to provide assistance as requests are received from the principal response agencies.</p><p>Civil Defence volunteers have been very involved in recent weeks assisting home owners and members of the public in almost every county. Civil Defence volunteers have engaged in a wide variety of tasks including sand bagging, pumping out houses, evacuating people from their homes, rescuing car drivers from flood waters, checking on vulnerable people, assisting nurses and home helps in getting through flood waters, bringing children to school, monitoring river levels and keeping people away from flood waters.</p><p>The Government approved the allocation of &euro;5m to be distributed as emergency humanitarian support to small businesses, which through no fault of their own have been unable to secure flood insurance and have been flooded recently. The scheme, which is being administered by the Irish Red Cross, has now been extended to cover the flooding caused by the continued adverse weather into early January 2016 and will now also cover community, sports and voluntary bodies that could not secure flood insurance for their premises.</p><p>The scheme is aimed at providing a contribution to the costs of returning premises to their pre-flood condition including the replacement of flooring, fixtures and fittings and damaged stock. It only applies to premises that have been flooded and it is intended as an emergency humanitarian assistance contribution rather than compensation for loss or a replacement for the cover provided by insurance.</p><p>Applications under the &euro;5,000 threshold are being paid following a quick verification process between the Irish Red Cross and the local authority responsible for the area in which the business was flooded. The Red Cross have appointed loss assessors to undertake damage assessments for applicants that have sought assistance above the &euro;5,000 threshold.<b></b>To date, the Red Cross have made more than 100 payments under the scheme totalling around &euro;500,000. The Red Cross are continuing to receive and process applications on a daily basis. The Red Cross are due to commence the assessments for applications for amounts between &euro;5,000 and &euro;20,000 this week. </p></reply>

The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare. The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is, therefore, not a statutory entitlement and cannot be imposed on suppliers or contractors.</p>  <p>  However, compliance with employment law obligations, such as the National Minimum Wage, in respect of contracts for the provision of goods or services awarded by my Department and the Defence Forces is set down in standard tender documentation. It provides that successful tenderers shall be solely responsible in law for the employment, remuneration, taxes, immigration and work permits of all personnel retained under any such contract.</p>  <p>  Minimum rates of pay may also be supplemented by social transfers such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement or health, education or housing assistance payments where the need arises and to reflect family circumstances. These have served to provide an important safety net for families that by virtue of their circumstances require such financial support. </p></reply>

It provides that the overall establishment of the Army Reserve (AR) and the Naval Service Reserve (NSR) be set at 4,169 personnel, consisting of 3,869 Army Reservists and the expansion of the establishment of the four Naval Service Reserve Units from 200 to 300 personnel.</p><p>The current total strength for the Reserve Defence Force (as of 30 November, 2015, the latest date for which figures are available) was 2,323. Subhead A5 provides for a budget of &euro;2.15 million in 2016, of which &euro;2.068 million encompasses Paid Training. The budget is sufficient having regard to the existing strength of the AR and NSR. A key challenge is to attract, recruit and train sufficient personnel to meet the establishment provided in the White Paper . Budget is not a constraint on achieving this establishment.</p><p>Indicative costs of meeting the Paid Training requirements for the numbers outlined in the questions are outlined in the table following:<table><tr><th>Increase </th><th>Additional Cost (approx) </th></tr><tr><td>Army Reserve from 2,188 to 3,000 </td><td>&euro; 0. 847 m </td></tr><tr><td>Naval Service Reserve from 141 to 1,000. </td><td>&euro; 0. 896 m  </td></tr></table></p><p>It should be noted that numbers beyond the establishment would require a reappraisal of organisational structures, levels and of the costs of PDF support required. There are no plans to increase the establishment strengths of the Reserve Defence Force beyond the targets set out in the White Paper on Defence.</p></reply>

As regards remaining ground rents, Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 contains a statutory scheme whereby the holder of a leasehold interest may, at reasonable cost, acquire the freehold in his or her dwelling. To date, over 80,000 applicants have acquired freehold title to their property under this scheme. Comprehensive details of the manner in which the fee simple can be acquired under this scheme are available on the Property Registration Authority's website (www.prai.ie).<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>In the case of remaining ground rents, I should also add that a ground landlord is statute barred from claiming more than 6 years arrears of ground rent<b><font color="#000080">.</font></b></p><p>With regard to the abolition of ground rents, the position is that this matter was considered by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in their Report entitled 'Private Property'. The Committee took the view that a ground landlord's ground rent is a form of property right which is constitutionally protected and that abolition of such rents would be unconstitutional in the absence of adequate monetary compensation. The Committee also noted that where leases were approaching expiry, any legislation providing for the abolition of ground rents would have to provide for the payment of enhanced compensation by the ground tenant. In light of the foregoing, I have no immediate plans to introduce further legislation in this area but operation of the existing law is, however, kept under review by my Department.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

Such transfers may be facilitated where the other country has ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.  Transfer requests under the Convention are normally made by a prisoner through the governor of the prison in which he or she is detained.  I decide on all such requests following the collation of a number of reports from various agencies setting out the consequences of such a transfer. </p><p>On receipt of a completed application from a prisoner,  an assessment is initiated immediately by my officials in the Irish Prison Service. The collation of the documents, as required under the provisions of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act between the sentencing state and the receiving state can be a very lengthy and complex process.  Therefore it is not possible to determine how long any such assessment will take to be completed. </p><p>I can advise the Deputy that as at 1 January 2016, there were 52 active transfer applications which are at various stages of the assessment process. </p><p>Two prisoners were transferred into this jurisdiction in 2015. The sentencing states in these cases  were Estonia and Spain.  </p><p>The Deputy should be aware, that the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons does not confer an automatic right for any prisoner to be transferred nor does it confer an obligation on any State to comply with a transfer request. In addition the consent of the three parties in the process is required prior to any transfer, i.e. the sentencing state, the receiving state and the sentenced person.  <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p><p>Legislation to amend the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts is being proposed. Until now persons serving sentences here or in another country could not be transferred to another state without their express consent. The new legislation will allow the State to transfer prisoners serving sentences imposed by Irish courts, in order to repatriate them to their state of nationality, without their consent. It will also allow persons who are Irish citizens to have a sentence imposed on them here if a prison sentence was imposed by a court in another EU state. The provision will only apply in regard to serious offences which carry a jail term of more than 3 years and will not apply to sentences imposed before December 2011. </p></reply>

However, as the Deputy will also be aware, the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, which was signed into law on 30th December 2015,  makes extensive provision in Part 10 for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged by legal practitioners, along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients. </p>  <p>  Legal practitioners, whether solicitors or barristers, will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients. This will be in the form of a Notice, written in clear language, which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions. Among other things, the Notice must disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not known, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated. A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client. When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs, the Act provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question. In addition, the Act sets out that it will not be permissible for legal practitioners to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business and that it will no longer be permissible for barristers to charge junior counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees.</p>  <p>  An aggrieved client will also have the option of applying for the adjudication of disputed legal costs by the reformed and modernised Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators, which is currently known as the Taxing-Masters' Office.  The Act sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles. These are contained in Schedule One and enumerate the various matters that shall be taken into account in the adjudication of disputed legal costs. The Act also provides for the establishment of a publicly accessible Register of Determinations which will disclose the outcomes and reasons for decisions made by the Legal Costs Adjudicators. </p>  <p>  The Act, as part of a new independent public complaints regime to be run by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, will also introduce a system for processing complaints about excessive costs, which will be the subject  firstly of informal resolution attempts, but will then escalate to formal resolution where alternative dispute resolution means do not succeed. This will be the first time that complaints about all legal practitioners will be dealt with by an independent statutory public authority.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Act sets out a clear path to new Legal Partnerships business models involving barrister/barrister partnerships and barrister/solicitor partnerships, which will allow for such partnerships to open for business in competition with the more traditional lawyer structures. The new Legal Services Regulatory Authority will be tasked with carrying out public consultations and reporting to me as Minister with further legislative recommendations over its first four years in areas such as removing existing client money and direct access restrictions relating to barristers; examining entry and training requirements for the legal profession; unification of the two legal professions and the opening of the market to multi-disciplinary practices.</p>  <p>  Overall, the Act seeks to achieve greater flexibility in the legal-services market, more competition and improved access to justice and will pave the way for the introduction of new business structures for legal practitioners. These combined measures will enable those availing of legal services, be they private consumers or enterprise, to identify costs more clearly, including in competition with other possible legal service providers. I might add also that both the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the Consumers Association will have statutory nominees on the new 11 member Legal Services Regulatory Authority.</p>  <p>  The legal costs provisions of the Act are expected to be commenced in the coming weeks, with the complaints-handling and business models provisions following in the coming months when the Authority is fully established.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the vetting process demands rigorous procedures to safeguard its integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service. </p><p>Full vetting checks are conducted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.  This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Garda Vetting Disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions. </p><p>Furthermore, under the Data Protection Acts, any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date.  The general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also protects against the risk of fraud or forgery . Such procedures are in line with best practice internationally.</p><p>There are, however, certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.  For example, persons involved in voluntary work may be doing work with more than one voluntary organisation at the same time, and may agree with the vetting applicant to share a single vetting disclosure.  Similar arrangements arise in the health sector in regard to persons working as locums, agency nurses or other temporary employees in a number of different organisations, or in the education sector where substitute teachers are on panels for substitute teaching in more than one school. </p><p>The current average processing time for vetting applications is four weeks. However, in some individual cases additional enquiries may be necessary and this may result in processing times in excess of the average.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, taking into account  the need to protect children and vulnerable adults while providing an effective and efficient service, I do not think that this time period is unreasonable.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of a certificate of naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the system.  </p><p>It is open to any individual to lodge an application for a certificate of naturalisation if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act.  Detailed information on Irish citizenship and naturalisation is available on the INIS website at www.inis.gov.ie.  The website contains the current version of the application by a person of full age for naturalisation as an Irish citizen and an on-line naturalisation residency calculator which individuals may find of assistance in establishing if the residency requirements are met.  All questions on the application form are required to be completed by the applicant.  It is open to applicants to provide additional information or clarification in relation to any of their responses should they wish.  The question on the application form referred to by the Deputy is aimed at establishing whether the actual period of residence satisfies the requirements under the Act.  A reasonable and generous period of 6 weeks is allowed to provide for absences for normal holidays and other short absences such as for a family bereavement.</p><p>Where an applicant is found to be non-resident for substantial periods of time then those periods will not be reckonable for the purposes of satisfying the residency conditions for naturalisation stipulated in the Act.  This is of particular importance with regard to the requirement to have 1 year&rsquo;s continuous residence in the State immediately prior to the date of application, and may also mean the requirement of total residence is not met.  The guidance notes attached to the application form inform applicants that arrangements for assessment of residence are on the basis that the person is physically resident for the required period of time and that where there are significant absences from the State the application may be refused<b>. </b></p><p><b></b>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

In particular, the reforms include the insertion of new sections - sections 18A to 18D - in the 1964 Act. These provisions allow the court to intervene where a parent or guardian does not comply with a custody or access order. The court may order additional access time in order to help address adverse consequences of previous failure to allow access; reimbursement of expenses incurred in an attempt to exercise access; or it may require the applicant, the respondent, or both to attend a parenting programme, family counselling, or a mediation information session. Where a parent or guardian without reasonable notice fails to exercise his or her court-ordered access or custody, the court may also order that the expenses of the other parent be reimbursed. </p>  <p>  It is my hope and expectation that these new provisions will give the courts new options to help parents whose relationships have broken down to focus on their joint parenting responsibilities and on the best interests of their children, and to make and adhere to custody and access arrangements.</p></reply>

The review concluded that a revised district and station network commensurate with the organisation resource base would best meet public demand.

In relation to emerging crime trends, Operation Thor, which was launched by the Garda Commissioner last year, is a multi-stranded national operation which builds on previous and current Garda operations to tackle crime, particularly burglaries the number of which, as we know, increase with the advent of the long winter nights, in both urban and rural communities nationwide. Operation Thor is made possible by the increased investment in policing by this Government, including an allocation of &euro;5 million to specifically support this new Operation. It entails a broad range of activities to tackle burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime. These activities include: additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed Regional Response Units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce re-offending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign; and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities and enhanced supports for victims. I am confident that this comprehensive operation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, supported by Government investment in Garda resources and personnel, will disrupt the activities of burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders and will improve the safety of all our communities across the country.</p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review taking into account crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources. I  have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the number of stations and the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to Tallaght Garda station on the 30 November 2015, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 176.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to provide effective and visible policing throughout the country. A crucial element of the Government's strategy is ensuring ongoing seamless recruitment to renew An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. With this in mind Budget 2016 made provision for the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; this year bringing to 1,150 the number of new Garda&iacute; who will have been recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014. So far 295 of these new recruits have been fully attested and are undertaking Garda duties in communities nationwide.  I am assured by Garda management that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; and in this context I have been informed by the Commissioner that of these newly attested Probationer Garda&iacute;, 19 have been assigned to  the DMR South, with 5 stationed in Tallaght.</p>  <p>  I am very pleased that the 2016 recruitment campaign announced last November and which closed on 6 January has attracted strong interest with in the region of 16,500 applications received by the Public Appointments Service which is organising the competition on behalf of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I share the Deputy's concern over the incidents of crime in both rural and urban areas. In relation to emerging crime trends, Operation Thor, which was launched by the Garda Commissioner last year, is a multi-stranded national operation which builds on previous and current Garda operations to tackle crime, particularly burglaries the number of which, as we know, increase with the advent of the long winter nights, in both urban and rural communities nationwide. Operation Thor is made possible by the increased investment in policing by this Government, including an allocation of &euro;5 million to specifically support this new Operation. It entails a broad range of activities to tackle burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime. These activities include: additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed Regional Response Units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce re-offending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign; and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities and enhanced supports for victims. I am confident that this comprehensive operation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, supported by Government investment in Garda resources and personnel, will disrupt the activities of burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders and will improve the safety of all our communities across the country.    </p>  <p>  I am especially conscious of the distress that burglary-related crime can cause to householders as well as the broader impact that the fear of crime can have in our communities, both urban and rural.  In response to these issues, Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill 2015 has now been enacted and will be commenced in the very near future. This Act  seeks to ensure that prolific burglars can be refused bail in appropriate cases.  The key objective of this legislation is to target a cohort of persistent offenders who prey on law-abiding householders and clearly have no concern for the damage and distress that they inflict on other people. The Act is designed to keep these repeat burglars off the streets and to improve the safety of our communities.</p></reply>

The Family Resource Centre Programme is a national programme with its own dedicated budget. Tusla provides core funding to Family Resource Centres to cover the employment of two to three members of staff and some overhead costs. In 2015, Tusla provided &euro;13.09m in funding for the Family Resource Centre Programme.</p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres (FRCs) are front-line services rooted in the communities they serve.   Acting as a focal point within their communities, Family Resource Centres provide a holistic service of child, family and community support and advocacy to all children and families in their communities. While Family Resource Centres operate an open-door policy and provide many services and development opportunities at a universal level, they also proactively target specific cohorts within their communities. </p>  <p>  Tusla fully appreciates the role that Family Resource Centres play in offering early intervention support to families in difficulty. The Agency also recognises the benefits that additional staffing resources can bring to a Family Resource Centre and this is an item under review as Tusla&rsquo;s budget allocations for 2016 are currently under consideration. </p>  <p>  The concerns of some service providers in regard to Tusla&rsquo;s plan to introduce commissioning, and the requirements of the new European Union Directive on Public Procurement (2014/24/EU) have recently been highlighted to me.  Tusla has advised that it does not envisage that the new European Union Directive on Public Procurement (2014/24/EU) will have any impact on the operational funding available to the National Family Resource Centre Programme. </p>  <p>  With regard to commissioning for Family Resource Services, the aim of Tusla&rsquo;s Commissioning Strategy is to target services not currently available in Family Resource Centre areas and to procure these services by way of a separate budget established for this purpose.</p>  <p>  Tusla is currently developing plans for the introduction of its commissioning approach.  It will engage closely with stakeholders in this regard and will provide the necessary guidance and advice.  </p>  <p>  Tusla is committed to a partnership approach whereby it will engage with other statutory partners and respect the unique role of community and voluntary organisations, including small scale providers to ensure that there is full engagement with all stakeholders at each stage of the process.. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I announced a significant increase in the funding allocation to Tusla for this year. Tusla has available to it some &euro;676 million in funding, representing an increase of &euro;38 million over 2015.  This increase in funding will allow Tusla to address critical shortcomings such as the number of children and families awaiting services.</p>  <p>  The precise level of funding to be provided to Family Support Centres for this year has been considered by Tusla in developing its Business Plan for 2016, which has been submitted to me for consideration.</p>  <p>  The Government, since its establishment, has attached particular priority to supporting vulnerable children and families and the significant increase in funding being made available to Tusla this year represents further evidence of our delivery on this ambition.</p></reply>

The Agency&rsquo;s key priority is to ensure that the needs of victims are met in the best way possible. Accordingly, in 2015, a dedicated national budget of &euro;19.5m was directed towards protecting front-line services for survivors.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I announced a significant increase in the overall funding allocation to Tusla for 2016.  Tusla has available to it some &euro;676 million in funding, representing an increase of &euro;38 million over 2015. The 2016 allocation includes specific funding of &euro;200,000 requested by Tusla to support the implementation of obligations under the Istanbul Convention on violence against women and domestic violence. Tusla has also identified the need for further funding in subsequent years to develop services in line with the provisions of the Convention. This will be the subject of consideration in the context of overall funding to be provided to Tusla in 2017 and beyond.</p>  <p>  Additional provision of outreach services and an increase in the number of emergency refuge spaces in the greater Dublin area are amongst specific developments planned for 2016 in order to enhance access to services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender based violence.</p>  <p>  Tusla has also established a nationally managed structure, with a single line of accountability and a dedicated national team to support provision of accessible and high quality services.  Planning for domestic violence and sexual violence services will seek to address gaps, avoid duplication and support effective delivery of frontline services nationally. </p>  <p>  The increase in funding for 2016 significantly strengthens Tusla's base funding level and gives the Agency greater capacity to respond to current risk and anticipated demand in 2016.</p>  <p>  The precise level of funding to be provided to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services this year has been considered by Tusla in developing its Business Plan for 2016, which has been submitted to me for consideration.</p></reply>

The Framework centralises and coordinates key policy commitments for children and young people across Government, and commits to measuring progress against the national outcomes. It also establishes a robust implementation infrastructure. The ISPCC is included in this infrastructure<i></i>through an Advisory Council that brings together key members of the community and voluntary sector, as well as independent experts with experience in children and youth affairs.</p><p>The primary responsibility for policy in relation to the treatment and support for young people with mental health and addiction issues lies with the Department of Health. The Health Service Executive is responsible for the provision of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, works closely with a range of care providers in respect of access to mental health, primary care, disability and other services. The Office for Internet Safety is an Executive Office of the Department of Justice and Equality with lead responsibility for internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children. The Department of Education and Skills also has an important role to play in educating young people in the responsible use of the Internet. The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government has primary policy and operational responsibility for homelessness affecting families, while the Direct Provision System is within the policy and operational remit of the Department of Justice and Equality.</p><p>Tusla is funded by my Department and has a significant role in the areas of child protection, early intervention, family support and educational welfare. Central to its role is that of strengthening inter-agency cooperation to ensure the seamless provision of such services. Tusla commenced a new Emergency Out-of-Hours Social Work Service in November 2015 in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Tusla also provides funding to voluntary organisations offering a range of counselling and support services to children and families including child counselling, made available to those who could not otherwise afford it. </p><p>The Children First Act 2015 was signed into law by the President on 19 November 2015. The Act aims to ensure that the best interests of the child are paramount in the performance by Tusla of its statutory functions. The Act also provides that organisations providing services to children will have to consider the potential for risk to children availing of their services and produce child safeguarding statements which will be available to parents and the public generally. The Act will operate side-by-side with the <i>Children First </i>National Guidance<i>,</i>which will continue as the basis for all citizens to report concerns. </p><p>Much of the above is aimed at ensuring appropriate responses to a complex range of issues which, if allowed to remain unchecked, can have detrimental impacts on a child or young person. </p></reply>

A standard capitation fee of &euro;62.50 per week per eligible child is paid to participating childcare services, with a higher capitation fee of &euro;73 per week paid to services with more highly qualified staff.</p>  <p>  From September 2016, I am expanding the ECCE programme to allow children to access free pre-school from the time they are 3 years of age until they start primary school.  There will be three intakes of eligible children during the pre-school year: children who reach the age of 3 between April and August can access the programme from September; children who reach the age of 3 between September and December can access the programme from January; and children who reach the age of 3 between January and March can access the programme from April. </p>  <p>  In the region of &euro;172 million is provided annually to support the ECCE programme and the cost of the extended provision is estimated to be an additional &euro;47 million in 2016.

From that date the standard capitation rate of &euro;64.50 and higher capitation rate of &euro;75 per week will apply.</p></reply>

This means, for example, that children born between 2 February 2011 and 30 June 2012 qualified for free pre-school from September 2015. Children who turn 3 from 1 July  2012 are below the age range for eligibility for ECCE in the 2015/2016 programme year but will qualify for the 2016/17 programme year. </p>  <p>  The recent Budget decisions, which introduced an extended provision under the ECCE programme that allows children to access the free pre-school programme from the time they are 3 years of age until they start primary school, come into effect from September 2016. This extended provision, when fully rolled out, will mean that children will have access to free education - either in pre-school or primary school - from the age of three.  The start up date for the introduction of this new measure was decided so as to allow pre-school providers an adequate timeframe to make any necessary infrastructural or service changes and to put in place extra staff resources to accommodate the additional numbers benefiting from the programme, which is estimated to increase from 67,000 to 127,000 in a given programme year.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that, depending on their date of birth, some children enrolling in the ECCE programme in September 2016 will not benefit from this extended free pre-school provision. I am also aware that, when the programme is fully in place (i.e. from 2017), there will be some children will benefit for a shorter extra period of free pre-school than others. Again, this will depend on the child's date of birth and the age at which they make the transition to primary school. Ultimately however, when this extended programme is fully in place, all children will be better off than in the present programme. Indeed, the net effect of the improvements for children overall will be an increase of an average of 23 weeks over the current programme.

The Family Resource Centre Programme is a national programme with its own dedicated budget. Tusla provides core funding to Family Resource Centres to cover the employment of two to three members of staff and some overhead costs. In 2015, Tusla provided &euro;13.09m in funding for the Family Resource Centre Programme.</p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres (FRCs) are front-line services rooted in the communities they serve.   Acting as a focal point within their communities, Family Resource Centres provide a holistic service of child, family and community support and advocacy to all children and families in their communities. While Family Resource Centres operate an open-door policy and provide many services and development opportunities at a universal level, they also proactively target specific cohorts within their communities.  Tusla fully appreciates the role that Family Resource Centres play in offering early intervention support to families in difficulty.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I announced a significant increase in the funding allocation to Tusla for this year. Tusla has available to it some &euro;676 million in funding, representing an increase of &euro;38 million over 2015.  This increase in funding will allow Tusla to address critical shortcomings such as the number of children and families awaiting services.</p>  <p>  The precise level of funding to be provided to Family Support Centres for this year has been considered by Tusla in developing its Business Plan for 2016, which has been submitted to me for consideration.</p>  <p>  The Government, since its establishment, has attached particular priority to supporting vulnerable children and families and the significant increase in funding being made available to Tusla this year represents further evidence of our delivery on this ambition.</p></reply>

The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  </p>  <p>  The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement and cannot be imposed on suppliers or contractors by either my Department or its agencies.</p>  <p>  It is different to the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis. This Government established the Low Pay Commission to annually assess the appropriate level of the National Minimum Wage. The national minimum hourly rate of pay increased to &euro;9.15 per hour on 1 January this year following Government acceptance of the Low Pay Commission recommendation of July 2015 to increase the rate from &euro;8.65 per hour. </p>  <p>Separately, wage rates and other conditions of employment are provided for in Employment Regulation Orders for the Contract Cleaning and Security sectors. These statutory Orders came into effect on 1 October 2015 and provide for minimum rates in excess of the National Minimum Wage, with &euro;10.75 per hour payable to workers in the Security sector and &euro;9.75 per hour payable to workers in the Contract Cleaning sector. </p>  <p>  Statutory minimum rates of pay may also be supplemented by social transfers such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement or health, education or housing assistance payments where the need arises and to reflect family circumstances.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable. It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need. Patients with the greatest level of need are provided with treatment by the HSE. In the HSE South region, which includes Co Kerry, over 70% of patients are assessed within 6 months and over 99% of patients are assessed within 12 months. </p>  <p>  A pilot scheme in the Dublin North East area (DNE), which involves up-skilling staff to work as orthodontic therapists is currently underway.  One member of the dental hygienist staff and one member of the dental nursing staff completed a one-year training course in September 2015. They are now working in the HSE under the supervision of specialist orthodontists. The scheme is currently undergoing an evaluation, which includes consideration of how the scheme is affecting waiting lists. Figures are currently being collated and early indications are positive. It is planned to extend the scheme nationally after the evaluation has been completed. </p>  <p>  In addition, a national procurement process is currently underway to provide treatment for certain categories of misalignment by a panel of independent practitioners under contract to the HSE over the next three years, with consideration of an extension to four years. This initiative will especially focus on those waiting for four years or longer. Tenders have been evaluated and will be awarded in the coming weeks. It is expected that these initiatives will have a positive impact on waiting times. </p></reply>

The title of physiotherapist will, as a consequence, be protected for the exclusive use of the board's registrants when the register's 2 year transitional period ends in 2018.  </p>  <p>  I am currently examining the issue of also protecting the title of physical therapist under the Act.   In the rest of the English speaking world the titles of physical therapist and physiotherapist are interchangeable and their users are qualified physiotherapists.  In Ireland, however, the title is used by a number of practitioners who are not physiotherapists but who are competing with physiotherapists in the private sector in the provision of musculoskeletal therapies.   </p>  <p>  Having consulted with the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, I wrote to a number of relevant organisations regarding my proposal to protect the title of physical therapist as a variant of the title of physiotherapist and invited them to submit their views.

Both schemes remain closed.</p><p>On foot of a Government decision, monthly payments have continued to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time that the scheme closed, on the basis that this would prevent hardship and, on an interim basis, alleviate stress, anxiety and uncertainty among a vulnerable group in society.</p><p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Department is seeking a solution which would best meet the aim of supporting people with severe disabilities who require additional income to contribute towards the cost of their mobility needs, while remaining within the available budget and satisfying all legal and equality concerns. </p><p>Work is ongoing on the policy proposals to be brought to Government for the drafting of primary legislation for a new scheme.  The proposals seek to ensure that:</p><p>-  There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;</p><p>-  There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;</p><p>-  Resources are targeted at those with the greatest needs; and</p><p>-  The Scheme is capable of being costed and it is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

While INR blood tests are not mentioned specifically in the GMS contract, such tests are carried out free of charge by some general practitioners as a matter of course  in their practices and I welcome this.  This provides  patients with an option of receiving this service locally in a primary care setting rather than attending an acute hospital.  Warfarin testing is available free of charge in hospitals. </p>  <p>  Consultation fees charged by GPs outside the terms of the GMS contract are a matter of private contract between the clinicians and the patients. While I have no role in relation to such fees, I would expect clinicians to have regard to the overall economic situation in setting their fees.  The HSE is not in a position to refund the costs of such charges to patients.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE are cognisant of the need for a new contract with GPs that will help modernise our health service and develop a strengthened primary care sector and negotiations are underway with the IMO in this regard.  The development of appropriate contractual arrangements in relation to the management of chronic conditions is amongst the significant issues to be considered during the contractual talks.</p></reply>

This includes the appointment of persons to posts in psychology services.</p><p>A HSE Psychology Eligibility Review Group was convened, in April 2015, to review the current care group delineations and make appropriate recommendations and also to review the eligibility requirements for each care group in the context of competencies for the posts and the PSI accreditation guidelines.  The final report of the HSE Psychology Eligibility Review Group is expected to be issued in January and the recommendations are currently being drafted for the National Director of HR and the Director General of the HSE.</p><p>Action 46 of Future Health (DoH, 2012) provides for the Department of Health to work with the HSE to implement an approach to workforce planning and development with the objectives of recruiting and retaining the right mix of staff; training and upskilling the workforce; providing for professional and career development; creating supportive and healthy workplaces.</p><p>In 2016, working together with the HSE, the Department will develop a national integrated strategic framework for health workforce planning on a cross-sectoral basis, including the Department of Education. The framework is intended to support the stability and sustainability of the health workforce in Ireland.</p><p>Since coming into office, this Government has made significant efforts to prioritise and modernise mental health care.  We have provided &euro;160 million ring-fenced funding and approved 1,150 new posts for mental health since 2012 up to the end of 2016, to modernise services in line with <i>A Vision for Change</i>and Programme for Government commitments. A key focus has been additional posts to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams for both adults and children.  This funding is also being used to enhance specialist community mental health and forensic services, increase the access to counselling and psychotherapy and for suicide prevention initiatives.  In 2016, funding will be provided for the continued development of counselling services across both primary and secondary care, including the provision of two new Jigsaw youth mental health services in Cork and Dublin city and for the continued development of Community Mental Health Teams and improved 24/7 responses and liaison services.</p></reply>

They must however, comply with the European Communities (General Product Safety) Regulations which specify the duties of producers and distributors placing products on the market.</p><p>While e-cigarettes do not contain tobacco, they do contain nicotine, a highly addictive substance which is the driver for cigarette smoking. Hence, there are legitimate concerns about the public health benefits of allowing such products to exist without regulation. Because they are a relatively recent product, there is limited scientific information available to balance the potential harms and benefits that might arise from more widespread public use.</p><p>The EU Tobacco Products Directive (2014/40/EU), <i>inter alia,</i>provides for the regulation of certain aspects of e-cigarettes across EU Member States. </p><p>The Directive will:</p><p>-  set mandatory safety and quality requirements e.g. on nicotine content, ingredients and devices, as well as refill mechanisms etc., for e-cigarettes;</p><p>-  make health warnings and information leaflets obligatory;</p><p>-  introduce notification requirements for manufacturers and importers of e-cigarettes; and</p><p>-  impose stricter rules on advertising and monitoring of market developments.  </p><p>The Department recently undertook a public consultation seeking views on certain discretionary elements within the Directive.  The submissions from the consultation are being analysed and will inform policy decisions. The Department is working to transpose the Directive into national legislation by the May 2016 deadline.</p><p>In addition to the regulations under the Directive, e-cigarettes will be further regulated in Ireland through the introduction of a retail licensing system.  The legislation, approved by Government will also prohibit the sale of these products to, and by, persons under 18 years of age.  A public consultation process to obtain views on those measures was conducted early in 2015.  The drafting of the Regulatory Impact Assessment is underway.</p><p>Current evidence-based means of quitting include behavioural support and pharmacotherapies. The HSE provides and promotes these safe and evidence-based services, supports and aids to help people to quit.  The HSE recommends that those wishing to give up smoking use its cessation services as the first port of call.  </p><p>The Department will continue to monitor evidence on the potential harms and benefits of these products, so as to inform decisions around any future additional regulation in this area.</p></reply>

The complaint will be investigated whether the practitioners is in the jurisdiction or not.</p>  <p>  The Medical Council advises that, where adverse events occur and it is appropriate, it is important that complaints are made in a timely manner to the Council.  Under the legislation the Council has a wide range of powers, depending on the final outcome of the Fitness to Practice process.

In practice, this will mean a smoking prevalence rate of less than 5%. The two key themes underpinning the policy are protecting children and the denormalisation of smoking. While the number of people smoking in Ireland has significantly reduced, particularly among young people, it is important that we continue to implement <i>Tobacco free Ireland</i>to reduce these numbers further.  One of the recommendations in <i>Tobacco Free Ireland </i>is the introduction of standardised packaging for tobacco products.  This legislation have now been enacted and tobacco products produced after 20th May 2016 will have to comply with the provisions of the legislation.  The legislation will prohibit the insertion or affixing of any item to the tobacco pack other than items allowed for by law.  This would mean that in the near future the packs, as described by the Deputy, will not be available for retail sale.The Standardised Packaging legislation together with the new EU Tobacco Products Directive will go a long way to ensuring that tobacco products are much less appealing to consumers and in particular young people.</p></reply>

Funding was allocated in 2015 for additional consultant posts including two consultant orthopaedic surgeons, anaesthetist and support staff at Crumlin  while capital funding was also provided for a new theatre on site to expand theatre capacity further. The 2016 Service Plan specifically provides for support for the new theatre capacity and the continued development of paediatric scoliosis services to address ongoing capacity deficits.</p>  <p>  In order to address waiting times in the interim, patients from Crumlin have been transferred to other hospitals where capacity is available and where that is clinically appropriate.  These include Temple Street, Cappagh, Tallaght and the Blackrock Clinic.  External capacity has also been identified at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital at Stanmore in the UK. These measures in total resulted in more than double capacity for this surgery for patients on the Crumlin waiting list in 2015.</p>  <p>  The HSE is continuing to work with the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group and the individual hospitals to identify all options to increase capacity further to improve access times for surgery.</p>  <p>  As the specific issues raised are a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure.  This requires the provision of information by the applicant and the HSE cannot make a determination on eligibility unless all the required information is to hand.  Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, as set out in the HSE national assessment guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.</p><p>In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware of the &quot;Keane&quot; <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility</i>with a key recommendation that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. It also recommended that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.</p><p>It is clear that there are people with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner. Greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE because the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 97,000 at the beginning of December 2015.This followed the measures I announced with Minister Varadkar following the publication of the Keane Report.</p><p>On foot of the Keane Report, the HSE established a Clinical Advisory Group to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system.  The Director General of the HSE, on accepting an interim recommendation of the Group, made a decision to award medical card eligibility to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer from 1 July 2015, with the card to be held for a period of five years.  The Clinical Advisory Group is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions.</p><p>We do not have a universal eligibility system for primary and community health services. Until we have universal health care and everyone is entitled to health care, one will always have anomalies and injustices. There will always be somebody who is just above a means threshold, or who does not have a prescribed disease, or whose condition is not sufficiently severe and, as a result, these individuals will not meet the assessment criteria.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the HSE, unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.  In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p></reply>

The Rotunda Hospital will be co-located with adult acute services at Connolly Hospital campus, Blanchardstown, while the Coombe will be tri-located at St. James&rsquo;s campus with adult acute services and the new national children&rsquo;s hospital.  Co-location of maternity services with adult services provides mothers with access to a full range of medical and support services, should the need arise.  Tri-location with paediatric services enhances the clinical benefits for the sickest new-born babies.  It is envisaged that the name and brand of the Rotunda Hospital will be preserved.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the other specific issues raised by the Deputy, these are matters for the Health Service Executive to consider in collaboration with the Rotunda.

It is responsible for the regulation of pharmacy services in Ireland and regulates the professional practice of approximately 5,615 pharmacists, 1,880 pharmacies and 424 pharmaceutical assistants, in the interest of the health, safety and welfare of patients and the public.</p>  <p>  The PSI&rsquo;s statutory functions and duties are specified in the Act and include:</p>  <p>  -  registering pharmacists, pharmaceutical assistants and pharmacies, and maintaining the registers;</p>  <p>  -  improving the profession of pharmacy including ensuring that all pharmacists are undertaking appropriate continuing professional development (CPD);</p>  <p>  -  setting of standards for pharmacy education and training;</p>  <p>  -  accreditation of educational programmes for the pharmacy profession at different levels;</p>  <p>  -  quality assurance of standards, and the development of pharmacy practice;</p>  <p>  -  inspection and enforcement, including the taking of prosecutions; and</p>  <p>  -  handling complaints and disciplinary matters, including the imposition of sanctions.</p>  <p>  The PSI is funded by registrant fees which are set out in Rules made by the PSI Council, following Ministerial consent.  Following an extensive review of the PSI functions and related costs, and consultation with national stakeholders, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Fees) Rules 2008 were made setting out the quantum of fees.  These were reduced by 10% in 2010 and most of them by a further 5% in 2014.  The Council of the PSI has processes in place to review the level of fees on an annual basis and has committed to doing so in 2016. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the regulatory functions delivered by other regulators in Ireland and by pharmacy regulators in other jurisdictions differ considerably in scope and range from those provided by the PSI.  For example, in Northern Ireland the investigative and enforcement activity is carried out by the Northern Ireland Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety rather than the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland.  In Great Britain, the General Pharmaceutical Council is responsible for regulatory functions including inspection and enforcement and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain is the professional body which provides professional guidance, networks and resources, with registration fees levied separately by both organisations.  The PSI performs significant inspection and enforcement activities in respect of pharmacies which are not replicated by regulators in other jurisdictions.  Therefore it is difficult to directly compare the regulatory registration fees applicable in differing jurisdictions and by other regulators in Ireland on a like-for-like basis. </p>  <p>   There is a particular cost associated with the delivery of a regulatory system and associated services.  Economies of scale apply when a larger proportion of registrants fund the model.  The principle of the PSI application of fees is to recover costs based on who causes the cost or who benefits and is subject to the activities undertaken.</p></reply>

It is challenging to project precisely the potential changes in numbers eligible as persons who currently do not hold a medical card could become eligible due a change in circumstances, either on a means or a discretionary basis.  Furthermore, existing medical cards, save where granted following discretionary consideration, are subject to a periodic review of eligibility which can result in renewal, change or removal of eligibility as particular to the cardholders&rsquo; circumstances, such as positive changes in income. </p>  <p>  The HSE National Service Plan for 2016 assumes that the number of medical cards will continue to decline such that the number of persons covered will fall by some 50,000 from the end of 2015 to the end of 2016.  This reduction takes account of variables such as demographic and economic growth. </p>  <p>  While the number of persons on the Live Register may have reduced, many people who took up employment may have continued to qualify for a medical card on basis of being below the income guidelines in the means test.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that people who have been unemployed for a minimum of 12 months can retain their medical card for a period of three years (without a means test) if they commence employment.  Persons who take up approved training/work schemes retain their medical card for the duration of the scheme.</p></reply>

The establishment of this network has been a very welcome development in recent years.  The HIQA report on our pre-hospital emergency care services, which was published last year, recognised the challenges faced by our ambulance service in responding to emergencies in rural communities.  The report recommended the expansion of the CFR scheme and additional funding was provided for this in 2015 and 2016.  There are 131 CFR schemes active around the country, with 20 of these becoming active since January 2015.  I look forward to further expansion of the scheme in 2016. </p>  <p>  The Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council is the independent statutory agency with responsibility for standards, education and training in the field of pre-hospital emergency care.

The delay in responding to him is regretted.  However, the reply which issued took account of developments up and including the date of issue of the reply.  In this regard, the Deputy will note that the NMBI confirmed that the applicant's name was entered in the Psychiatric Division of the Register on 5 January 2016 and certificates issued on that day to the applicant's home address.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the other question the Deputy raised during January in relation to a specific application, the NMBI has advised that this applicant has applied for consideration of registration with the NMBI in the general nurse division of the Register on 29 October 2015 having undertaken her nurse training in the United Kingdom.  As part of the application process, the applicant was requested to furnish to the NMBI's office, a completed application form, identity documents and passport sized photographs.  The NMBI also requires a verification of registration completed by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) in the United Kingdom prior to a review being undertaken on her application.  To date, this verification remains outstanding.  A total of 12 queries have been raised via the NMBI's overseas call centre regarding the progress of this file, the most recent query being raised on 8 January 2015 whereby the applicant was informed of the outstanding document.  Unfortunately, as this document is crucial to the final review on the applicant's application, the NMBI is not in a position to progress this application until same is received directly from the applicant or directly from the NMC in the United Kingdom.</p>  <p>  The NMBI has noted that the Deputy has not provided any details relating to correspondence received from public representatives that were made to the NMBI during 2015.  The Acting  Director of Registry will immediately investigate same if the Deputy wishes to provide such details.</p>  <p>  The NMBI has put a number of contact channels in place for applicants following up on the progress of their applications.  One such measure, which was introduced in October 2015, is the opening of a dedicated call centre line for overseas applicants.  This call centre is open Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 5.30 p.m.  The call centre can provide regular updates to overseas applicants on the current status of their application.  To date, this call centre has taken over 4,500 calls.  The NMBI is imminently launching a new website which will have additional features for overseas applicants to include a facility to &ldquo;Track their Application&rdquo; on-line.</p>  <p>  The NMBI is acutely aware of the severe pressures on employers throughout the HSE, the Nursing Home sector and other employers to progress applications through the system as efficiently  and as quickly as possible.  The NMBI continues to have monthly engagement with representatives from the above organisations and also holds weekly meetings with individual stakeholders as required.  This engagement has led to very positive working relationships with these Stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The central tenet of the NMBI is the protection of the public.  Therefore, we must be satisfied that all documentation required to progress an application to decision stage meets all the necessary requirements.  The NMBI has referred to its guide document for overseas applicants on its website, which provides a detailed breakdown of the overseas process if the Deputy needs to gain more specific information on the NMBI's processes and requirements.</p></reply>

These proposals have now been accepted by the INMO National Executive and it will be recommending them for acceptance in a ballot of Emergency Department nurses. </p>  <p>  The interests of patients are always best served through negotiation and by avoiding industrial action. I particularly welcome the fact that the proposals contain specific measures to enhance patient safety and delivery of care. </p>  <p>  I hope that Emergency Department nurses will regard the proposals as sufficiently detailed and robust to address their concerns around activation of the escalation policy, health and safety and full implementation of the agreement itself. I expect a deeper level of trust between hospital management and nursing staff will result from the active implementation and monitoring of the proposals.</p></reply>

The following is the current position as regards the lodging of the planning application.  This is a major development on a campus with listed / protected buildings.  Therefore HSE has had extensive consultations with the planning authorities about the new facility and the treatment of the listed / protected buildings.  The purpose of the consultation process is to ensure a successful planning application in so far as is possible.   Following its most recent meeting with the relevant local authority mainly on conservation issues the HSE expects that the planning application can be lodged in Q1 2016.  Subject to a smooth planning process and no onerous planning conditions construction could commence late this year.  However in advance of receipt of the award of planning it is not possible to indicate with any certainty when construction could commence.</p>  <p>  The HSE has recently submitted its draft Capital Plan for the multi-annual period 2016-2021.  This is being reviewed.  It requires my approval together with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.

However, I can inform you that the Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare. The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement and cannot be imposed on suppliers or contractors. It is different to the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis.</p></reply>

Since 2009 all designated centres for older people (nursing homes) whether public, private or voluntary have been registered and inspected by HIQA.  Under Section 49 of the Act the Chief Inspector must establish and maintain a register of designated centres. Details entered into the register include the name and address of the centre, date of registration and the number of people that can be accommodated. This information is available on a county basis and is published and can be accessed at the Authority&rsquo;s website <i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i></p><p><font color="#0000FF">  </font>During 2015 the Department commissioned a consultancy to provide an analysis of potential measures to encourage the provision of nursing home and Community Nursing Unit facilities.  This report was published in December and is available at .  The report forecasts the demand for long stay and short stay beds from 2016 to 2036, arising from CSO based population projections.  The information is broken down at HSE Local Office Level.  The report notes that the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Occupancy report for May 2015 indicates that at a national level public long stay units had an occupancy rate of 92%.  It further notes that according to Nursing Homes Ireland the average occupancy rate nationally in private nursing homes during 2014 was 90%.  In his budget speech, Mr Michael Noonan T.D., Minister for Finance announced changes to the Employment and Investment Incentive Scheme (EIIS) to allow for investment in the extension, management and operation of nursing homes.  The inclusion of nursing home expansion works in the EIIS was influenced by this analysis.</p><p>It is important to both consolidate our existing stock, particularly of public beds, and to ensure that sufficient capacity is provided across the public and private sectors to meet future demand.  I recently announced an additional <b>&euro;300m </b>capital allocation for refurbishment or replacement of social care facilities for older persons&rsquo; units and disability units to allow such facilities to comply with relevant National Standards by 2021. The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme included a general examination of the operation of the Scheme, as well as the balance between residential care and care in the community and a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed considerations across Departments and Agencies.  Arising from the Review, further work will be undertaken by the National Treatment Purchase Fund to examine their current pricing arrangements with a view to ensuring adequate residential capacity for those with complex care needs, providing value and increasing transparency, and to submit future pricing proposals to the Minister.</p></reply>

St. James's Hospital and the new children's hospital are both model 4 hospitals.  St James's Hospital has the widest range of sub-specialities and the highest level of clinical complexity of all the adult hospitals in the country. The skill and expertise of the clinical staff in the co-located new children's hospital and St James's Hospital match appropriately, and these shared skills and expertise are precisely what is required for the care of the most complex and life-threatening conditions with which children from all over Ireland will present to the new children's hospital. By bringing together the full spectrum of sub-specialities in paediatric and neonatology on a single campus, the degree of critical mass can be attained that will support the more complex treatment and care for the sickest children and young people of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) is the statutory body responsible for planning, designing, building and equipping the new children's hospital. On 10 August 2015 the NPHDB submitted a planning application for the new hospital and satellite centres to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  The oral hearing process began on 30 November and heard submissions from key stakeholders and interested parties, including the Jack and Jill Foundation, before concluding on 15 December. An Bord Plean&aacute;la will consider all of the evidence presented and I look forward to the planning decision which is expected in February.</p>  <p>  A final reply to the Deputy has issued on this matter.</p></reply>

Funding was allocated in 2015 for additional consultant posts including two consultant orthopaedic surgeons, anaesthetist and support staff at Crumlin  while capital funding was also provided for a new theatre on site to expand theatre capacity further. The 2016 Service Plan specifically provides for support for the new theatre capacity and the continued development of paediatric scoliosis services to address ongoing capacity deficits. </p>  <p>  In order to address waiting times in the interim, patients from Crumlin have been transferred to other hospitals where capacity is available and where that is clinically appropriate.  These include Temple Street, Cappagh, Tallaght and the Blackrock Clinic.  External capacity has also been identified at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital at Stanmore in the UK. The HSE is continuing to work with the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group and the individual hospitals to identify all options to increase capacity further to improve access times for surgery.</p>  <p>  As the specific issues raised are a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

Under European and Irish legislation, before a medicine can be placed on the Irish market the manufacturer has to seek an authorisation from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) or in the case of certain medicinal products, the European Medicines Agency (EMA). A determination on an application for authorisation of a medicine is based on a rigorous scientific assessment of the application against legal and regulatory requirements.</p>  <p>  In July 2014, the Misuse of Drugs Regulations were amended to allow for certain cannabis based medicinal products to be used in Ireland.

In the rest of the English speaking world the titles of physical therapist and physiotherapist are interchangeable and their users are qualified physiotherapists.  In Ireland, however, the title is used by a number of practitioners who are not physiotherapists but who are competing with physiotherapists in the private sector in the provision of musculoskeletal therapies.   </p>  <p>  Having consulted with the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, I wrote to a number of relevant organisations regarding my proposal to protect the title of physical therapist as a variant of the title of physiotherapist and invited them to submit their views.

A priority of these discussions will be the inclusion of chronic disease management for patients.  It is not possible in advance of completion of the negotiation process to foresee what the outcome of the review may be and its consequent effect on the average cost of a GP visit card.  Therefore, depending on the outcome of these negotiations, the estimated costs of extending free General Practitioner care to children over 6, persons over 60 years of age and the entire population may vary from the estimates provided, as these have been produced on the basis of the current costs.</p>  <p>  Assuming the same terms, conditions, services as the contract for those children under the age of six years, the cost of extending Free GP care to the 6-18 year old age cohort is estimated at approximately &euro;80 million.</p>  <p>  The cost of extending free GP care to those aged between 66 and 70 is estimated at approximately &euro;20 million. My Department has been unable to calculate the cost of GP visit cards for the 60-65 age cohort because the figures for this age group are not available from the HSE's Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) - its standard grouping being aged 55 to 64 years.  The cost of extending free GP care to those aged between 19 and 65 on the same basis as the current contract is estimated at approximately &euro;400 million. The PCRS's most recently available average cost of a GP visit card was used in these estimations.</p>  <p>  The cost of extending free GP care to those not already covered by free GP care would be, on the basis of the above range of assumptions and estimations, in the region of &euro;500 million.</p></reply>

All our actions are in support of our twin objectives of securing his release at the earliest opportunity, and caring for his welfare while he remains in detention.  To that end, Embassy officials undertake regular and frequent consular visits with this citizen and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also interacts regularly with his family to provide support and assistance.  Such a high level of visitation means that Embassy officials are well-placed to intervene on his behalf when issues arise, and numerous positive interventions have already been made on his behalf with the Egyptian authorities.  My Department continues to liaise closely with this citizen, his family and his Egyptian legal team in regard to medical issues.  The most recent consular visit took place on 28 December and the most recent direct contact with the citizen&rsquo;s family was when Embassy officials spoke with one of its members last Saturday.</p>  <p>  I remain in close contact with my Egyptian counterpart, Foreign Minister Shoukry, with Egypt&rsquo;s Ambassador to Ireland, Ms Soha Gendi, and with EU High Representative Ms. Federica Mogherini in relation to this case. The Taoiseach has also spoken about this citizen&rsquo;s detention with President al-Sisi on two separate occasions.</p>  <p>  All the information we receive is carefully considered and informs our overall strategy towards the achievement of the above-mentioned twin objectives.  As the local lawyers in any consular case are generally best placed to clarify and advise on issues relating to local law, Embassy officials remain in close contact with this citizen&rsquo;s Egyptian legal team and will continue to support their efforts to secure his release at the earliest possible opportunity.</p></reply>

Ireland, along with the other Member States of the EU, believes that lifting the embargo, along with the full implementation of the package of economic and social reforms adopted by the Cuban parliament in 2011, would facilitate an opening of the Cuban economy to the benefit of the Cuban people.</p>  <p>  Our concerns about economic measures against Cuba, which are contrary to commonly accepted rules of international trade, are long-standing and clear.  We do not support unilaterally-imposed measures that impede the economic and commercial relations of EU Member States with Cuba.</p>  <p>  The historic developments of the past year have seen considerable progress in relations between the United States and Cuba. We look forward to the ending of the US embargo and the removal of all remaining obstructions to trade and communication with Cuba. We welcome the commencement of bilateral discussions between the US and Cuba in Havana on 8 December, 2015 on the subject of compensation.</p>  <p>  Together with our EU partners, Ireland also continues to encourage the US to bring about the closure of the detention centre at Guant&aacute;namo Bay. The question of jurisdiction and control over Guant&aacute;namo is a matter for the US and Cuban authorities.</p></reply>

Our membership of the United Nations Human Rights Council (2013 to 2015) afforded us the opportunity to underline and reinforce that commitment at the very heart of the global human rights&rsquo; machinery.</p>  <p>  Respect for human rights is also fundamental to the EU&rsquo;s foreign policy. Since 1995, the European Commission has included a human rights&rsquo; clause in all negotiated bilateral agreements of a general nature. This so-called "essential elements" clause applies to agreements with over 120 countries.  In 2012 an EU Special Representative for Human Rights was appointed further highlighting the EU commitment to human rights.</p>  <p>  The EU Action Plan for Democracy and Human Rights (2015-2019) was adopted by the EU Foreign Ministers on 20 July 2015.  The Plan includes a commitment to enhancing human rights safeguards in all migration and mobility dialogues and cooperation frameworks with third countries as well as in migration-related agreements, processes and programmes.</p>  <p>  Ireland actively participated in the Valletta Summit Meeting of 11\12 November, 2015 which brought leaders from the EU and Africa together to address migration challenges originating in Africa. The protection of human rights is a central element in the Valletta Action Plan. The state of play of the implementation of the Plan will be regularly monitored within the framework of the Africa-EU Strategy, as well as within bilateral political dialogues among signatories to the Plan. This will help ensure that respect for human rights continues to guide engagement with participating Governments, including Eritrea and Sudan.</p>  <p>  The Rabat Process &ndash; a framework for migration dialogue between the all countries of the EU and the countries of West and Central Africa &ndash; is under the guidance of a Steering Committee, the major decision-making body directing the Process. The Committee&rsquo;s membership includes Belgium, France, Italy and Spain. Respect for human-rights is a core feature of the Rome Programme, the strategic framework of the Rabat Process for the period 2014-2017.</p>  <p>  The Khartoum Process - which also highlights the importance of human rights in the context of Migration - is being steered by a group of core EU and African countries as well as by the European Commission and the European External Action Service. All EU member states as well as Eritrea and Sudan are parties to the Khartoum Process.</p>  <p>  Given Ireland&rsquo;s and the EU&rsquo;s commitment to human rights, and that this commitment is effectively embedded in all three processes (Valetta Action Plan and the Khartoum and Rabat Processes), the Deputy can be assured that respect for human rights will remain a priority for both Ireland&rsquo;s and the EU&rsquo;s continuing engagement with these processes.</p></reply>

This recognises the fact that the majority of migrants entering the EU in recent months transit such third countries. In an increasingly interconnected world, all countries are mutually reliant on each other as regards effective migration management. In particular, all countries have certain international responsibilities and obligations towards each other as regards accepting back their own nationals who are found to be illegally staying elsewhere. Ireland remains committed to the principle that the primary criterion for the allocation of development and humanitarian assistance is need and, as stated in Ireland&rsquo;s policy for development assistance, <i>One World One Future</i>, we will play our part in ensuring that the EU continues to deliver aid that is effective and assists those most in need.</p></reply>

In the vast majority of cases the witnessed consent of parents or legal guardians is given on the application form.  This record is sufficient to meet the consent requirements of the Act. However, there are cases where only one guardian provides his/her witnessed consent on the application form.  The circumstances are not always clear from the details of a passport application.  The reasons generally relate to a breakup of the relationship of parents, the death of a parent/guardian or the absence of the father&rsquo;s details on a child&rsquo;s birth certificate.  Timing can be important in terms of ensuring that the consent aspect of an application is fully compliant with the Act.    For instance in the case where a birth certificate is submitted without the father&rsquo;s details the conclusion might be that the mother is the child&rsquo;s sole guardian.  However, it could be the case for example that the father has acquired guardianship in the period between the registration of a child&rsquo;s birth and the date of a passport application.</p>  <p>  Similarly, the circumstances under which a previous passport was issued to a child on the basis of the sole consent of one parent/guardian may have changed by the time that the passport is due to be renewed.  For instance a court order may have been obtained by another family member, such as a grandparent, that determines that this person is also a guardian of that child.</p>  <p>  In order to fulfill the legal obligations under the Act in the context of a wide range of family circumstances, the Department requires sole guardians to complete a pro-forma affidavit to accompany each passport application.  This is a legal declaration on the part of the sole parent/guardian in which s/he attests -</p>  <p>- to being the child&rsquo;s sole guardian;</p>  <p>- that there is no Court Order giving the other parent or another person guardianship of the child;</p>  <p>- to not entering an arrangement or agreement which has the effect of making or purporting to make the other parent or another person a guardian of the child;</p>  <p>- that no other person is a guardian by operation of law: and</p>  <p>- that no other circumstances exist whereby there is a guardian.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that some additional costs may be incurred by the witnessing parent/guardian in having this affidavit completed and sworn.  However the submission of the affidavit with an application form ensures that the terms of the Act in relation to consent are complied with; that the right of each guardian is protected as far as possible and that the risk of child abduction is reduced.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to review this policy at present.</p></reply>

We have expressed concern about its increased use of late in a number of countries, including the recent cases in Saudi Arabia which I condemn without reservation.</p>  <p>  The abolition of the death penalty is one of Ireland&rsquo;s priorities at the United Nations, one which we pursued while a member of the UN Human Rights Council.   For example, Ireland made a statement at the Council on 21 September 2015 voicing clear concern in relation to another death penalty case in Saudi Arabia.</p>  <p>  These and other human rights issues are raised with the Saudi authorities, usually in conjunction with our EU partners with a view to trying to maximize the impact of our representations.  In addition to the concerns in the case of Sheik Al-Nimr raised in her statement of 2 January 2016, High Representative Mogherini stated in July 2015 that the EU will continue to closely follow the issue of the death penalty in Saudi Arabia in general, and to voice its concern through appropriate diplomatic channels. </p>  <p>  The representation of States to bodies such as the UN Human Rights Council is determined by election by the Member States of the United Nations.</p>  <p>  The execution of Mr Al-Nimr and the protests in which mobs illegally attacked Saudi diplomatic offices in Iran are increasing sectarian divisions that threaten the stability of the Middle East region. I am concerned, in particular, about the possible implications of these tensions for the tentative steps towards peace in Syria which had been achieved by the International Syria Support Group, and I urge Iran and Saudi Arabia to avoid further actions which could contribute to regional tensions.</p></reply>

Open public procurement procedures are used to engage external contractors to provide non-core services involving ICT, programme administration and general services.   The Department meets its statutory obligations relating to minimum pay by complying with the European Procurement Directives and the National Procurement Rules by utilising the standardised set of Government public procurement documents.</p>  <p>  The use of Government model templates of request for tenders for supplies, services and goods, which incorporate model template contracts, outlines the legal and procedural obligations placed on both the Department and tenderers regarding employment protection.</p>  <p>  When issuing tenders, the Department publishes provisions of the contract and request for tenders simultaneously. The contracts clearly outline the terms and conditions, the specifications, charges and special conditions relating the operation of the contract in an open and transparent manner.</p>  <p>  These details, including the employment protection provisions, are confirmed by the tenderer in his acceptance of the terms and conditions of the tender competition on contract completion.</p>  <p>  Discussions are often conducted with tenderers following the tender process to conclude contract agreements.</p>  <p>  Tenderers that fail to meet the wage level compliance requirements may be rejected at this stage at the sole discretion of the Department.</p>  <p>  The cost in implementing this wage level requirement for contractor employees is a matter primarily for the contractor.

The scale and presence of the network is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis.

A range of factors are taken into account in considering our diplomatic representation overseas, including our national political, economic and trade priorities, as well as the availability of resources. However, current resource constraints do not allow us to have resident representation in all the locations that might objectively justify it having regard to political, economic and trade factors.

More favourable ratios operate in DEIS Band 1 schools. Under an agreement reached with the Education Partners for the 2010/11 school year my Department provided 50 additional posts to the primary sector and 100 additional posts to the post-primary sector. At primary level as these posts were additional to those required to cater for demographic growth, some improvements were made to the staffing schedule for the 2010/11 school year. These improvements were targeted at medium-to-larger schools typically under the greatest pressure in relation to class sizes. At post-primary level, additional supports were targeted at co-educational schools in single post-primary catchment areas and at schools that join together with other local post primary schools to increase subject choice in a town.The application of these additional posts to the primary staffing schedule resulted in the schedule operating on the basis of 1 classroom teacher for an average of every 27 pupils between the bands of 8 classroom teachers and 16 classroom teachers. The 37 pupil difference arises only at the point between 16 and 17 classroom teachers. However given that the standard size of a school is 16 classrooms this issue does not typically arise. An average of 28 to 1 applies for the bands of 18 classroom teachers upwards.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I have announced a 1 point improvement to the primary staffing schedule in the context of Budget 2016. The improved staffing schedule which is available on the Department website will be implemented for the 2016/17 school year.</p>  <p>  The application of this 1 point improvement to the primary staffing schedule will result in the schedule operating on the basis of 1 classroom teacher for an average of every 26 pupils between the bands of 8 classroom teachers and 16 classroom teachers.</p>  <p>  The staffing arrangements for all schools for the 2016/17 school year will be published early in 2016.</p></reply>

In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.</p>  <p>  A range of supports have been provided for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, they will have access to an appropriate education.</p>  <p>  We now have a higher level of Resource Teaching and SNA support than ever before.</p>  <p>  In July last, I announced that an additional 610 Special Needs Assistant posts are being provided for this year. From September, there are 11,820 whole time equivalent SNA posts available in Primary, Post Primary and Special schools to support children with special educational needs with assessed care needs. This is the highest level of SNA allocation that we have ever had. In total there has been an increase of 11.7% in SNA posts available for allocation to schools since this Government came to office.  These extra posts will ensure that the Government's policy of ensuring that every child who is assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to such support.</p>  <p>  In addition, the NCSE has established over 150 new Special Classes in the 2015/16 school year, which means there are now over 1,000 special classes attached to mainstream schools catering for children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  I also announced provision for an additional 480 Resource Teachers, to take into account increased demand and demographic growth and to ensure that children can continue to have access to additional supports in school.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I have also established a pilot of a new model for allocating resource teachers to schools, which is currently underway in 47 schools with widespread support. The NCSE had recommended that a new model be developed based on the profiled needs of each school, rather than on the diagnosed disability of individual children.

It will also review the experiences of the schools who participated and assist us further in developing the model. Consultation will continue to take place with education partners and stakeholders prior to the implementation of any new model.</p>  <p>  This Government's continued investment in education will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs. We have been resolutely committed to protecting, and in some instances increasing, the level of investment being made to support children with special educational needs at a time when there has been a requirement to make expenditure reductions across a range of areas. It is an area of spending which has been prioritised above most other areas by this Government, despite the enormous pressures on all areas of public spending.</p></reply>

Minimum entry requirements for programmes of primary initial teacher education are set by my Department, in consultation with the Teaching Council. Applications for undergraduate programmes (4 year Bachelor of Education) are made through the Central Applications Office (CAO) and selection is based on the CAO points system. Places on the post graduate programmes are awarded on the basis of qualifications, an interview and an oral examination in Irish.  Since September 2014, the 2 year Professional Masters of Education (PME) has replaced the 18 month Graduate Diploma in Education.</p>  <p>  As part of the minimum academic requirements, all candidates, including school leavers, mature students and university graduates, must have a minimum of a Grade C in Higher Level in Irish in the Leaving Certificate, or an approved equivalent.  All candidates for Primary initial teacher education post graduate programmes must hold an Honours Bachelor Degree (Major Award at Level 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications) or a major award at Level 9 or a major award at Level 10 on the National Framework of Qualifications.</p></reply>

These posts will provide for an improvement in the staffing schedules at primary and post primary levels, enhance the leadership and management roles of deputy principals at post-primary level by reducing their teaching time, an improvement to the scheme of release time for principal teachers at primary level and additional resource posts to meet special education needs. The allocation of a whole time equivalent of an additional 300 teachers to second level schools brings the basis of allocation from 19:1 to 18.7:1 for the school year 2016/17. This improvement of 0.3 in PTR allocation is a restoration of 50% of the teaching resources that were removed when the allocation of guidance posts was brought within quota. The delivery of the 50% restoration through a change in the PTR allocation will allow each school to determine how best to allocate the additional resources to meet the guidance needs of the school.</p>  <p>  When the allocation for guidance was brought within quota DEIS schools were protected from the change by providing for a 18.25:1 allocation compared to the general 19:1 allocation. The position of DEIS schools will be further enhanced by a change to an allocation on the basis of 17.95:1.</p></reply>

I will be meeting with An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta, and Gaelscoileanna Teoranta in January.

All schools should be required to prioritise local children, regardless of their religion, while building in protection for the small number of minority faith schools which serve dispersed communities. This is a matter that needs to be addressed as a priority for the next Government.</p></reply>

Department of Finance Circular 27/2001 provides for the reimbursement to staff by Departments of professional membership fees. The policy of this Department is that staff may apply for a reimbursement in respect of one professional body only providing the membership is necessary for the performance of an officer's official duties. e.g., where there is a legal requirement that the officer be on the register of a professional body or association or that the membership of the body forms part of the officer&rsquo;s employment contract.<br /><br />2. The payment to PSI is a professional membership payment on behalf of 117 NEPS Psychologists. The single group payment enables the Department to avail of a 10% discount on the total cost of the individual memberships and significantly reduces the number of individual reimbursement payments issuing to staff from the unit.<br /><br />3. Subscriptions are made to Legal Island which provides regular updates in relation to employment law for officials in Human Resources.<br /><br />4. The payment to EBSCO allows staff access to an electronic database of specialist journals and articles for use by the professional staff of the Inspectorate (Education Research Complete) and NEPS (Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection) and is necessary for their work. The payment relates to a 2 year subscription which runs from 01/12/2015 to 31/11/2017.</blockquote></p></reply>

The current ECF, agreed for the period 2010 to 2014, remains in place. It should be noted that the higher education sector has met, and indeed exceeded, all the required reductions in core funded posts since the introduction of the ECF.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2015, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced that the existing ECFs and associated moratoriums would be lifted and replaced with a system of delegated sanction for recruiting and promoting up to Principal Officer level, subject to adherence by Departments to binding 3 year pay ceilings and ongoing compliance with Workforce Planning requirements. In light of this announcement a new ECF for the higher education sector will be put in place shortly.</p>  <p>  In line with Government policy, any requests for exceptions to the Moratorium that are not covered by the ECF must be sanctioned by my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform prior to the awarding or renewal of the employment contract. </p>  <p>  A condition of the current Framework is that the reductions in the number of core staff should be achieved in a balanced manner across the grading structure and should not be concentrated at the lower grade levels, i.e. the framework should not result in 'grade-drift' within institutions. Promotions are permitted under the ECF subject to compliance with the Framework and to the maintenance of appropriate balance between grades, both academic and administrative/professional/technical.</p></reply>

One aspect of this Agreement relates to supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and as both Unions that represent SNAs namely, SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to the Haddington Road Agreement, my Department has implemented supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs.</p><p>  The first part of the LRC proposals for supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs outlines that the supplementary assignment arrangements only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant. Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school/ETB.</p><p>  The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for the 2015/2016 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0041/2015 which issued on 12  June 2015 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address: .</p><p>Once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service (Service in a substitute capacity i.e. covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job-sharing etc. does not count) is notified by his/her employer that s/he is to be made redundant then s/he shall be deemed to be a member of a supplementary assignment panel for SNAs.</p><p>The operation of this panel is described and outlined in Circular 0041/2015 and it is designed to be as flexible as possible which enables all eligible SNAs, who have the requisite Panel Form 1 completed by their former employer, to apply for any SNA position that is advertised by a school or an ETB with no sectoral, diocesan or geographical limitations imposed. It does not work on a list basis. Every eligible SNA will remain on the panel for two years with a view to getting further employment. If they are not successful over that period of time in obtaining a further SNA position then they will be eligible for a Redundancy payment. Furthermore, an SNA may opt out of this supplementary assignment panel at any point in time triggering the processing of his/her redundancy payment in line with the terms set out in the SNA redundancy scheme (DES Circular 58/06) or any revision of same that is applicable at that time.</p><p>It is important to note that when an employer has a vacancy to fill, they must undertake the recruitment process in accordance with the provisions outlined in paragraphs 15-22 of Circular 41/2015. Finally, my Department has set up a dedicated e-mail address to deal with all queries in relation to the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel and any queries in respect of the operation of the Panel can be directed to this dedicated e-mail address: snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie. </p><p>In regard to job-sharing arrangements, the position is that the provisions of the Job Sharing Scheme for Special Needs Assistants in Recognised Primary and Post-Primary Schools are outlined in my Department's Circular Letter 41/2014 which is available on the Department's website at the following address: </p><p>.</p><p>In accordance with the Circular, Special Needs Assistants may apply to share a whole-time post on a 50:50 basis i.e. 16 hours per week in both Primary and Post Primary Schools. The terms of the scheme were agreed with the School Management Bodies and the relevant Trade Unions and have general application to all Special Needs Assistants.</p></reply>

This Government has made considerable progress in implementing the recommendations set out in the Strategy, significantly advancing the goal of achieving a modernised, more flexible and responsive higher education system that is accountable for high quality performance across the full range of higher education activities. </p>  <p>  With regard to the institute of technology sector, the Strategy recommended significant reforms to position the sector to meet national strategic objectives. In particular, the Strategy recommended consolidation within the sector and a pathway of evolution for those consolidated institutes of technology, to allow them to demonstrate significant progress against robust performance criteria and to apply to become technological universities. </p>  <p>  The main purpose of the Technological Universities Bill, which was published in December 2015, is to give effect to the recommendations set out in the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 with regard to the IoT sector.  In addition, the Bill provides for a number of important reforms to the governance and operation of the existing institutes of technology.</p>  <p>  The Technological Universities Bill 2015 sets out the process for the establishment of technological universities. These technological universities will be distinctly different from traditional universities and institutes of technology by virtue of their mission. This differentiated mission includes a systematic focus on the preparation of graduates for complex professional roles in a changing technological world; the advancement of knowledge through research and scholarship and the dissemination of this knowledge to meet the needs of society and enterprise; and, the particular contribution the university will make to the needs of the region in which it is located. These institutions will be linked to industry, and will have an enormous impact on our capacity to create and retain jobs in regions such as the South-East and the North-West.</p>  <p>  The Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, and its Chair, Deputy Joanna Tuffy, undertook pre-legislative scrutiny on the General Scheme of the Bill in April of 2014. I am aware that the TUI participated in this process, and many of the Committee's recommendations have been taken into account during the drafting of the Technological Universities Bill. </p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the Strategy, the Higher Education Authority (HEA) published a four-stage process and criteria for applicant groups of institutes of technology wishing to apply to become technological universities. That document set out a process whereby individual institutions could make a strategic choice to align, merge and apply to become designated as technological universities. The procedure for application for designation as a technological university, as set out in the Technological Universities Bill 2015, is a reiteration of the fourth and final stage of the earlier published 'process and criteria for designation as a technological university'. The proposed consolidations now emerging within the institute of technology sector, and the development of technological universities as a result, will protect and enhance the distinctive career and enterprise focused missions of institutions in the traditional institute of technology sector while also enhancing their strength and scale. This improvement in scale will be particularly important in relation to the challenge that applicants for technological university status must address in improving their competitive position nationally and internationally.</p>  <p>  Initially three consortiums of institutes of technology expressed an interest in merging and in applying to become technological universities as part of the Landscape Process undertaken by the HEA in 2012 and approved by the then Minister for Education and Skills. </p>  <p>  Two of those consortiums have successfully passed stage 3 of the four-stage process which involved the assessment of their project plans by an international panel of experts. These are the TU4Dublin consortium, made up of Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology, Tallaght and the Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown, and the Munster Technological University consortium, made up of Cork Institute of Technology and the Institute of Technology Tralee. </p>  <p>  Both of these consortiums are working towards full mergers in 2016. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Technological University for the South-East, consisting of Institute of Technology, Carlow (ITC) and Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT) a preliminary facilitation process has been underway since September 2015 and there has been strong engagement in the process by both parties. This facilitation process involves a series of meetings, and is an important building block in terms of building trust between the parties and in developing a strong working connection. Not all of the facilitative meetings have been scheduled yet so as to allow the participants time to reflect and to complete any tasks required to move the process on. </p>  <p>  In early 2015, the Connacht-Ulster Alliance, made up of Galway Mayo Institute of Technology, Sligo Institute of Technology, and Letterkenny Institute of Technology, also expressed an interest in merging and in applying to become a technological university. In October 2015 I approved this application to proceed to the next stage. In line with the process for designation as a TU, Stage 2 of this process involves the preparation of a plan by the Connacht-Ulster Alliance, to meet the criteria for designation as a Technological University.</p>  <p>  As these proposals have progressed through the four stage process I have reiterated to the consortiums the importance of, and the need for, a process of consultation and engagement such as referred to in the correspondence the Deputy has received. </p>  <p>  The mergers outlined above cannot proceed until the Technological Universities Bill has been enacted and the relevant provisions commenced. Therefore this Bill, in providing the legislative underpinning for those institutes of technology who have established partnerships and wish to merge, represents an essential milestone in the modernisation and reform agenda for higher education institutions.</p>  <p>  I would also like to point out that institutes of technology which do not choose to follow the evolutionary path set out in the National Strategy for Higher Education, and in this Bill, will continue to make an important contribution to higher education and particularly to the development of their region.</p>  <p>  The National Strategy recommended that the governance structures of all higher education institutions should be reformed to ensure that they are fit for purpose and have the expertise relevant to the governance of a modern higher education institution. This Bill therefore provides for new and modernised governance structures in the institutes of technology and for other reforms which will allow them to become more flexible and responsive to their environment.</p></reply>

However, my Department may also provide sanction to special schools, subject to application, to retain a pupil for one additional year beyond the age of 18 to facilitate the transition of a pupil to adult services. </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that students with a special educational need, including those with Down syndrome, have a range of options available to them in the higher and further education sectors. Some students choose to participate in educational programmes through further adult educational programmes or in adult settings. </p><p>  While the Department of Health and Children/Health Service Executive assumes direct responsibility for young adults with special educational needs who are over 18 years, my Department may allocate funding towards an educational component of such provision. </p><p>  This is generally transacted through the co-operation hours scheme operated by Education and Training Boards (ETBs) where the local service provider makes application to the relevant ETB for tuition hours. Funding is also provided to the National Learning Network for this purpose. </p><p>  Young adults with disabilities are eligible to access Specialist Training Provision for persons with a disability organised through the ETB Sector who contract with Specialist Training Providers nationwide to deliver training to people with disabilities who require more intensive support than would be available in non-specialist training provision. A range of specialist courses is available at two levels of training, Introductory Skills Training (IST) and Skill Specific Training (SST) and includes in-centre, employer based and blended learning approaches to accommodate learners' training needs.

The deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the school management authorities. We have a growing population of young people in this country and despite the difficult financial circumstances we face as a country, we prioritised education so that the number of teachers we have in the system has also grown in order to protect pupil teacher ratios. This has involved an increase of around 3,100 teaching posts in our primary and post-primary schools over the last two years. This is a very significant investment at a time of scarce resources.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I have made provision in Budget 2016 for some 2,260 additional teaching posts for our primary and post primary schools next year. This includes an estimated 440 posts at primary level to cater for increased demographics.</p><p>  At primary level there will be a one point improvement to the primary staffing schedule to be implemented for the 2016/17 school year. This will see the primary staffing schedule operate on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 27 pupils. Lower thresholds apply for DEIS Band 1 schools. The estimated additional post requirement in 2016 for this improvement is 300 posts. The improved staffing schedule is currently available on the Department website. </p><p>  Increasing demographics at primary level are expected to peak in 2018 with an annual estimated requirement of circa 350 posts per annum to maintain the 27:1 general average. Declining enrolments at primary level in the following three years could potentially reduce the post requirement by circa 800 posts over the three year period. </p></reply>

The level of extra teaching support provided in respect of language support to schools is determined by the numbers of eligible pupils enrolled and the associated levels of those pupils' language proficiency. New arrangements (rule based allocations and an appeal process) were put in place in recent years for the allocation of language support to schools. Prior to the 2012/2013 school year, these posts were allocated on a temporary basis by way of applications by individual schools.</p>  <p>  Reforms introduced in the 2012/13 school year created a single simplified allocation process for both learning and language support. At primary level, learning/language support hours are allocated on the basis of mainstream classroom teaching posts in the school. At post-primary level, learning/language support is allocated on the basis of pupil numbers. Schools have autonomy to deploy this resource between learning support and language support depending on the specific needs of the school.</p>  <p>  The revised arrangements also provided for additional permanent teaching posts to be given to schools with high concentration of pupils that require language support. Further additional temporary language support posts are provided on the basis of appeals to the Staffing Appeal Boards. The appeal criteria are set out in the published staffing arrangements.</p></reply>

The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement and cannot be imposed on suppliers or contractors.</p>  <p>  It differs from the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis. The Low Pay Commission was established to annually assess the appropriate level of the National Minimum Wage. The national minimum hourly rate of pay increased on January 1st 2016 following Government acceptance of the Low Pay Commission recommendation of July 2015.</p>  <p>  Separately, wage rates and other conditions of employment are provided for in Employment Regulation Orders for the Contract Cleaning and Security sectors.</p></reply>

Under regulation 5(1) a person who registered with Irish Water, as required under section 5(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Water Services Act 2014, on or before 30 June 2015 was eligible to receive the grant in 2015 if they were normally resident at the principal private residence on that date.  I have no proposals to amend the regulations which governed the 2015 Water Conservation Grant scheme. There is no direct relationship between payment of domestic water charges and eligibility for the Water Conservation Grant. The grant is funded by the Exchequer and is a payment to all eligible households, including non-Irish Water customers, to promote water conservation in the home.</p><p>If a customer does not pay their water charges, late payment provisions automatically apply, unless the customer enters into a payment plan. In the case of a One Adult Household (capped at &euro;160), &euro;30 will be added to any bill where outstanding payments equate to the total annual payment and remain unpaid for 3 months or more. An additional &euro;30 will be added on every anniversary of the original add on date while the bill remains unpaid or a payment plan has not been entered into with Irish Water. In the case of a Two Adult Household (capped at &euro;260), &euro;60 will be added and again at each anniversary.  The late payment charges will only apply where someone is in arrears for more than 12 months and has not entered into a payment plan with Irish Water.  Payment plans will be developed based on an ability to pay and it is important to note that the late payment charges are focused on those who &ldquo;will not pay&rdquo;, rather than those who cannot pay.</p><p>A range of flexible payment options are available. Irish Water will facilitate bill payment through direct debit, electronic funds transfer and payment by cash at any retail outlet with a Paypoint or Payzone sign, or at a post office where a bill can be paid in full or part payments of a minimum of &euro;5 can be made. Irish Water is also participating in the Household Budget scheme.  This facility, operated by An Post on behalf of the Department of Social Protection, provides customers with a facility to have their household utility bills and social housing rents deducted directly from their weekly social welfare payment.</p><p>Any customers who have unpaid water charges can be pursued through the Courts by Irish Water for the sums due. The Civil Debt (Procedures) Act 2015, allows creditors to apply to the Court for an order enabling either attachment of earnings or deduction form social welfare payments, as appropriate, for the purposes of enforcing debt.</p></reply>

This approach was taken in order to reduce the administrative burden for the many hundreds of community and voluntary groups registered under the scheme, who provide an excellent service for the elderly.</p>  <p>  The assessment of the tenders for this scheme, including the award of contracts, was managed separately by Pobal, an independent company, following a public advertisement on eTenders on 20 October 2014.</p>  <p>  The range of expertise and experience represented by those on the tender evaluation panel included the following - tendering and procurement, project management, business development, business management, assessment and appraisal, programme design and evaluation, economics, accountancy, financial management and analysis, as well as policy and research experience. Academic qualifications of those involved in the assessment were up to Master&rsquo;s degree level and included strategic management and innovation, social science, business studies and management.</p>  <p>  The tender was broken down into 10 regional lots to ensure that SMEs were not disadvantaged due to excessively large lot sizes. A panel of regional suppliers was contracted to provide the equipment within specified regional areas while maintaining the benefits of local service provision. In accordance with the Invitation to Tender, the maximum number of lots an interested party in their own right could apply for was three lots.</p>  <p>  In addition, it was possible for companies who tendered for three lots independently to tender for up to three other lots under a consortium arrangement. Each regional lot contains a panel of ranked suppliers. The first supplier is the supplier of choice for all local organisations in that lot unless they are unable to meet demand whereby the next ranked supplier will then be chosen to supply the equipment.</p>  <p>  The suppliers of telecare equipment under the Seniors Alert Scheme are required to communicate any changes to sub contracted parties to the tender to Pobal and this has been outlined in contracts provided to them by Pobal. I understand that, to date, no changes to sub-contracted parties initially outlined have been communicated to Pobal by suppliers ranked highest in each lot.  Supplier performance is also subject to annual review as outlined in the documentation provided that formed part of the Invitation to Tender.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Invitation to Tender, tenderers were required to provide evidence to Pobal of their status as Garda vetted, or, alternatively, commitment that such evidence would be provided if admitted to the framework agreement and before the commencement of any services.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the tender process was entirely robust.</p></reply>

The dwellings to which the Act does not apply are set out in section 3(2) of the Act, and include for example: </p>  <p>  -	a dwelling that is used wholly or partly for the purpose of carrying on a business;</p>  <p>  -	a dwelling within which the landlord also resides;</p>  <p>  -	a dwelling the subject of a tenancy the term of which is over 35 years. </p>  <p>  Where a dwelling is occupied by a person under a tenancy to which the Act does not apply or under an arrangement or agreement which is not a tenancy , such as instances where a bona fide licensing arrangement exists, the PRTB does not have any function in relation to such agreements or arrangements.     </p>  <p>  Licences are not granted to landlords.  A licence, in this context, is a private contractual matter between the parties concerned. In circumstances where it is unclear as to whether a particular rental agreement is a tenancy or a licence, the PRTB can adjudicate on the question and has done so in the past.  Where it finds that a tenancy is unregistered due to the landlord&rsquo;s wrongful claim of licence , the PRTB can serve a notice requiring registration and failure to comply is an offence.   </p>  <p>  The question of whether a particular rental agreement is a tenancy or a licence is independent of the type or nature of the development.  It is not the case, for example, that owners of multi-unit developments are automatically exempt from PRTB regulations.  Where the owner of a dwelling in a multi-unit development enters into an agreement with a person for the occupation of that dwelling , it is a private contractual matter between the parties as to whether that agreement is a licence or a tenancy.  If the agreement entered into is a tenancy agreement, then the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 applies to that agreement, unless it falls into one of the exemptions set out in section 3 of the Act.  Where the agreement entered into between the parties is a licence agreement, the Act does not apply.</p></reply>

Section 22 of the Act makes specific provision for the registration based on technical assessment of persons who had been independently performing duties commensurate with those of an architect for a period of 10 or more years in the State prior to the commencement of the Act. In 2013, in response in particular to the lower than anticipated rate of applications for registration by technical assessment, an independent review of the arrangements in place for registration was undertaken by Mr Garret <b>Fennell</b>, Solicitor.  Mr <b>Fennell</b>&rsquo;s report, which was welcomed by my Department, made a number of recommendations intended to improve and streamline the arrangements for registration.  Implementation of these recommendations, in consultation with the Architects Alliance of Ireland and others, has seen a number of reforms being implemented which include the administration of the technical assessment process on a cyclical basis where briefing, guidance and support for candidates can be administered in a structured manner; mentoring and supporting applicants; facilitating assessment based on recent projects; facilitating applicants with reassessment/reapplication (i.e. ensuring that the technical assessment procedure is not seen as a one chance only route to registration); and reviewing and simplifying guidance materials with direct input from practice-trained persons.  My Department and the RIAI, as registration body, are committed to continuing to work with the Architects Alliance of Ireland and others in this manner to achieve whatever further reasonable and practical improvements of registration arrangements can be made in the context of the <b>Fennell</b>report or otherwise.</p><p>The recent review of the building control regulations afforded the opportunity for further consideration of the matter in the context of broadening the pool of persons who may certify building works for building control purposes.  In this regard, Minister Kelly and I have both reaffirmed our commitment to continuing to work with stakeholders to identify, as an alternative to the existing technical assessment procedure, a special entry route that takes due account of the practice-trained experience and subsequent career circumstances of such candidates for registration.</p></reply>

Decisions on all housing loan applications must be made in accordance with this statutory Credit Policy in order to ensure prudence and consistency in approaches. </p><p>All applicants must complete a housing loan application form which can be downloaded from the relevant local authority&rsquo;s website.  As part of the loan application procedure, the Housing Agency provides an underwriting and support service to all local authorities.  This shared central service processes loan applications, carries out credit checks and issues a recommendation to the local authority on each loan application in accordance with the credit policy.  The final decision on loan approval is a matter for each local authority and its credit committee on a case-by-case basis.  Accordingly, the local authority issues the loan and the Housing Agency provides an underwriting and support service to the local authority during the loan application process.</p><p>To ensure effective targeting of limited resources, local authority loan finance continues to be available to first time buyers only.  The Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012 are kept under constant review.  There are no plans, at this time, to alter the Regulations in this regard.  The option currently available for non-first time buyers is to seek home loan facilities from one of the commercial lending institutions.</p></reply>

In the context of the development of second cycle River Basin Management Plans in Ireland it is intended that there will be a single national River Basin District (RBD) for the second cycle (resulting from a merger of the Eastern, South Eastern, South Western, Western and Shannon River Basin Districts) and that also a single administrative area will be established for the purpose of coordinating water management with authorities in Northern Ireland for the North Western and Neagh Bann International RBDs.  The technical analysis and planning tasks are being advanced on the basis of the appropriate water or catchment management units as defined by the Environmental Protection Agency.  Both jurisdictions are also keen to assist the further development of River Trusts and to continue to build on the success of on-going and previous initiatives to assist River Trusts in cross border areas.</p><p>In relation to public water and wastewater services, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels for public water services including the delivery of water services capital infrastructure. </p><p>I understand that Irish Water is participating in a joint application with Northern Ireland Water for funding for cross-border initiatives covering water and wastewater services under the EU's Interreg programme.  The funding of such proposals is a matter in the first instance for Irish Water.  Two joint applications are being developed, one water resources project which will address micro-pollutant in cross-border drinking water catchments and one addressing wastewater compliance towards achieving the Water Framework Directive objectives for Lough Foyle.  Both proposals are in the application phase at this stage. </p><p>For further information on this matter and other aspects of capital investment, Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives and has contacted all Oireachtas members to provide details of an improved level of service which it is aiming to provide.  The team can be contacted via email to or by telephone on a new dedicated number, 1890 578 578.</p><p>As regards rural water, my Department's rural water investment programme supports the delivery of quality water services in rural communities.  The selection and prioritisation of group water and sewerage schemes is a matter in the first instance for local authorities. </p><p>Earlier this month, my Department wrote to local authorities advising them of the new approach to the funding of group water and sewerage schemes for 2016 and beyond.  This will ultimately lead to the development of appropriate prioritised lists of schemes for funding and a series of demonstration projects which will assist in further evolving the programme of investment.  Details of the new multi-annual programme are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>It is now a matter for local authorities to decide on the prioritised list of group water and sewerage schemes to be funded in their respective areas and to submit their funding applications for the period 2016 to 2018 to my Department by 29 January 2016.  Allocations for funding under the new multi-annual programme will be provided to local authorities in due course and following consideration of authorities' bids for funding.</p></reply>

A number of important measures have been taken already aimed at improving housing viability and increasing supply.  The Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, which commenced in September 2015, introduced a number of reforms in relation to, inter alia, Part V of the Planning and Development Acts; the retrospective application of reduced development contributions; and the introduction of a vacant site levy.</p><p>These measures were introduced to incentivise the development of vacant and underutilised sites for housing and regeneration purposes.  Together, these legislative provisions are aimed at putting in place structural reforms of planning and land development processes that will support an increase in the output of housing to meet the needs of everyone in Ireland  . </p><p>Given that these measures will take time to fully impact on supply, the Government agreed a comprehensive suite of shorter-term measures to improve the operation of the private rental sector and stimulate increased housing supply, as set out in the document <i>Stabilising Rents, Boosting Supply</i>(November 2015).</p><p>Details of the full package of rent stability and housing supply measures are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p>.</p><p>I have enacted two major pieces of legislation to put the key elements of <i>Stabilising Rents, Boosting Supply</i>on a statutory footing, namely:</p><p>-The Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2015, which strengthens the status of aspects of planning guidelines issued to local authorities on planning matters to ensure their consistent application, particularly in relation to Apartment Standard Guidelines.  It also streamlines the process for the making of modifications to Strategic Development Zoneplanning schemes; and;</p><p>-The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015, which provides for an increased rent review period from one to two years; increased notice periods for rent reviews and greater protections for both tenants and landlords.  These measures will bring much-needed stability to the rental sector pending the coming on-stream of the supply of new housing.</p><p>Cognisant of the difficulty faced by some households in accessing the housing market, an affordable rental pilot scheme was announced as part of Budget 2016 with &euro;10 million being made available to fund a pilot in 2016.  This will be an on-going annual commitment to secure a long- term increase in the supply of affordable properties to meet the needs of those households that would struggle to make rental payments under present market conditions.</p><p>The pilot Scheme is expected to work on the basis of tenants paying the majority of the rental cost from their own resources, with the State helping to meet the shortfall.  It is intended that the scheme would be made available to employed low to moderate income households together with being a possible support option for some households who qualify for social housing support.  Details of the Scheme are currently being finalised in my Department.</p><p>In addition, NAMA is aiming to deliver a target of 20,000 residential units before the end of 2020 with 90% of these units to be in the greater Dublin area, with approximately 75% of the units being starter homes.</p><p>The approach taken by Government is a comprehensive one and I am committed to doing all that it is possible to overcome the difficulties faced by households in accessing the housing marketso that every household will have access to secure, good quality housing suited to their needs at an affordable price in a sustainable community.</p></reply>

In addition to these engagements, my Department is in touch with local authority counterparts on a weekly basis, if not indeed more frequently at times.  My Department has also organised multiple information events for Local Authority Housing personnel, covering issues such as: targets under the Strategy; the Local Authority perspective on Social Housing; what makes a good Scheme; project appraisal; social housing delivery options; the Social Housing Proposals Clearing House.   </p>  <p>  A Local Authority Directors of Housing Network has been established, the Chair of which appraises the Network of the latest updates from the Project Board and the Oversight Group established to drive implementation of the Strategy.  My Department has also undertaken a number of seminars for Elected Council Members, through the Association of Irish Local Government, in relation to the objectives of the Strategy, with regard to both social housing delivery and the broader reform agenda. </p>  <p>  I recognise that on-going and open communication between the various stakeholders, in particular between my Department and local authorities, is key to this Strategy&rsquo;s success and therefore such communication will continue to be maintained, via the governance structures of the Social Housing Strategy and well as through other less formal information and networking events.   </p>  <p>  Of course the capacity of local authorities to deliver social housing is not limited to its executive.  Local authority elected members must support social housing provision on the ground and particularly through the Part 8 planning process.  I would urge all Deputies to be aware of the social housing programme in their local areas and to ensure that the local authority is supported to deliver it.   </p></reply>

To this end, local authorities have been given substantial powers under the Act in relation to any such sites, including powers to require specified measures to be taken in relation to a derelict site, to impose a levy on sites which are included in the local authority&rsquo;s derelict sites register, or to compulsorily acquire any derelict site.  It is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas.</p>  <p>  The administration of the legislation at local level, including the setting of deadlines on local issues, is a matter for the relevant local authority.  My Department updates, on an annual basis, a Schedule of Urban Areas designated by local authorities as areas in which the derelict site levy can be applied in line with the provisions of the Act.  The latest update of this Schedule (for 2015) is presently being compiled. </p>  <p>  Derelict sites throughout the State continue to remain a focus for my Department, and a suite of measures have been introduced by the Government to support town and village renewal in general on an on-going basis. I refer the Deputy to the reply to his Topical Interest Debate on 11 November 2015 on this matter, and also to the replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos 221, 222, 223 of 10 December 2015.     </p>  <p>  I am confident that the range of measures which is now available to local authorities and communities will assist in providing a much-needed impetus towards revitalising our main urban centres as well as our rural towns and villages in the coming years so that they are better positioned to take advantage of the upturn in our economy.  </p></reply>

However there are conditions attached to such activity and penalties for their contravention which are set out respectively in sections sections 131 and 173 of the Fisheries Act of 1959.  I am advised that, on request from a landowner, Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) will discuss their requirements and/or concerns to assist in seeking to ensure there is no inadvertent contravention of the relevant statutory requirements by any landowner.  In this regard a landowner should contact the local IFI Office.  I am also advised that there are locations where the requirements of EU Habitats Directive, in respect of certain species and their habitat, would apply and IFI would also be happy to offer guidance on this issue.</p>  <p>  It is imperative for the landowner to ensure that all the appropriate statutory provisions can be met before contemplating the commencement of any works and IFI can advise and assist in this regard for the benefit of the landowner. </p>  <p>  In addition to statutory requirements,  it would be important that consideration be given by landowners to the potential impact of any proposed works on adjoining lands and property.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the sale, the owners are obliged to continue to operate the refinery for a minimum of fifteen years, a commitment which remains in place until July 2016.  That commitment is not affected by the planned sale.</p>  <p>  The owners of the refinery, Phillips 66, advised my Department in October that they were putting the Whitegate refinery up for sale and indicated their intention to market it for sale as an operational refinery.  A refinery sale would be a commercial matter between Phillips 66 and a potential purchaser.  As this process is underway Whitegate will continue to be operated on a business as usual basis.  I updated Government on the matter last month. </p>  <p>  The Government views the continued operation of the Whitegate refinery on a commercial basis as highly desirable from an energy security and economic perspective.  Security of supply remains a fundamental tenet of our energy policy and our overarching strategic energy security objectives are set out in the White Paper &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future&rdquo; published on 16 December last. </p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty, which meet the defined eligibility criteria.  The homes of the scheme beneficiaries are retrofitted free of charge, thus making those homes more energy efficient.  The retrofit measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation.   Since the commencement of the scheme in 2000, 119,701 homes around the country have received energy efficiency measures at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;154.9m. &euro;16.5m has been allocated to the scheme for 2016.  Demand for this scheme remains very strong, clearly demonstrating its potential to continue to deliver energy efficiency gains and related benefits, such as reduced energy costs and better health outcomes. </p>  <p>  The measures currently supported are those that can deliver the most energy savings at the lowest cost to the greatest number of homes.  This is why cavity wall insulation is the measure typically offered under this scheme; in a very small number of exceptional circumstances other measures, such as internal dry lining or external cladding of the walls, are provided. </p>  <p>  There is clear evidence that delivering energy efficiency improvements remains the best method of combating energy poverty, which is a Government priority.  Therefore, I will continue to ensure that improving the energy efficiency of homes of those vulnerable to energy poverty remains central to Ireland&rsquo;s Better Energy Programme.  This will be set out in detail in a new strategy on energy poverty which I will be publishing in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.  The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services.  These very significant investments represent a step change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>On the 22 December 2015, I formally launched the procurement process for the State Intervention to provide high quality, high speed broadband to all premises in Ireland that may not be served through commercial investment.  The formal procurement commenced with the publication of the Project Information Memorandum and the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire.  In addition, my Department also published:</p><p>- the National Intervention Strategy &ndash; updated in December 2015, which takes account of responses to the public consultation which took place in July 2015 and subsequent expert analysis; and</p><p>- the High Speed Broadband Map 2020 which follows ongoing engagement with industry and public consultation.</p><p>The Intervention strategy sets out a detailed service specification including a requirement that the State-funded network must be capable of delivering high-quality, high speed broadband of at least 30mbps download and 6mbps upload.  It must also be capable of catering for higher performance in the future so as to keep pace with consumer demand.  It is therefore a matter for bidders to select the technology which will show how they propose to meet these contractual requirements.</p><p>Given the quality of the services we wish to see delivered, and based on the current absence of significant fibre networks in many parts of Ireland, it is likely that fibre will play a major role in any proposed solution.  However, the technology platforms that will provide the final connectivity to the premises will be a matter for commercial operators to decide on in line with EU State Aid guidelines.</p><p>The 2020 map is available at .  The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services by the end of 2016.  The areas marked AMBER represent the target areas for the proposed State intervention and includes Beheenagh in the townlands of Knocknagashel East and West and Beheenagh (Knocknagashel).

The White Paper sets out a high-level framework for Ireland's energy transition to a low carbon economy and society and identifies a range of measures and actions to support this aim.  One key measure is the design of a new renewable electricity support scheme in 2016 for a range of renewable generation technologies.  The existing Renewable Electricity Feed-in-Tariff (REFIT) schemes closed for new applications on the 31 December 2015 and are the principal means of supporting renewable electricity generators for renewable energy exported to the grid.  These REFIT schemes have proved cost-effective and successful at incentivising increasing levels of renewable generation in the electricity sector.  The schemes support electricity generated from a range of renewable sources, including hydro, biomass and wind generation.</p><p>The first of three public consultations on the design of a new renewable electricity support scheme was published in July 2015.  The initial phase of this consultation process, which closed on 18 September 2015, was designed to review the technology options that may be supported by any new scheme.</p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  T</font>here will be two additional public consultation phases in 2016.  The second phase in the consultation process will explore the potential design options for the structure of the support scheme, while the final phase will seek feedback on the preferred design option and implementation.

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.  The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services.  These very significant investments represent a step change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>On the 22 December 2015, I formally launched the procurement process for the State Intervention to provide high quality, high speed broadband to all premises in Ireland that may not be served through commercial investment.  The formal procurement commenced with the publication of the Project Information Memorandum and the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire. In addition, my Department also published:</p><p>- the National Intervention Strategy &ndash; updated in December 2015, which takes account of responses to the public consultation which took place in July 2015 and subsequent expert analysis; and</p><p>- the High Speed Broadband Map 2020 which follows ongoing engagement with industry and public consultation. </p><p>The Intervention strategy sets out a detailed service specification including a requirement that the State-funded network must be capable of delivering high-quality, high speed broadband of at least 30mbps download and 6mbps upload.  It must also be capable of catering for higher performance in the future so as to keep pace with consumer demand.  It is therefore a matter for bidders to select the technology which will show how they propose to meet these contractual requirements.</p><p>Given the quality of the services we wish to see delivered, and based on the current absence of significant fibre networks in many parts of Ireland, it is likely that fibre will play a major role in any proposed solution.  However, the technology platforms that will provide the final connectivity to the premises will be a matter for commercial operators to decide on in line with EU State Aid guidelines.</p><p>The 2020 map is available at .  The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services by the end of 2016.  The areas marked AMBER represent the target areas for the proposed State Intervention and includes Granard in the townland of Garraneard, County Cork.  Members of the public can see whether their individual premises is in the BLUE or AMBER area by inserting their Eircode, and/or address, or scrolling through the map.</p><p>The Government is determined to ensure that the network is built out as quickly as possible and engagement with industry stakeholders has indicated that this could be achieved within 3-5 years of the contract award.</p><p>In this context, the NBP proposes that through the combination of commercial investment and State intervention, 85% of addresses in Ireland will have access to high speed services by 2018, with all addresses passed by 2020.</p><p>More generally, I am informed by the commercial operators that next generation broadband services have been rolled out to over 126,000 premises to date in County Cork with over 55,600 more expected to be serviced by commercial investment.  Almost 86,000 remaining premises in Cork will be covered either by further commercial investment or the proposed State intervention.</p></reply>

It is widely recognised that solar photovoltaic (PV) technology has become more cost competitive for electricity generation, not only compared with other renewables but also compared with conventional forms of generation.  The deployment of solar in Ireland has the potential to contribute to our renewable energy targets and is one of the technologies being considered in the context of the new support scheme for renewable electricity generation which is expected to be available towards the end of 2016.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) provides supports for the use of solar thermal heating technology to both large industry and SMEs.  Households can also avail of grant support for investment in renewable energy installations, including solar thermal, under the Better Energy Homes Scheme.  In addition, the current tax-based support incentives include the Employment and Investment Incentive Scheme which allows individual investors to obtain income tax relief on investments in renewable energy in each tax year.  An Accelerated Capital Allowance scheme also allows companies to offset the cost of investment in qualifying renewable energy generation technologies, against their tax liabilities in year 1 rather than over a more prolonged period, thus aiding their cash flow.</p><p>With regard to additional measures that may support more solar PV and solar thermal technology, my Department launched two public consultations in 2015 on the development of a new renewable heat incentive (RHI) support scheme and a renewable electricity support scheme (RESS).  The initial phase of the consultation closed on 18 September 2015 and was designed to review the technology options that may be supported by any new incentive scheme.  Solar energy (<font color="#0D0D0D">both </font>photovoltaic<font color="#0D0D0D"> and thermal) were identified as potential renewable generation technologies that will be assessed as part of the design process for the new schemes.  T</font>here will be two additional public consultation phases in 2016 before any decision is taken on the final design of the new scheme. </p><p>The second phase of the consultations will explore the potential design options for the structure of the support schemes, while the final phase will seek feedback on the preferred design option and implementation.  These consultation phases will give all interested parties another opportunity to participate in the development of the support schemes.  All details will be advertised on the Department&rsquo;s website in 2016.</p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  It is expected that the new schemes will be announced towards the end of 2016 subject to Government approval and State aid clearance from the European Commission.</font></p></reply>

In the lifetime of this Government there have been three rounds of the SCP with &euro;133.6m allocated under the Programme in 2,633 separate grants to sports groups and organisations. The focus of the SCP is now on the drawdown of existing grants.  No decision has been made on the timing of any future rounds of the Sports Capital Programme.</p>  <p>  Under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme (LASPP) grant aid to a maximum of &euro;3.8 million is provided to local authorities towards the capital costs of the provision of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools. Since 2000, 58 projects have been or are being dealt with under the scheme, of which 50 have been completed and the remaining eight are at various stages of development.  I wish to commence the process of opening a new limited round of swimming pool allocations and I have asked my departmental officials to report back to me on this matter.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Government is investing in the development of a National Indoor Arena at the National Sports Campus in Blanchardstown. The Arena, which is scheduled for completion in November 2016, comprises a National Indoor Athletics Training Centre, a National Gymnastics Training Centre and a National Indoor Training Centre (multi-sports hall).  The arena will cater for approximately 26 national sports and as well as providing world-class indoor training facilities for Irish sport, it will allow smaller sporting bodies the potential to host their competitions at local, regional, national and international levels.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  The Local Improvement Scheme (LIS) provides funding for road and laneways that councils have not taken in charge.  That is, private roads and laneways, the maintenance and improvement of these roads is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant landowner.   The LIS for local roads remains in place but my Department does not provide a separate grant allocation towards this scheme.  Instead local authorities may use a proportion of State grant funding for LIS should they wish to do so.  </p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to revise the current arrangement.

In 2015 I changed the regulations to remove reference to the unexpired period of the previous licence.  This was necessary because the European Commission informed me that Ireland was not compliant with EU law in regard to certain categories of licence, which had to be of a fixed period specified in EU law.  Ireland was therefore required to remove reference to the unexpired period of the previous licence in some cases.  I decided to eliminate this reference for all cases in order to avoid confusion.</p></reply>

The application of a surface dressing is a maintenance treatment which is aimed at extending the life of a road pavement by sealing the road and preventing the ingress of water into the road pavement.  Because of the process involved it is suited to rural roads rather than to urban roads.</p>  <p>  In urban areas, alternative, more expensive, processes and more expensive materials need to be used.  Apart from being more expensive, these materials have a greater depth than surface dressing material (and thus strengthen the road as well as seal it).  The more built up an area is, the less likely it is that the less expensive surface dressing option can be used.  Factors such as the cost of traffic control measures, grade of bitumen emulsion used, extent of preparation works and material transportation distances will also affect costs.  It is the case, therefore, that there can be valid reasons for significant variations in costs between local authorities.  The cost of bitumen emulsion is a major factor which affects the overall cost of surface dressing across all councils each year.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that the maximum rates for surface dressing of &euro;5.50 for regional roads and &euro;4.50 for local roads work are being adhered to.  In addition, the introduction of those maximum rates has clarified the range of different treatments which local authorities were undertaking under the heading of routine maintenance (which impacted on average costs).  Because of this, the Department has been looking at the classification of works and reporting arrangements with a view to ensuring a consistent approach across local authorities, which in turn will allow for more consistent cost comparisons which are not available from historic data.  In this context, local authorities will be advised this year they can only claim for surface dressing work under the Road Maintenance grant and that other road treatments should be charged to the Restoration Improvement Grant.</p></reply>

In this regard, I wish to advise that my Department is responsible for the enforcement of the Wildlife Acts and the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 (S.I.

However, my Department carries out considerable work on control of such species in National Parks and Nature Reserves - for example, work undertaken over many years to deal with the rhododendron threat in Killarney National Park.  My Department does not have the resources required to extend such work into urban areas, or indeed the wider countryside, and is not in a position to provide dedicated funds for such work to other bodies.</p><p>The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department worked with the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) to fund and manage the <i>Invasive Species Ireland Project </i>between<i></i>2006 and 2103.  This initiative provides advice and guidance on the management of a range of invasive species, including the Japanese Knotweed.  Best Practice Management Guidelines for Japanese Knotweed have been published and can be accessed on the project website at .  These guidelines provide practical advice to persons and organisations, including local authorities, on the removal and disposal of these species.</p><p>In addition, my Department is currently supporting the development of a Japanese Knotweed protocol for Ireland.  A number of agencies, including the National Biodiversity Data Centre (NBDC), Inland Fisheries Ireland and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, are involved in drafting the protocol, which it is to be completed this year.  I am aware too that a number of local authorities are already carrying out control programmes for problem species, including Japanese Knotweed.</p></reply>

My Department itself operates a Structures at Risk Fund to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, that are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This fund, which had an allocation of &euro;624,000 in 2015, was administered through the local authorities and sought to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  A scheme for 2016, which will be delivered through the local authorities, is currently being finalised. </p>  <p>  I launched a new &euro;2 million scheme - the Built Heritage Investment Scheme - for the repair and conservation of protected structures on 21 October 2015.  This scheme will operate in 2016, via the local authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which ran in 2014.  It is expected to support a significant number of projects across the country and to create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  The scheme for this year is effectively closed as local authorities were required to submit a provisional schedule of projects to my Department by 16 December 2015.</p>  <p>  The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  For 2015, the Council administered a community based heritage grants scheme with funding of &euro;547,000 available for projects that contributed to particular heritage themes.  The Council would be able to advise if the particular structure referred to by the Deputy would be eligible for funding, now or in the future.  </p>  <p>  The remainder of my Department&rsquo;s built heritage capital budget for 2016 will be focused on the conservation and presentation of the State's heritage portfolio, which is managed by the Office of Public Works.</p></reply>

This is a matter of genuine concern to rural dwellers and farmers.I am keenly aware that we must ensure that this should not impact upon our populations of wild birds, including yellowhammers and many other species.  For that reason, any such cutting will be subject to conditions and restrictions which will be specified in regulations in relation to hedgerow husbandry, management or maintenance to protect fauna or flora.</p><p>In addition, my Department will monitor activity under the proposed new provision, and an assessment of the impacts will be carried out before any decision is taken on continuing this measure beyond the pilot phase.  In that context, my Department will work towards gathering the data required to underpin such a decision.  This will include data in regard to bird nesting, and the level and impact of cutting.</p><p>The existing provisions of section 40 of the Wildlife Acts relating to the closed period for hedge cutting are still in operation and any changes to the closed period are dependent on the passage of the Heritage Bill 2016 through the Oireachtas.</p></reply>
