    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-16a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017021600060#WRA00600"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for Partnership Government states that <i>&quot;Long durations in direct provision are acknowledged to have a negative impact on family life.  We are therefore committed to reforming the Direct Provision system, with particular focus on families and children.&quot;</i>I can therefore assure the House and the Deputy that the rights and needs of children are at the forefront of our thinking as this commitment is being delivered. </p><p>The following are some of the highlights of the services and facilities available being made available to children and families across the accommodation portfolio:-</p><p>-  Tusla and the HSE, link in with accommodation centres to provide on-site services and monitoring of children and families through Public Health Nurse and GP services, social work teams, mental health specialists and through the positive engagement of accommodation centre management teams.  </p><p>-  The Community Welfare Service of the Department of Social Protection holds clinics in many of our centres to assist families with needs which may fall to be assisted under the Exceptional Needs Payments.</p><p>-  The weekly allowance for children was increased by &euro;6 to &euro;15.10 per child in 2016 by the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>-  Children are linked in by local management to mainstream primary and post-primary schools in a like manner to the general population.  Younger children may also avail of the free ECCE pre-school placements. </p><p>-  Homework clubs are also provided at certain family centres.  The Department of Education has also made changes to allow children who are 5 years in the Direct Provision system and who have attended a minimum of five years in the Irish school system to avail of third level education.</p><p>-  RIA has a dedicated Child and Family Services Unit, whose role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers residing in the direct provision system.  It also acts as a conduit between RIA and Tusla, the latter having statutory functions in this area.  The Unit is headed up by an official seconded from Tusla who has clinical expertise in the area of child welfare and protection. </p><p>-  The Child Protection  and Welfare Policy and Practice Document in force in all accommodation centres is based on the HSE's &ldquo;Children First - National Guidelines for the protection and welfare of children.  The HSE &amp;amp; Tusla have provided 'Keeping Safe' child protection training and Designate Liaison Person Training [DLP] to each centre's Designated Liaison Persons and other staff members.  RIA has recently updated  its Child Protection Policy to include a Practice Document. Briefing sessions were held in family centres around the country for centre staff members and all other<font color="#FF0000"> </font>relevant personnel.  All staff of centres under contract to RIA are Garda vetted.</p><p>Projects are underway in my Department to ensure that all facilities for families in accommodation centres under contract to the Department are improved and enhanced to the highest possible standard. </p><p>A number of recommendations in the the McMahon report in relation to physical improvements to accommodation are being rolled out.  The following are just a few examples of the improvements either finished or in progress:-</p><p>-  The installation of residents&rsquo; kitchens in a number of accommodation centres to provide for home cooking by residents and their families;</p><p>-  The introduction of full independent living at the Mosney Accommodation centre - each family are able to select their own choice of fresh food so they may prepare meals for themselves;</p><p>-  A complete refurbishment of each accommodation unit (triple glazed windows and doors, refurbished interiors) at the Athlone Accommodation Centre;</p><p>-  Improvements to a number of outdoor playgrounds and football pitches to provide for &lsquo;all-weather&rsquo; facilities.</p><p>-  Teenage rooms in relevant centres to provide social areas for this age group.</p><p>Many of the recommendations of the McMahon report that involve structural changes/improvements are being implemented with necessary due consideration to fire safety, building regulation and planning issues.  The Reception &amp;amp; Integration Agency (RIA), in consultation with its contractors, are examining the feasibility of phasing in the re-designation of accommodation so that where possible each family has an independent living space.  The House will appreciate that such structural changes cannot be put in place overnight and will take time but I am committed to implementing the improvements.</p><p>Given the scope of the structural changes that have to be implemented, I am satisfied with the progress of such major improvements since the publication of the Agreed Programme for Partnership Government.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-16a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017021600060#WRA01000"><p>The establishment of the new Policing Authority has been both a welcome and, I think, necessary addition to the policing landscape in the State.  It has brought a dedicated layer of public accountability to the operation of policing services and <font color="#2F2F2F">it represents one of the most significant and progressive reforms to the justice sector over recent years.  Indeed, the recent transfer of the appointment function in relation to the senior ranks is a particularly important signal of this reform.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  This House recently debated the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality's Report on Garda Oversight and Accountability and I made the point during that debate that the recent changes related to policing need further time to fully embed themselves before we can fully assess the Authority&rsquo;s effectiveness.  That said, I strongly believe th</font><font color="#2F2F2F">at the Authority has made a significant impact during its first year. </font></p><p>Since its establishment, it has focused, as a matter of priority, on its functions which have statutory deadlines and reform significance.  It has met on several occasions with the Commissioner and her senior team, as a follow up on its consideration of the O&rsquo;Higgins Report and related matters.  A number of these meetings have been held in public to reassure the community about the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Areas that have been highlighted in the discussions include:</p><p>-  implementation of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;</p><p>-  review of the Garda Protected Disclosure policy;</p><p>-  plans to conduct a culture audit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;</p><p>-  corporate governance arrangements and management structures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and</p><p>-  arrangements for training and the professional development of members.</p><p>The Authority has approved a three year Strategy for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It has also determined the policing priorities for 2017 which informed the content of the recently published 2017 Policing Plan.  It has reviewed and issued recommendations on the Garda Protected Disclosure policy and also recently launched a Code of Ethics which includes standards of conduct and practice for Garda members. </p><p>In developing the legislative framework that now governs policing in the State, considerable thought was given to the Constitutional framework within which it would operate.  In this regard, it is clearly the position that the public functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na relating to policing and security are important elements within the executive power of the State and must therefore be exercised, in accordance with Article 28.2 of the Constitution, by or on behalf of the Government.  Accordingly, the provisions in the Act are designed to strike the right balance between, on the one hand, the exercise by the Policing Authority of effective and meaningful oversight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, on the other hand, the retention by Government of essential residual powers in relation to policing.  In my view, this new dispensation, although still in its early stages of development, is showing tangible results that bode well for its future. </p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">Having said that, I accept fully that we need to monitor how the new arrangements are working and, indeed, the legislation makes provision in this regard.  The Authority is required, within 2 years of its establishment to submit to the Minister for Justice and Equality a report on the effectiveness of the Authority and the adequacy of the functions assigned to it.  In addition, there is a requirement on the Minister for Justice and Equality, in consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to review the operation of the statutory provisions relating to the Authority.  That review must take place not later than 5 years after the establishment of the Authority.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">These provisions will ensure that the current Garda oversight arrangements can be kept under review in an orderly and sensible fashion.  They will also provide an appropriate mechanism whereby any amendments considered necessary to the functions of the Authority can be identified.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  While I have no plans at present to amend the legislative framework relating to the Authority, the Deputy will be aware that I have already informed the House </font>that I intend to seek Government approval shortly to prepare Heads of a Bill to amend Part 4 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which concerns the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, to improve its operation.  <font color="#2F2F2F">I expect the forthcoming changes to reflect the recommendations relating to GSOC in the Joint Committee&rsquo;s Report. </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">Finally, I want to reiterate that I and the Government are fully committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to provide a modern, efficient and accountable policing service and I have every confidence that the new structures which have been put in place are a significant contribution to that.</font></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-16a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017021600060#WRA01300"><p>Ireland signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007 and since then, successive Governments have emphasised Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to proceed to ratification as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are met.  This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention.</p>  <p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland.  Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification.</p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 completed Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on 7 December 2016 and is currently at Report Stage.  When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial.</p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and commenced Second Stage on 31 January 2017.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of Deprivation of Liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-16a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017021600060#WRA01600"><p>At the outset, can I say that I recognise that there are important issues in relation to disability on which further work is needed.  With this in mind, in mid- 2015 the Department of Justice and Equality began a consultation process with all relevant stakeholders, including the Disability Stakeholders Group, with a view to putting a new Inclusion Strategy in place. </p>  <p>  The broad and comprehensive consultation process included two rounds of public consultations during which disability organisations and service providers, individuals with a lived experience of disability had an opportunity to provide detailed input, feedback and suggestions into the Strategy.  I&rsquo;m confident that the new Strategy will make a real difference in terms of having in place a set of wide-ranging, ambitious and achievable actions.  Furthermore, the monitoring and implementation process will be fortified and tightened to ensure that Departments and agencies account for their progressing of actions at regular intervals, including through an annual implementation plan, a mid-term review, and further public consultations at the mid-term point.  I am also delighted that this time the National Disability Authority will be have a strengthened role in the monitoring and reviewing of progress.  I expect to be able to submit the final draft strategy to the Government in the coming weeks, and it will be published as quickly as possible thereafter.</p></reply>

Some &euro;4 million was provided under the Scheme, which was administered by Pobal, with a view to increasing public safety and reducing the risk of anti-social and criminal activity.  That Scheme benefitted some 45 Community CCTV projects across the State.  </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to providing investment in CCTV systems and to that end, I have secured &euro;1 million in Budget 2017 to begin a new round of community CCTV schemes in line with the Programme. </p><p>My Department is currently developing a framework for the scheme and, while applications are not being invited or considered at this time, I expect to make an announcement shortly.</p><p>In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deploys its own CCTV technology and works with<font color="#212100"> other bodies such as the National Roads Authority, Port Authorities, local authorities and private car park operators to also get access to data from their ANPR systems, as well as CCTV systems operating on the motorway network.  Under the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme, the intention is to use CCTV in new ways utilising modern technology and to expand the use of ANPR technology to allow for wider access and analysis, to identify key criminal and terrorist targets and to enhance community safety.</font></p><p>This is underpinned by significant Government investment under the Capital Plan of some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million to provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with additional high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, and motorcycles to ensure that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-16a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017021600060#WRA02700"><p>The Magdalen Laundries Restorative Justice Ex Gratia Scheme was initiated following the publication of the report in February, 2013 of an Inter-Departmental Committee set up to establish the facts of the State's involvement with the Magdalen Laundries.  It was chaired by then Senator Martin McAleese and it is commonly referred to as the McAleese report.  The material in the Report relates to 10 different institutions which were run by 4 different Orders of nuns over a period of 70 years.  Although there was no finding in the McAleese Report which indicated that the State had any liability in the matter, following the report&rsquo;s publication the Taoiseach issued a State apology to the women.  Mr. Justice Quirke was asked by the Government to make recommendations on an appropriate redress scheme for those who were in the 10 Magdalen laundries that were the subject of the McAleese Report.  The Government also included in the scheme the laundry that was attached to Stanhope Street Domestic Training School and later also decided to include a 12th institution, the Domestic Training School in Summerhill.</p>  <p>   It should be noted that the terms of the  Scheme specifically exclude institutions that are covered by the Residential Institutions Redress Board Scheme.  (The Residential Institutions Redress Board Scheme was established to provide awards for persons who, as children, were abused.) </p>  <p>  I will take this opportunity to give some background to the operation of the Scheme.  Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking into account any available records, documents and statements including the applicant's testimony.  Processing of all applications under the Scheme operates on the premise that the testimony of the applicant is correct and the officers processing the application then seek to verify the application by checking appropriate records.  If there are records and they are consistent with the application, then an offer is made.  If there is a discrepancy, or in cases where the religious congregations have an incomplete or no record for an applicant, my officials must carry out a thorough examination, checking whatever records are available from other departments, agencies and institutions to support the application.  The records of the religious congregations are not regarded as decisive; they are just one factor that is taken into consideration.</p>  <p>  The Scheme provides for lump sum payments varying from &euro;11,500 to &euro;100,000 depending on the length of stay in the institution concerned.  Further, each woman is entitled to a top-up payment to bring her weekly income from the Irish State up to the equivalent of the Irish Contributory Pension.  To date, over &euro;25 million has been paid out to 669 women under the Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act 2015 provided for certain services to be made available by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to the women.  The services, which are free of charge, include GP services, prescribed drugs, medicines, aids and appliances, dental, ophthalmic and aural services, home support, home nursing, counselling services, chiropody, podiatry and physiotherapy.  The HSE has administrative arrangements in place for health and social services for women living outside Ireland.</p></reply>

This followed a process of dialogue with the national level Traveller NGOs during 2015 which culminated in the presentation of an agreed position paper by them and confirmation that there are no legal or expenditure implications arising from such recognition.  The key point is that recognition of the distinct heritage, culture and identity of Travellers and their special place in Irish society would be hugely important to Traveller pride, to Traveller self-esteem and to overcoming the legacy of marginalisation and discrimination that the community has experienced. </p>  <p>  I have had a long standing interest in this area, most notably through my chairing of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality when it produced its report on the Recognition of Traveller Ethnicity (April 2014).  I made a presentation to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform in relation to this issue in December 2016 following which an invitation was extended to Traveller representatives to meet that Cabinet Committee to further these discussions; that latter meeting took place on 06 February 2017 and further engagement at this level is planned.

Probate functions are also carried out by County Registrars at District Probate Registries in a number of provincial court offices. </p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the current waiting times in the Probate Office in Dublin for Grants of Representation are 20 weeks for applications lodged by a solicitor and 28 weeks for personal applications. </p>  <p>  Where a person elects to apply for a Grant without the assistance of a solicitor the process requires significant support from the Probate Office and is more resource intensive.  The Probate Office is actively involved in preparing the necessary paperwork and in servicing queries from the applicants by way of telephone, e-mail or post.  Each personal applicant is required to attend at the Probate Office in person by prior appointment to complete the application process.</p>  <p>  All applications for Grants of Representation in deceased persons' estates are made on foot of a number of mandatory legal documents which must be furnished by the applicants and these require detailed checking by the Probate Office to ensure that the estate of the deceased person is administered correctly and in accordance with the law.  All applications are assessed on the basis of the date on which they are lodged, an approach which provides fairness and equity to all applicants.  Priority is given to probate applications which display a particular urgency or where it is considered that extenuating circumstances so warrant.  In such circumstances it is open to applicants to bring the matter to the attention of the Probate Office.  </p>  <p>  The Courts Service also informed me that there have been a number of staff changes in the Probate Office during the last year due to retirement and promotion and this has impacted on the waiting times.  The examination of probate applications requires a thorough legal examination of documents and it takes a new staff member a period of at least six months to acquire a satisfactory knowledge in this area.  As new staff members become more proficient, the waiting times will reduce. </p>  <p>  The backlogs in the probate system are a cause for concern and review of the probate system is being carried out at present.  It is anticipated that a report with recommendations for the modernisation of the process will be presented by mid 2017 to the Senior Management Team of the Courts Service and to the Courts Service Board for their consideration.</p></reply>

This was superseded by the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) which allows for Syrians and other nationalities to benefit from resettlement and relocation schemes, and offers them protection in Ireland in their own right.  This is a much improved programme allowing thousands to benefit from protection here.  There has been a significant challenge at EU level to maximise the functioning of the resettlement and relocation programmes.  We will be 100% ahead of target on resettlement when the programme ends next September and following my recent visit to Greece, I am satisfied that the number coming in under relocation will ramp up to agreed levels in 2017. </p>  <p>  I am not of the view that the best solution to this crisis is to increase the number of programmes and all the administrative and legal complexities that go with them.  My emphasis is to increase the number of people arriving in Ireland under the programmes currently in place.  I am satisfied that we are making that progress now and that there is still capacity to ensure more Syrians can come to Ireland under our resettlement and relocation programmes and all our focus needs to be on meeting these targets.  In addition, existing avenues remain open as pathways for family reunification.</p>  <p>  Significant resources are currently being invested in these humanitarian efforts through the offices of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, the Office of the Promotion of Migrant Integration and the International Protection Office.  As a result we have established and functioning mechanisms and associated expertise to deal with resettlement and relocation.  Our response to the migrant crisis in terms of accepting refugees is through the IRPP and all available resources are being directed to that Programme in order to meet the commitment entered into and I have no plans, at this point, to introduce any additional  admission programmes.  It is essential that we continue all our efforts to completing the IRPP successfully before we can look to apply that learning and resources to any new programme.</p></reply>

It allows freedom of travel between the two jurisdictions for Irish and UK citizens, and provides for largely reciprocal benefits of citizenship, in terms of entitlements to reside, work and access services.  These arrangements stem from the close historic relationship between the two countries and predate the entry of both to the EU.  The Common Travel Area is an important feature of the close relationship between Ireland and the UK with long-established benefits for trade and tourism between our two countries.  Both the Irish and British Governments value the Common Travel Area and will work to keep this in place as part of future arrangements.</p>  <p>  An extensive programme of engagement has been put in place to support this strategic objective.  The importance of the Common Travel Area has been highlighted through political and diplomatic engagement with other Member States.  There is ongoing engagement with EU institutions and there is regular contact with Michel Barnier's Commission negotiating team on the UK exit from the EU, including in relation to the specific question of the Common Travel Area.  You will also have seen the very clear commitments from the Taoiseach and Prime Minister May to maintaining its benefits into the future.  </p>  <p>  As part of the Common Travel Area arrangements, it has long been the case that Ireland and the United Kingdom cooperate closely on jointly securing the external border of the Common Travel Area.  We will continue to cooperate, and to strengthen that cooperation, in the future.  But it is also important to emphasise that Ireland of course remains a committed member of the European Union.  We will continue to uphold the right of free movement for all EU citizens after the UK leaves the Union.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Cavan/Monaghan Garda Division on the 31 December 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 318 with 14 reserves and 37 civilians.  It is important to note that all Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity whether it be in the area of drug offences or otherwise. </p>  <p>  I am further informed that the prevention and detection of drug related offences is a priority within the Cavan/Monaghan Division and that all Garda&iacute; in the Division, both uniform and detective, are engaged in intelligence-led policing and the undertaking of targeted operations against those involved in drug-related crime.  In addition, Garda personnel from the Division continue to work with the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau in this regard.  I am advised that local Garda management are satisfied that this strategy ensures the optimal use of resources in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, 838 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, including 21 to the Cavan/Monaghan Division.  I am also informed by the Commissioner that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Cavan/Monaghan Division, in the coming years. </p>  <p>  The investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the prevention and detection of all criminal activity including drug offences.</p></reply>

The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers.  The immediate objective of the revaluation programme is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in more than 150 years is conducted as soon as possible.  Following this revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area will then be carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation, in accordance with Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions and decisions with regard to the selection of rating authority areas for revaluation is his sole prerogative.  Section 19(1) of the 2001 Act empowers the Commissioner, after consultation with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the rating authority concerned, to make a Valuation Order specifying a rating authority area over which a revaluation is to be conducted.  I am advised that the revaluation programme which began with South Dublin, Fingal and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council areas has also been rolled out to the Dublin City Council area, Waterford City and County Council area and Limerick City and County Council area.</p>  <p>  The current phase of the National Revaluation Programme known as "ReVal 2017" covers revaluation of counties Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly, Kildare, Sligo, Carlow and Kilkenny for the first time since the nineteenth century.  These are the nine counties referenced in Action No. 76 in the Government's Action Plan for Rural Development "Realising Our Rural Potential", published on 23 January 2017.  The revaluation of these nine rural counties is expected to be completed in September 2017 and become effective for rates purposes from 2018 onwards.</p></reply>

On 31 December, 2016 the International Protection Act 2015 was commenced.

It is a problem solving court and makes an important contribution, not least as an alternative to prison.  The Drug Treatment Court operates on the basis that a criminal matter has not proceeded to formal conviction and the presiding Judge reviews matters at each adjournment, frequently over an extended period of time, to assess progress, before the matter before the Court is eventually finalised.

Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State by the end of 2017, 2,622 through the EU  relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, and 1,040 (519 by the end of 2016 and the remainder in 2017) under the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focussed on resettling refugees from Lebanon. </p><p>In a further gesture of humanitarian assistance towards the most vulnerable caught up in the migration crisis and following a debate in the D&aacute;il, the Government  also committed to taking up to 200 unaccompanied minors from France who were previously resident in the migrant camp at Calais.  These initiatives therefore leave just a small residual balance to be allocated from the Government decision to take 4,000 persons.</p><p><b><i>Resettlement strand of the programme</i></b></p><p>Taking account of the situation in the Middle East, and the plight of the refugees, the T&aacute;naiste announced that Ireland would accept 520 persons for resettlement over an 18-month period to the end of 2017.  This was almost double the figure proposed for Ireland by the European Commission and was delivered a year ahead of the Commission deadline.</p><p>In addition, the Government recently announced that it is extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 520 refugees from Lebanon in  2017, most of whom are of Syrian origin.  260 refugees have already been selected during a selection mission to Lebanon in October 2016 and are expected to arrive in Spring 2017.  Most of these refugees are also Syrian.  A further selection mission to Lebanon will be arranged in the coming months to select the remaining refugees due to come to Ireland in 2017 under the resettlement programme.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p><b><i>Relocation strand of the programme</i></b></p><p>Despite initial delays outside of Ireland's control in respect of the operation of the 'hotspots' on the ground in Greece, Ireland has to-date taken in a total of 320 people from Greece under relocation, another 78 people have been formally accepted and are awaiting transport arrangements, and a further 155 have been assessed and are awaiting clearance.  A monthly schedule has been agreed with the Greek authorities which will sustain the pace of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meets its commitments to Greece within the time frame envisaged by the  Programme.</p><p>As regards Italy, the relocation mechanism from Italy has yet to commence for many countries, including Ireland, due to issues with the Italian authorities surrounding the security assessment of migrants assigned to other Member States.  Intensive efforts are ongoing to resolve this, both bilaterally with Italian counterparts at official, diplomatic and Ministerial level, and at EU level, including through the European Commission.</p><p>The total target for relocation to Ireland includes a further 910 persons - the country of origin for this cohort is unassigned as yet.</p><p><b><i>Table of Total Numbers under Government Decision</i></b><table><tr><th>Relocation Strand</th><th>Numbers</th></tr><tr><td>Council Decision 2015/1523</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>Council Decision 2015/1601</td><td>2,022</td></tr><tr><td>Total Relocation</td><td>2,622</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Resettlement Strand</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Government Decision 09/06/15</td><td>520</td></tr><tr><td>Government Decision 06/07/16</td><td>260</td></tr><tr><td>Government Decision 29/11/16</td><td>260</td></tr><tr><td>Total Resettlement</td><td>1,040</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total Unaccompanied Minors Calais (Government Decision 10/11/16)</td><td>200 (up to)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mechanism as yet undecided</td><td>138</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>4000</td></tr></table></p><p><b><i>Unaccompanied minors</i></b></p><p>In announcing the IRPP, the Government recognised the importance of prioritising family groups and addressing the position of unaccompanied children.  A significant number of those who have arrived to date are young children with one or two parents.  Ireland has taken in four unaccompanied minors with another to follow very shortly; we have indicated our willingness to take further unaccompanied minors from Greece under relocation and work continues in this regard.  Such minors are placed in the care of Tusla.  Unaccompanied minors that Ireland takes from Greece are additional to the commitments made by Ireland in respect those previously resident in the migrant camp in Calais.</p><p>In summary, under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme 519 refugees have arrived in Ireland under resettlement and 320 persons have arrived in Ireland under relocation.  I wish to confirm to the Deputy the deep commitment of the Government to delivering on its decision to accept 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers, notwithstanding the difficulties that have been encountered so far which have been outside of Ireland's control.</p></reply>

Cavan in December 1972 was an appalling atrocity which claimed the lives of two innocent young people.  My heart goes out to the families who lost their loved ones in such a callous manner that day.  These unspeakable murders, like so many other acts of violence, characterised the darkest period in the modern history of this island.

This is a matter of profound regret.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the investigation into these murders remain open.  However, with the passage of over forty years and with no new evidence emerging, one would have to be cautious as to the prospect of bringing a successful prosecution.  Nonetheless, the Garda Authorities will pursue any new information or evidence that becomes available and will work with the PSNI to seek to progress the investigation where new evidence is produced.  I would call on anyone with any relevant information about this atrocity to bring it to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p><p>It is a sad fact that dealing with the legacy of the troubles on this island is very difficult and complex task.  In the Stormont House Agreement a series of useful measures were agreed to put in place an overarching framework to seek to deal with the legacy of the troubles.  The Government is fully committed to playing its part in implementing those measures and will continue to work with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland to give effect to the measures.</p></reply>

The programme is premised on the key requirement that applications are beneficial for Ireland, good for job creation, are in the public interest and that the funds invested are legally acquired and owned by the investor (i.e. not borrowed).  It is also essential that applicants be of good character.  In return the investor applicant and their immediate family members are granted rights of residence in the State which will allow them to enter the State on multi-entry visas and to remain here for an initial period of 2 years, renewal for a further 3 years, subject to certain criteria being met (i.e. that (i) the investment has not been withdrawn, (ii) they continue to be law abiding and self sufficient). </p><p>All applications under the Immigrant Investor Programme are considered on their merits by an independent Interdepartmental Evaluation Committee who have the requisite skills and experience to evaluate the applications.  The membership comprises of officials from the IDA; Enterprise Ireland; Department of Finance; Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade; Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation, and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (which also provides the administrative assistance to the Committee).  </p><p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department that, since the programme commenced, a total of 380 applications have been approved, resulting in an Investment of approximately &euro;142 million.  A breakdown by year is as follows:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Applications Approved</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>273</td></tr></table></p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that significant take-up of the programme commenced in 2015, with a greatly accelerated pace in 2016, when some 273 applications or 72% of all applications were approved in that year alone.  It is not possible to identify with any degree of certainty the number of jobs created, as not all projects create jobs directly; this was particularly the case in the early years of the programme, where funds were for mixed investments or for investment bonds (these options were suspended in July 2016).  The Deputy might also note that some 250 of the 273 projects approved in 2016, have only received that approval very recently.  </p><p>When the programme was introduced in 2012, the original level of investment required was &euro;1 million.  This was reduced to &euro;500,000 to stimulate interest in the programme.  In total 450 IIP applications have been made since April 2012, with some 40 % being submitted between July and November 2016.  This upsurge in applications was considered by the independent Evaluation Committee who recommended the restoration of the minimum investment threshold to its original level.  I approved this course of action having brought the matter to the attention of my Cabinet colleagues.  This change has had no adverse effect to date on the value of applications received in respect of the 2017 application process.  An economic evaluation of the programme has commenced. </p></reply>

Any such proposal could give rise to very large, unpredictable and potentially very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services.  Furthermore, there may well be significant implications for the operation of the Common Travel Area, particularly, in the context of Britain withdrawing from the European Union.  Any proposal in this regard would have to be very carefully considered.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>At the European level, Ireland together with the other Member States of the European Union has committed under the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum agreed at the European Council in October 2008 &quot;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&quot;.  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases. </p><p>It should be remembered that people usually become undocumented through their own conscious actions or omissions.  It is always open to persons in an undocumented situation to present their case, or that of their children, on its individual merits to the immigration authorities.  Such cases would be carefully considered before a decision is made and it is reasonable for the State to expect that the affected persons would respect that decision.</p></reply>

The first 3 years will focus on aspects of domestic violence to be followed by 3 years dealing with sexual violence.  However, elements of each type of violence will feature in both phases of the campaign.  My Department is currently evaluating the first phase of the campaign on domestic violence.  I can assure the Deputy that evaluation will be an ongoing process and will help to inform the development of a suitable theme, in due course, for the latter 3 years dealing with sexual violence.</p></reply>

The majority of the Legal Aid Board&rsquo;s income comes from a grant from my Department, which this year is just under &euro;39 million.  Other sources of income include costs recovered from the other party to a dispute (where costs are awarded in favour of the legally aided person), costs recovered from legally aided persons (where property is preserved or recovered on that person&rsquo;s behalf in the course of legal proceedings), and contributions paid by legally aided persons.</p>  <p>  Applicants for civil legal aid and advice are required to meet both the merits test and the financial eligibility criteria under section 29 of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 and the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 to 2016.  The vast majority of applicants granted legal aid and advice, including those seeking legal services in connection with domestic violence remedies, are also required to pay some contribution.  The minimum amount is &euro;30 for legal advice and a minimum of &euro;130 applies for legal aid (which includes the advice contribution already paid).  The amount of the contribution depends on a person&rsquo;s income and assets.  It should be noted that aid contributions in respect of domestic violence cases in the District Court are capped at a maximum of &euro;417. However, the majority of applicants for legal aid in connection with domestic violence reliefs pay the minimum contribution.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will wish to note that Section 29 (2) (b) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 (as amended by Section 80 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008) provides that the Legal Aid Board may waive any contribution payable or accept a lower contribution on the grounds that a failure to do so would cause undue hardship to the applicant.  The Legal Aid Board has put in place guidelines for its decision makers in relation to applications for a waiver of contributions.  The guidelines provide for a sympathetic approach to be taken to applications for a waiver in cases where the application is in connection with a domestic violence matter and the person&rsquo;s sole source of income is social welfare.  In such circumstances a decision maker may decide to waive the aid contribution so that the person will only pay the advice contribution of &euro;30.</p>  <p>  The Board received approximately &euro;1,557,855 in client contributions in 2016.  The amount of client contribution in 2016 in respect of domestic violence cases is estimated at &euro;177,076, &euro;38,699 of which was waived.  The amount of &euro;138,377 received represents just under 9% of the total contributions received.</p>  <p>  The Board has a policy role in relation to the provision of civil legal aid and periodically it brings proposals to my Department in relation to the financial eligibility and other criteria in relation to civil legal aid.  I understand that the Legal Aid Board are to consider in due course making proposals in relation to revising the financial eligibility criteria for civil legal aid.</p></reply>

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits, 300 Reserves, and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy notes there has been a substantial reduction in the strength of the Reserve in recent years from a peak of 1,164 in 2013 to 695 currently.  The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways - firstly close to 200 serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointment Service have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last three years. </p>  <p>  Now that the recruitment process for trainee Garda&iacute; has been bedded down and is producing a continuous pipeline of new recruits for the Garda College, work is underway on the development of multi-annual plan with the objective of recruiting and training 300 new Reserves annually starting this year, to bring the strength of the Reserve up from its current strength to 2,000 by 2021.  In this regard Garda management in conjunction with my Department is engaging with the Public Appointments Service in relation to the timing of a fresh recruitment drive for the Reserve.  </p></reply>

Community policing provides a means of recognising that every community, both urban and rural, has its own concerns and expectations.  The Programme for Government commits the Government to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing in every community, including the most minimal response times possible. </p>  <p>  With this in mind, I can confirm that I have asked the Policing Authority to oversee a review of, among other things, the dispersal of Garda stations in rural areas.  I understand that the Authority has, in accordance with section 117(2) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, formally requested the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to examine the dispersal and use of resources available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities and to make recommendations to provide a more effective, visible and responsive policing service.  The Authority has informed the Inspectorate that the review should take account of: </p>  <p>  - the changing environments in rural, developing urban and suburban areas; </p>  <p>  - the views of local communities; </p>  <p>  - the allocation to and deployment of Garda resources at the local policing level, including the use of the Garda Reserve, Garda facilities and Garda equipment; and </p>  <p>  - relevant recommendations made in previous Inspectorate reports.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the Garda Commissioner is primarily responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources available to her.  This includes responsibility for the formulation of proposals in relation to the geographical boundaries of Garda districts and the opening and closing of Garda Stations, taking into account crime trends and policing priorities, so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that I have requested the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions in relation to the distribution of Garda resources in the State, to identify 6 stations for reopening on a pilot basis in line with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  This pilot scheme is intended to feed into the wider review being overseen by the Policing Authority.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. </p><p>I am further informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Mayo Division, on the 31 December 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available was 300.  There are also 23 Garda Reserves and 34 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and the Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.

I am also informed by the Commissioner that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including Mayo, in the coming years.</p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that over 520 new vehicles were purchased and allocated for use in 2016. In addition, some 200 vehicles were purchased for allocation and use in 2017.  This will be supplemented by funding of some &euro;4 million which is available for new vehicles in 2017.  The investment in the Garda fleet will continue to provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with additional high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, and motorcycles to ensure that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime. </p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that the needs of all Garda  Divisions including Mayo are considered when allocation vehicles across the Divisions.

While noting the positive benefits to society of the interconnected digital world in which we live, the report also noted the negative aspects and the emerging trend to engage in online communications that cause significant harm to others. </p><p>In December 2016, the Government gave its approval for the drafting of a General Scheme of a Bill which would provide for new and amended criminal offences along the lines set out in that report.  It is intended that this Bill will address the criminal law aspects of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report.  The Commission has proposed extending some existing offences and creating some new criminal offences.  The precise formulation of the offences will be subject to review and potential variation during the drafting of the General Scheme.</p><p>Child sexual exploitation often occurs following a gradual process of grooming the victim.  This may arise through seemingly innocent contact made via information and communication technology such as social media, messaging apps or online forums.  This type of technology can also be used to expose children to sexually explicit and inappropriate material.  The Deputy will be aware that the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill includes a number of measures to significantly strengthen existing criminal law in combating child exploitation and, in particular, address the use of modern communication technologies as a tool which may lead to child sexual exploitation.  The Bill completed its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas earlier this week.</p><p>Hotline.ie provides the public with the means to report illegal online content, such as child sexual abuse material and liaises with An Garda Siochana, as appropriate, to have illegal content is taken down. </p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has an arrangement in place with a large internet service provider to block access to child sexual abuse content in accordance with a list they provide.  Among the aims of this initiative is to reduce inadvertent viewing by members of the public, including children, of this illegal material.  An Garda Siochana also has a Schools Programme where personal safety issues, including online safety, are highlighted and discussed with children and young people in schools.</p><p>In order to assist the public to stay safe on the internet, the Office for Internet Safety in my Department has a series of booklets aimed at parents.  The booklets provide information on various aspects of internet safety including filtering, using social networking sites and cyberbullying.  These information resources are made available free of charge on the Office for Internet Safety website and also in hard copy on request.  The website also contains a wide range of information and links to further resources on internet safety.  Ireland also cooperates at an international level to keep children and young people safe online, with the Office for Internet Safety acting as coordinator for the Irish consortium under the EU Internet Safety Programme and channels EU funding to four partner organisations.</p></reply>

The counsel appointed to the panel were nominated by the Attorney General and were all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.</p>  <p>  The complaints were in the form of letters, some of which were sent by the individuals direct, while others had been submitted through intermediaries, such as TDs or representative organisations.  In some, but not all cases, the complainants gave the name of the Member, or Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that were the subject of their complaint. </p>  <p>  Recommendations by counsel were based on a review of the papers in the complaint, and did not involve interviews or interaction with complainants or any other form of investigation, although counsel could where necessary recommend that I seek further information from persons or bodies, for example the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC).  Each case was considered on its own merits and recommendations were made in relation to each case. </p>  <p>  The Panel was independent and therefore no restriction was placed on the nature of recommendations which they might make.  I have repeatedly emphasised that the Independent Review Mechanism was not established to act as a Commission of Inquiry or Investigation.  The purpose of the review was to triage the complaints to establish in each particular case whether there was any action which I could take to further resolution of that complaint.  Counsel were therefore required to consider the matters raised by each complainant and any corroboration offered by them, to take into account the actions already taken in relation to the complaint, and the possible options open to me as Minister to pursue matters.  Counsel were then required to use their knowledge and experience of the criminal law to recommend whether further action was either possible or appropriate and if so to recommend the relevant action that I could take.</p>  <p>  Insofar as GSOC is concerned, GSOC is an independent statutory body and I have no role in relation to the conduct of its investigations.</p></reply>

Under this decision a programme office was established in my Department to oversee the operational aspects of the programme, which aims to bring in 4,000 vulnerable migrants to Ireland under two different mechanisms, refugee resettlement - operated by the Office for Promotion of Migrant Integration (OPMI) - and asylum seeker relocation from within the EU.  </p>  <p>  We will be 100% ahead of target numbers on the Resettlement Programme by next September.  While there has been challenges at EU level to maximise the functioning of the Relocation aspect of the programme, following my recent visit to Greece, I am satisfied that the numbers coming in under relocation will ramp up to agreed levels in 2017.  My emphasis currently is to increase the number of people arriving in Ireland under the mechanisms currently in place.  I am satisfied that we are making that progress now to ensure many more people can come to Ireland under our resettlement and relocation programmes.  We must focus all our attention to meeting these targets and their needs when they arrive here.  </p>  <p>  Significant resources are currently being invested in these humanitarian efforts through the various offices in my Department and in other Departments and agencies.  As a result we have established functioning mechanisms and associated expertise to deal with resettlement and relocation.  Our response to the migrant crisis in terms of accepting refugees is through the IRPP and all available resources are being directed to that Programme in order to meet the commitment entered into.  It is essential that we continue our efforts to complete the IRPP successfully before we look to apply that learning and resources to any expansion of our current commitments.</p></reply>

This number rises and falls as some residents are granted a form of status and others with status move into the community.  Over 1,900 persons left the State provided accommodation system during 2016.  However, it is important to note that not all those leaving State provided accommodation would have done so because they received a form of status.  The State provided accommodation system is entirely voluntary and some of those leaving the system were exercising their right to live elsewhere.</p><p>The issues identified in the Irish Refugee Council's Report echo findings of the McMahon Working Group Report.  Following on from the McMahon report, the Department of Justice and Equality developed a guide to independent living for persons with status to provide practical assistance for them.  The guide is available in all centres and has been published on the RIA website (<i>www.ria.gov.ie)</i>in a number of different languages.  This was published in parallel with information sessions coordinated by the Citizens Information Bureau in accommodation centres which gave an opportunity for such persons to seek assistance and clarification on the services provided.  The Reception &amp;amp; Integration Agency (RIA), its centre managers, the Community Welfare Service (by way of provision of Rent Allowance), the Citizens Information Board and those City and County Councils operating the Housing Assistance Payments link with such persons in accessing the appropriate supports and services, including in respect of sourcing and securing private accommodation.</p><p>Following a recent call for proposals under the Asylum Migration and Integration Fund, a number of charities and NGOs have been awarded funding for projects with the specific aim of providing assistance to those transiting from state provided accommodation to permanent homes in the community.  </p><p>Once some form of status is granted, residents cease to be ordinarily entitled to the accommodation supports provided through RIA.  Notwithstanding this fact, RIA has continued to provide such persons with accommodation until they secure their own private accommodation. </p></reply>

The Irish Prison Service has access to a limited number of places in the Central Mental Hospital for prisoners who require residential mental health treatment.  There is currently an average of 20 prisoners each week awaiting transfer to the Central Mental Hospital.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service, in collaboration with the National Forensic Mental Health Service, has established two dedicated areas where high support is provided to vulnerable prisoners with mental illness: D2 wing in Cloverhill Prison (for remand prisoners), and the High Support Unit in Mountjoy (for sentenced prisoners).  Both units provide a dedicated area within the prison where mentally ill and vulnerable prisoners, who present with a risk of harm to self or to others, can be separated from the general prison population and are closely monitored in a safer environment.</p>  <p>  A Psychiatric In-reach and Court Liaison Service is delivered by the Health Service Executive/Central Mental Hospital at Cloverhill Prison.  The diversion system ensures as far as possible that those people presenting before the courts, or indeed at an earlier stage of the criminal justice system, where the infraction is a reflection of an underlying mental illness, are referred and treated appropriately.  This approach has reduced the number of mentally ill people committed to prison.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive has confirmed that approval has been granted for the appointment of a consultant led team to both Limerick and Cork prisons.  The Health Service Executive has also advised that arrangements are being finalised for the assignment of a consultant led mental health in-reach team to Castlerea Prison.  The National Forensic Mental Health Service also provides an assessment and liaison service for all other prisons where a prisoner requires a forensic assessment, or access to an admission bed in the Central Mental Hospital.  Consultant Forensic Psychiatrists are leading these services and can be supported by Non-Consultant Hospital Doctors, Community Psychiatric Nurses, and Social Workers.</p></reply>

The Programme, which seeks to bring in 4,000 migrants to the State, comprises two main strands - asylum seeker relocation and refugee resettlement.  The Deputy's questions refer specifically to the relocation mechanism, which is underpinned by two EU Council Decisions,  EU/2015/1523 and EU/2015/1601 established to assist Italy and Greece who have struggled to cope with the numbers arriving on their shores due to the migration crisis.  Ireland voluntarily opted into both Council Decisions and agreed under the provisions of same to take a total of 2,622 persons - 623 from Italy, 1,089 from Greece, and 910 from a Member State yet to be determined by the Council (either Italy or Greece).  </p><p>The remainder of the 4,000 are being taken into the State through a combination of refugee resettlements from Lebanon and, for example, the acceptance into the State of unaccompanied minors formerly resident at the migrant camp at Calais, France (approved by Government Decision last November).</p><p>The relocation programme is on schedule in terms of the numbers currently assigned to Ireland from Greece, with all 1,089 expected to either have already arrived, or have been assessed and accepted for arrival by the end of September 2017.  There has been a total of 10 missions to Greece to carry out needs assessments, security assessments and provide orientation to those selected for relocation to Ireland.  From these 10 missions a total of 320 people have arrived from Greece under relocation so far, another 78 people have been formally accepted and are awaiting transport arrangements, and a further 155 have been assessed and are awaiting clearance.  A monthly schedule has been agreed with the Greek authorities which will sustain the pace of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meets its commitments to Greece within the time frame envisaged by the Programme.<b></b></p><p>The number of officials travelling on each mission depends to a large extent on the numbers to be assessed, however current missions assess an average of 80 persons at a time and this number typically requires three IRPP officials, three members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, where unaccompanied minors are to be interviewed, two officials from Tusla - the Child and Family Agency.</p><p>As regards Italy, the relocation mechanism from Italy has yet to commence for many countries, including Ireland, due to issues with the Italian authorities surrounding the security assessment of migrants assigned to other Member States.  Intensive efforts are ongoing to resolve this, both bilaterally with Italian counterparts at official, diplomatic and Ministerial level, and at EU level, including through the European Commission.</p><p>I wish to confirm to the Deputy the deep commitment of the Government to delivering on its decision to accept 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers, notwithstanding the difficulties that have been encountered so far which have been outside of Ireland's control.</p></reply>

Following the approval by Government of the appropriate legal mechanism and the identification of considerable resources needed, officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency and my Department  positively engaged with the French authorities in Paris in early January with a view to identifying these unaccompanied minors.  There has also been ongoing contact with the NGO sector. </p>  <p>  Subsequent to the officials meeting, the first mission to meet unaccompanied minors took place last month and included representatives of Tusla, which has statutory responsibility for the care and accommodation of unaccompanied minors in the State.  The Tusla officials were accompanied by a member of staff from the Irish Refugee Protection Programme Office of my Department and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who carried out security assessments.  Tusla has indicated that the final logistical stages of the relocation process for the first group of young people is in hand.  A second mission took place early this month and I understand that three further missions are scheduled over the next few weeks.  Although decisions regarding numbers and dates for future missions are matters for Tusla to determine in cooperation with the French authorities, I understand that initially approximately 40 young people could be identified by both the authorities and the NGO's and processed over the course of the coming months and we have committed to accept all of these on a phased basis and subject to the aforementioned security process.  The best interests of the child is central to this partnership process with the French authorities.</p></reply>

Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who joined the organisation on or after 1 April 2004 may retire on full pension once they have served at least 30 years and have reached 55 years of age.  A member has the option of continuing to serve until they reach 60 years of age subject to the Garda Commissioner being satisfied that the member is fully competent and available to undertake, and fully capable of undertaking, the duties of his or her position as a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing throughout the country in order to strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and prevent crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the College 838 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am further informed that 900 Garda are scheduled to attest this year.  This will see Garda numbers increasing to around the 13,500 mark by year end when projected retirements of in the region of 300 are taken into account.  I can assure the Deputy that projected retirements are kept under continuing review and the level of recruitment adjusted as necessary in order to achieve the desired strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, in the coming years.</p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p></reply>

Over thirty locations around the country will benefit from the Programme which includes major refurbishment of stations and facilities including facilities for meeting victims of crime, essential remedial works to existing stations, development of large scale property and exhibit management stores, the upgrade of cells and provision of improved custody management facilities.  </p>  <p>  The Programme also makes provision for new Garda stations in Glanmire, Co. Cork and at Bailieborough, Co. Cavan through direct exchequer funding and a further three new Garda stations in Sligo, Macroom and Clonmel by means of public private partnership.  In addition to the Programme, over &euro;100 million has been provided for new Divisional Headquarters in Kevin Street, Dublin and Wexford, as well as for a new Regional Headquarters in Galway.  Each of these projects are well under way and, I understand, are on track for completion this year.</p>  <p>  A considerable amount of new Garda ICT solutions has also been delivered over the past number of years.  These include the deployment of a secure national digital radio system (NDRS), the deployment and support of Garda and Community CCTV systems, an automated number plate recognition (ANPR) system and the addition of many new functions to the PULSE system, which itself is further supported by a dedicated Garda data entry service in Castlebar.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 is intended to professionalise, modernise and renew An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that the organisation can meet present and future challenges.

These specialist units also work closely with the Criminal Assets Bureau in targeting persons involved in such criminality.  All of these units operate under the umbrella of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Special Crimes Operations Unit. </p>  <p>  Multi-disciplinary approaches are utilised to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted, including the use of the proceeds of crime legislation, money-laundering legislation and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to participate in joint and multi-disciplinary and multi-jurisdictional investigations, within the European Union and world-wide.  Successful investigations, prosecutions and disruptions of criminal activities have been and continue to be achieved through these parallel investigations.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the very significant measures which have been introduced in response to the recent feuding activity including the establishment of a dedicated Garda Armed Support Unit in Dublin and the establishment of the Special Crime Task Force.  </p>  <p>  Commendable successes continue to be achieved in targeting criminal groups as well as the drugs and firearms seized and assets targeted.</p>  <p>  We are seeing significant results including those of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Operation Hybrid.

This includes responsibility for the formulation of proposals in relation to the opening and closing of Garda Stations, taking into account crime trends and policing priorities, so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has, in the Programme for a Partnership Government, recognised community policing as the embodiment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, providing a means of recognising that every community, both urban and rural, has its own concerns and expectations.  It commits the Government to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing in every community, including the most minimal response times possible.</p>  <p>  With this in mind, I can confirm that I have asked the Policing Authority to oversee a review of, among other things, the dispersal of Garda stations in rural areas.  I understand that the Authority has, in accordance with section 117(2) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, formally requested the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to examine the dispersal and use of resources available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities and to make recommendations to provide a more effective, visible and responsive policing service.  The Authority has informed the Inspectorate that the review should take account of:</p>  <p>  -  the changing environments in rural, developing urban and suburban areas;</p>  <p>  -  the views of local communities;</p>  <p>  -  the allocation to and deployment of Garda resources at the local policing level, including the use of the Garda Reserve, Garda facilities and Garda equipment; and</p>  <p>  -  relevant recommendations made in previous Inspectorate reports.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment in the Programme, I have also requested the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions in relation to the distribution of Garda resources in the State, to identify 6 stations for reopening on a pilot basis to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.  I understand that work is currently underway in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to identify the 6 stations for inclusion in the pilot.  It is intended that the results of the pilot scheme will feed into the wider review being overseen by the Policing Authority.</p></reply>

In recognition of this, and in making determinations as to whether a person is a suspected victim of human trafficking, An Garda S&iacute;ochana takes into account any information provided by NGOs in relation to their engagement with these persons.  In circumstances in which persons have no legal basis to remain in the State, the Administrative Immigration Arrangements for the Protection of Victims of Trafficking provide for the granting of a 60 day recovery and reflection period.  This may be followed by a 6-month renewable temporary residence permission, where the trafficked person wishes to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or other relevant authorities in any investigation or prosecution in relation to the alleged trafficking.  As part of Ireland's victim-centred approach, suspected victims of human trafficking are provided with accommodation (where necessary), medical care and planning, psychological assistance, material assistance, legal aid and advice, security advice, vocational training and education.</p>  <p>  As always, I would urge all victims of crime, including persons who believe that they may be victims of human trafficking, to report the matter to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Any suspicion of human trafficking that is reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the subject of a comprehensive investigation.  In terms of legislation, the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, with penalties of up to life imprisonment for human trafficking, greatly strengthened the law in this area and this legislation was further bolstered in 2013 with new forms of exploitation, namely forced begging and forced criminal activities, being provided for in law.</p>  <p>  Measures have been taken to ensure that the Irish border is secure and that the opportunities which may arise at the point of entry to identify victims and their traffickers are taken.  These measures include ongoing training for immigration officers at border control points and increasing use of new technology.  Training in relation to human trafficking has also been provided for staff at reception centres where asylum seekers are housed.</p>  <p>  Ireland's approach to the issue of Human Trafficking is further set out in the Second National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Human Trafficking in Ireland which was published in October 2016.</p>  <p>  In relation to the broader question of the undocumented I have no plans to introduce a general regularisation scheme.  However, as I have stated previously it is always open to such persons to present their case on its individual merits to the immigration authorities.  Such cases would be carefully considered before a decision is made and it is reasonable for the State to expect that the affected persons would respect that decision.</p></reply>

However, owing to a number of unique factors pertaining to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the fact that it is a single national police force which provides a security and intelligence service as well as a policing service, international policing models may require tailoring to our circumstances. </p>  <p>  Section 117(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 specifically requires the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to benchmark their recommendations by reference to the best standards of comparable police services.  Arising from this requirement, every inspection conducted by the Garda Inspectorate, and any recommendation arising, has involved examining policing practices in other jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will no doubt be aware that the recommendations of the Inspectorate's 2015 Report, 'Changing Policing in Ireland', formed the basis of the Government's Five Year Reform and High-level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Commissioner&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 is the vehicle for implementing the agreed Government Plan for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This Programme was launched in June 2016. </p>  <p>  Key reforms being implemented include the replacement of the current District model of policing with a Divisional model where responsibilities will be allocated on a functional rather than geographical basis.  However, in implementing this reform, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is required to continue to maintain the close relationship it has with communities in large rural Divisions.  The Plan also contains a commitment to increase the number of civilian staff in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  in line with international norms.  A medium term target of achieving 20% civilians by 2021 is proposed to this end.  I have asked the Policing Authority to monitor the implementation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the Plan and to provide regular progress reports to the Department on the matter. </p>  <p>  In accordance with section 26 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the direction and control of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In exercising this function, I understand that the Garda Commissioner has ensured that relevant policing developments in other jurisdictions are reviewed on an on-going basis so that international best practice can be identified and, where appropriate, applied throughout the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. </p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Kildare Division, on the 31 December 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 316.  There are also 22 Garda Reserves and 30 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and the Organised Crime Bureau. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, 838 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, including 35 to the Kildare Division.  I am also informed by the Commissioner that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including Kildare, in the coming years.</p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p></reply>

The Policing Authority represents one of the most significant developments in policing since the founding of the State.  It constitutes a major element of the comprehensive programme of justice reform which is being delivered by the Government, aimed both at ensuring continuing confidence in the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and at supporting the women and men of the service in the work they do on our behalf every day. </p><p>The Authority&rsquo;s role is to oversee the performance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to policing services, to promote public awareness of policing matters and to promote and support the continuous improvements in policing in Ireland.  Its mission is to drive excellent policing through valued and effective oversight and governance.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware the statutory basis for the Policing Authority is the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 which amended the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  Since its establishment, it has focused, as a matter of priority, on its functions which have statutory deadlines and reform significance.</p><p>Under the Act, the Commissioner reports to the Authority to facilitate its work and to provide any relevant material as requested.  I am aware that the Authority has met frequently with the Commissioner and her senior team with 13 meetings held in 2016, five of which were held in public.  Such public meetings serve to reassure the community about the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Areas that have been highlighted in the discussions include: </p><p>-  consideration of the O&rsquo;Higgins Report and related matters;</p><p>-  implementation of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;</p><p>-  review of the Garda Protected Disclosure policy;</p><p>-  plans to conduct a culture audit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;</p><p>-  corporate governance arrangements and management structures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;</p><p>-  redeployment of Garda members to front line policing; and</p><p>-  arrangements for training and the professional development of members.</p><p>Also, since its inception, the Authority has approved a three-year Strategy for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It has also determined the policing priorities for 2017 which informed the content of the 2017 Policing Plan which it also approved.  It has reviewed and issued recommendations on the Garda Protected Disclosure policy and also published a Code of Ethics that includes standards of conduct and practice for Garda members.  </p><p>In addition to these functions, the Authority also took over the Department&rsquo;s role in relation to Joint Policing Committees. </p><p>The Authority has responsibility for nominating persons for appointment by the Government to the posts of Garda Commissioner and Deputy Garda Commissioner; appointing persons to the ranks of Superintendent, Chief Superintendent and Assistant Commissioner (and removing them for reasons related to policing services); and for appointing persons to senior positions within the Garda civilian staff. </p><p>All sections of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 have now been commenced and I look forward to the Authority fulfilling its very important statutory functions into the future.</p></reply>

Finance Act 2016 does not contain any such provisions referred to by the Deputy in relation to either capital gains tax or local property tax.  However, section 52 of the Act, which made changes to a capital acquisitions tax exemption that applies in relation to gifts and inheritances of dwelling houses in certain circumstances, came into operation on 25 December 2016.  I believe that this is the matter about which the Deputy is seeking clarification. The changes made to the 'dwelling house' exemption have two principal effects.</p>  <p>  Firstly, the dwelling house exemption is only available for inheritances.  With one exception, it is no longer possible to receive a tax-free gift of a dwelling house.  The exception is where a person gifts a dwelling house to a dependent relative.  For this purpose, a dependent relative is a direct relative of the donor, or of the donor's spouse or civil partner, who is permanently and totally incapacitated because of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself or herself or who is over the age of 65. </p>  <p>  Secondly, the inherited dwelling house must have been the deceased person's principal private residence at the date of his or her death.  This requirement is relaxed in situations where the deceased person had to leave the house before the date of death because of ill health; for example, to live in a nursing home.</p></reply>

It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. </p><p>Following the enactment of the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015, the Central Bank focused on developing a robust regime for this new category of regulated firm.  The objective was to ensure that borrowers whose loans are transferred from a regulated lender have the same level of consumer protections they had prior to the sale under the various statutory codes issued by the Central Bank.</p><p>The Central Bank has developed detailed Authorisation Requirements and Standards for credit servicing firms which set appropriately high requirements on applicant firms.  These include requirements on how these firms deal with their loan owner in order to ensure that borrowers receive the full protections of Irish financial services legislation, including Central Bank codes.  </p><p>I understand that the Central Bank is currently putting applicant firms through its application process to ensure that only firms that demonstrate compliance with these authorisation standards are authorised.</p><p>A of those applicant firms who have notified the Central Bank that they wish to avail of the transitional provisions provided for in the legislation (whereby, by virtue of the Act, they are taken to be authorised to carry on the business of a credit servicing firm pending a decision on their application by the Central Bank) is available on the Central Bank website.  No firms have been granted an authorisation to date but it is worth highlighting that the full requirements of Irish financial services legislation (including Central Bank codes) apply to these firms. </p></reply>

In addition, the records relating to this meeting had previously been released under the Freedom of Information Act in November 2015. </p><p>For particular details of what was discussed at the meeting, I would refer the Deputy to the note of this meeting with Cerberus which is publically available on the Department of Finance website: </p><p>I, as Minister, and my Department refute absolutely the validity of any suggestion that I or my officials acted inappropriately in meeting with Cerberus in March 2014.  It is entirely appropriate that I, as Minister for Finance, would meet with the Chairman of a major international investment fund and former US Secretary of the Treasury, at his request whilst he was in Dublin on business.</p><p>As the published documentation confirms, the meeting was arranged at the request of Cerberus and was high level in nature.  It would be very unusual and indeed inappropriate for any Minister for Finance not to meet with such individuals and firms.  I have had many similar meetings in the course of my ministerial duties.  It is also entirely appropriate that my officials would meet with representatives of firms who have a general investment interest in Irish assets. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware of the clear legal separation between the Minister for Finance and NAMA's commercial operations.  My meeting with former Secretary John Snow and my officials meeting with Cerberus representatives in March 2014 did not alter the fact that neither I nor my officials were involved in the Project Eagle sales process.  As is well established, I was generally aware that the Project Eagle process was underway and Cerberus did inform me and my officials, at those meetings, that they were interested in the portfolio.  This was the extent of engagement on the matter and the meeting record clearly states that any specifics of the sale should be discussed with NAMA: &quot;[Secretary Snow] noted that they have interest in NAMA's Project Eagle.  It was also noted that they would be meeting NAMA later that day to discuss their interest.  Secretary Snow mentioned the process letter from NAMA but it was suggested that it would be most appropriate to discuss that issue at the NAMA meeting&quot;.</p><p>Aside from the brief reference to Project Eagle outlined above, the Deputy will note that other high level discussion points related to Cerberus' general activity in Europe, the recovery of the Irish property market, recent capital gains changes and the Single Resolution Mechanism in the Eurozone. </p><p>I would expect that the Deputy, and any reasoned observer, would not find any of these discussion points either surprising or inappropriate.</p></reply>

I have no role in day to day supervision of the insurance industry, as this is the responsibility of the Central Bank of Ireland.  The Central Bank of Ireland has two specific mandates as regards insurance supervision.  First, it is responsible for the prudential supervision of insurance companies authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Second, it is responsible for the supervision of conduct of business in Ireland, also referred to as consumer protection.  All insurance undertakings operating in Ireland, whether authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland or a competent authority of another EU state, are subject to conduct of business supervision by the Central Bank of Ireland.  </p><p>It is important to note that the legal and regulatory framework for the provision of life insurance, non-life insurance and reinsurance in the European Economic Area (EEA), and the supervision of that activity, is prescribed by EU Directives and Regulations.  This framework allows for the freedom to provide services from one Member State into another throughout the European Union.  This is a key principle of the European Union and is availed of by a number of insurance firms established in Ireland in order to conduct business into other EU Member States.  </p><p>Underpinning the ability to conduct business whether in a company's home territory or elsewhere in the EU under the freedom to provide services is the Solvency II Directive which came into force from 1 January 2016.  Solvency II is a revision of EU insurance and reinsurance law designed to modernise supervision, deepen market integration, increase the competitiveness of European insurers and ensure a harmonised approach to supervision across the EU going forward.  </p><p>The Government is supportive of the principle of the freedom to provide services across the European Union and is of the view  that the legislative framework underpinning this principle is robust.  Additionally the Central Bank has informed me that it works closely with relevant foreign National Competent Authorities and EIOPA (the insurance European Supervisory Authority), which has identified as one of its key strategic objectives 'to improve the quality, efficiency and consistency of the supervision of EU insurers and occupational pensions.'  The Central Bank of Ireland fully supports EIOPA's work in this regard and has actively engaged with EIOPA in its revision of the General Protocol which will enhance the exchange of information between supervisory authorities.</p><p>Finally, I am informed by the Central Bank that when an insurance undertaking is notified to the Central Bank by an equivalent EU / EEA supervisory body they are added to the register of service providers or branch establishments.  This register is available on the Central Bank's website and includes the details that the Deputy has listed in his question.  </p><p>Link: .</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-16a.319.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017021600065#WRF00400"><p>I am advised by Revenue that income tax issues relating to foreign assignees working here temporarily are set out in the Revenue's Statement of Practice IT-3-07.  The Statement of Practice was updated as a matter of routine in December 2016.  In accordance with the terms of the OECD Model Convention on Income and on Capital, it re-affirmed the longstanding position in respect of the taxation of foreign assignees to Ireland and the obligations on employers in relation to the operation of the Irish PAYE system.</p>  <p>  With effect from 1 January 2006, income attributable to the performance, in the State, of duties of a foreign employment has been chargeable to tax under sections 18 and 19 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Consequently employers are obliged to make the appropriate deductions from that income under the PAYE system.</p>  <p>  However, under the terms of the Employment article of Double Taxation Agreements between Ireland and other countries, income attributable to the performance in the State of the duties of an employment may be relieved from the charge to Irish tax, and in such cases the tax deducted under PAYE is generally repaid to the individual.  In order to reduce the administrative burden on employers, Revenue do not require an employer in these circumstances to operate PAYE where the employee is under the direction and control of the foreign employer and the duties of that office or employment are performed in the State for not more than 60 working days in total in a year of assessment.</p>  <p>  The updated Statement of Practice contains additional guidance (in line with the internationally agreed commentary on the OECD Model Tax Convention) on this release from the obligation to operate PAYE.  I am advised by Revenue that this position is not new and has been clarified by Revenue in extensive discussions with tax practitioner groups over the last two years.  The additional guidance should improve certainty for employers as to their PAYE obligations, and certainty is frequently cited as a key concern which businesses take into account when making long-term business investment decisions.  I am further advised by Revenue that, as necessary, it will seek to enhance its guidance in this area, to ensure that employers subject to these provisions have certainty as to their obligations at all times.</p></reply>

One of the networks funded under the Skillnets Training Networks Programme is the Carlow Kilkenny Skillnet. Four years ago, the Carlow Kilkenny Skillnet began a consultation with the local childcare industry and childcare representatives about identified skill needs/shortages for the sector. This led to the development of a new QQI accredited Level 7 BA Honours Degree in Early Childhood Education &amp;amp; Care. The course was developed in partnership with Carlow IT, with whom the network has developed a strong working relationship as part of its local stakeholder collaboration. </p>  <p>   This is a 1-year programme which has had three iterations to date, with a fourth course planned for 2017.  It has proved to be a successful programme,  with all places filled from the enterprise membership of the Carlow Kilkenny Skillnet and other neighbouring Skillnet networks. The programme development costs were borne by Carlow IT, and Carlow Kilkenny Skillnet negotiated commercial rates with Carlow IT for the programme delivery costs. The course fees for the candidate are effectively subsidised via the Skillnets grant, which incentivises both the development and delivery of industry-led learning programmes.</p>  <p>   While Skillnets has no involvement in the provision of a similar course via NUIG, one assumes that this is a publicly-available programme, the course fees for which are determined by NUIG.</p>  <p>   Higher education institutions are autonomous bodies and the criteria governing </p>  <p>  the level of tuition fees to be charged in relation to third level students who do not qualify for free fees is determined by the institutions and accordingly I have no role in relation to the </p>  <p>  matter.</p></reply>

These responsibilities include the important activity of community and other fire safety initiatives.  The provision of health services in Ireland, including the provision of ambulance services, is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE), operating under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Health.   </p>  <p>  I am aware that a number of reports have been delivered in recent years dealing with aspects of the ambulance services, both nationally and in the Dublin area, including, for example, a 2014 report from the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) making recommendations to improve patient safety, which should, of course, be at the centre of all deliberations on this matter.  While this issue is not within my direct remit, due to the interaction between the operation of the ambulance services and fire services in Dublin, my Department has engaged with Dublin City Council and the Department of Health in relation to arrangements for the provision by Dublin Fire Brigade of an emergency ambulance service as part of the HSE&rsquo;s emergency medical services in the capital.  My Department also met with SIPTU recently to hear staffing interests&rsquo; concerns in relation to these same matters. </p>  <p>  While the provision of ambulance services is a very important aspect of the work carried out by Dublin Fire Brigade currently, their primary statutory responsibilities continue to be in the area of fire safety and the provision of fire services.  Any work undertaken by local authorities on behalf of another sector should be on the basis of cost recoupment to the local government sector and, insofar as the provision of ambulance services by Dublin Fire Brigade is concerned, the priority focus must be on ensuring that this is provided for in appropriately-commissioned, inter-service working arrangements based on the highest standards of clinical and operational governance.  My Department will continue to engage with the Department of Health and Dublin City Council in this regard. </p>  <p>  By placing the citizen in need of medical services at the centre of considerations and with flexibility from all the stakeholders concerned, I am confident that robust arrangements can be put in place to ensure that appropriate fire and ambulance services continue to be provided for the citizens of Dublin.</p></reply>

In this regard, where a permanent post falls to be filled by transfer the relevant transfer list is consulted.  In addition to having to satisfy attendance and performance criteria, the question as to whether the person can be released from their current office/Department arises.  There are a number of reasons why someone might not be released e.g. they may be required to serve in their current location for a specified period of time, there may be no suitable replacement available should one be required or the business needs of the office are such that releasing an experienced person cannot be facilitated at that point in time.  If a person is not suitable or cannot be released they retain their place on the list for future opportunities and the next person on the list is considered.</p>  <p>  An increase in the work undertaken in the Department&rsquo;s Longford office required the ongoing assignment of a significant number of new staff last year.  From a business perspective, and in order to maintain service delivery to those depending on the schemes operated in that office, it has not always been possible to release experienced staff while getting new staff fully trained up.  The position is subject to continuous review with a view to being able to facilitate staff transfers when opportunities arise in the future</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the Department&rsquo;s information section, the ongoing reorganisation of the Communications Unit in the Department will over time see staff redeployed within Sligo to fill vacancies which will, in the short term, impact on the requirement to assign additional staff to that location.  The redeployment of staff within Sligo is not expected to impact on the other locations identified by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The SIF operates on a &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; basis, with the Exchequer acting as residual financier of the fund when there is a shortfall between contributions received and benefits paid.  The fund is central to Ireland&rsquo;s system of social protection and there is a fundamental requirement that it should be protected for current and future generations.</p>  <p>  Specifically, illness benefit is a short term payment made to insured people who are unable to work due to illness.  Normally payment of illness benefit begins from the seventh day of the illness; no payment is made for the first six days, known as &ldquo;waiting days&rdquo;.  Waiting days have been a long standing feature of social insurance schemes and are a feature of similar social security schemes in many other countries.  </p>  <p>  In order to ensure the sustainability of the Fund, the number of waiting days was increased in 2014 from three to six.  The increase in waiting days was a relatively modest adjustment and many employees still receive their salaries when out sick where their employers have occupational sick pay arrangements in place.  Furthermore, people who need financial support are not left without such support during waiting days.  A person who has no other income may claim supplementary welfare allowance in respect of the days in question. </p>  <p>  I have no plans at present to change the number of waiting days for illness benefit. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-16a.436.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017021600067#WRH01100"><p>The social welfare system is primarily a contingency-based system, with entitlement based on a number of defined contingencies such as sickness, unemployment, old age or widowhood.</p>  <p>  There are two basic principles which underpin the Irish social insurance system.  Firstly there is the contributory principle.  Under this principle there is a direct link between the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions.  Where a person has sufficient PRSI contributions, then benefits and pensions may be paid as of right, where a particular contingency arises and without a means test.</p>  <p>  Secondly there is the solidarity principle.  Under this principle the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons. PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable.  In this regard, it should be noted that some PRSI contributors do not experience all of the contingencies during their life, or may not be in a position to benefit from one or more such payment.  For example, one contributor may never require access to Invalidity Pension whereas it may be a crucial support for another.  Similarly, there will be many contributors who will never require coverage for Maternity Benefit, but who nevertheless continue to be levied PRSI at the full rate during their working years.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is a general principle of one person, one payment.  Given the contingency-based nature of this system, it can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time.  For example, an unemployed person may become sick.  The general approach is that if a person experiences more than one of these contingencies at the same time, he or she can receive only one of those payments.  This principle is common to social security systems across the world.</p>  <p>  There were a limited number of exceptions in the social insurance system to the general principle of one person, one payment.  These exceptions usually applied in the context of short-term benefits.  For instance, recipients of One-Parent Family Payment, Widows and Widowers Pensioners etc. could, until recent years, also receive short-term social insurance benefits, such as Illness Benefit and Jobseeker's Benefit at half-rate at the same time.  These overlapping payment arrangements were introduced in the early 1950s when the social insurance system was first established, at a time when there were only 10 individual social welfare payments and when rates were significantly lower in real terms than they are now.  The social welfare system has been significantly developed over the intervening period, with the result that the number of possible combinations of concurrent contingencies has increased greatly.</p>  <p>  In the context of the difficult fiscal environment in recent years and the Government's commitment to maintain existing core rates of primary payments for social welfare recipients, the concurrent payment of half-rate Illness Benefit and Jobseeker's Benefit in addition to One-Parent Family Payment, Widows and Widowers Pensions etc. was discontinued from January 2012.</p>  <p>  It is realistic and prudent to maintain the underlying principle of entitlement to only one payment at any one time, i.e. one person, one payment.  To do otherwise could potentially involve very significant and unsustainable additional expenditure in the long term. </p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the last Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund published in 2012 found that Fund has a strong redistributive nature.  This is demonstrated by the fact that those on lower incomes fare considerably better than those on higher incomes and the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This includes enhancing the position of the self-employed through a supportive tax regime and, very importantly, improving the level of PRSI based benefits available to self-employed workers.</p>  <p>  This has been one of my key priorities since becoming Minister in this Department.  On Budget Day, I was pleased to announce important measures which will directly benefit the self-employed.</p>  <p>  From March 2017, the self-employed will have access to the treatment benefit scheme which includes free eye and dental examinations, and contributions towards the cost of hearings aids.  Treatment benefit entitlements will also be extended from October 2017 so as to provide further dental and optical benefits.</p>  <p>  Even more significantly, self-employed contributors will be eligible for the Invalidity Pension from December 2017.  The measure is expected to benefit approximately 1,400 people in 2017 at a cost of &euro;1.5 million while the cost for 2018 will be a little over &euro;23 million with 2,500 people benefitting from the scheme.  For the first time, this will give the self-employed access to the safety net of State income supports if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of an illness or disability without having to go through a means test.  This is a real advance in the level of cover available to the self-employed.</p>  <p>  I plan to continue extending cover for the self-employed to other benefits on a phased basis in future Budgets.  In 2017, my Department is examining the costs and financing of the extension of social insurance to cover new risks and contingencies, including developing proposals on a form of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit where a person's business fails or they can no longer continue working in their profession or trade.  This examination will include the level of appropriate additional contribution required to fund additional benefits.  The cost of extended social insurance cover for the self-employed will also be addressed in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund as at 31 December 2015 which is currently underway.  This report will be available later in 2017.</p></reply>

The Public Spending Code published by my Department sets out the principles which apply in relation to project appraisal, value for money etc., and which continue to apply throughout the implementation phase. </p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) has responsibility for the procurement of common goods and services on behalf of the public sector and for public procurement policy generally which includes construction procurement policy.  With the exception of the recently established Framework Agreement for the Provision of Rapid Delivery Housing, the OGP does not centrally procure construction projects.</p>  <p>  A project must complete the review stages set out in the Public Spending Code before sanction is given to go out to tender.  At each review stage the project is evaluated to ensure it continues to meet its objectives, the budget is reviewed and adjustments undertaken as necessary.  Once tenders are received the sanctioning authority must review the tender report and give permission for a contract to be awarded with an established construction budget.  It is a matter for the contracting authority who has awarded the contract to manage its performance thereafter and report on budgetary matters to the capital sanctioning authority concerned.  The extent of cost increases on individual capital projects is a matter for each sanctioning authority and the details are not held centrally.</p>  <p>  All public works projects that are delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the Government's capital plan must be procured in accordance with the provisions laid down in the Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF).  The CWMF is mandated by circular and was developed to provide an integrated set of contractual provisions, guidance material, technical templates and procedures which cover all aspects of the delivery process of a public works project from inception to final project delivery and review.  The structure of this strategic framework compliments the Public Spending Code.</p>  <p>  A central pillar to the successful outcome of a construction project is a clearly defined set of contract conditions.  The standard public works contract which must be used without amendment (unless otherwise sanctioned) is a lump sum, fixed-price contract and includes, amongst other important elements, a set of tightly defined circumstances where the contract sum and the project's completion date may be adjusted.  It is a general principle that public works projects are put out to tender on the basis of a comprehensively defined set of project requirements so that tenderers can provide a lump sum price for the completion of the project.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that, the conditions of construction contracts must make provision for change after the contract is awarded whether that is due to unforeseen circumstances or brought about by a change in the contracting authority's requirements.  Careful management pre-procurement is required to ensure that neither scenario arises since changes are disruptive and costly in the construction phase.  Public procurement law also recognises both eventualities and Article 72 of the EU 2014 Procurement Directives sets limits for both types of changes.  Where these limits are exceeded a new procurement process is required.</p></reply>

The Clinical Communications Gateway is used to send and receive<b><i></i></b>patient identifiable clinical messages including referrals, prescriptions, diagnostic imaging, lab requests and results and monitor the progress of messages between care settings.</p><p>The health service in Ireland has built its own version of the clinical communications gateway, this is known as HealthLink, the National HealthLink Project and has been in operation for several years.  The National HealthLink Project is a joint collaboration between the Office of the Chief Information Officer (HSE) and Hospitals throughout Ireland as well as Primary Care.</p><p>In 2016 the HealthLink team became part of the eHealth Ireland function in the Office of the Chief Information Officer in the HSE.  HealthLink uses Health Information and Quality Authority standards to ensure messages can be passed around the health service digitally, it provides the capability to pass clinical messages such as laboratory test requests, test results reporting , image and diagnostic requests and referrals for a range of specialties.  In 2016, over 17 million messages were transmitted mainly between Primary and Acute settings. </p><p>HealthLink has recently been involved in developing solutions around electronic referrals between primary and acute care settings.  It builds upon the success of a pilot that was developed and implemented in hospitals across the South/South West Hospital Group<b><i></i></b>in 2014 specifically for referrals.<b><i><font color="#FF0000">  </font></i></b>The objective of the<b><i></i></b>initial project was to put in place an electronic general referral solution that was scalable, measurable, accessible, robust and transparent.  Using the e-referral solution, a GP can submit a referral electronically directly from their practice management system to the hospital in question using the HIQA-approved referral form and immediately receive an acknowledgement confirming receipt of same.  Later phases of the project ensure that the GP practice system also receives a response message once the patient has been triaged and enables the referral to be processed digitally within the hospital. </p><p>A programme to make it possible for all acute hospitals to accept (General) referrals electronically was initiated in Q1 2015.  By December 2015, over 50% of all acute hospitals were live, including three complete hospitals groups, namely HSE South/South West, Saolta and the University of Limerick Hospital Group.  As of May 2016, all public hospitals were live and can receive HIQA compliant general electronic referrals from GPs.  Another phase of  development proposes that general eReferrals can be sent to a single Central Referrals Office at a hospital group level, as is the case with the University of Limerick Hospital Group eReferrals, in order to facilitate a more effective management of eReferrals in terms of waiting times and capacity constraints at a hospital group level.  Further expansion of the potential for eReferral is being examined including the potential for patients to see their referral using patient portal technology.  HealthLink will also be the infrastructure for the movement of information relating to the Individual Health Identifier and the new national laboratory information system which are scheduled for implementation in 2017.  My Department is currently evaluating a business case for a national electronic health record for Ireland to significantly improve the digital opportunity for healthcare.  HealthLink will be a critical part of the development of digital health services into the future.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  A care needs assessment  is carried out to determine if a person requires long term care, followed by a financial assessment to determine how much a person will contribute to their cost of care.  Currently, the average processing time to complete the application process is 4 weeks.</p>  <p>  The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, published in July 2015 recommended the consolidation of the number of nursing homes support offices (NHSOs) from 17 local offices to 4 regional offices.  Importantly the Review stated that there should still be a facility in the existing NHSOs to deal with queries from the public in relation to the Scheme and application process.</p>  <p>  In line with the recommendation contained in the Review and as per the HSE's National Service Plan, 2017 the HSE is planning to improve efficiency and responsiveness for applicants by reducing the number of NHSOs from 17 to 5 during the current year.  In implementing this development, the HSE will be maintaining a sufficient level of service in the existing local offices to ensure continuity of service and communication with the public.  As a result, the existing local offices will continue to provide assistance to the public in regard to the Scheme.</p></reply>

I understand that the Review has been completed and is under consideration by the HSE and Dublin City Council.  </p>  <p>  I should also draw the attention of the Deputy to the HIQA (2014) report on ambulance services which highlighted significant public safety issues arising from two ambulance services operating in the same domain.  The Report identified concerns around the existence of two separate control and dispatch processes, and also highlighted the need for greater clinical governance of both services.  The Report points to the need for enhanced integration of ambulance service provision in the greater Dublin area. </p>  <p>  I fully accept that, in the interest of patient safety, we need the Dublin Fire Brigade and the NAS to have a more coordinated and integrated approach to service delivery.  I am therefore reassured that the HSE is working closely with Dublin City Council to devise and agree the elements of a safe, sustainable, integrated and quality ambulance service for the citizens of Dublin.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that if, and before, any changes in the model of ambulance service delivery in Dublin are implemented, a formal proposal for same will be required to be submitted to both myself and the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, for our consideration and approval.  In that regard, discussions are ongoing between officials from my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. </p></reply>

Two changes were made to the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule  with the introduction of Men B and Rotavirus for all babies born on or after 1 October, 2016.  As the first doses of these vaccines are administered to children when they reach two months, the changes to the immunisation schedule took effect from 1 December, 2016.  All vaccines administered through the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule are provided free of charge.  Ireland is the second country in Europe to make the vaccine available free of charge as part of its national immunisation programme. </p>  <p>   The National Immunisation Advisory Committee makes recommendations in relation to &ldquo;at risk groups&rdquo; but not all of these are included in the current immunisation schedule.  The introduction of the vaccine to the childhood immunisation programmes means that all children born on or after 1 October 2016, including those in "at risk groups", will automatically receive the vaccine.  However, there are no plans at this stage to introduce a catch-up programme for older children.  Those who have a medical card are eligible to have the vaccine administered by their GP free of charge.  However the purchase of the vaccine is not covered by the medical card scheme.</p></reply>

This is in line with international best practice. </p>  <p>  Invasive cervical cancer is extremely rare in women aged under 25, with less than 5 women in this age group being diagnosed with this condition in Ireland each year.  While changes in the cells of the cervix are very common for those under 25, in the vast majority of cases these changes will settle and return to normal without intervention.  If the screening age was lowered to invite those under 25 for smear tests, young women could be subjected to unnecessary treatment that could have potential long-term negative effects on their health and fertility.</p>  <p>  My Department encourages all women aged under 25 to be vigilant about their health and to consult their GP immediately if they have any symptoms which would raise the suspicion of cervical cancer.  If necessary, their GP will refer them to a gynaecology clinic for further investigation.  Similarly it is recommended that any woman concerned about cervical cancer on the basis of family history should discuss this with their GP. </p></reply>

As a result of investment, we made some progress but there is much more to do to provide the level service that is needed.  </p>  <p>  I recently met with the CEO of the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group and of Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin (OLCHC) to discuss immediate action that can be taken to reduce waiting times for children and adolescents with scoliosis.  </p>  <p>  While the new theatre in OLCHC was commissioned in 2016, it is only now being used  for scoliosis surgery due to challenges with recruiting nurses.  The hospital has undertaken an aggressive recruitment drive to attract new theatre nurses with the necessary paediatric training.  As a result four new nurses will be in place by April.  A further 16 international nurses have been offered posts, and have commenced the registration process.  The recruitment of these nurses means that the new theatre will be used to provide the additional capacity for scoliosis procedures in OLCHC from April.  This will allow an additional day of procedures to be carried out in the medium term.  I am advised by OLCHC that an orthopaedic surgeon post in the hospital will also be filled by June.  This means that from July, the hospital expects that the theatre use will be further increased.  In addition I will receive an Action Plan for Scoliosis from the HSE by the end of February which will take on board the concerns of the advocacy groups.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific issue raised by the Deputy regarding the waiting list and waiting times for children for scoliosis surgery and activity levels in hospitals, as this is a service issue, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.</p></reply>

My Department currently provides a range of supports across a number of schemes for Irish beef farmers. </p>  <p>  One example is the Beef Data and Genomics Programme which forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme and will provide suckler farmers in Ireland with some &euro;300 million of funding over the next 6 years.  The program builds upon the substantial investment in data recording and genomics which has been made in recent years and will drive further developments and improvements in this area.  It complements other RDP schemes available for beef farmers including GLAS, ANC scheme, TAMS and Knowledge Transfer Groups.</p>  <p>  I will also be launching a scheme to provide funding of facilitators for Producer Organisations in the beef sector.  This will encourage primary beef producers to form Producer Organisations and allow farmers to engage collectively with processors . </p>  <p>  The work of Teagasc and ICBF is also critically important and my Department will continue to provide support to these organisations to improve productivity, reduce costs and improve overall profitability on Irish farms. </p>  <p>  Access to new markets is also important and significant progress has been made in this context in recent years.  My Department is currently in the process of attempting to secure beef access to a range of Third Countries including China, South Korea,  Ukraine, Thailand and Vietnam.  This builds on the opening of some major markets in the last two years including the US, Canada and Japan.  This is a vital means of providing Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector with as many commercial opportunities as possible for Irish beef in addition to our existing European markets. </p>  <p>  My Department and state agencies such as Bord Bia will continue to work to ensure that as many markets as possible are opened  for Irish produce  to provide sufficient outlets for exports of Irish beef, lamb, pig and dairy exports.  I allocated additional funding to Bord Bia in Budget 2017 for the specific purpose of dealing with the impact of Brexit which help to support Irish food and drink exports in 2017.  This, in addition to the opening of a new office by Bord Bia in Singapore this year, will ensure that exports of Irish beef are promoted effectively to provide viable export markets for any increases in Irish beef production.</p>  <p>  I am also very conscious of the vital role that live exports play in providing an alternative market outlet for Irish farmers.  The opening of the Turkish market for live cattle exports has seen over 19,500 exported in 2016, a number I am hopeful will grow in 2017.  I also note that exports of live cattle to Libya have recommenced which is a positive and welcome development.  My Department is also currently actively examining the possibilities of bilateral health certificates for the export of cattle to Kazakhstan, Montenegro and for breeding cattle to Morocco.  I remain committed to ensuring that Irish beef producers have the option of exporting to as many markets as possible.</p></reply>

These schemes were designed to provide financial support to young farmers and new entrants to farming during the crucial early years immediately following the setting up of a farming enterprise.  </p>  <p>  The National Reserve provides for an allocation of entitlements at the national average level or a top-up on existing entitlements that are below the national average to two mandatory categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo;.  The Young Farmers Scheme is a separate scheme that provides for an additional payment to young farmers based on activated entitlements.  </p>  <p>  The Young Farmer&rsquo;s Scheme will operate from 2015 to 2019.  EU Regulations set down the definition of a &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; for the purposes of eligibility for the National Reserve and the Young Farmers Scheme as follows:</p>  <p> - S/he is participating in the Basic Payment Scheme in the year in which s/he submits an application;</p>  <p> - S/he is aged no more than 40 years of age at any time during the calendar year in which s/he first submits an application under the Basic Payment Scheme;</p>  <p> - S/he is setting up an agricultural holding for the first time or has set up such a holding during the five years preceding the first submission of the Basic Payment Scheme application.</p>  <p>  Details in relation to the application process for the Young Farmer&rsquo;s Scheme 2017 will be widely advertised in the farming media and on the Department&rsquo;s website.  The closing date for applications under the Scheme will be 15th May 2017.</p>  <p>  The National Reserve provides for an allocation of entitlements to eligible applicants under the two mandatory categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo;.  In 2015 the National Reserve fund was based on a 3% cut to the Basic Payment Scheme financial ceiling and provided some &euro;24 million.  Some 6,260 applicants were allocated entitlements under the 2015 National Reserve. </p>  <p>  There was no National Reserve in 2016 as all available funding had been utilised under the 2015 scheme.  In order to provide for a National Reserve in 2017 funding is required to replenish the Reserve.  EU Regulations governing the scheme provide that funding for the replenishment of the National Reserve may be obtained by means of surrender of entitlements that remain unused by farmers for two consecutive years and by clawback derived following the sale of entitlements without land.  It is envisaged that funding derived from these two sources in 2017 will be very limited.  The Regulations also provide the option for Member States to apply a linear cut to the value of all farmers&rsquo; entitlements to fund the National Reserve.  Consultation between officials from my Department  and the Direct Payments Advisory Committee comprising members of the main farming organisations, agricultural education and farm advisory bodies takes place annually as part of the decision making process for the National Reserve.  Decisions relating to the availability of a 2017 National Reserve will be made following determination of available funding and the completion of the consultation process involving the Direct Payments Advisory Committee which is currently underway.</p>  <p>  The Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme of TAMS II provides grant aid for a range of investments aimed at facilitating the entry of farmers and generational renewal.  The TAMS Scheme specifically targets support at young farmers by offering them a greater rate of aid intensity at 60% compared to the standard grant aid rate of 40%.  In addition, support is being provided for grant aid for dairy buildings specifically for qualifying young farmers.</p>  <p>  There are a number of tax measures specifically aimed at young farmers, specifically &lsquo;100% Stock Relief on Income Tax for Certain Young Trained Farmers&rsquo; and &lsquo;Stamp Duty Exemption on Transfers of Land to Young Trained Farmers&rsquo;.  The Agri-taxation Review was published as part of Budget 2015 and set out the main policy objectives for continuing support through agri-taxation measures including</p>  <p>  -  Increasing land mobility and the productive use of land</p>  <p>  -  Assisting succession and the transfer of farms.</p>  <p>  Both objectives are especially relevant to young farmers and Budget 2015 included a number of new measures in this regard, as well as measures to enhance and strengthen the existing supports.</p>  <p>  In addition I recently announced that the &lsquo;Succession Farm Partnership Scheme&rsquo; has been approved and administrative arrangements are being finalised for its commencement this year.  The Scheme provides for a &euro;25,000 tax credit over five years to assist with the transfers of farms within a partnership structure and will promote the earlier inter-generational transfer of family farms.  It will encourage and support important conversations within farm families about succession planning.</p></reply>

The term &lsquo;Origin&rsquo; can also be used where the country/member state of birth is the same as the country of rearing and slaughter.  A Statutory Instrument was prepared by my Department to ensure that the necessary provisions were in place to implement this mandatory labelling requirement from 1 April 2015 and it is now fully in force.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Health, has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation and new EU food information regulations which were adopted by the Council of Health Ministers in December 2011.  However, my Department plays a  role in the enforcement of this legislation under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  My Department has assisted our colleagues in the Department of Health in the drafting of a new Statutory Instrument to bring the labelling of loose pigmeat, poultry meat and sheepmeat into line with the origin labelling rules for packaged meat brought in on April 1st 2015.  This requires businesses who sell meat loose in their premises to clearly identify the country of rearing and slaughter of the animal from which the meat is derived.  The draft SI has been finalised and my Department has placed it on the Technical Regulation Information System for notification to all EU Member States under the World Trade Organisations technical barriers to trade systems.  Following on from completion of these standstill periods I would hope that the SI will be in a position to be signed by my colleague the Minister for Health. </p></reply>

Statistics show that accidents on farms cause more workplace deaths than all other occupations combined.  In 2016 there were 21 work related fatal accidents on farms compared to 19 in 2015, this while the overall fatal accident rate fell between 2015 and 2016 from 56 to 44.  The 21 fatal farm accidents account for more than 47% of all the fatal work accidents in 2016, while farming accounts for less than 6% of the workforce.  Already in 2017 there has been one fatal farm accident.</p>  <p>  The rate of accidents on farms remains far too high and it is important the focus on farm safety is increased.  Safety must become an integral part of farming culture.</p>  <p>  While the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) has primary responsibility for Health and Safety on farms, I am fully supportive of their work and my Department are active members of the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee (FSPAC) and are in regular contact with the Health and Safety Authority.  The FSPAC consists of members from a wide range of bodies within agriculture and looks at how to promote and develop farm safety.</p>  <p>  As part of the Animal Welfare, Safety and Nutrient Storage Scheme (AWNSS) and also the Young Farmers capital Investment Scheme (YFCIS) and Organic Capital Investment Scheme (OCIS), there is a wide range of safety elements that may be grant-aided.  Examples of safety elements being grant-aided are replacement slats, animal handling facilities, rewiring buildings, safety fencing around slurry tanks, tank extensions to provide external agitation points, all of which will assist in making the farm a safer place.</p>  <p>  In addition, as part of all of the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes it is mandatory for all applicants to have completed a minimum of a &frac12; day farm safety course before they can claim grant-aid.</p>  <p>  Further, there are &lsquo;Health and Safety&rsquo; guidelines in all &lsquo;Building Specifications,&rsquo; drawn up by my Department for the construction of agricultural buildings and structures.  These specifications set out the minimum standard to which grant-aided structures must be completed and are freely available to all farmers undertaking construction works. </p>  <p>  As part of the Knowledge Transfer Groups, under the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme, there is a mandatory Health and Safety element included.  These groups will directly engage in excess of 20,000 farmers with farm safety.  </p>  <p>  Beyond this, a Farm Safety leaflet is included with the Single/Basic Payment application packs, distributed annually to over 130,000 farmers.  This is a joint initiative between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the HSA and the FSPAC and has targeted different risks in each of the last five years. </p>  <p>  Behavioural change is what is required to prevent many accidents.  It is a case of being aware of the dangers and taking the time to do what is necessary to minimise the risk.   While there are many risks in farming, farming does not have to be a dangerous occupation.  There are plenty of ways to reduce the danger without spending significant money.  Farmers should be encouraged to take time to plan buildings and work.</p>  <p>  It is important for everyone to continually highlight the need for farmers to think Safety First in all tasks they perform, no matter the pressure.  No individual action or organisation can solve this difficult problem that impacts so negatively on so many lives each year.</p></reply>

That report provided a road map for the sustainable development of the greyhound sector, and in that context recommended a number of asset disposals, including Harold's Cross, in order to reduce the debt burden.</p>  <p>  I understand that Bord na gCon, having considered the matter, and having regard to the recommendations in the Indecon Report, has decided to cease racing at Harold's Cross and initiate the sale of the Stadium in order to reduce its debt levels and increase its capacity to provide support and assistance to the industry. </p>  <p>  While this is very regrettable, its view is that there is no other option if the burden of debt on the organisation is to be reduced in any meaningful way.  I understand that its intention is to transfer the Harold's Cross racing schedule to Shelbourne Park, a few kilometres away, and that all 12 staff at Harold's Cross will be offered redeployment.</p></reply>

I hosted a Tillage Stakeholders Forum last October which consisted of representatives from all sides of this Sector.  Following a very productive meeting I subsequently initiated a number of responses to address key issues raised by stakeholders. </p>  <p>  As I set out then, one of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some sectors, which have caused cash flow difficulties for farmers.  So I was pleased to announce the launch of the &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo; recently.  The Scheme, which was developed in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), makes &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at interest rates of 2.95%.</p>  <p>  Distributed through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, it provides tillage farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.  The loans are for amounts up to &euro;150,000 for up to six years and are flexible with interest only facilities of up to three years.</p>  <p>  As an additional support to cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, I also confirmed that advance payments would be made in 2016 in respect of the Basic Payment and Greening Payment schemes.</p>  <p>  Advance payments commenced on the 17 October last, the earliest possible date by which payments can begin under the governing EU Regulations, with the addition of balancing payments from the 1 December. </p>  <p>  To date &euro;1.177 billion has been paid out to 123,454 farmers and payments are ongoing.  Payments of &euro;199.6 million have also been made to 93,341 applicants under the Areas of Natural Constraints scheme. </p>  <p>  In the changing international economic landscape we need to take a fresh look at our tillage industry to ensure that it is best positioned to withstand future challenges and to avail of new opportunities which may present themselves. </p>  <p>  The Forum is therefore an opportunity to explore and build such opportunities, as well as addressing the challenges.  This Forum is again meeting today and provides an opportunity for all to work together to evaluate further measures for the long term sustainability of the tillage sector.</p></reply>

These Regulations set down minimum requirements that must be met in order to use the term &ldquo;Free Range&rdquo;, including rules around access to the range.  The EU Regulations also provide for situations where veterinary restrictions are imposed to protect public and animal health, as is the case currently in Ireland and other MS, whereby eggs and poultrymeat may continue to be marketed as &ldquo;Free Range&rdquo; for the duration of the restriction but not for more than 12 weeks.  In Ireland, the 12 week period expires on the 17 March 2017.  </p>  <p>  There are a number of Member States who currently have housing restrictions in place.  The issue of what to do after the 12 week period expires was raised at an EU Agriculture Council meeting in January.  Since the meeting in January the Commission confirmed their intention not to table a proposal to extend the 12 week period during which time the eggs or meat from birds subject to a confinement order can continue to be marketed as free range stating concerns about the integrity and credibility of marketing standards, which were introduced for the protection of consumers.  The Commission acknowledged that the 12 week period is a balance between the interests of the producer and the consumer and that it was regarded as a reasonable period to cover an avian flu epidemic.  My Department is in ongoing contact with producers, processors and retailers on the implications of this 12 week period for the designation of eggs and poultry as free-range.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that this outbreak/epidemic is prolonged in nature and the possibility that prolonged epidemics of this duration may become a more regular event.  In these circumstances the Commission have agreed to undertake a review of the marketing standards with a view to a possible modification of the current rule in light of the prolonged epidemic such are we are experiencing right now.</p>  <p>  As regards organic production, the rules applying here are also laid down by EU regulation.  While all poultry must have access to the open air, the regulations do recognise that this may not be possible where wider restrictions are imposed on human or animal health grounds.  In such cases, operators must ensure that the needs of the birds are met in other ways, until such time as full open-air access can be restored.  The regulations thus provide a reasonable degree of flexibility as far as organic production is concerned and my Department is looking at providing additional guidance in this area.</p></reply>

In fact, it was one of the areas we identified to the Commission that could be simplified as part of our initial submission on simplification of the CAP in 2015.</p>  <p>  Ireland further submitted that, under the provisions in Regulation 1307/2013 (direct payments) relating to equivalent practices, farmers should be allowed to continue to grow only one arable crop if they join an agri-environmental scheme and sow 25% of their arable land to catch crops.  However, despite numerous efforts by my Department to have this provision reviewed, the Commission has continued to hold the view that the farmer must sow 100% of the area to catch crops.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the simplification proposals on greening practices subsequently introduced by the Commission in 2016, did not address the equivalent practices as they relate to crop diversification. </p>  <p>  Modernising and simplifying the CAP is at the core of the Commission's vision for the future of the CAP post 2020.  I continue to believe that improvements can be made in the area of crop diversification and equivalence, and this is something I will continue to pursue.</p></reply>

This freedom to respond to market forces is particularly important in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s ambitious plans for the growth of the sector, as set out in the Food Wise 2025 strategy. </p><p>We would therefore not favour a return to coupled payments, but instead look to the use of more flexible and innovative means (such as futures markets and hedging) to help mitigate the effects of market volatility.</p><p>My Department does not retain information on coupled payments in other Member States.</p></reply>

Some Member States, including Ireland, raised the possibility of increasing individual<i>de minimis</i>thresholds from their current level of &euro;15,000, to &euro;30,000.  To date the Commission has resisted such calls. </p><p>The issue of reviewing state aid rules in a Brexit context is something that would need careful consideration in the context of the European Commission's overall approach to the exit negotiations, which are yet to commence.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Deputy will already be aware of the many measures in place to support the Irish agri-food sector in dealing with the impact of the fall in the value of sterling against the euro.  These include additional funding for Bord Bia and Bord Iascaigh Mhara, agri-taxation measures, and increased expenditure on the Rural Development Programme and the Seafood Development Programme.  From a State aid perspective, the recently-launched &euro;150 million low cost agri-loan scheme, includes <i>de minimis</i>aid of &euro;4 million for all non-livestock farmers, and particularly tillage and horticulture farmers, as a means of addressing the impact of Brexit.</p></reply>

However, it remains open to a company to continue to offer waste collection on a pay-by-weight basis.  Many companies already had a pay-by-weight element to their charging structure before the agreement was reached and many of their customers had opted for this approach. </p><p>My Department is currently reviewing, together with the regulatory authorities and industry representatives, the introduction of an incentivised pricing system for household waste collection.  Incentivised pricing aims to encourage householders to prevent, reduce and segregate their waste, to reduce our reliance on landfill for waste disposal in light of the landfill capacity emergencies that occurred in 2016, and also facilitates the industry in providing householders with a range of options to manage their waste costs.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p><p>Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at shows the extent of the State Intervention area: </p><p>-  The areas marked BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p><p>-  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>Individuals can check whether their premises are in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode. </p><p>The townland of Kilmovee falls within an AMBER area and will therefore be included In the State Intervention procurement process under the NBP.</p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  My Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map to finalise the Intervention Area for the Procurement process, taking into account industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, together with new industry investments within the proposed State Intervention Area, along with concrete and credible commitments by industry for further new investments within the Intervention Area.</p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides for a future proofed solution for the 25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.  </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. </p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. </p><p>In this regard, I and Minister Humphreys established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce in July 2016.  The findings of this Taskforce recommends practical actions that can be taken to remove barriers to and improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland.  The Taskforce report is available at the following link: www.dccae.gov.ie/communications/en-ie/Pages/Publication/Report-of-the-Mobile-Phone-and-Broadband-Taskforce.aspx. </p><p>Minister Humphreys has established two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to unlock barriers to investment in mobile and broadband services.  Since July, there has been significant progress made in discussions with the key stakeholders including local authority management representation, Government Departments and State agencies, as well as interaction with ComReg and telecoms operators.</p><p>I have signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with the allocation of spectrum in the 3.6GHz band, in early 2017.  This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.  </p><p>These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country.</p></reply>

On 23 January, I hosted an All-Island dialogue on Brexit and implications for Transport and Tourism, with the objective of getting viewpoints from various stakeholders on how the UK decision will affect them and what can be done by both industry and by Government to mitigate these adverse effects.</p>  <p>  As an island nation, the aviation sector is critical to Ireland.  It is essential for our trading relationships, for all our industries especially tourism, manufacturing and retail.  The UK is by far the most important origin and destination for international passengers to and from Ireland.  The current extent of air traffic between the UK and Ireland is approximately 11 million passengers and in excess of 100,000 aircraft movements each year.  I am very concerned about the potential impacts of Brexit on Irish aviation and the implications for tourism and for the wider economy.  These concerns have been conveyed to the European Commission's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and his team.  The Department of the Taoiseach remains in constant contact with the Barnier team and will continue to engage with them on these and other Irish concerns.  </p>  <p>  Aviation services between the UK and Ireland and within the EU operate under the traffic rights afforded under the Single European Aviation Area.  The British Prime Minister's recent announcements on the UK's negotiating position made it clear that a 'hard Brexit' is likely.  It will be necessary therefore to negotiate a new aviation transport agreement between the EU (27 Member States) and the UK.</p>  <p>  In the absence of a replacement arrangement, the existing traffic rights of Irish licensed airlines to fly between the UK and Ireland, the UK and the rest of the EU, within the UK, and between the UK and a range of other third countries, could be negatively impacted.   </p>  <p>  The overall connectivity objectives outlined under the National Aviation Policy (NAP), remain unchanged by the UK's decision to exit the EU.  Obviously, Brexit presents a major challenge to the maintenance of current connectivity levels as well as our future growth objectives.  The National Civil Aviation Development Forum (NCADF), which was established under the NAP, has provided a platform for key stakeholders from the Irish aviation sector to discuss the potential impact of Brexit.  Along with the outputs of the recent All-Island Dialogue, these discussions will guide any future actions deemed necessary under the National Aviation Policy in the context of the Brexit negotiations as they evolve.  </p>  <p>  There will be no negotiations with the UK until Article 50 has been triggered.  However, in preparing for those negotiations, I am seeking to ensure that aviation will be a top negotiation priority for Ireland.</p></reply>

I believe that, given the high incidence of alcohol-related road deaths, that it is appropriate that road collisions, and the resulting fatalities and serious injuries associated with alcohol-related road collisions are currently receiving priority.</p>  <p>  The Road Traffic Act 2016 contains a number of legislative measures dealing with drug driving; written off vehicles; mutual recognition of driving disqualifications between Ireland and the UK; uninsured drivers; and a new optional 20km/h speed limit in built-up areas, among other measures.  The immediate priority is to have the legislative provisions of the 2016 Act commenced.</p>  <p>  During the passage of the Road Traffic Act 2016 through the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Road Safety Authority submitted proposals for "naming and shaming" disqualified drivers.  This is considered to be an effective tool in dealing with the issue of drivers continuing to drive following a disqualification.  While it was not possible to accommodate the necessary provisions in that Act, I hope  to bring proposals on this in the forthcoming Road Safety Authority Bill, which is currently being developed by my Departmental officials.</p>  <p>  I believe that the legislative measures I have proposed are balanced, and that together with RSA road safety campaigns in 2017 regarding alcohol and drug driving, speeding, distracted driving/use of mobile phones, and seat-belt wearing, combined with greater enforcement by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, will have an impact on road safety in 2017 and beyond.</p></reply>

This includes an increase of 30%-40% in the number of investments for the West Region.</p>  <p>  To support the delivery of these regional targets, an IDA Regional Property Programme was launched by the Government in February 2015.  This Programme includes the delivery of Advance Technology Buildings (ATBs), infrastructure investment in a number of sites and the upgrade of business and technology parks across the Agency&rsquo;s national portfolio.</p>  <p>  In the West Region, ATBs will be constructed in Castlebar and Parkmore East under the Programme.  Planning permission was also approved in August 2016 for the construction of an advance office building in Galway, which will be delivered through a Public Private Partnership.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland will continue to work closely with Galway County Council to ensure that there is sufficient industrial and commercial zoned land available in Loughrea, and in the wider area, to facilitate further foreign direct investment in the region.</p></reply>

In that context, I understand that EI representatives have met with Loughrea Community Enterprise Development Company last October.</p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that for any community planning on establishing an enterprise centre in their locality, Enterprise Ireland provides references of relevant enterprise spaces already developed in other communities around the country.</p>  <p>  To stimulate regional growth, as detailed in Action Plan for Jobs 2017, Government is committed to supporting the implementation of the eight Regional Action Plan for Jobs and to provide investment of up to &euro;60 million across 2017 &ndash; 2020 to support collaborative approaches to boost enterprise and job creation throughout the country.  This competitive funding is aimed at accelerating economic recovery in every part of the country by delivering on the potential of local and regional strengths.  As part of this commitment, Enterprise Ireland will announce a new competitive fund in the near term.</p></reply>

In the event those proposals were rejected by the Union side.</p>  <p>  The matter was then referred to the Labour Court.</p>  <p>  On 21 November 2016 the Labour Court recommended that the parties should, over a period of eight weeks, engage in a locally based process in an attempt to allow settlement at local store level.  The Court recommended that the process should be guided generally by the content of the Workplace Relations Commission proposals.  I understand that if this did not succeed the Labour Court recommended that the Workplace Relations Commission proposals should then be accepted as the means of national resolution of the issues.</p>  <p>  I understand that the union side rejected the Labour Court recommendation and did not engage in this local process.  After balloting its members, Mandate served strike notice on Tesco and industrial action commenced on Tuesday 14 February at 8 stores.  The stores involved are Baggot Street, Ballyfermot and Finglas in Dublin, as well as stores in Tralee, Longford, Navan, Tullamore, and Bray.  I understand another 8 stores will commence industrial action this Friday, 17 February and that a further 22 stores will be balloted from Monday next.</p>  <p>  This is disappointing given the efforts of the WRC and Labour Court.</p>  <p>  Our industrial relations institutions have been heavily involved in this dispute and have put forward independent proposals and recommendations.  They will be monitoring how this situation evolves over the coming days.

The programme was then expanded by reducing the age of eligibility to 3 years and by increasing the number of entry points to three throughout the programme year (September, January and April).  This means that children can begin to avail of their free place on the pre-school programme as soon as possible after they reach the age of 3.  As with any scheme, there must be entry and cut off points.  These rules for ECCE reflect evidence based policy and are necessary from an administrative and budgetary management perspective.  Regrettably, it is the nature of such rules that they benefit some more than others.</p><p>Providing free pre-school for children from the age of 3 was a key recommendation of the <i>Expert Advisory Group on the Early Years Strategy</i>.<i></i>Expansion of ECCE was also given significant consideration by the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare which reported in July 2015.  Senior officials from the Department of Education and Skills contributed to the discussions on an upper age limit for the scheme, taking a child centred approach.</p><p>I would note that this summer we will come to the end of the first delivery cycle of the newly expanded ECCE programme.  My Department will ensure that the scheme is kept under ongoing review and that learning from this cycle informs its ongoing development.</p><p>I would also note to the Deputy that plans are currently in train to provide for a new national scheme of financial support for parents towards the cost of their childcare entitled the Affordable Childcare Scheme, which will replace the existing targeted childcare subsidisation schemes with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme.  The new scheme will provide a system from which both universal and targeted subsidies can be provided towards the cost of childcare.  In the case of targeted subsidies, these will be payable for children from 6 months of age up to 15 years of age.  The level of subsidy will depend on the investment available and on a family&rsquo;s income.  The new Affordable Childcare Scheme will &quot;wraparound&quot; ECCE for pre-school and school-age children.</p></reply>

Paid training days are also allocated in respect of the work of the RDFRA Executive, representing a further contribution by the State in support of RDFRA.</p><p>Officials in my Department are carefully considering RDFRA&rsquo;s request for increased funding in the context of the request being an additional call on the exchequer.  My officials are in communication with RDFRA and are seeking additional information with a view to reaching a resolution in the matter.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is important that any solution proves to be sustainable over the long term in terms of exchequer funding and member subscriptions.  I will make the necessary decision subsequent to such considerations.</p></reply>

The State Claims Agency (SCA) manages and provides legal representation in relation to personal injury cases taken against the Minister for Defence.  External legal costs incurred by the SCA arising from the defence of any claims managed by the Agency for my Department are refunded to the Agency by the Department.  In 2016, my Department refunded &euro;500,538 to the SCA in respect of the Department&rsquo;s legal costs.  My Department does not hold details of the fees paid to the individual legal firms engaged by the SCA.  In addition while my Department does not engage the services directly it funds the provision of legal aid in respect of Court Marital Appeals Court cases.</p>  <p>  Outside of the cases managed by the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office and the State Claims Agency, a payment of &euro;23,954 was made to Colm Smyth, Senior Counsel in 2016 to carry out an independent review into a disclosure made under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.</p></reply>
