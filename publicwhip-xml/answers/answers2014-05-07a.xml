    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-07a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700043#WRA00500"><p>The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities. Significant progress has been made by the Military Authorities in addressing gaps between male and female participation in the Defence Forces, with an increase of 23% of female participation in the PDF since 2002.  However, it is recognised that more work needs to be done to meet the gender target for recruitment of females of 20% which was set by the Military Authorities in 2007.  As at 31 March 2014, the latest date for which figures are available there were 555 women out of a total strength of 9,133 serving in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF).  This represents 6% of the overall strength of the Defence Forces.</p><p>  A number of specific initiatives have been implemented to increase female participation in the Defence Forces including:</p><p>  - the introduction of best practices in recruitment, such as the adjustment of physical standards for female applicants,</p><p>  - special consideration is paid to women as a target group for recruitment,</p><p>  - there is balanced composition between men and women on recruitment and selection boards,</p><p>  - all promotions and career courses are open to both genders on merit,</p><p>  - a Gender Advisor has been appointed to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces. </p><p>  Unlike many other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions as regards the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties.  Women, therefore, play a full and meaningful role in all aspects of Defence Forces operations at home and overseas.</p><p>  I believe that there is a need to continue to develop and promote strategies that not alone support increased female participation in the Defence Forces but also support increased diversity. The personnel profile of the Defence Forces should reflect the changing demographic and multicultural nature of Irish Society.  To this end, as part of the recent recruitment campaign for enlisted personnel and the Reserve, specific efforts were made to increase the number of female applicants. This was part of a wider campaign aimed at improving gender and ethnic representation and diversity in the Defence Forces.  In the case of female participation, these efforts included school visits, media engagement including national and local radio, targeting sports clubs and use of social media. At the closing date for this recruitment campaign on 9 April 2014 there were 755 Female applicants or 10.3% out of a total of 7,295 applicants for the Permanent Defence Force and 320 female applicants or 14.9% out of a total of 2,146 applicants for the Reserve Defence Force.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-07a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700043#WRA00700"><p>I am not aware of the media Reports to which the Deputy refers. However, I can state that there are no plans to develop voluntary housing schemes for overholders in the Curragh.  The position regarding overholders has been outlined on numerous occasions. The Department of Defence does not have a role in the provision of housing accommodation for those who are not members of the Defence Forces.  As I have said previously, I cannot support the illegal occupation of military property by those who have no entitlement in this regard and who may well have the means to acquire housing for themselves.  In accordance with normal procedures my Department will continue to seek vacant possession of married quarters which are being overheld until the overholding issue is resolved.</p><p>   I recognise that there are a very small number of people currently in possession of houses in the Camp who, due to exceptional circumstances, deserve particular consideration when their cases are being processed. Accordingly I have asked that the remaining overholding cases at the Camp be examined with a view to identifying the small sub-set of cases which may be vulnerable from an accommodations perspective.  This case review is progressing and officials in my Department will engage with this small number of individuals in the coming weeks.  In light of and subject to their particular circumstances, my Department would be prepared to provide whatever assistance and support it can to the individuals concerned. This engagement will, I hope, give us more of an insight into their particular needs and thereby help us progress to a solution.  Proceedings seeking vacant possession of all other properties being overheld will proceed as announced.</p><p>  In advance of the above, my Department has recently undertaken a review of vacant former married quarter properties within the Curragh Camp with a view to their potential for future use by the military.  While this review is not fully concluded, the indications are that it would not offer potential for suitable alternative accommodation for the small number of particularly vulnerable  overholders.</p></reply>

Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the tabular statement.  The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 192 personnel, and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) with 135 Defence Forces personnel. </p><p>Other missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the EU Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali) with eight (8) personnel; the EUFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina with seven (7) personnel; the NATO-led international security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with twelve (12) personnel; and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan with seven (7) personnel. Five (5) personnel were deployed in August 2013 for service with the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) in South Sudan. Ireland also contributes 26 observers and staff to various United Nations and OSCE missions, 3 personnel to the Nordic Battle group headquarters in Sweden and 15 other personnel to staff appointments at UN, EU and OSCE headquarters.</p><p>The Defence Forces completed their withdrawal from the EU Training Mission in Somalia (EUTM Somalia) on 14 April 2014.  The Defence Forces had been serving with that mission since April 2010.  Ireland also provided the Mission Commander during the period August 2011 to February 2014.</p><p>Ireland has participated in ISAF in Afghanistan since 5 July 2002.  In March 2011, the transition process whereby the Afghan security forces would gradually take on more security responsibility from ISAF was launched. This process is due to be completed at the end of this year, when ISAF&rsquo;s mission will end. The overall drawdown of ISAF personnel is currently underway and the withdrawal of the Defence Forces personnel will be coordinated in this context. While it is anticipated that Irish personnel will complete their service with the mission in September 2014, this will be kept under review in the context of the current proposed follow on training mission.  </p><p>With regard to any future deployments of Defence Forces personnel overseas, no further requests for such deployments are currently pending in my Department.  Due to Ireland&rsquo;s own current level of commitment in overseas peacekeeping operations, notably to the United Nations Disengagement Force in Syria and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, we are not in a position to make any significant commitment to other missions at this time.  The current contribution of some 410 personnel to overseas missions reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security.</p><p><b><i>AS OF 04 MAY 2014</i></b><table><tr><th>1.</th><th>UN MISSIONS</th><th></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) HQ</td><td><div>12</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>UNIFIL 42nd Infantry Group</td><td><div>176</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>UNIFIL Sector West HQ</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>UNTSO (United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation ) Israel &amp;amp; Syria</td><td><div>13</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MINURSO (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara)</td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MONUSCO (United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo)</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>UNOCI (United Nations Mission in Ivory Coast)</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>UNDOF (United Nations Disengagement Observer Force) Golan Heights Syria</td><td><div>135</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>UNMAS (United Nations Mine Action Service ) South Sudan</td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>354</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>UN MANDATED MISSIONS</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>EUFOR (EU led Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina)</td><td><div>7</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>EUTM Mali (EU led Training Mission)</td><td><div>8</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KFOR (International Security Presence in Kosovo) HQ</td><td><div>12</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ISAF (International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan)</td><td><div>7</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONNEL SERVING WITH UN MISSIONS</td><td><div>388</div></td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>ORGANISATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE (OSCE)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>OSCE Mission to Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>OSCE Mission in Belgrade &ndash; Serbia</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Staff Officer, High Level Planning Group Vienna</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONNEL SERVING OSCE</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>EU MILITARY STAFF</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Brussels</td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>NORDIC BATTLE GROUP 2015</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>FHQ Sweden</td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>MILITARY REPRESENTATIVES/ADVISERS/STAFF</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Military Adviser, Permanent Mission to UN, New York</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Military Adviser Irish delegation to OSCE, Vienna</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Military Representative to EU (Brussels)</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Liaison Office of Ireland, NATO/PfP (Brussels)</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>EU OHQ Operation Althea, Mons, Belgium</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Irish Liaison Officer to SHAPE &amp;amp; Military Co-Op Division, Mons, Belgium</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL NUMBER OF DEFENCE FORCES PERSONNEL SERVING OVERSEAS</td><td><div>410</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The closures were effective from March 2012.  Agreement in principle has been reached for the sale of Kickham Barracks to South Tipperary County Council. To date a total of &euro;101,703.60 has been spent on security/management fees and &euro;112,223.31 on utilities and other minor maintenance works.  O&rsquo;Neill Barracks Cavan was sold to the then Co Cavan VEC. From its closure in March 2012 to its sale in early 2013, &euro;62,453.25  was spent on security, &euro;27,884.40 on utilities and &euro;39,757.98 on maintenance works. </p><p>  Columb Barracks Mullingar remains in ownership of my Department. It is currently under lease to Westmeath GAA Board.

This is not a new development and has been the situation for many years.</p><p>  The principle of competitive tendering for Government contracts is used by the Department of Defence for the acquisition of defensive equipment, including weaponry, for the Defence Forces.  Central to those procedures is the requirement to allow fair competition between suppliers through the submission of tenders following advertising of the tender competition on the e-tenders site.  Such tender competitions are open to any individual company or country in accordance with the terms of all UN, OSCE and EU arms embargos or restrictions. There are no such restrictions or embargos in place on Israel or Israeli companies. Tender competitions are held in accordance with the EU Code of Conduct on Export Controls.</p><p>  The primary purpose for the procurement of weaponry and defensive equipment by the Department of Defence is to enhance the capability of the Irish Defence Forces on overseas Peace Support Operations and to afford the greatest possible force protection to Irish troops whilst on such missions.  I understand that the value of defensive equipment acquired or being acquired from Israeli companies since March 2011 is in the region of &euro;2.9m, exclusive of VAT.  The main expenditure relates to a contract awarded to Elbit Systems for the supply of ten Ground Surveillance Radars to the Defence Forces following on from a detailed tender process carried out over the last twelve months. The main purpose for the acquisition of the Ground Surveillance Radars is again for force protection on overseas missions.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-07a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700043#WRA01600"><p>Arising from the comprehensive review of expenditure in 2011, the Government decided to stabilise the strength ceiling of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 Permanent Defence Force personnel.  The three Brigade structure then in place had originally been designed in the 1990s, when the strength ceiling of the PDF was 11,500 personnel. Clearly, at a strength ceiling of 9,500 personnel, this structure was no longer viable.  In this context, I initiated a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces encompassing the consolidation of three under-strength Army Brigades into two full strength Brigades. This was to ensure that within the revised strength ceiling, the operational effectiveness of the Permanent Defence Force was optimised in order to fulfil all roles assigned by Government. </p><p>  Key aspects of the reorganisation included the consolidation of under-strength units into a smaller number of full strength Units, a reduction in the number of headquarters and the associated re-deployment of personnel from administrative and support functions to operational Units. </p><p>  A new White Paper on Defence is due to be completed and submitted to Government for approval later this year. Work on the new White Paper on Defence is progressing well. Having regard to the inputs received from a wide variety of stakeholders, Working Groups comprising of civil and military representatives are considering future operational demands and the defence capabilities required to meet projected future operational requirements. This work will underpin recommendations regarding defence provision for the next decade. </p><p>  Capability decisions contained in the White Paper must be based on a careful assessment of the Defence and Security environment, have regard to future operational requirements and the roles that the Defence Forces will be required to undertake, and have regard also to the resource envelope.  While I do not intend to pre-empt or second guess the outcome of the White Paper, there will undoubtedly be challenges with regard to future demands and available resources. In this context, it is essential that any recommendations are linked to explicit future capability requirements.  The current organisational structures have allowed the Defence Forces to fulfil all operational requirements within the available resource envelope. This will remain a key focus for the White Paper.</p></reply>

The meeting was chaired by the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Baroness Catherine Ashton. NATO Secretary General Mr. Anders Fogh Rasmussen was present for part of the meeting.  The meeting commenced when the European Defence Agency (EDA) Steering Board met to discuss the follow-up to the December European Council tasking on military capabilities and defence industry.  The EDA Chief Executive briefed on the document they are preparing to support coordinated defence planning across the Union in respect of the collaborative delivery of defence capabilities.</p><p>  The meeting of Defence Ministers then commenced with discussions on the EU Maritime Security Strategy. This included a brief presentation on the Joint Communication by the High Representative and the Commission &ldquo;For an open and secure global maritime domain: elements for a European Union maritime security strategy&rdquo;.  This item was a priority for Ireland during our Presidency of the EU Council and still remains a priority.  The High Representative highlighted the cross sectoral and cross border nature of the maritime domain, the contribution the Maritime environment to socio-economic development and trade and the need for maritime security to that end.</p><p>  In the next working session, the High Representative drew attention to the deteriorating security situation in the Central African Republic.  Ministers were briefed by the EUFOR RCA Mission Commander, Major General Philippe Ponti&egrave;s, on the current status of the Operation.  Other issues that were discussed were the issues surrounding the difficulties in force generation for this mission, planning issues and the use of Battlegroups.  </p><p>  Discussion on Ukraine and Eastern Partnerships took place over lunch in the presence of the NATO Secretary General.  Ministers discussed the crisis in Ukraine and its consequences to Common Security and Defence Policy and the wider security perspectives of Europe.  There was collective concern on the need to significantly reassess our security and defence assumptions, improve capabilities and improve efficiency by allocating more resources to defence and security.</p></reply>

It also supports the HSE&rsquo;s pilot Emergency Aeromedical Support (EAS) service which operates out of Custume Barracks, Athlone.</p><p>  In 2005, the Department of Defence and the Department of Health completed a Service Level Agreement (SLA) which formalised arrangements for the provision of the inter-hospital air ambulance service by the Air Corps.  This SLA was renewed in October, 2011 and provides for inter-hospital transfer by air for patients with medical conditions that require urgent treatment at a hospital within Ireland or in the UK. There has been a substantial increase in the use of this service with 102 inter-hospital missions being completed in 2013 and 108 in 2012.</p><p>  In addition, a twelve-month pilot Emergency Aeromedical Support (EAS) service, supported by the Air Corps, commenced operating out of Custume Barracks, Athlone on 4 June 2012.  This pilot service was established by agreement between my Department and the Department of Health in order to assess the level and type, if any, of dedicated emergency aeromedical support needed to assist the National Ambulance Service, primarily in the west of Ireland. The assessment focused on certain types of patient, particularly on the requirements of the HSE Clinical Care Programmes such as Acute Coronary Syndrome and Stroke.</p><p>  A full evaluation of the service was undertaken by an inter-agency Audit and Evaluation Group, and in June 2013, a Report was submitted to the Minister for Health for his consideration.  The Minister for Health has accepted the Report&rsquo;s recommendations and a Working Group, chaired by the Department of Health, has been established to examine options for the provision of an EAS service into the future. The Group has met on four occasions and I understand that a further meeting is to be held later this month.  Whilst the initial 12 month pilot period has expired, I have agreed to extend the Air Corps&rsquo; participation in order for the Working Group to complete its work.</p></reply>

Foreign naval vessels are granted permission to visit Irish ports on condition that they meet the necessary policy stipulations, which require that the vessels are not carrying nuclear weapons and are not engaged in a naval exercise. The vessel in question was in Ireland as part of a routine visit and was granted permission to dock on the basis that it met these criteria.</p><p>  Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence (2000) is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power which in practice means to assist, on request, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have primary responsibility for security matters. In this regard, the Naval Service was requested by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide support with security arrangements for the visit. Accordingly, a Naval Service rib and a number of personnel were deployed to provide on-water security support. The Naval Service also provided a liaison officer facility for the USS Leyte Gulf, which is a standard courtesy afforded to all visiting naval vessels. In addition, the Naval Service hosted representatives of the crew of the vessel for a short courtesy visit to the Naval Base, again in accordance with standard protocols.</p></reply>

I was also updated on progress made to date on the publication of the 2012 and 2013 annual reports of the Ombudsman.  Due to particular circumstances, relating to High Court proceedings arising during 2013, the Annual Report for 2012 of the ODF has not yet been published. The Ombudsman indicated that the 2012 report will be available by the end of June 2014 and the 2013 report will be published as soon as possible thereafter.  </p><p>  There are no plans at present for changes to the operation of the office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces. The office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is well established. A number of administrative and systemic issues identified by the Ombudsman have been addressed by Defence management. This has contributed to improvements in procedures and policies within the Defence Forces.  I am satisfied that the current system is working well.  </p><p>  The Ombudsman has full independence and autonomy in the discharge of his statutory functions.  The primary role of the Ombudsman, which is provided for in the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004, is to provide an independent appeals process for members of the Defence Forces. Such appeals arise where a complaint has been processed through the internal Defence Forces &ldquo;Redress of Wrongs&rdquo; process but the complainant remains dissatisfied, either with the outcome, or with the manner in which the complaint was handled.  The 2004 Act also provides that, subject to certain conditions, the Ombudsman may accept complaints directly from former members of the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

They are subject to the same pension scheme terms as their pre-January 1994 enlisted counterparts.  However, they have different upper service limits depending on rank at discharge date.  Their pension and gratuity are payable immediately on discharge after relatively short periods of service, and regardless of age. <font color="#FFFFFF"> </font>Someone enlisting at age 18 could on discharge after 21 years qualify for immediate retirement benefits at age 39.  For those who joined the PDF <i>on or after 1 April 2004 and before 1 January 2013</i>, their pension arrangements are more in line with other Public Service pension schemes, e.g. benefits are based on total pensionable service and pensionable pay at retirement date.  They have a &lsquo;minimum pension age&rsquo; of 50. For those joining the PDF <i>from 1 January 2013</i>onwards, the new Public Service Single Pension Scheme applies.  </p><p>The position in relation to promotional opportunities for enlisted personnel is that they are promoted to fill rank vacancies in the establishment as provided for in the Defence Force Regulation (CS4) which outlines the numerical establishments and ranks of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps. In the five years 2009 to 2013 inclusive, a total of 1,239 enlisted personnel were promoted to higher Non Commissioned rank.  </p><p>A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the PDF after 1 January, 1994. In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. As the negotiation process with the Representative Association is very much on-going, and discussions are confidential to the parties involved, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on this issue at this time.</p></reply>

The new Field Engineer Companies are larger than before, have increased proportions of technical personnel and are better equipped.

Since the adoption of the Millennium Declaration at the UN in 2000, the world has made remarkable progress on investing in education.  Between 1999 and 2009, the global school-aged population increased by 25% and primary school enrolment increased by 59%.  However progress has not been uniform across the world and <font color="#212100">recent statistics show that it has slowed down since 2005.  As of 2011, as many as 57 million children, 54% of them girls, remain out of school.  Lower enrolment and primary school completion rates for girls remain a particular problem in sub Saharan Africa.</font>Being a girl, coming from a conflict affected region, being disabled, and having to engage in child labour are identified as the main factors which work against children&rsquo;s education.</p><p>Ireland recognises from our own history that improving access to quality education is central to efforts to reduce poverty and promote inclusive economic growth. A commitment to improving access to education, in line with the MDGs, is a central priority of the Irish Aid programme. In 2012, we allocated some &euro;33.9 million to education programmes in developing countries.  Ireland&rsquo;s new policy on International Development, <i>One World, One Future,</i>reaffirms our commitment to education, and especially the importance of focusing on the education of girls and ensuring that improvements in education quality accompany efforts to increase access to education in developing countries. </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s strategy in supporting the achievement of the second MDG is to focus on the most marginalised communities and those that have been left behind to date. We support national governments in our partner countries to build sustainable education systems; we focus strongly on awareness-raising to address gender based violence in schools; we support the work of Non-Governmental Organisations in programmes to improve educational infrastructure and the school learning environment.  Child labour, both domestic and industrial, is a major barrier to childhood development. Ireland provides substantial support to international efforts to eliminate child labour through Irish Aid&rsquo;s assistance to the International Labour Organisation&rsquo;s <i>Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour</i>.</p><p>Overall, Irish Aid is supporting the <i>&rsquo;Decent Work Agenda&rsquo; </i>of the<i></i>International Labour Organisation (ILO) in a partnership programme that covers the four year period 2012-2015. The <i>Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour</i>is one of four priority focus areas for Irish Aid&rsquo;s support to the ILO. During 2014 and 2015, our support will facilitate the ILO in its efforts at eliminating the worst forms of child labour from tobacco growing in Malawi and Zambia, quarrying in India, artisanal fishing in Ghana and stone-breaking in Benin.</p></reply>

I recalled that the Northern Ireland Executive Parties and both governments agree about the importance of addressing the needs of all victims.</p><p>  I note the Secretary of State&rsquo;s decision not to initiate a review of the La Mon case and wish to also recall at this time the suffering of the families of those killed and injured in that dreadful atrocity.  Incidents such as Ballymurphy and La Mon must be dealt with.  There is an urgent need for a comprehensive framework for dealing with the legacy of the past and the needs of those who have lost family members to violence must be to the forefront of that process.</p></reply>

As I stated in response to Question No. 13 of 8 April 2014, the system of financial regulation has been radically overhauled since the financial crisis. Furthermore, the Governor of the Central Bank last week appeared before the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and outlined the extensive changes introduced to the Central Bank since his appointment.</p><p>  Notwithstanding these important changes, this Government has introduced legislation to allow for a Banking Inquiry into all of the issues which led to the collapse of the banking system. An important principle embodied in the legislation is the responsibility assigned exclusively to the Houses themselves for determining the requirement for an inquiry, initiating it and agreeing its terms of reference as well as its procedural and organisational aspects.  In the circumstances I do not wish to comment at this stage on what is essentially a matter for the terms of reference of the inquiry.</p></reply>

This relates to the exemption under section 8 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended), which is the exemption to which the Deputy refers. It was originally intended that this exemption would only apply to first-time buyers, however, the exemption was deemed by Revenue to benefit any buyer, not just a first-time buyer.</p><p>  The relief is available to a person who purchased a second hand house in 2013 and occupies it as a sole or main residence. The exemption will apply up to the end of 2016, provided the purchaser does not sell or otherwise transfer ownership of the property and continues to live in it as his or her sole or main residence. Accordingly, there will be some occasions where a purchaser of a second hand property in 2013 will not qualify for the exemption, for example, where the property is being let by the purchaser.</p><p>  Revenue has advised me that the section 8 exemption applies to a clearly defined group of property owners within three broad categories:</p><p>  (1) Those that purchased a residential property between 1 January 2013 and 1 May 2013 and paid the 2013 LPT liability. These purchasers may be entitled to a refund of the 2013 payment and, subject to certain conditions, may be exempt for 2014 to 2016 LPT;</p><p>  (2) Those that purchased a residential property between 2 May 2013 and 1 November where the purchaser paid the 2014 LPT liability. These purchasers may be entitled to a refund of the LPT for 2014 and, subject to certain conditions, may be entitled to an exemption for 2015 and 2016 LPT; and</p><p>  (3) Those that purchased a residential property between 2 November 2013 and 31 December 2013. These purchasers, subject to certain conditions, may be entitled to an exemption for 2015 and 2016 LPT.</p><p>  Revenue has made significant progress in identifying individuals who bought in 2013 and who may be entitled to claim the exemption. It is estimated that approximately 3,000 property owners may be entitled to relief under Section 8. Revenue has written to approximately 1,500 property owners and 600 claims to exemption have been submitted. It is evident, on foot of the contacts already made, that many individuals who purchased properties in 2013 do not meet the qualifying conditions for the relief.  Up to half of the claims received have resulted in refunds or in offset of some or all of the overpayment to the property owner's LPT liability (on another property) or to satisfy other tax liabilities. </p><p>  Revenue will contact the remaining 1,500 individuals in the near future to invite them to submit claims to exemption should they qualify for relief.  Revenue has also advised that an accurate timeline for the completion of the process will only be available when those who are contacted respond by claiming the section 8 exemption for 2013 and/or 2014, as appropriate.</p></reply>

The Department of the Environment undertook to provide such a robust mechanism in conjunction with the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI). Such a mechanism is in place since June 2011 and the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012 specify the environmental standards for coal placed on the market and provide the regulatory framework in relation to the distribution and sale of coal in the State.  The application of the carbon tax to solid fuels was further postponed in 2012 given the overall tax increases in Budget 2012 including in the standard rate of VAT.</p><p>Budget 2013 commenced the application of carbon tax to solid fuels but I chose not to introduce the carbon tax on solid fuels until after the 2012/2103 winter period and opted to introduce the tax in two phases i.e. &euro;10 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>from 1 May 2013 and a further &euro;10 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>from 1 May 2014 thus bringing the carbon tax on solid fuels in line with that on all other fossil fuels i.e. at &euro;20 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>.  The introduction of Carbon Tax was about sending a price signal that there is a cost associated with the consumption of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment. It should also be noted that solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels. As a result they are considered the dirtiest fuels and given the environmental impact it is important that they are taxed.</p><p>While tax increases are unpopular, where Member States are under fiscal pressure, it makes sense to increase taxes in areas where some benefits can arise; in this instance a carbon tax promotes energy efficiency, reduces emissions and reduces our dependence on imported fossil fuels.  Accordingly I do not intend to reverse the further increase of &euro;10 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>emissions from 1 May 2014.</p></reply>

At this time less than 10% of all credit unions have a restriction in place which limits the total amount of lending within the month, while close to 40% of all credit unions have a restriction on commercial lending activity.</p><p>  For those credit unions where there is an individual loan size restriction in place, the level at which the limit is imposed ensures that the vast majority of those credit unions can continue to make loans significantly greater than the average loan for the sector of just above &euro;6,000. Lending restrictions are, in most cases, intended to be short-term in nature and kept in place until the credit union has addressed the issues giving rise to the particular concerns advised to the credit union. These restrictions are reviewed on a regular basis.</p><p>  Section 35(2) of the Credit Union Act, 1997 permits a credit union to have up to 30% of its loan book outstanding for more than 5 years and up to 10% of its loan book outstanding for more than 10 years. Based on the most recent information provided by credit unions  to the Central Bank in the December 2013 quarterly prudential returns, average lending over 5 years as a percentage of gross loans was some 11%, while average lending over 10 years as a percentage of gross loans was about 2%. These figures indicate that, in general, credit unions are currently well within the limits as set down in the 1997 Act.</p><p>  On foot of recommendations from the Commission on Credit Unions, section 11 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 substantially amends section 35 of the 1997 Act. Section 11 will be commenced in tandem with the new Central Bank regulations, which are to be introduced as part of the tiered regulatory approach recommended by the Commission.  This tiered approach will address a range of areas including lending, investments, savings, borrowings, additional services, reserves and liquidity.  The structure of the tiered regulatory approach has not yet been agreed. The Central Bank has issued a consultation paper on the  proposed tiered regulatory approach in order to provide an opportunity for stakeholders to set out their views across a range of issues. The consultation process was extended by one month to 31 March 2014, at the request of sector stakeholders. The Central Bank is currently considering over 160 submissions received and will communicate with credit unions and other stakeholders in relation to the proposed next steps.</p><p>  I have, on a number of occasions, highlighted  the Governments' recognition of the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in this country and also the importance of getting lending going in the economy. However, the issue of lending needs to be constructively considered in order to ensure a viable credit union sector into the future.</p></reply>

The meeting was attended by a representative from the MFSA, who advised the Central Bank of Ireland on developments.</p><p>While the position on each policy is for the liquidator to decide in due course, policyholders will be given cancellation notification during which period cover will remain in force.  While policies will remain valid until the required notice period has been served, it is important to be clear that the amounts due under any claims may not be fully recoverable in all circumstances. The Central Bank has written to over 230 brokers and firms who were offering policies from Setanta Insurance to consumers to require them to immediately contact any Setanta policyholder and inform them of the urgency to make alternative motor insurance arrangements.</p><p>Claims on personal insurance policies will be payable from the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF).  Claimants will be eligible for 65% of the amount due or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser. Under Section 3.6 of the Insurance Amendment Act 1964 (as amended) first party claims by a body corporate or unincorporated body are not covered by the ICF.  The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland (&quot;MIBI&quot;) is a non-profit-making organisation which was established by Agreement between the Government and those companies underwriting motor insurance in Ireland. The principal role of MIBI is to compensate innocent victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles. If, for legal reasons, MIBI is not in a position to accept a claim, these third party claims will be eligible to proceed for consideration by the High Court for compensation from the ICF, payments from the Fund being subject to the limits set out above.</p><p>The refund of premiums for commercial and personal insurance policies is not covered by the ICF or MIBI. A portion of the premium refunds may, however, be available upon completion of the Setanta liquidation. Until otherwise advised those policyholders which have been affected by the collapse should continue to contact to Setanta Insurance Services Limited at 0818 255 255 (if calling from outside Ireland +353 1 897 6300) or on .</p></reply>

Revenue confirmed that as a result of a comprehensive data matching exercise they have matched 1.27 million properties, for which the Household Charge (HHC) was paid, to the LPT register.  As the Deputy is aware, from Revenue published statistics, LPT returns were made in respect of 1.69 million properties (other than Local Authority/Social Housing).  It is absolutely essential from a fairness perspective to the vast majority of house owners who have paid the HHC and LPT that Revenue follows through on those who have not.</p><p>In this context Revenue has identified a database of properties for which the Household Charge (HHC) is still outstanding but has stated at all times that the database is not 100% accurate for a number of reasons. The two main reasons are:</p><p>- The LGMA Register captured the name of the person who paid the HHC rather than the owner of the property, therefore, for example, where a son or daughter paid the HHC on behalf of a parent and particularly where the address of the property was a 'non-unique' rural address, Revenue may not have been able to match the HHC payment to the right property.</p><p>- The legislative basis for both the HHC and LPT are different. Some properties that are liable for LPT were exempt from the HHC and, unlike LPT, property owners were not actually required to make a claim for exemption from HHC.  For that reason, Revenue could not identify every property that was exempt from HHC through the cross-referencing process.</p><p>In addition there are some examples where the LGMA register did not fully record situations where the HHC was paid to a Local Authority directly.  In all their communications with property owners during the current compliance campaign, the Revenue Commissioners have highlighted that these inconsistencies exist and have outlined the action that owners need to take if the HHC is not due. </p><p>Revenue has provided a new online service to facilitate property owners to make payment, or to indicate that they have already paid or are exempt. Any person who has paid or is exempt from the HHC and have received a reminder letter should contact Revenue through the online LPT service at www.revenue.ie or by calling the LPT Helpline and their HHC record will be updated once contact is made online or through the Helpline service.  The LPT Helpline service at 1890200255 has been open on an extended basis, to facilitate HHC queries, from 8am to 8pm since Tuesday 22 April. </p><p>For the Deputy's information, on 18 February Revenue announced a six-week period to enable those who had not paid the HHC to pay or arrange payment of the &euro;200 charge to prevent any further interest and penalties. It carried out a significant media campaign advising people that they could check if they were on the arrears database by going online at . In the current phase of the campaign Revenue is writing to those property owners on the arrears database. This letter does four things:</p><p>- tells the property owner that per Revenue's records the property is on the arrears database,</p><p>- advises property owners  who had paid the HHC or whose property was not liable for the HHC to contact Revenue to correct the database,</p><p>- advises those who are liable to pay the charge to prevent additional interest accruing, and</p><p>- advises those who do not, of the next steps that Revenue will take to collect the charge.</p><p>In no sense could this approach amount to issuing threatening letters. The letters are a necessary step in ensuring compliance with the Household Charge.  Revenue has matched the vast majority of those who have paid the HHC. However, any data matching exercise of this type will not succeed in 100% matching and this is why Revenue is writing to those on the database to enable them tell Revenue that they have paid the HHC.</p><p>In relation to the Deputy's question regarding refunds of HHC, any refund claims relating to HHC arrears paid to Revenue on or after 1st July 2013 will be repaid in accordance with Section 26 of the 2012 Finance (Local Property Tax) Act (as amended). A refund will be issued where a claim is submitted to Revenue and is approved for repayment or where an overpayment is identified by Revenue.</p><p>Regarding the Deputy's reference to my Department contacting the Comptroller and Auditor General, as the Deputy will have seen from the foregoing there was no question of a lapse in oversight. There are perfectly valid reasons why Revenue has been unable to fully identify those who have paid the HHC or are exempt, or entitled to a waiver, from the charge and Revenue has stated this at all times in relation to LPT and the HHC arrears. I am very satisfied that Revenue has done an excellent job in relation to all aspects of LPT, including securing a 94% compliance rate in relation to  2013 LPT.  I have no doubt that the C&amp;amp;AG will, in the course of its annual review of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, examine various aspects of the introduction of LPT and Revenue will, as they always do, co-operate fully with the C&amp;amp;AG and will seek to constantly improve its systems and processes in light of live operational experience.</p><p>I am satisfied that Revenue has committed significant resources to compile as accurately as possible details of HHC non-compliant property owners. They have sought to fully explain why a letter may, despite their best efforts, have issued to a compliant property owner. Considering the number of property owners receiving correspondence in connection with the current compliance campaign, the level of error being reported by property owners to the LPT Branch, other than those explained by me earlier, is a very small proportion of the overall numbers.</p></reply>

Retrospective funding is not a feature of the scheme and approval can only be given when the necessary documentation is submitted with the application form for processing by my officials.

In keeping with this principle, additional resources provided in the education system are allocated on the basis of identified individual educational need rather than that of ethnic or cultural background.</p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that a decision was taken by the previous Government as part of the December 2010 budgetary process that Traveller pupils who are eligible for learning support teaching should receive this tuition through the existing learning support provision in schools. This is in keeping with the policy of inclusion and the 2006 report.  The General Allocation Model, which provides additional learning support and resource teaching allocations for primary schools, was updated for all primary schools from the 2012/13 school year and now includes the Traveller pupils who had previously been supported by Resource Teacher for Traveller (RTT) posts under the General Allocation Model.</p><p>  Limited alleviation measures were put in place to assist schools who had high concentrations of Traveller pupils previously supported by Resource Teacher for Traveller posts/hours, in the context of the limited resources available. A total of 141 posts have been allocated to schools for this purpose. 81 posts were used to readjust Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) allocations to include Traveller pupils previously supported by Resource Teacher for Traveller posts.  38 alleviation posts were provided for schools that had high numbers or concentrations of Traveller pupils who were previously supported by RTT posts and a further 22 alleviation posts were allocated to schools who had the highest percentage of traveller pupils previously supported by RTT posts, in comparison to other schools, taking into account their overall pupil populations, and who had not qualified for the first round of alleviation posts.</p></reply>

In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or on the basis of some other criterion. The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to publish its enrolment policy.</p><p>  Existing equality legislation, which outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values. The legislation provides that any school that has this objective may admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students. Such a school can also refuse to admit a student who is not of that religion, provided it can prove that this refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school. </p><p>  I have published a draft General Scheme for an Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, 2013 as well as Draft Regulations on Content of Policy and Draft Regulations on Admission Process for discussion ahead of enacting legislation. These are available on the Department's website. The Government recently gave approval for drafting the Education (Admissions to Schools) Bill 2014. I have stated that my aim in bringing forward legislative proposals in relation to school admission is to improve the admissions process and to ensure that the way schools decide on applications is structured, fair and transparent.</p></reply>

This is updated on a regular basis. </p><p>  The 5 year School Construction Plan announced on 9 March 2012 (which is also detailed on the website), provides for a &euro;2 billion school capital investment programme to 2016, of which &euro;1.5 billion is being allocated to fund major school projects with the balance needed for the additional accommodation scheme, the prefab replacement initiative, the acquisition of sites and other works. The primary aim at the core of the Five Year Plan is focussed on meeting demographic demands to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers. The Plan prioritises major school projects in areas where future significant demographic changes have been identified.</p><p>  Further to the Five Year Plan, my Department is committed to publishing a detailed annual programme in relation to individual major school projects commencing construction. In December 2011, details of 56 major school building projects scheduled to commence construction in 2012, the first year of the Plan, were published. In December 2012, details of 50 major school building projects were announced to commence construction in 2013, the second year of the Plan (both Plans available on my Department's website). Details of the building projects that are projected to commence construction in 2014 will be announced later this year. </p><p>  In addition, due to additional funding made available for the schools' building programme as part of the Government's &quot;Investing in Infrastructure &amp;amp; Jobs&quot; package announced earlier this year, 28 school projects that were not contained in the 5 year programme but have completed extensive architectural planning are now being progressed to tender and construction.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that under the Prefab Replacement Initiative 2012, approval was given to 170 schools nationally to replace 458 prefab units with permanent accommodation. In excess of &euro;42 million was allocated for this initiative. In June 2013, I announced a further initiative to replace prefab units with permanent accommodation. A total of &euro;15 million has been allocated in 2013/2014 for this purpose. Forty-six schools, with 115 prefab units, will be offered grants to provide the new facilities. Replacing prefabs is part of this Government's &euro;475 million education infrastructure plan for 2014. The Plan will provide modern, high quality accommodation for pupils and teachers. The Deputy will also be aware of my announcement on 7th November of an additional &euro;70 million for school improvement works. In addition, details of applications for devloved funding for the provision of additional accommodation may be viewed on my Department's website.</p></reply>

My letter to the HEA and their report is published on .  It sets out all the proposed mergers and alignments.  In summary, three groups of institutes of technology have expressed an interest to merge and apply to become technological universities.  The three groups are:   </p><p>1. Cork Institute of Technology; Institute of Technology Tralee</p><p>2.  Waterford Institute of Technology; Institute of Technology Carlow</p><p>3.  Dublin Institute of Technology; Institute of Technology Blanchardstown; Institute of Technology Tallaght</p><p>The three applicant groups are currently developing detailed plans towards merger.  When these are complete they will submit them to the Higher Education Authority. Other mergers/alignments will arise from the Initial Teacher Education Review which recommended the creation of six centres of excellence in teacher education.  The Froebel Institute has now been incorporated into NUI Maynooth.  Significant progress has been made towards the other centres of excellence.</p></reply>

I have already signalled my intention to increase the Student Contribution by &euro;250 each year hereafter until the 2015/16 academic year when the contribution will stand at &euro;3,000. The Contribution is paid by the Exchequer in respect of students who qualify under my Department's Student Grant Scheme (some 40%). </p><p>  Work is ongoing between my Department and the Higher Education Authority (HEA) on future funding policy for higher education.This builds upon the substantial amount of work already undertaken by the HEA. The objective is to identify a range of approaches that, combined, will achieve a sustainable funding base to address the continual expansion of the sector while protecting the quality of education. </p><p>  The Deputy also refers to further education where Budget 2011 provided for the introduction of a &euro;200 annual Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) programme participant contribution. This was introduced at the start of the 2011/2012 academic year and the same charge has applied each year since then.  Full medical card holders (in their own right and their dependent children), those eligible under the student grant scheme and those in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) or Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) allowances are exempt from paying the contribution.  Decisions in relation to funding matters such as these are generally made as part of the annual Estimates process.</p></reply>

Final reports on the Dell, Waterford Crystal, SR Technics and NACE 41, 43 &amp;amp; 71 construction sub-sector EGF programmes were submitted to the European Commission between 23 December 2011 and 7 December 2012 as required under the EU EGF Regulation No. 1927 of 2006 as amended by EU EGF Regulation No. 546 of 2009.  Total expenditure under these six programmes was &euro;55,955,469.80, of which the EU co-financed contribution was &euro;36,371,055.37.  The final reports for these EGF programmes along with related post-programme labour market outcome information is publicly available at the Department's dedicated website .</p><p>  Both EU and the national contributions were spent in all EGF programmes on a wide variety of measures including occupational guidance, training (including apprenticeship supports as appropriate) further education, higher education and enterprise supports, provided to a total of 9,783 redundant workers.  The Department is preparing a final report on the Talk Talk EGF programme which ended on 28 February 2014 and for which &euro;2,696,382 was received in EU co-funding, which is required to be submitted to the Commission by 28 August 2014. The EGF Regulation then provides for the European Commission to wind up the financial contribution from the EGF within a further 6 months.

The Intercultural Education Strategy was influenced by the Report and Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy published in 2006. Inclusion was a core principle of that report as was the provision of an education that affirms and supports Travellers and their culture. </p><p>  The Irish Traveller Movement initiated the Yellow Flag Programme. It is a programme of equality and diversity for both primary and post-primary schools which promotes and supports diversity. In the past few years, the number of schools in the Yellow Flag programme has been growing steadily with my Department's encouragement.  Ireland also became a full member of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance in 2011. This body helps to promote respect for nomadic cultures through raising awareness of the extermination of European groups like the Roma and Sinti, as well as of the Shoah against Jews.</p><p>  The greater flexibility anticipated in current curricular reforms will also support schools, teachers, and students in engaging with historical and cultural studies which relate in a meaningful way, to their own interests and backgrounds.  At primary level, schools are expected to provide a broad and balanced curriculum that reflects the interests of their pupils and the school's context. The importance of promoting interculturalism within the school is also highlighted by this DES.  The Primary Curriculum 1999 is complemented by Guidelines on Traveller Education in Primary Schools (DES, 2002) and Intercultural Education in the Primary School (NCCA, 2005). These guidelines promote an intercultural approach in the classroom and provide practical examples of how intercultural themes, including Traveller culture, can be accommodated through the various curriculum areas. </p><p>The Framework for Junior Cycle which I published in October 2012 has eight principles - one of which is inclusive education - whereby the educational experience is inclusive of all students and contributes to equality of opportunity, participation and outcomes for all.  Inclusion in all its forms, including Travellers, is a key component of our primary and post-primary education.</p></reply>

School inspections include evaluation of the quality of learning in literacy and numeracy. Evaluation reports identify good educational practice in relation to literacy and numeracy development and provide advice to teachers and schools as to how the quality of provision for these skills can be improved.</p><p>  The Inspectorate also supports schools in the development of their school self-evaluation (SSE) processes in relation to literacy and numeracy. Since 2012, the Inspectorate has developed Guidelines, tools, materials and a dedicated website to support SSE. During 2012/13, it facilitated whole-staff advisory SSE visits to 3029 primary and 666 post-primary schools.  In its advisory capacity, the Inspectorate works with the national support services on the design and content of professional development supports that are delivered to schools and teachers in relation to literacy and numeracy. It also contributes to the development of new specifications for English, Maths and Irish at primary and post-primary level.</p></reply>

The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.

This new model is called Droichead and it is a pilot project which will run from 2013 to 2016 and is being independently researched by the ESRI (Economic and Social Research Institute). Training for Professional Support Teams (PST) involved in the Droichead pilot, at school level, is provided by the National Induction Programme for Teachers (NIPT).  Droichead is grounded in the belief that the people best placed to conduct the formal welcome into the profession are experienced fellow professionals, who know what is involved in teaching and learning in their school.  These fellow professionals will themselves be supported through the provision of a range of structures and resources.</p><p>  There are 52 participating schools in the current academic year - 12 at Primary and 40 at Post Primary.  The number of Newly Qualified Teachers (NQTs) involved in the process is 76, 21 of these at Primary and 55 at Post Primary.  So far for the next academic year of 2014/15 there are expressions of interest in the Project from 38 Primary Schools and 18 Post Primary Schools.</p></reply>

Contracts are awarded following a competitive process conducted in compliance with the established procurement rules and procedures.</p><p>Under EU Directives on public procurement public works, supplies and service contracts above certain thresholds must be advertised on the Official Journal of the EU and awarded on the basis of objective and non-restrictive criteria. For works contracts the threshold is &euro;5.186 million; for supplies and service contracts awarded by Government Departments the threshold is &euro;134,000 and for the remainder of public bodies the threshold is &euro;207,000. The threshold for supplies and service contracts of entities operating in utility sectors (water, energy, transport and postal) is &euro;414,000. For contracts below these thresholds, the general requirement is that they be advertised on the national public procurement website or, depending on value, awarded on the basis of a competitive process of direct invitation to an adequate number of suitable suppliers.</p><p>The aim of these European rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules</p><p>The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) is responsible for producing annual statistical information in relation to above-EU threshold procurement activity by the Irish public sector and for providing these statistics to the European Commission. The EU average for cross border activity in relation to above threshold procurements is 1.4%. I am informed that the figure of 28% is not based on OGP data. The following information has been complied by the OGP and is based on data available on above EU threshold awards:</p><p>- In 2011, 10.55% (valued at &euro;240 million) of the total known awarded contracts above threshold by the State went to non-domestic companies. This represents less than 5% of the overall annual public procurement spend (approximately &euro;13.1 billion). I am advised by the OGP that more up to date data on above EU threshold contracts for 2012 and 2013 will be available later this year; </p><p>- Analysis of cross border procurement by country, carried out by the EU Commission in 2012, shows that small countries tend to award more cross border contracts (the range is between 5 and 15% in 2011). The comparable figure for Ireland is 10.55%.  In Ireland's case the reasons for this level of cross border procurement would include:</p><p>- There are a significant number of procurement categories which are not supplied locally (i.e. fuel, vehicles, heavy machinery, pharmaceuticals, IT and certain telecommunications equipment);</p><p>- The fact that the vast majority of public procurement opportunities in Ireland are advertised in the English language makes our tender documents accessible to an increasing number of economic operators across Europe, for whom English is the preferred second language;</p><p>In terms of the overall data, the UK, France, Spain, Germany, Poland and Italy are responsible for about three quarters of all EU public procurement, both in number of contracts and in value. This distorts the average figure in favour of large economies that have natural resources and heavy industry base capable of meeting the majority of their national public procurement needs.</p><p>It is important to remember that open tendering is a two way street and that it provides Irish companies with opportunities to compete abroad. The public procurement market in the EU is estimated to be valued in excess of &euro;2.4 trillion. In this regard, it is worth pointing out that the open market regime offers opportunities for Irish companies to win business abroad and reliable EU studies indicate that many Irish businesses are successful in this regard.</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of the EU rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds such as nationality, organisational size, etc. and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.</p><p>The Government is committed to maximising procurement opportunities which actively assist job growth and benefit the wider economy.  The public sector has an immense purchasing power, spending in the region of &euro;8.5 billion per annum on goods and services. This is in addition to expenditure on public works.  This level of expenditure by the public sector affords significant business opportunities for firms that can supply the products and services that are required by public bodies.</p><p>The Government also acknowledges the significant role that SMEs play in the Irish economy and is committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement and the opportunities presenting.  In order to encourage greater SME participation the Office of Government Procurement has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'Meet the Buyer' events hosted nationwide.  These 'Meet the Buyer' events are run in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and InterTrade-Ireland. To date the OGP has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide.  These events afforded suppliers an opportunity to meet and discuss the issues with public service buyers and provide networking opportunities for suppliers and encourage consortia-building.</p><p>My Department has also recently finished reviewing and updating existing guidelines and procedures aimed at promoting SME participation in public procurement.  Circular 10/14, launched on 17 April, sets out new initiatives aimed at opening up opportunities for small businesses to bid for State business.  These new guidelines are aimed at reducing the administrative burden on businesses that want to tender for public contracts. The guidelines promote the setting of relevant and proportionate financial capacity, turnover and insurance levels for tendering firms and the sub-dividing larger contracts into lots, where appropriate, to enable SMEs to bid for these opportunities. The guidelines also encourage SMEs to form consortia where they are not of sufficient scale to tender in their own right and to register on to ensure maximum exposure to tendering opportunities.</p><p>The guidelines accelerate some of the key business-friendly initiatives included under the new EU Public Procurement Directive, currently being transposed by my Department.  The SME Working Group, established under the Government's Action Plan for Jobs, was consulted on the new Guidelines.  The SME Working Group is chaired by the Office of Government Procurement and includes representatives from ISME, IBEC, Inter Trade Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the Competition Authority, the Small Firms Association, Chambers Ireland and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Ireland. The new Circular has been broadly welcomed by industry representative associations.</p><p>The reform of public procurement across the public service is on-going and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business.  The Office of Government Procurement will continue to work with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.</p></reply>

This increased discharge would only commence when the flood level would threaten the railway line, at which point much of the land in the area would already be flooded.  The degree of benefit to be conferred on agricultural lands at Ballycar would therefore be insignificant, and would almost certainly be exceeded by the losses arising from the probable worsening of flooding on the lands downstream.</p><p>  It is a matter for the local authorities in the first instance to investigate and address flooding issues locally.  It is therefore a matter for Clare County Council to consider the question of raising the public road to facilitate access to the houses near Ballycar.

These measures are being delivered by a number of public sector bodies, including Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland which come under the remit of my Department, and the Office of Government Procurement (OGP).  My Department&rsquo;s officials are also closely involved in supporting SMEs&rsquo; access to procurement through their involvement in a number of the Action Plan measures and through their representation on a High Level Group on SME Access to Procurement which is chaired by the Government&rsquo;s Chief Procurement Officer.</p><p>  Actions to be taken in 2014 to support SMEs in accessing procurement opportunities include:</p><p>  - encouraging SMEs to register on the State&rsquo;s eTenders website so that they can be alerted to up-coming tender notices, </p><p>  - increasing SME awareness of procurement opportunities through various public events and workshops, </p><p>  - providing information to SMEs on approaches to multiparty tendering, and </p><p>  - encouraging collaboration between SMEs in bidding for contracts.</p><p>  InterTradeIreland, in collaboration with the OGP, hosted a number of &ldquo;Meet the Buyer&rdquo; events in 2013 to give SMEs an overview of the all-island public procurement market and the opportunities that are available.  These events facilitate businesses networking, and provide opportunities for companies to form joint ventures and identify sub-contracting opportunities. The 2013 events included specific information sessions on &ldquo;Consortia Building&rdquo;, which outline the practicalities, processes and benefits of joint ventures and consortia bidding. InterTradeIreland intends to hold two further &ldquo;Meet the Buyer&rdquo; events in 2014.</p><p>  The agency will also continue its programme of procurement training for SMEs by delivering a number of &ldquo;Go-2-Tender&rdquo; and &ldquo;Advanced Go-2-Tender&rdquo; workshops on an all-island basis to approximately 330 companies during 2014.  Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland will develop regional consortia building programmes this year to encourage collaboration between SMEs in bidding for and winning public tenders.  In addition, as part of the Action Plan for Jobs, the Competition Authority and the OGP will be producing guidance on consortium bidding in compliance with competition and procurement law, by the end of 2014.</p><p>  The Minister of State with special responsibility for Public Service Reform and the Office of Public Works, Brian Hayes TD, launched new public procurement guidelines last month (Circular 10/14), which are intended to make it easier for SMEs to bid for work across the public sector.  The new guidelines promote the setting of relevant and proportionate criteria for tendering firms and the sub-dividing larger contracts into lots, where possible, to enable SMEs to bid for these opportunities.  The guidelines also encourage SMEs to form consortia where they are not of sufficient scale to tender in their own right.</p></reply>

The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs includes a commitment to introduce an SBIR programme on a pilot basis in Ireland by identifying and commencing a suitable pilot.  Following engagement with a number of public sector bodies, Enterprise Ireland has identified a project which will be piloted with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and ESB.</p><p>  The objective of the pilot is to successfully deliver the first SBIR project in Ireland, while developing guidelines and a blueprint to promote the model to other contracting authorities in due course.  Any contracting authority, including a Local Authority, can implement an SBIR project under pre-commercial procurement rules.  Enterprise Ireland is currently meeting with a number of contracting authorities that are interested in discussing possible SBIR projects and is available to meet with any Local Authority which is interested in finding out more about the process.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 77,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. </p><p>Rent supplement is a demand let scheme and recipient numbers reached an unprecedented high with a peak of over 97,000 during 2011. There are currently approximately 77,000 rent supplement recipients with the number of recipients falling by almost 20,000 during this period.  A detailed breakdown on the reason customers exit rent supplement and details of their current status is not available.  However, the numbers in receipt of the scheme have continued to reduce since the peak experienced in 2011 in line with the improving trends in the economy and the reduction in the live register. As of April 2014, some 33,200 persons on the live register are in receipt of rent supplement compared to a figure of 48,000 in August 2011. </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to transfer responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need to local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Officials are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, in piloting HAP in Limerick with further roll out to selected local authorities during the year. It should also be noted that since December 2011, almost 10,750 long term rent supplement cases have been transferred to local authority sponsored solutions, including the Rental Accommodation Scheme.</p><p>The number of rent supplement recipients by claim duration at end April 2014 is provided in the tabular statement. </p><p><b>Number of Recipients of Rent Supplement by Claim Duration, End of April 2014</b><table><tr><th>Duration in Months (1)</th><th>Recipients (2)</th></tr><tr><td>0 to 3</td><td>5,213</td></tr><tr><td>3 to 6</td><td>6,099</td></tr><tr><td>6 to 12</td><td>13,419</td></tr><tr><td>12 to 18</td><td>9,600</td></tr><tr><td>18+</td><td>42,873</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>77,204</td></tr></table>(1) Claims with duration of precisely 3 months are recorded under the 3-6 months heading, claims with duration of precisely 6 months are recorded under the 6-12 months heading and so on.</p><p>(2) This represents unbroken continuous claims only.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-07a.344.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700058#WRQ01400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 to 136, inclusive, together.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and </p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. For example:</p><p>- Eircom is rolling out a &euro;400m investment in a Next Generation Access Fibre Network that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps. Service is already available to over 800,000 addresses, with planned coverage to reach 1.4m addresses by 2016. </p><p>- UPC has invested over &euro;500m in upgrading its cable network. Over 700,000 homes can already access minimum broadband speeds of 120Mbps and up to 200Mbps. Businesses can access speeds of 500Mbps. </p><p>- ESB is engaged in a new project allowing a fibre network to be rolled-out on its existing electricity infrastructure. It is understood that discussions between ESB and Vodafone to form a new Joint Venture Company are at an advanced stage. The company has initial plans to construct a fibre network directly to 450,000 premises outside of Dublin and it is expected that details will be announced over the coming weeks. </p><p>- Mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile broadband services following ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction. There has also been continued investment by all operators in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements. </p><p>- Fixed wireless operators are continuing to invest in high speed point-to-point wireless broadband. </p><p>- The broadcaster Sky has entered the broadband market, increasing choice for consumers.</p><p>Of the estimated 2.3m premises in Ireland, approximately 1.4m are expected to be served by these commercial next generation broadband services over the coming years. </p><p>This accelerated roll out of high speed services by the commercial sector means that the addressable area required by the State intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. The speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. </p><p>On 25 April, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way.</p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build-out will also ensure that fibre is deployed to strategic locations on each route such as schools, business hubs and health facilities. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the comprehensive mapping process currently underway. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. Currently I envisage that a total of 59 areas in County Kerry, 18 areas in County Kildare and 108 areas in County Cork will be included in the proposed fibre build-out. The list is available on my Department's website .</p><p>In tandem with the fibre build-out, the Strategy will include measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services, and the provision of access services in the most remote areas where fibre rollout may be insufficient to stimulate commercial investment or may be cost-prohibitive. </p><p>Intensive design work is ongoing in the Department with a view to publishing an end-to-end implementation strategy later this year, together with the outcome of the mapping exercise which will identify the areas that require intervention. A full public consultation will take place once the strategy is published and EU State Aids clearance will be required for the intervention strategy once finalised. It is expected that the detailed procurement process will take place in 2015 with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in the areas that require intervention as quickly as possible. </p><p>The EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on state aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude member states from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. In this regard it is noted that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out a fibre-based broadband networks in Counties Kerry and Kildare, which includes rolling out those services in Ballybunion and Killorgan in County Kerry and Naas in County Kildare by July 2016.</p><p>I fully share the concerns of local representatives about the quality of broadband in rural areas. I intend to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by ensuring an end-to end market intervention with fibre as a core component. In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, the Government is acknowledging that broadband is the key infrastructure of the 21st century.</p></reply>

Registration as a Quantity Surveyor would not entitle a person to sign the statutory certificates of compliance prescribed under the regulations as the duties of a Quantity Surveyor do not typically extend to building design.  In order to sign the statutory certificates a person must be included on either of the statutory registers of architects or building surveyors, as maintained by the Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland (RIAI) and the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI), respectively, in line with the Building Control Act 2007, or the register of chartered engineers as maintained by Engineers Ireland (EI) under the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland (Charter Amendment) Act 1969. Architects, Building Surveyors and Engineers are the construction professions typically involved in the design of buildings.   </p><p>  Building regulations, subject to certain conditions, do not normally apply to farm buildings comprising a single storey building which is used exclusively for the storage of materials or products, for the accommodation of plant or machinery or in connection with the housing, care or management of livestock.

Under this strategy a policy for shared acquisitions for libraries will be developed, including a national acquisitions consortium for public library print and electronic resources that maximises the cost-effectiveness of expenditure, increases purchasing power and gets the best choice of material to the user in line with government policy.  The <i>Programme for Government</i>identified the role public procurement can play as an instrument to support innovation and allow greater access for SMEs, including micro-Enterprises, to the public sector market. As part of the Public Service Reform Plan, the Government established the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) to drive a new consolidated and integrated approach to public procurement. The OGP is committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement and the opportunities presenting.</p><p>In the context of the reform of the Public Service and the establishment of the Office of Government Procurement, it has been decided to update and strengthen measures aimed at facilitating SME participation in Public Procurement in order to reinforce their application across the public sector. In April 2014, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform issued <i>Circular 10/14: Initiatives to assist SMEs in Public Procurement</i>which has been brought to the notice of the local authority sector and will be implemented by all local authorities. </p><p>The guidance in this circular is designed to further enable SMEs in competing for public contracts. This is in line with EU policy on increased SME participation in public procurement. At all times this guidance is to be implemented by buyers in accordance with the principles of EU law, and in a manner that is fully compliant with EU public procurement law and national guidelines. All public sector procurement contracts within the EU, irrespective of value, are covered by the principles set out in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) of non-discrimination, equal treatment, proportionality and transparency.</p></reply>

Similarly, where an estate has not been completed to the standard outlined in the planning permission and the planning authority has not taken enforcement action within seven years of the expiry of the permission authorising the development, section 180 also provides that the planning authority must initiate taking in charge procedures if requested to do so by a majority of the owners of the properties concerned. The decision as to whether an estate should be taken in charge is ultimately one for the elected members of the planning authority having regard to a report prepared by the Authority&rsquo;s Planning Section. </p><p>  Section 180 was amended in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to provide that a local authority may take in charge an unfinished estate, at the request of the owners of the housing units, at any time after the expiration of the planning permission, in situations where enforcement actions have commenced or where the local authority considers that enforcement action will not result in the satisfactory completion of the estate by the developer. Planning authorities have also been empowered to take in charge part of an estate or some, but not all, of the facilities in an estate.   </p><p>  Section 180 does not contain any provisions in relation to the payment or non-payment of management company fees as this is not directly relevant to the matter of taking in charge. Management companies for residential developments are generally constituted under the Companies Acts and are required to comply with the provisions of company law, which comes within the area of responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation while the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, which contains specific provisions in relation to the governing of management companies in multi-unit developments, falls under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

An Inter-Departmental Working Group was established in October 2013 to advise the Government on the appropriate method for addressing affordability issues which may arise with the introduction of domestic water charges. The Group have taken into account the ESRI study as part of their examination of the issues. The Group comprises my Department and the Departments of the Taoiseach, Social Protection, Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance. I propose to publish the report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group, which includes the work of the ESRI, on my Department&rsquo;s website shortly.   </p><p>The Government has decided, following consideration of proposals in relation to the funding model for Irish Water and taking account of the work of the Inter-Departmental Working Group, to provide a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply. The Government has also decided to provide for an additional free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as child benefit, such that water charges will in effect only apply to adults in such households. The normal consumption is estimated at 38,000 litres annually per child of water supplied and waste water treated and so the allowance being provided will be up to 38,000 litres per annum. This level of consumption will be verified over time through actual data from metering. The Government has also decided that bills will be capped at the assessed charge level for those customers with particular medical conditions which necessitate high water usage. </p><p>The vast majority of household waste is collected by private waste collectors. In the very few areas where local authorities still collect waste, they do so in a market open to competition from private operators. As waste charges represent a fee for a service provided, primarily by the private sector, their amalgamation with other household charges does not arise.  Matters relating to Local Property Tax are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigned the company the necessary powers to allow it to undertake the metering programme. </p><p>The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it.  It also assigns responsibility for the independent economic regulation of Irish Water to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and Irish Water will be subject to the approval of the CER. Where a household is connected to a public water supply but is not connected to a public sewer, the household will only pay for water supply and will not be liable for charges for waste water treatment.</p></reply>

I have asked the Inspector of Prisons to submit his report on the investigation as soon as possible.</p><p>In addition, on 4 April 2014 the Government published the terms of reference for the Commission of Investigation to be Conducted by Mr Justice Fennelly. In the event that any matter arises from the Report of the Inspector of Prisons into all the circumstances surrounding the recording of telephone conversations between prisoners and their solicitors, which appears to require further investigation in the public interest the Commission may investigate and report on same.</p></reply>

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of PDF personnel. The EAG&rsquo;s report was accepted by Government in 1995.  In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA). In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. </p><p>  In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the PDF after 1 January, 1994. A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.</p><p>  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current, level both at home and overseas, on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.</p><p>  The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:- </p><p>-  Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service.</p><p>-  Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years.</p><p>-  Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.</p><p>  With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks. A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter. </p><p>  In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. As the negotiation process with the Representative Association is very much on-going, I would not like to pre-empt or second guess the outcome of current discussions at Conciliation Council.  However, I do understand the concerns this issue raises for enlisted personnel due to be discharged in terms of their personal circumstances and the impact on their families. I am also cognisant of the need for continuing recruitment to the Defence Forces of young and fit men and women so that the Defence Forces can discharge all the roles assigned to them by Government, both at home and overseas. It was for this very reason that this policy was introduced in the first place.</p><p>  As discussions under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration.</p></reply>

As of 1 January 2015 that Regulation is superseded by EU Regulation 1307/2013 and consequently there is no longer any legal basis for the continuation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme in its present form. </p><p>  In developing the shape of the new system of Direct Payments in Ireland, I have been very conscious of the needs of sheep farmers, in particular those who farm on hill and commonage land.  In general, sheep farmers hold low value entitlements under the current Single Payment Scheme and will benefit significantly from the model of convergence that is to be applied in Ireland where those with a low Initial Unit Value will see the value of their entitlements increase over the period of the scheme. </p><p>  When determining the Initial Unit Value of a farmer&rsquo;s entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, Regulation 1307/2013 gives Member States the option to take into account any payment the farmer received in 2014 under Article 68 schemes such as the Grassland Sheep Scheme.  This option is only available where the Member State is not applying voluntary coupled support to the sector concerned under the new CAP.  </p><p>  I have decided to apply this provision in Ireland as a means of safeguarding the value of the payments received under the Grassland Sheep Scheme for those farmers concerned.  The Grassland Sheep Scheme is the only Article 68 scheme that is being incorporated into the calculation of entitlements under the new Basic Payment Scheme.  If such incorporation does not take place the value of such payments would simply remain in the national fund and would be redistributed generally among all farmers who establish entitlements. </p><p>  The incorporation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment into the calculation of a farmer&rsquo;s Initial Unit Value in 2015 will obviously result in a higher entitlement value for the farmers concerned from the start of the Scheme rather than relying solely on the gradual process of convergence to increase the unit value over the five year period up to 2019.  Our analysis confirms that as a result of this provision the group of farmers who receive the Grassland Sheep Scheme will have an immediate financial benefit in 2015 as part of their payment under the Basic Payment Scheme.</p><p>  Over the past two years sheep numbers have stabilised and while the breeding flock declined slightly in 2013, a return to growth is expected in 2014.  I was pleased to note that for the third consecutive year Irish sheep throughput grew, reaching 2.61 million head, a rise of 7%.  These developments led to sheepmeat production rising by around 3% to stand just over 55,000 tonnes.  The total value of Irish sheepmeat exports is estimated to have increased by over 4% in 2013 to reach &euro;220m.</p></reply>

As part of the next Rural Development Programme which will run to 2020, my Department is designing a new scheme to be known as GLAS &ndash; the Green Low-carbon Agri-Environment Scheme.  This scheme proposes a tiered approach to meeting key environmental priorities and is being developed following a wide ranging consultative process with stakeholders. I thank the Irish Wildlife Trust for their involvement in this process.</p><p>  As part of the design and approval process, a detailed ex ante evaluation of the new scheme, along with a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats), and needs assessment, must be submitted to the EU Commission.  Each of these reflects our experience in delivering previous environmental schemes.  In addition, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) and appropriate assessment (AA) are now underway, which will include a further round of public consultation, all led by independent evaluators.  I am satisfied that the process in place will lead to the development of an effective and attractive new agri-environmental scheme that is well informed by earlier experience.</p></reply>

In particular, Traveller students participate in SCP homework clubs which may be organised within Traveller sites and in collaboration with local youth services or Traveller organisations. SCP data estimate that approximately 11% of students participating in the Programme were identified as Travellers.</p><p>The Agency participates in the Traveller Education Strategy Advisory and Consultative Forum under the auspices of the Department of Education and Skills to monitor implementation of this key policy framework for Traveller Education with the objective of improving educational outcomes for Traveller children.

To help address the issue, funding of &euro;260 million is provided annually by my Department to support a number of targeted childcare support programmes that assist parents in accessing quality and affordable childcare.</p><p>  For example, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments or parents in employment who are on low or relatively modest incomes.  My Department also implements the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides one free pre-school year to all eligible children before they commence primary school.</p><p>  Tax incentives for working parents who incur childcare costs were previously proposed, and the issue of tax allowances or credits was considered, prior to the introduction of the targeted childcare supports.  A number of issues emerged at that time which did not favour the introduction of childcare tax relief.  A review of the childcare support programmes is being undertaken by my Department this year with a view to identifying areas where they could be enhanced and improved to ensure the best use of the investment which is currently being made in this area.  All proposals relating to childcare supports will be considered as part of this review.</p></reply>

In addition these nurses would also be in receipt of allowances and other premium payments. There are no plans to review these rates of pay. It is noted that the Agreement specifies that any subsequent appointment following completion of the Graduate Nurse Programme will be to the third point of the staff nurse salary scales and that, under the Agreement, the January 2011 new entrant salary scales have now been assimilated with the scales applicable to those who were in the Public Service prior to January 2011.</p><p>  A major objective of the Graduate Nurse Programme is to put in place more cost-effective service delivery arrangements, having regard to the high rates of expenditure on agency staffing and overtime. The Programme enables the health services to offer 1,000 graduate nurse positions for two years, at a time when job opportunities in the public service are very limited. Therefore it supports the retention of recently qualified graduate nurses and midwives within the Irish health system and enables them to gain valuable work experience and development opportunities post-graduation.</p></reply>

No. 179 of 2004.  Without prejudice to  section 52 of the Health Act, 1970, the functions of the Board, as set out in section 4(1) of that S.I. are as follows: </p><p>  a) to make arrangements with persons, whether resident in the State or elsewhere, for the provision of hospital treatment to such classes of persons as may be determined by the Minister, from time to time;</p><p>  b)  to collect, collate and validate information in relation to persons waiting for hospital treatment and to put in place information systems and procedures for that purpose;</p><p>  c) to furnish whenever it is so required by the Minister or on its own initiative, advice to the Minister on issues relating to its functions under this Article;</p><p>  d) to perform any other function in relation to the purchase of hospital treatment that the Minister may from time to time assign to it.</p><p>  Over the past number of years, the NTPF has evolved from the procurement of treatment for patients to supporting the Special Delivery Unit in the management of issues relating to scheduled care and outpatient attendances. This work is intended to assist in enabling acute hospitals to provide services in a well-planned manner in order to deliver uniformly high standards of clinical care for patients.  There are no current plans to extend the function of the NTPF beyond the remit of hospital treatment.  Under (d) above, the Minister has assigned responsibility to the NTPF to:</p><p>  - develop a national waiting list register;</p><p>  - develop and implement schemes to enable gradual reduction in maximum outpatient first appointment times;</p><p>  - support measures to facilitate improved patient experience times and performance in hospital emergency departments through targeted programmes of support.</p><p>  This work is being done in close co-operation with the SDU, to support their focus on unblocking access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs.  The NTPF also carries out a function in relation to the pricing and inspection of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme (&lsquo;Fair Deal&rsquo;).  As the Deputy is  aware, the Government committed to reform the structures of the health system in &lsquo;Future Health &ndash; A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Services 2012 &ndash; 2015&rsquo;.  My Department is currently working on legislation to put these new structures in place and the role and functions of the NTPF will be considered as part of this work.</p></reply>

The Taxi Regulation Review Group that produced the Taxi Regulation Review Report, 2011, included representatives of the taxi industry and the taxi authority, the NTA, and its recommendations were widely publicised to the industry, including through the NTA's website and industry updates.  Originally, it was intended that the measure would be introduced with effect from 1st January 2013 by way of regulations to be made by the NTA. However, it was concluded that it would be more appropriate to include such a provision in primary legislation as part of the Taxi Regulation Act, 2013, that was enacted on 23rd October 2013. Consequently the industry has had an 18 month period longer than envisaged under the Taxi Regulation Review Report under which transfers have been allowed to take place.</p></reply>

Agenda item 2 was titled "Consideration of the Remuneration Report" and was an advisory, non-binding resolution.</p><p>  The company's performance has improved significantly under Mr Mueller's stewardship and his overall remuneration package is what would be expected in a company of Aer Lingus' size and profitability. However, the decision to vote against follows my earlier indication of concern about the increased pension contribution in 2013 for the Chief Executive from 25% of his basic salary to 40%, at a time when the serious funding problem in the company&rsquo;s pension scheme remains unresolved.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the remuneration report was approved by a small majority.  While many other shareholders supported the government's position, most did not.  This should be borne in mind when it comes to future votes on other significant matters. Aer Lingus is a public company listed on the stock market not semi-state.</p></reply>

There have been many requests over the years to extend the use of bus lanes to other categories of road user.  These include limousines and hackneys, multi-occupancy vehicles and motorcycles.  My Department has rejected these requests in light of the original reason for the creation of bus lanes.  My view remains that the use of bus lanes should not be extended in any way which would undermine their original purpose through adding to congestion in these lanes.</p></reply>

Although there is no exemption for vintage vehicles, such vehicles are tested to the standards that the vehicles concerned were originally designed to meet.     </p><p>  Regular testing ensures that all commercial vehicles, regardless of age, are maintained to a minimum standard of roadworthiness. Vintage veteran vehicles, even if only covering low mileage, may still have roadworthiness concerns such as perishing of rubber components or seizure of brake actuators following periods of inactivity.  To exclude any category of vehicle from annual Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness Test based solely on the declared usage of the vehicle could have road safety implications. It could also lead to the anomalous situation whereby vintage vehicles being used commercially may unfairly seek to claim an exemption from roadworthiness testing.</p><p>  In relation to pre-1980 vintage cars, the Road Traffic (National Car Test) Regulations 2009, S.I. 567 of 2009, exempt cars first registered prior to 1 January 1980 from the NCT.  However, if such a car is used as a Small Public Service Vehicle it must be tested regardless of its age. As with vintage trucks, such cars are tested to the standards that they were originally designed to meet.  In accordance with Action 59 of the Road Safety Strategy 2013-2020, the RSA will conduct a review of the roadworthiness testing of vintage vehicles to determine the safety case and cost benefits, if any, for the inclusion or exclusion of such vehicles in roadworthiness testing. I have asked the RSA to bring forward this review and have it completed before the end of the year.</p></reply>

The resolution of the funding difficulties in the scheme is primarily a matter for the trustees, the members of the scheme, the companies participating in the scheme and the regulator of such pension schemes - the Pensions Authority (formerly the Pensions Board).  Pension schemes are closely regulated under Irish and European pension law and the Pensions Authority is the statutory regulator in Ireland.  There are prescribed procedures and limitations in place governing any reductions in pension rights introduced to address funding difficulties in a scheme such as the IASS.  Policy in this regard is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Protection, Ms Joan Burton T.D.</p><p>  The trustees of the IASS announced in February last that they had decided in principle on a number of changes to address the funding difficulties of the scheme.  The trustees, who are central to any solution to the funding difficulties, are required by law to act in the best interests of all members, be they active, deferred or pensioner members.  Following consultations between my Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, IBEC and ICTU, an Expert Panel has been established to carry out an urgent investigation of how the industrial relations issues relating to the scheme could be resolved.  The Panel recently gave an update to the Departments on its progress to date and confirmed that it had met with representatives of all the key stakeholders, including pensioners and deferred pensioners.  The Panel are due to report again in early May.</p></reply>

The 2013 Tourism and Travel Statistics show that spending in Ireland by overseas visitors (excluding fares) rose by 11.9% to &euro;3.262 billion compared with 2012.  The 2013 Overseas Travel Statistics reported that trips to Ireland were up by 7.2% compared to 2012 with 6,985,900 overseas visits.  Figures for the first quarter of 2014 show that trips to Ireland were up 7.3 % compared to Q1 2013.  The CSO does not provide a county breakdown of statistics.</p><p>I am aware that F&aacute;ilte Ireland does its own estimated regional breakdown of overseas and domestic revenue and visitors on an annual basis, based on its own research and available CSO statistics.  The most recent full year figures cover 2012, and have also been published at county level based on three-year rolling averages, taking account of the limitations of applying survey data to smaller areas.  These and other regional statistics are easily accessible in the research section of the F&aacute;ilte Ireland website under Regional Statistics and Reports.    </p><p>In relation to funding, my Department's support for the tourism sector is channelled through the State tourism agencies, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  The agencies have a range of programmes, many delivered at a national level, to assist in developing and promoting the tourism sector.  I have forwarded your question to Failte Ireland for direct reply as Tourism Ireland is concerned with overseas promotion.  However I would caution that it is unlikely that it will be possible to break down much of their funding on a county basis, as it is not allocated in such a manner.  Please contact my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</p></reply>
