    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-10-23a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013102300062#WRA00600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 29 together.</p><p>  Following from Government consideration of the funding of a pyrite remediation scheme through the imposition of mandatory levies on the quarrying and insurance sectors, work commenced on the development of a Pyrite Remediation Bill.  However, legal difficulties arose during the drafting process and it was not possible to proceed on the intended basis.  My Department and I have worked over the past number of months to resolve these difficulties and put in place an alternative means of funding a pyrite remediation scheme.  In this context, I am very pleased to have secured Exchequer funding to support the implementation of a pyrite remediation scheme under the auspices of the Pyrite Resolution Board.  In addition, a revised general scheme of a Bill to provide for the establishment of the Pyrite Resolution Board has been approved for drafting as a matter of priority.  My Department will be working with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to ensure that the Bill is published at the earliest possible date and I hope to bring the legislation to the Oireachtas in this term. </p><p>  The Pyrite Resolution Board, which I set up on an administrative basis earlier this year, has already made significant progress on developing appropriate systems and procedures.  They will now quickly advance work on the proposed online application and processing system and also finalise work on developing other complementary systems, with appropriate checks and balances, to ensure that effective and efficient programmes of remediation are delivered to affected homeowners.   </p><p>  The initial phase of the remediation programme will deal with approximately 1,000 dwellings which, it is estimated, are in need of repair.  Initially, &euro;10 million is being made available to my Department.  Additional funding will be provided over the next two years, in the context of the further capital stimulus programme to be announced in early 2014, to deal with all dwellings deemed by the Pyrite Resolution Board to be in need of remediation.  The post-2015 funding position will be dealt with having regard to the position at that time.  While it is not possible, at this point in time, to estimate the number of dwellings that may require remediation post-2015, the considered view is that the numbers will not be as large as previously thought.  There are a number of positive indicators that support this view.  The number of persons who have registered an interest with the Pyrite Resolution Board to receive an application form for the proposed scheme is 700 approximately.   </p><p>  As I have indicated previously, HomeBond is a private limited company providing a structural guarantee scheme to purchasers of new homes which, since November 2008, has become an insurance scheme underwritten by Allianz Insurance.  As a private company my Department has no role or function in its operations.  However, the Pyrite Resolution Board is in discussions with HomeBond in relation to how best they can make a positive contribution to the implementation of a pyrite remediation process.   </p><p>  While it was not possible to proceed with the imposition of levies on the quarrying and insurance sectors as a means of funding a remediation scheme, it would be indefensible to leave affected homeowners without redress.  Despite budgetary constraints, I am glad to have secured Exchequer funding for a pyrite remediation scheme.  I would like to assure affected homeowners that there will be no undue delay on my part or on that of my Department and the Pyrite Resolution Board to ensure that the pyrite remediation scheme is delivered in the shortest possible timeframe.</p></reply>

It is a key part of the Government's &euro;150 million capital investment in the economy over 2013-14.  This three-year programme will target the 25,000 least energy efficient local authority homes.  Some &euro;25 million will be provided in 2014 and it is expected that 12,500 homes will be retrofitted in the course of the year.  This will result in warmer homes and lower energy bills for the families concerned and will also create around 1,000 jobs in the sector.  A further &euro;5 million is being provided where a more substantial suite of energy efficiency works are needed, such as the replacement of windows and doors or the installation of high-efficiency central heating boilers.  Taking both measures together, it is estimated that some 14,110 households will benefit from this &euro;30 million investment in 2014. </p><p>  It will be a matter for the local authorities to determine the individual houses and estates that will be retrofitted under this programme.  My Department will be requesting local authorities to submit details of their energy retrofitting work programmes for 2014 in due course.  Capital allocations in 2014 will reflect the level of contractual commitments of works under way at end 2013, the scope and extent of the programmes submitted and the capacity to deliver these programmes in terms of frameworks in place for the taking on of contractors. </p><p>  I expect these works will be undertaken by small, locally-based contractors for the most part and will provide job opportunities for the long-term unemployed.  I have asked local authorities to ensure that the potential to employ local labour is exploited to the fullest extent possible, having regard to public procurement rules.</p></reply>

It provides the spatial vision and principles to achieve a better balance of social, economic and physical development and population growth between regions through the co-ordinated development of nine gateway cities and towns, and nine hub towns, together with complementary policies to activate the potential for lasting economic development in their hinterlands and wider regions.  The NSS serves as a strategic context for spatial planning in Ireland by regional authorities, in their regional planning guidelines role, and for planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in their statutory planning functions.  It also seeks to influence investment priorities particularly in transport, housing, water services, communications, energy, health and education infrastructure.   </p><p>  While the existing NSS remains in place, together with Minister Hogan, I have recently established a successor National Spatial Strategy Scoping Group comprising three experts with extensive experience of spatial planning and economic and social development, to prepare a short scoping report on a successor to the current NSS.  I expect to receive their report in the coming months following which I will bring proposals to Government on the roadmap to develop a successor NSS that will take account, inter alia, of our significantly changed economic circumstances and to contribute to sustainable national recovery.  The new strategy is expected to be in place in 2015.</p></reply>

The Regulations brought into operation a grants scheme to assist with the cost of remediation of septic tanks and domestic waste water treatment systems which are deemed, following inspection under the EPA's National Inspection Plan and the subsequent issue of an Advisory Notice by the local authority, to require repair or upgrading. </p><p>  The Regulations provide that, subject to the applicant meeting all qualification criteria, a local authority may pay a grant to a person who is required, following an inspection, to have repairs or upgrades to, or replacement of, a septic tank or other domestic waste water treatment system.  Applications for grant aid are administered by the local authorities in whose functional area the particular domestic waste water treatment system requiring remediation is situated.  Where a local authority pays a grant under the scheme, my Department will recoup 100% of the amount paid by the local authority. To date, no applications for recoupment have been submitted by the local authorities to my Department.   </p><p>  The Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 assigns responsibility to the EPA to make a National Inspection Plan for domestic wastewater treatment systems.  The National Inspection Plan 2013: Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems was adopted and published by the EPA in February 2013.  The Plan provides for a minimum of 1,000 inspections to be carried out by the water services authorities (which are the 34 county and city councils) in the 12 month period up to July 201 4.  Details of the minimum number of inspections to be carried out in each county are included in the Plan. </p><p>  An IT system, developed by the EPA for use by the water services authorities, underpins implementation of the National Inspection Plan.  The system facilitates the selection of treatment systems for inspection based on the risk to human health or the environment and captures all information relating to inspections.  This will ensure a consistent approach to inspections nationally.  Implementation of the Plan is a matter for the individual water services authorities, under the supervision of the EPA.  The IT system in use enables individual water services authorities to track the progress in completing inspections against the Plan's requirements and enables the EPA to monitor the progress by all authorities.  The EPA has committed to review the implementation of the National Inspection Plan in 2014.  As neither I nor my Department have any direct role in monitoring the implementation of the Plan, I have no information on the number of inspections carried out to date.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-10-23a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013102300062#WRA01700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 152 together.</p><p>  Earlier in 2013 I published the Government's Homelessness Policy Statement in which I outlined the Government's aim to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.  The statement emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness.  The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.  When I published the statement I announced a set of indicators which will be used to demonstrate the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed.  These indicators will give a clearer picture of homelessness in Ireland and, in quantifying its on-going extent, will support the bringing forward of realistic and practical solutions.  I also established a high-level three-person oversight group for the purpose of reviewing the progress of the approach being advocated in the statement, identifying obstacles and proposing solutions.  The group expects to provide me with their first report shortly.</p><p>  Arrangements have been put in place to provide for the delegation of homelessness funding to the lead housing authority in each of the 9 regions.  I consider the regional approach more appropriate as it helps to bring a more strategic perspective to bear on action to address homelessness, including avoidance of over-concentration of homelessness services in certain centres and promoting appropriate regional availability of services, consistent with need.  These arrangements place an emphasis on increased decision making at local level, in lieu of the existing individual project based arrangements, to improve overall efficiency and value for money, and allow greater local decision making in homeless services.  These arrangements seek to ensure that the measures being pursued by housing authorities reflect the housing-led approach advocated in the policy statement, that actions are in place towards achieving the target of ending long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 and that evidence to support progress will be presented through the reports on the indicators.  </p><p>  My Department is currently engaging with a number of lead housing authorities and is considering the appropriate allocation of the 2014 homelessness budget so as to ensure that Section 10 homelessness funding meets the needs in the various regions.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-10-23a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013102300062#WRA02000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 23 together.</p><p>  The Abridged Estimate for my Department for 2014 includes a capital provision of &euro;3 million for Traveller-specific accommodation in 2014.  While this represents a decrease of &euro;1 million compared to 2013, I do not expect that this will have a major impact on activity in 2014 as the current round of Traveller Accommodation Programmes come to an end this year.  This capital funding stream is used to provide 100% funding to housing authorities for the provision and maintenance of Traveller-specific accommodation and, in doing so, is designed to meet the specific and distinct accommodation needs of the Traveller community, such as halting sites and group housing schemes.</p><p>  In accordance with the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, new multi-annual Traveller Accommodation Programmes, which will run for the 5-year period to the end of 2018, will be introduced in 2014.  As a result, 2014 will be a transition year with a strong emphasis on the planning of programmes for the period up to end 2018.  Based on the current status of approved Traveller-specific projects and considering that the new programme must be adopted by April 2014, this is considered sufficient to meet current requirements.  If it transpires that the 2014 Estimates provision is insufficient, I will review the position with a view to augmenting the capital provision.   </p><p>  It should be recognised that the vast majority of Traveller families have opted for, and are accommodated in, standard housing provided by local authorities and financed from my Department's capital allocations for social housing, or in private rented accommodation with Rent Supplement support.  It is open to Travellers to opt for any form of accommodation and local authority Traveller Accommodation Programmes are intended to reflect these preferences.     </p><p>  There are high vacancy levels at present in Traveller-specific group housing schemes in some local authorities.  With a view to ascertaining the reasons for this, an independent research study is currently being carried out by the Housing Agency to examine the reasons why Traveller families vacate Traveller-specific accommodation and to make recommendations to inform future policy and practice.  The National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee (NTACC), which is a statutory body to advise me in relation to general matters concerning Traveller accommodation, has expressed concerns in relation to the level of vacant Traveller-specific accommodation nationally.  It is expected that this study will be completed early in 2014 and its findings will be presented to the NTACC, who will consider the policy implications I look forward to working with the committee on this issue and other concerns in relation to Traveller accommodation. </p><p>  The Government remains committed to meeting the accommodation needs of Travellers.  Since the adoption of the third round of programmes in 2009, it is estimated that over 450 units of Traveller-specific accommodation had been provided to end 2012, supported by the provision of approximately &euro;50 million in capital funding from my Department.  This is in addition to expenditure on standard local authority housing and other housing supports.

A key objective of the reform programme is to rationalise the cost of the current service delivery and ensure more efficient operation of water services by moving from 34 water services authorities to a single body; following enactment of comprehensive legislation later this year, these functions will transfer to Irish Water.   </p><p>  Bord G&aacute;is has put in place appropriate programme management arrangements to establish Irish Water, prepare for the transfer of assets, liabilities and functions from local authorities from 1 January 2014, provide for customer service and billing and implement the domestic water metering programme.  Expenditure on this programme is a matter for Bord G&aacute;is/Irish Water and these costs are not being funded from the Exchequer.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund has provided a bridging loan facility to Irish Water to meet the costs arising to the end of 2013.  This includes the initial stages of the domestic water metering programme, the full cost of which is &euro;539m excluding VAT. </p><p>  Following the transfer of water services functions to Irish Water from 1 January 2014, a new funding model will be in place to meet both capital and operational costs of the new entity.  Irish Water's costs in the coming years will be funded through a mix of revenue from the domestic and non-domestic sector, third party finance (such as the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, EIB, bank lending and capital markets facilities) and State support which may be in the form of both equity and subvention. </p><p>  The Exchequer proposes a direct equity investment of &euro;240m towards the capital funding of Irish Water in 2014.  This will support projects to be included in Irish Water's Capital Investment Plan and will ensure that the entity is in a position to take on the water services investment programmes of the 34 water services authorities, including some 80 projects currently in progress.  Irish Water will also finance some of its costs and the liabilities transferred from local authorities through borrowings in 2014.   </p><p>  The establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing from 2014.  Work is also underway on the funding model for Irish Water's operational costs, to ensure that Irish Water can fund the Service Level Agreements being put in place with local authorities for the delivery of water services in 2014.</p></reply>

My Department now understand s that two of these were in the ownership of Council employees.  There are robust legislative procedures in place under the Local Government Act of 2001 and the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995 which set out the requirements in relation to declarable interests and the conduct of public servants in exercising their functions.  There are no exceptions to these requirements.  </p><p>  In 2010, when the units in question were acquired, local authorities had delegated sanction to acquire housing units.  This delegated sanction applied where both the numbers of units and level of funding available for the acquisition programme had been agreed with my Department.  When identifying properties for acquisition, housing authorities are required to ensure that all the relevant issues are considered, including tenure mix and estate composition, specific local needs and that the acquisitions are fit for purpose and appropriate for social renting.  Housing authorities are also required to achieve best value for money in the acquisition of properties.  It is an absolute requirement that the local authority obtains an independent valuation of each property by a suitable qualified person. I understand this requirement was adhered to in both these cases.  My Department does not have a role in the selection of particular properties for acquisition by a local authority and would not, at any time, be aware of the identification of the vendor.  </p><p>  The matter of the alleged conflict of interest was brought to the attention of my Department in September.  Following this, my Department was in touch with senior management in Louth County Council and requested a report on the matter .  The County Manager subsequently commissioned an outside independent firm of auditors and risk assessment managers to undertake a comprehensive review of the Council's social housing investment programme in 2010, including the acquisition of 18 properties and, in particular, the procedures which applied in the case of the purchase of the two houses owned by local authority employees.  I understand that the review process ha s just complete d and that the independent consultants have presented their report to the County Manager .  It is absolutely essential that the public has full confidence in the exercise of public service functions and that there is strict compliance with the legislative requirements in this regard.</p><p>  In fairness to all concerned, I do not propose to comment further on the issue until such time as I have considered the findings of the report and the views of the County Manager.</p></reply>

On 18 July 2013, the Government approved the introduction of HAP including the provision of funding to the local authorities to cover the costs of accommodating HAP claimants.  It was also agreed that the DSP would provide for the implementation of the mandatory direct deduction of rental contributions from the welfare payments of HAP recipients and local authority tenants.  My Department and the Department of Social Protection continue to work closely on the legal, policy and operational issues involved in developing and introducing HAP.   </p><p>  My Department is also working closely with the County and City Managers Association (CCMA) in overseeing plans for the implementation of HAP, but more specifically at this stage in relation to the test phase, which is planned for 2014 (subject to the enactment of the relevant legislation).  A Project Implementation Team is in place and will be responsible for detailed planning and implementation during the testing and roll-out phases.</p><p>  The CCMA has identified Limerick as the lead authority to drive implementation in the local government sector.  The other authorities currently nominated for the test phase are:</p><p>  -  South Dublin County Council</p><p>  -  Louth County Council</p><p>  -  Kilkenny County Council</p><p>  -  Waterford City Council</p><p>  -  Cork County Council</p><p>  -  Monaghan County Council   </p><p>  A detailed business process design exercise for HAP involving input from all the relevant key stakeholders has recently been completed.  The Implementation Team will now, in conjunction with my Department, develop a plan for testing the scheme in the selected authorities in 2014 (subject to the required legislation being in place), with full roll out of the scheme to follow once the test phase is complete.  Consideration, where possible, will be given to what aspects of the scheme can be progressed under existing mechanisms prior to enactment of the required legislation.  </p><p>  HAP is being designed so as to bring all of the social housing services provided by the State together under the local authority system, with local authorities being responsible for all households with an established housing need and ensuring significant efficiencies in the provision of rental assistance.  HAP will provide a new framework for the provision of rental assistance, and will, in as much as it can, facilitate the removal of existing barriers to employment in the rent supplement scheme by allowing HAP recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment. </p><p>  Under the new scheme applicants will source their own accommodation within the private rented market (as currently happens with rent supplement) and the tenancy agreement will be between the HAP recipient and the private landlord. The local authority will pay the new assistance payment on the tenant's behalf directly to the landlord.  The tenant will pay a rental contribution to the local authority based on the differential rent scheme for the relevant local authority. </p><p>  During the test phase, it is envisaged that the authorities will initially focus on new applicants before moving on a progressive basis to those already in receipt of Rent Supplement.  It is also intended that the test phase will prioritise, as much as possible, the transfer of long-term unemployed rent supplement recipients to HAP.  This is a reasonable approach to implementation, which will allow any issues that arise to be dealt with in a graduated way and give local authorities sufficient time to scale up the operation of HAP within their housing directorates.</p></reply>

My Department continues to engage with the Local Development Companies, where Service Level Agreements are in place in relation to the delivery of a range of recreation services including the continued implementation of the Walks Scheme and other appropriate schemes and actions to implement relevant objectives of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy.</p><p>  The Walks Scheme was launched in March 2008 on the recommendation of Comhairle na Tuaithe (The Countryside Council) and represented an innovative response to facilitating the development and maintenance of many of Ireland's key walking trails.  This Scheme brings the landholders in as key participants in the provision of high quality walking trails, by contracting them to undertake maintenance work on the trails in line with agreed work plans.  The Walks Scheme is currently operating on 40 trails supported by 1,811 landowners, and is being managed by 16 Local Development Companies around the country. </p><p>  My Department is continuing negotiations with other State Agencies to agree a National Outdoor Recreation Plan for Public Lands and Waters in Ireland.  My Department also continues to be a main funding partner of Leave No Trace Ireland which promotes responsible recreational use in the outdoors.  It encourages all outdoor enthusiasts to act responsibly outdoors and to protect lands used by the public for the benefit of the environment and for future generations.  My Department chairs regular meetings of Comhairle Na Tuaithe (The Countryside Council) where matters are discussed relating to rural recreation/activity tourism and furthering the implementation of the priorities of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy (NCRS). </p><p>  It is intended to facilitate access to the uplands for hill walking and similar activities and a Pilot Mountain Access scheme is under way at Mount Gable in Connemara.  Discussions are continuing regarding the expansion of the initial proposed Carrantuohill Pilot to the entire McGillicuddy Reeks in Co Kerry.  A report on the Kerry Mountain Access scheme is currently being prepared and should be available towards the end of 2013. </p><p>  My Department is currently negotiating the implementation of a National Indemnity Scheme which would indemnify private landowners against claims from recreational users for injury or damage to property.  The Occupiers Liability Act of 1995 already provides significant protection to landowners, but the upfront costs of successfully defending a claim can be significant.  The development of the indemnity scheme is not expected to lead to any major increased demand for funding.</p></reply>

The requirement to reduce public expenditure to sustainable levels is impacting on capital programmes all across the public service, including my Department's housing capital programme.  The level of capital funding available has declined significantly in recent years along the lines highlighted in the Medium Term Exchequer Framework for Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016.  As a result capital spending on housing programmes  is subject to constraint over the short-term .    </p><p>  Substantial grant funding was provided for improving and adapting private houses in recent years - in the past two years almost 22,000 householders benefitted under the schemes.  On 22 February 2013 I announced Exchequer allocations to local authorities under the suite of Grants for Older People and People with a Disability amounting to &euro;34.2 million.  Through active management of the overall housing budget for 2013, I allocated further funding across all local authorities on 19 July bringing the overall funding for these grants to &euro;36.5 million.  My Department is closely monitoring expenditure across all the measures under the housing programme.  I will consider allocating further funds to the grants measure in the event of any saving arising elsewhere.   </p><p>  The Abridged Estimate for my Department, published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in Expenditure Report 2014, provides some &euro;28.6 million in respect of the grants measure.  This will be supplemented by the recently announced &euro;10 million in additional funding for the measure, giving an overall provision in 2014 of &euro;38.6 million, some &euro;4.3 million more than the initial allocation in 2013.   </p><p>  I am currently reviewing the operation of the suite of Grants for Older People and People with a Disability with the objective of targeting those in most need and ensuring that the maximum numbers of households can benefit from these schemes.

The Local Government Bill 2013 will provide that these committees will include representatives of local community interests, as well as members of the local authority, and representatives of other public authorities and of publicly funded or supported local development bodies.  Representatives of local community interests will, in the main, be drawn from local Community and Voluntary Fora, which are a collective representative structure for the community and voluntary sector in each local area and play an important role in facilitating local communities in making an input into various consultative processes.   </p><p>  The participative approach underpinning Local Community Development Committees, with the involvement of Community and Voluntary Fora and other local stakeholders, will build on the consultation with stakeholders that has already taken place in relation to the reforms covering the enhanced alignment of local government and local development.  The Alignment Steering Group, which I established to examine this area, undertook consultation with key stakeholders, including local development companies, local authorities (both city/county managers and elected representatives), the Community and Voluntary Fora, Volunteer Centres, representative bodies for community and voluntary organisations, and service users.   </p><p>  A partnership approach is also being followed in progressing the implementation of the Steering Group's recommendations, via a n Alignment Working Group which comprises representatives of the City/County Managers Association, the Irish Local Development Network and Pobal.  The Working Group has engaged with the Community and Voluntary sector, as well as with other important stakeholders, in considering how best to progress the alignment recommendations.  More recently, I established a working group on citizen engagement to make recommendations on more extensive and diverse input by citizens into the decision-making process and to allow for facilitation of input by citizens into decision making at the local government level. </p><p>  The reforms in Putting People First are based on greater local empowerment.  The work now underway on citizen engagement and the development of new participative arrangements, such as Local Community Development Committees, reflect the strong level of consultation already underway, which will continue as the reforms are implemented.</p></reply>

In terms of how this funding will be used, a full breakdown of the multi-annual capital investment framework provided for under Budget 2014, by ministerial Group, is set out in the Expenditure Report for 2014.  This Report, which provides a breakdown of the capital allocations by programme heading, including environmental and waste management programmes, on page 184, was published on 16 October by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and can be accessed at:   In particular, additional capital provision is being made in respect to landfill remediation.</p><p>  There has been no cut to the landfill levy.

However, it is important to note that t he landfill levy is chargeable on waste presented for disposal at landfill facilities.  It is intended, primarily, to act as an economic instrument to encourage more sustainable management of our waste by diverting it away from landfill.  The decrease in income from the levy indicates that the instrument continues to be effective in decreasing the amount of residual waste consigned to landfill.</p></reply>

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested.  To achieve this, it is essential that we continue to tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.  The financial parameters within which we continue to operate rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes.  The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.</p><p>  In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing.  I am monitoring expenditure under my Department's housing programme for 2013, together with the level of contractual commitments extending into 2014, with a view to a decision later this year on approving some limited new construction and house purchases over the period to end 2014.  In addition to the &euro;525.8m in housing programme expenditure provided for in my Department's Estimate for 2014, Budget 2014 provides a further &euro;50 million to fund infrastructural investment primarily in the housing area, including &euro;30 million to recommence a State house building programme; &euro;10 million for an unfinished housing estate resolution project; and &euro;10 million for housing adaptation grants.  When this is taken into account, funding for housing for next year is effectively maintained at 2013 levels.   </p><p>  Delivery of social housing is significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government continues to be committed to other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  In addition, my Department and the Housing Agency are also engaged with NAMA to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes.  Approved Housing Bodies will also play a key role in 2014 in the delivery of social housing and in particular in its capacity to attract external financial investment.   </p><p>  In spite of the current challenging circumstances, I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2013 to be in the region of 5,000 new housing units, and it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2014.</p><p>  Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with the housing authorities.  Work continues between central and local government and the voluntary sector to ensure that the considerable monies spent on services for the homeless are effectively and appropriately targeted.</p></reply>

Plans for the refurbishment of 63 units and the construction of 37 new units at Dolphin House are well advanced, with demolition and construction works due to commence late 2014 or early 2015. </p><p>  In the case of the redevelopment of St. Teresa's Gardens, the retrofitting of apartments to facilitate the de-tenanting of apartments due for demolition has commenced and it is anticipated that 16 units will be completed by the end of the year.  This will facilitate the demolition of vacant units and the start of preparatory work for the construction of 50 new units on the cleared site. </p><p>  In relation to Limerick, the regeneration programme over the past five years has facilitated a substantial acquisition and re-housing programme with over 1,000 households relocated to date.  I recently launched a comprehensive Framework Implementation Plan which has the capacity to transform the four regeneration areas within Limerick.  The implementation of this plan will see construction and refurbishment accelerate in all regeneration areas in 2014.</p><p>  The proposed works for Cork City North West Regeneration are being carried out on a phased basis and in accordance with available funding.  All the tenants from Phase 1 have now been relocated and the houses have been demolished.  Work is due to commence shortly on the construction of 23 new social houses.   </p><p>  The Mitchel's Area regeneration programme in Tralee is in its final phase, having made significant progress in the delivery of key elements including the delivery of Phases 1 and 2 of the Tobar Naofa housing development. </p><p>  The regeneration of the Cranmore estate in Sligo and Cox's Demesne in Dundalk are at an early stage of development.  However, some important initial works have been completed including, in the case of the Cranmore Estate, a windows and doors replacement programme and the completion of the initial phases of the Cleveragh Regional Park.  In the case of Cox's Demesne, the retrofitting of a number of houses has been completed with the next phase focussing on the strategic demolition of a number of dwellings and the construction of some new dwellings.</p></reply>

The Abridged Estimate for my Department, published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in Expenditure Report 2014, provides &euro;525.8 million in respect of the Housing Programme.  These resources have been supplemented by a further &euro;50 million announced in the Budget to fund infrastructural investment primarily in the housing area which includes &euro;30 million to recommence a State house building programme; &euro;10 million for an unfinished housing estate resolution pilot project; and &euro;10 million for housing adaptation grants. When taken in conjunction, funding for Housing is effectively maintained at 2013 levels. </p><p>  I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested.  To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing need.  The 2014 Estimates will provide capital funding which will allow progress to continue to be made across a range of programmes under my Department's Social Housing Investment Programme (SHIP).  These measures will include the provision of over &euro;40 million to continue the local authority housing construction and acquisitions programme.  I am confident that the additional &euro;30 million being invested in local authority housing will facilitate the construction of new infill developments in areas with the highest demand for social housing and will bring long-term vacant units back into social use resulting in up to 500 new homes becoming available for families in 2014.  I envisage that some 4,500 additional housing units will be provided next year through leasing and existing capital programmes.   </p><p>  Significant funding is also being provided to support the national regeneration programme with over &euro;79 million available in 2014 to target the country's most socially disadvantaged communities and to support a range of remedial works schemes.  2014 will also see &euro;25 million provided which will improve the energy efficiency of 12,500 local authority houses, resulting in warmer homes and lower energy bills for thousands of families. </p><p>  In 2014, I will continue to focus the available resources towards the most vulnerable and disadvantaged sectors of the community.  The capital provision will include over &euro;40 million for the provision of accommodation by Approved Housing Bodies (AHB's) to be funded under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS).  Under CAS, funding of up to 100% of the approved cost is available for the provision of accommodation to meet the needs of persons with specific categories of housing need including older people.  The additional &euro;10 million provision under the suite of Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability, as announced last week, will facilitate the payment of more than 7,800 grants to assist older people and people with disabilities to remain at home for longer.</p></reply>

The objective of the LCDP is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government, and its agencies, and people in disadvantaged communities.  It is a key tool of Government in providing supports for the 'harder to reach' in the most disadvantaged areas and communities.  &euro;47.707 million is being provided in the 2014 indicative allocation for the Local and Community Development Programme, a reduction of &euro;1million or 2% on the 2013 allocation, the smallest reduction to the Programme since 2010.</p><p>  In allocating resources in the prevailing stringent budgetary situation, I am particularly conscious of the need to support funding levels for the LCDP, to ensure that resources are allocated in the fairest way possible and to make the maximum contribution to job creation and economic recovery.  In our current economic circumstances and with high levels of unemployment, the LCDP is more relevant than ever as it creates employment opportunities and gives those most distant from the labour market the skills to access training and jobs.  The Programme provides employment supports, training, personal development/capacity building and other supports for the harder to reach in the most disadvantaged areas in society.  The funding provided in 2014 will be used to increase access to formal and informal educational activities and resources, and to increase people's work readiness and employment prospects.  For example, some 14,000 people who are distanced from the labour market will receive direct one-to one labour market training and supports through the Programme in 2014.</p><p>  I provided &euro;2 million in capital funding for RAPID in 2013, which is being used to meet my Department's existing contractual commitments on RAPID projects, mainly Sports Capital top-ups and CCTV systems, jointly funded with the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Justice and Equality respectively.  The capital allocation for RAPID for 2014 is &euro;1.9million, a reduction of 5%.</p><p>  The LCDP and RAPID programmes will in future be overseen by new Local Community Development Committees which are to be established in each Local Authority area as part of the reforms set out in <i>Putting People First - Action Plan for Effective Local Government</i> with the objective of bringing greater co-ordination on an area basis to publicly - funded programmes.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of the legislation is to re-unite the original account holders with their moneys, including all interest due.  In addition, the legislation also provides that disbursements from the fund may be made for charitable purposes or for purposes of community benefit.  Since its establishment in April 2003 to the end of September 2013, the transfers to the Dormant Accounts Fund have totalled some &euro;724.6m, which includes interest earned of approximately &euro;39.8m.  Funds reclaimed in that period by account holders amounted to around &euro;267.6m.  &euro;278m of disbursements have been approved, with &euro;251m already spent on projects designed to benefit the community over the same period.  The current balance of uncommitted funds is &euro;120.6m.</p><p>  The Disbursement Plan of 2009, put in place by the Dormant Accounts Board, will be replaced shortly by a new disbursement scheme in accordance with the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act 2012.  The 2012 Act also provides for the preparation of an action plan, to give effect to the disbursement scheme.  The plan will indicate the programmes or types of projects that may apply for disbursement and the maximum funds available.  Different amounts may be specified in the plan in relation to a particular class or classes of programme or project.</p><p>  This year, I have allocated &euro;6.385m for Dormant Accounts Measures, which includes &euro;2.835m to be used to support labour force activation measures in local authorities.  The budget provision for 2014 is &euro;5.456m, made up of &euro;3.45 current and &euro;2.006 capital.

Specifically, the Court found that in a case where a project requiring EIA required both planning permission and an Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) licence, the fact that Irish legislation did not prevent the Environment Protection Agency from making a licensing decision before the planning permission application was decided, and therefore before the EIA was completed, meant that part of the overall consent for the project (i.e. the licence) was being decided without an EIA being first carried out, contrary to Articles 2 and 4 of the EIA Directive.</p><p>  In order to comply with the Court ruling it was necessary to make amendments to the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 and the Planning and Development Act, 2000 in relation to the assessment of projects which require both a consent under the Planning and Development Act 2000 and an IPPC licence.  These amendments were made in the European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control) Regulations 2012, which came into effect on 30 September 2012 (new application for IPPC licences) and the European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control) (No.2) Regulations 2012, which came into effect on 15 November 2012 (IPPC licence applications on hands).</p><p>  I consider that the legislation in relation to the environmental impact assessment of the projects referred to above is now fully compliant with the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive and I have no plans further to amend the legislation in this regard.</p></reply>

It would not be appropriate for me to comment on individual loan applications.</p><p>  Local authorities have for many years provided housing loan finance to people of limited means and who could not access such finance in the commercial market.  One of the qualifying conditions for such local authority loans was the provision of evidence of refusal from two commercial lenders.  In extending housing loans, local authorities are as flexible as possible when dealing with borrowers experiencing difficulties servicing those loans.</p><p>  Housing loans extended by local authorities are based on obtaining matching finance from the Housing Finance Agency which must in turn be serviced by local authorities.  Any default on a housing loan exposes the local authority to a drain on its finances in continuing to service loans.  In extending loans, it is also critical to ensure that borrowers are capable of servicing the loan sought, thus avoiding the distress which might ensue should the home be repossessed as a result of unsustainability. </p><p>  The credit guidelines for housing loans, introduced in 2009, were intended to standardise best practice throughout the sector, and apply a transparent and coherent process to the assessment of loans.  Central to this was the requirement to have the application subjected to examination by the Irish Credit Bureau, to ensure that each loan was similarly treated and assessed.  Anecdotally, loans extended under the guidelines are performing more satisfactorily than those not subjected to these guidelines.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the guidelines in place, and the checking of applications by the Irish Credit Bureau, represent prudent practice and work in the best interests of borrower and lender alike.</p></reply>

Final decisions will be made in the wider context of the Department's overall capital allocation and will be published in the Revised Estimates later in the year.  </p><p>  In line with the 'bottom-up' approach to rural development the Local Development Companies (LDCs), contracted on my Department's behalf, are the principal decision makers in relation to which projects are funded under the Programme.  I understand that the LDC for Longford has not received an application from the organisation referred to in the Question.</p></reply>

The report was also raised in recent discussions which my colleague, the Minister of State for Trade and Development, Joe Costello, had with Palestinian representatives, including Foreign Minister Malki, during his recent visit to the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  The World Bank estimate that if Israeli restrictions on Palestinian access to, and activity and production in, Area C were lifted, the total potential value could amount to some $3.4 billion or some 35% of Palestinian GDP, at 2011 levels.  The resulting increase in revenues for the Palestinian Authority could amount to $800 million which would notionally cut its fiscal deficit by half, thereby significantly reducing the need for recurrent donor support.</p><p>  At a time when the Palestinian economy is facing significant pressures, with declining aid levels and GDP growth having fallen to 1.9 per cent in the first half of 2013, compared to an average 9% over the period 2008-2011, the economic benefits of greater Palestinian control of Area C and its resources are obvious.  Ireland has for decades been clear on the need for an urgent end to Israel's occupation.  This report merely underlines the unacceptable costs to Palestinians of continuing failure to end the occupation and realise the undoubted economic dividend and benefits which will flow from a negotiated peace deal and realisation of the two State solution.</p></reply>

During my visit to the US last month, I spoke with several key contacts in the US Congress including leading members of the House Judiciary Committee, Minority House Leader Nancy Pelosi, and Chair of the Congressional Friends of Ireland, Pete King.  I also met with representatives of Irish community groups as well as some community members who are undocumented.  I am acutely aware of the difficulties they face as a result of their undocumented status.</p><p>  I am more determined than ever to continue to work to find a solution to their plight.  A resolution of the situation facing the undocumented Irish in the United States remains a priority for the Government.  The Government also attaches great importance to seeking provision for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the United States through the extension of the "E-3" visa scheme to include Irish citizens.  In this context, we very much welcomed the US Senate's approval of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Bill by a 68-32 margin on 27 June last.    </p><p>  The comprehensive draft legislation, which was drafted over several months by a bipartisan group of eight US Senators, provides for extensive reform of the US immigration system. It includes provisions that would legalise the status of undocumented Irish people and provide a path to permanent residency.  It also provides for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US via the proposed E-3 visa. </p><p>  The Bill is a very positive development.  Its provisions, if adopted, would help to end the great hardship and uncertainty faced by undocumented Irish in the US and their families here in Ireland.  The inclusion of a new provision to allow several thousand Irish citizens to legally avail of employment opportunities in the US every year is also particularly welcome.  The focus has now shifted to the House of Representatives for its consideration of the issues.  It remains to be seen whether a consolidated Bill can be agreed between the Senate and the House of Representatives.   It is generally accepted that securing overall agreement will remain a complex and challenging process, particularly at a time when Congress has been preoccupied by budgetary and debt issues.  This was clear from my discussions last month and I believe the challenge to secure agreement has become even greater in recent times.  I am determined to continue to deploy all necessary resources at political, diplomatic and Irish community level to make progress on this vital issue.  In support of this ongoing effort, a delegation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade is in Washington DC this week for a programme arranged by our Embassy during which they will meet with key members of Congress and with Irish-American community representatives.</p><p>  In addition to my contacts last month in New York, I visited Washington DC on 11-12 July and held a series of meetings on Capitol Hill, including with key members of the House of Representatives and Senate, with the US Administration and with Irish-American community representatives.  I reiterated throughout all these contacts the Government's interest in all aspects of immigration reform and in particular our interest in seeing an overall agreement reached which provides relief for currently undocumented Irish migrants and a facility for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US.  </p><p>  I wish to acknowledge the critically important role being played by a number of Irish community organisations, including the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform and the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform.</p></reply>

This is reflected in the large number of high level visits that have taken place between Ireland and China in recent years, and the strong growth seen in many sectors.  The implementation of Ireland's Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy is overseen by the Export Trade Council, which I chair, and which includes relevant Ministers, heads of State Agencies involved in the promotion of Trade, Tourism and Investment and representatives of the private sector.</p><p>  The Strategy includes numerical targets and associated action points for implementation and outlines 27 priority markets, of which China is one.  Each market has a Local Market Team, which comprises the Embassy/Consulate and the relevant state agencies, under the direction of our Ambassador.  China is a priority growth market for Irish companies.  Export growth of 19% was recorded in 2012 to bring the total value of goods and services exported by Irish owned companies to China to &euro;346m.  Enterprise Ireland, in their recently revised strategy for China, have outlined a path to achieving total exports of &euro;600m by 2016 &ndash; an ambitious 73% growth rate over the next 4 year period.  </p><p>  During my visit to China in July/August, I visited Beijing and Shanghai and met with many companies across practically all sectors of the economy &ndash; from tourism and food to education &ndash; and SMEs active in sectors as diverse as telecommunications and agricultural machinery.  While the scale of opportunity in the Chinese market is enormous, it is nevertheless a market that takes somewhat longer to generate returns, compared to our more established export markets in Europe and the US.  I am conscious of the need to provide the necessary support to Irish businesses seeking to exploit those opportunities.</p><p>  The priority target sectors for export development over the next 3 year period are: Financial Services; Clean Technologies (including Energy Efficiency and Green Buildings); Pharmaceuticals; Information Technologies; Medical Devices; Education Services; Agri-Technologies; Equine Products and Services.  In addition, and with the support of Bord Bia, Irish food &amp;amp; drink exports to China have more than doubled over the last three years, reaching &euro;262m in 2012.  The market is on track for a further increase in the region of 30% during 2013.  The main focus of our food exports at present is on dairy, pork, and seafood.  In line with the Government's plans for growth in the industry, China is expected to play an important role in the uptake of increased dairy production post CAP reform 2015.  Securing access to mainland China for Irish beef will also play an important role in increasing our exports.  Bord Bia has established a "Food Hub" in its office in Shanghai which provides a cost-effective way for Irish companies to achieve a presence within the market.  At present nine companies are represented in the Bord Bia Food Hub. </p><p>  My Department, in conjunction with all State Agencies present in China, will continue to work to maximise the benefits from the substantial goodwill and positive relations that exist between Ireland and China.</p></reply>

This includes the ongoing consideration of the European Commission's proposal to limit the use of foodcrop-based bio-fuels in transport to 5% by 2020.  Ireland, during our EU Presidency, worked hard to facilitate consensus on this complex issue.  The Council has yet to arrive at an agreed position.  A significant number of Member States have argued for either no cap or a cap in excess of 5% on these first generation bio-fuels.  My officials have been advised by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources that in the interests of facilitating negotiations with the European Parliament, with a view to reaching an agreement as quickly as possible on the proposal from the Commission, Ireland has given its support to a compromise proposal from the Lithuanian EU Presidency for a 7% cap.  The European Parliament voted last month for a cap on first generation bio-fuels of 6%.</p><p>  As I have stated in response to previous Questions on this subject, I share concerns that bio-fuel production, unless properly regulated, can have a negative impact on food production and food prices, especially in developing countries.  I will continue to follow this matter closely.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-10-23a.195.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013102300070#WRJ01500"><p>Under the regulations known as the "Two-Pack" which were formally adopted on 30 May 2013, a common budgetary timeline is being introduced for all Euro Area member states.  Specifically, the draft budget for central government and the main parameters of the draft budgets for all the other sub-sectors of the general government must be published by the 15 of October each year; draft budgetary plans in a common format must be submitted by all Euro area Member States not in a programme of assistance; and the budget for the central government must be adopted or fixed upon and published by the 31 of December each year.</p><p>  In light of these requirements, the Government decided to bring Budget Day forward from the first week in December to on or before the 15 of October from now on.  Accordingly, I presented Budget 2014 on Tuesday last, 15 October.  The Government also decided that the Finance Bill should complete its passage through the Oireachtas by the 31 of December each year.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that one of the most critical elements of the Budget process is the accuracy of systems for forecasting potential revenue yield in the year in question prior to the Budget actually taking place.  In the context of a December Budget Day, the availability prior to the Budget of information on cumulative tax yields to the end of November gave a high degree of certainty to the estimation of potential outturn for the year.  For example, cumulative tax yield to the end of November 2012 was &euro;33.8bn, which represented 92% of the full year outturn of &euro;36.6bn.  On the other hand, cumulative yield to end September, at &euro;26.1bn, represented only 71.3% of the eventual outturn. </p><p>  The scope for unanticipated events which would lead to either a higher or lower than projected outturn is considerably increased in the context of an October Budget.  In addition the ability to project future yield is compromised. Consequently, measures which would result in improvements in the availability of information or increases in the proportion of total yield already available prior to the Budget have to be considered.  The main areas where scope exists to introduce such improvements relate to the income tax Pay &amp;amp; File arrangements and on 11 October I initiated a consultation process on a revision of the existing arrangements.  I will consider the results of this consultation process when drafting, as a Committee Stage amendment to the forthcoming Finance Bill, the necessary measures.</p><p>  I would reiterate to the Deputy that these changes are required as a result of the move to an earlier Budget Day, necessitated by the adoption of the Two-Pack and will provide increased certainty around the annual tax take.  I would not accept the suggestion that such changes are a threat to jobs or businesses.  On the contrary, the more information available at Budget time, the more accurate forecasting can be, thereby increasing levels of certainty for business and employment.</p></reply>

This comprised &euro;2.5 billion in expenditure cuts and tax increases complemented with additional resources - other savings of &euro;0.6 billion.  A summary table of the adjustment package is outlined below.<table><tr><th>-</th><th>&euro;bn</th></tr><tr><td>Expenditure measures</td><td>1.6</td></tr><tr><td>Current expenditure measures</td><td>1.4</td></tr><tr><td>Increase in savings from Prior Year Measures</td><td>0.1</td></tr><tr><td>Capital expenditure measures</td><td>0.1</td></tr><tr><td>Taxation measures</td><td>0.9</td></tr><tr><td>Net new measures</td><td>0.4</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue carryover</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>Other </td><td>0.6</td></tr><tr><td>Total Adjustment Package</td><td>3.1</td></tr></table></p><p>Additional detail on what encompasses the other elements of the adjustment package may also be useful.  Firstly, the NTMA Budget debt service estimate for 2014 is lower than the corresponding April SPU estimate, of the order &euro;0.2bn, due to an improvement in the interest rate environment generally and lower than previously planned bond issuance.  Turning to the Central Bank income, during the summer, the Central Bank provided an estimate of the 2013 surplus income to be paid to the Central Fund in 2014 based on results to that date and projections for the remainder of the year.  The Central Bank revised this estimate upwards by &euro;0.1bn in September, in light of actual results for the first nine months and the consequent revisions of projections for the remaining three months of 2013.</p><p>  In terms of savings from the Live Register, the numbers in work rose by 33,800 in the year to the second quarter of 2013 and the Live Register at the end of quarter 3 2013 was down by just over 20,000 when compared to the same period last year.  On foot of this recovering labour market, live register savings have exceeded those previously expected of the order of &euro;0.15bn.  Finally, the remaining &euro;0.15bn arises from a number of other factors mainly connected with state asset transactions. </p><p>  Complementing tax and expenditure measures with additional resources and other savings, some of which may be once off, is consistent with the composition of previous adjustments published in the National Recovery Plan - Budget 2011 and the contribution of additional dividends outlined in Budget 2013.</p></reply>

It is not the case that all expenses incurred on health care qualify for relief.

Regling and Watson and the Nyberg Commission pointed out the problems to be addressed in our system of financial regulation.  Acting on the recommendations contained in those reports, this Government has undertaken a number of significant reforms towards building a strengthened regulatory framework for the financial services sector and to respond to the shortcomings identified in those reports.  The Central Bank Reform Act 2010 created a single fully-integrated Central Bank of Ireland with a unitary board &ndash; the Central Bank Commission &ndash; chaired by the Governor of the Central Bank.  The unitary Central Bank structure gives the Commission members a more complete remit over prudential regulation and financial stability issues.  In 2011 the new Fitness and Probity regime was rolled out by the Central Bank in accordance with the provisions of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010.  The regime provides for new powers to be exercised by the Central Bank to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions within financial service providers and of key office-holders within those providers.</p><p>  The Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act was also introduced in 2011.  It provides the necessary mechanisms to enable the Central Bank to intervene where a credit institution gets into serious difficulty and is in danger of becoming destabilised or otherwise failing.  The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 was passed this year which enhances the Central Bank's regulatory powers, drawing on the lessons of the recent past.  It strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions.  The Act also provides the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and underpins the credible enforcement of Irish financial services legislation in line with international best practice.</p><p>  The reforms introduced under the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 are complemented by a number of strategically important reforms at EU level in financial services.  Under our presidency, agreement was reached on the single supervisory mechanism, one of the main cornerstones of Banking Union which will provide for the European Central Bank to act as supervisor for systemic important banks throughout the Union.  Agreement was also reached on the Capital Requirements package which will ensure that European banks hold enough good quality capital to withstand future economic and financial shocks.  Member States have also agreed in principle the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation and Directive and agreement with the European Parliament was secured on the Market Abuse Regulation. </p><p>  These legislative reforms have been supplemented by a significant increase in regulatory activity by the Central Bank with a corresponding increase in staff numbers and skill levels.  The Central Bank of Ireland's Enforcement Priorities for 2013 highlight the importance of enforcement within its risk-based regulatory framework (PRISM).  PRISM represents a challenging and proportionate risk-based system of supervision for all financial institutions operating in Ireland.  The Central Bank's Strategic Plan 2013 &ndash; 2015 also sets out a strategy of assertive risk-based supervision underpinned by a credible threat of enforcement.</p><p>  This Government has also implemented a series of measures which reflect the important role that the banking sector has to play in supplying credit and in doing so to support economic growth in the economy.  As shareholders in the main banks, the Government's objective is twofold; to ensure that they are managed commercially so as to create and protect value for the taxpayer but also to ensure that they supply the credit lines necessary to sustain and grow the economy.  In that respect the Government has imposed SME lending targets on AIB and Bank of Ireland for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013.  Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion in 2012 and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.  Both banks have reported that they achieved their 2011 and 2012 targets and the recent Credit Review Office quarterly report commented "both banks are on track to achieve their &euro;4bn loan sanction targets, assuming the pattern of previous years of a strong Q4 performance is repeated".</p><p>  The Credit Review Office is available to assist businesses which have been refused credit.  The most recent CRO report shows that the CRO upheld the credit appeal in 150 cases or 55% of cases decided.  The upheld appeals have resulted in &euro;18.5M credit being made available to SMEs and farms, protecting 1,521 jobs. In Budget 2013 I recognised the important role played by the CRO in assisting borrowers who had been refused credit by the banks by increasing the number of reviewers in order to ensure that all appeals are dealt with in a timely and efficient manner.  In Budget 2014 I announced an increase in the limit for loan applications that can be reviewed by the CRO from &euro;500,000 to &euro;3m.  This increase will assist those borrowers currently banking with non-trading banks and banks which are strategically exiting the Irish SME lending market, whose refinancing requests are larger than &euro;500,000.</p><p>  We have also put in place a comprehensive suite of measures to assist personal borrowers including mortgage holders.  The personal insolvency regime has been overhauled and the insolvency service is now up and running.  The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and new statutory personal insolvency frameworks protect and assist people in genuine mortgage arrears difficulty and, more generally, to resolve unsustainable debt positions.  Co-operating borrowers now have more protections available to them and more effective options to deal with their over indebtedness than was the case previously.  These measures will also require creditors to deal with their customers who are experiencing genuine debt difficulty in a more holistic and customer friendly manner.  Taken together, these factors should make a useful contribution to the future development and application of more responsible lending decisions and practices.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Acquisitions Directive (transposed into Irish law in June 2009); the Central Bank's Corporate Governance Code and the recently introduced Fitness and Probity regime act as important safeguards in that matter.  To improve regulatory supervision and protect the Irish consumer, the Central Bank has, along with increased staffing levels, introduced a risk-based supervision framework, PRISM (Probability Risk and Impact SysteM). The framework establishes a new approach for supervisory engagement with regulated firms.  The first phase covering banks and insurers was rolled out in late 2011.  The system categorises all regulated firms into four separate impact categories, which are based on the level of damage a firm could cause to the financial system, economy and consumers were it to fail.  Firms are categorised as high impact, medium-high impact, medium-low impact or low impact, which determines the number of supervisors assigned and level of interaction with each firm.</p><p>  As part of the framework the Central Bank of Ireland engages with firms at a level that corresponds to their impact category; the higher the impact, the higher the level of engagement. Engagement involves reviews, inspections and meetings, and the frequency and level of engagement is associated with the firms' impact<i></i>rating.  Additionally, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013, enacted on the 11th July, 2013, enhances the power of the Central Bank to regulate, supervise and take action against financial service providers.  Some of the enhanced powers include: whistle blower protection and powers of inspection, investigation and information gathering for Central Bank authorised officers.  Taken together this overall framework should ensure that the Irish consumer will be protected as far as possible.</p><p>  Furthermore, the Deputy should note that at EU level a directive known as Solvency I places requirements on the amount of regulatory capital insurance companies must hold against unforeseen events.  Following years of negotiations, on 1 January 2016 Solvency II will commence.  The Solvency II EU Directive will set out new, stronger EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the key aim of increasing policyholder protection.  This modern, risk-based system for the regulation and supervision of European insurance and reinsurance undertakings is necessary in order to ensure a safe and solid insurance sector that can provide sustainable insurance products and support the real economy through long-term investments and additional stability.</p><p>  Negotiations on this directive are nearing the end in Brussels and preparations are already underway for this in Ireland.</p></reply>

An individual is tax resident in Ireland for a tax year if they are present in the State:</p><p>  for 183 days or more in Ireland during a tax year or</p><p>  for 280 days or more in Ireland between the current year and the previous year (although if an individual is present in the State for fewer than 30 days in either year, those days are not counted for the &quot;280 day&quot; test).</p><p>Individuals are treated as being present in the State on a day for tax residence purposes if they are present in the State at any time during that day. </p><p>  The Programme for Government contains a specific commitment to ensure that &quot;tax exiles&quot; make a fair contribution to the Exchequer.  A public consultation on tax residence rules was undertaken last year, to prepare for possible further changes in the area.  In general, the submissions received considered the present residence rules are clear and workable, and the clarity, certainly and stability of our domestic tax regime enables us to compete effectively in the international economic context.</p><p>  An Irish domiciled individual claiming to be non-resident for tax purposes and who is living abroad primarily for tax reasons may be subject to the Domicile Levy which is charged on an individual:</p><p>  - who in any year is Irish domiciled,</p><p>  - whose worldwide income in the year exceeds &euro;1m,</p><p>  - whose Irish located property in the year is greater than &euro;5m, and</p><p>  - whose liability to Irish income tax for the year is less than &euro;200,000.</p><p>The amount of the levy is &euro;200,000.  Any Irish income tax paid is available as a credit against an individual's liability to the levy.</p><p>  In Budget 2012 I abolished the &quot;citizenship&quot; condition for payment of the Domicile Levy to ensure that it cannot be avoided by renouncing citizenship.  The first year for which the changes applied was the tax year 2012; the levy payment for that year is due by 31 October 2013.  Measures in recent budgets to increase the tax take from high earners will also have an impact on so called &quot;tax exiles&quot;.</p></reply>

This scheme will run from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015 and provides for tax relief for homeowners by way of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a principal private residence.  Qualifying expenditure is expenditure subject to the 13.5% VAT rate.  The work must cost a minimum of &euro;5,000 (exclusive of VAT) which would attract a credit of &euro;675.  Where the cost of the work exceeds &euro;30,000 (exclusive of VAT) a maximum credit of &euro;4,050 will apply.  The credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is carried out.  The work must commence on or after 1 January 2014 and be carried out during 2014 or 2015.</p><p>  Homeowners must be Local Property Tax compliant in order to qualify under the Incentive, while building contractors must be tax compliant in order to carry out works.  The scheme will be administered through Revenue's online systems.  Contractors will be required to inform Revenue in advance of details of works to be carried and will also be required to notify Revenue in relation to any payments received in respect of the works.  Homeowners will be able to view the information provided to Revenue by the contractor through the Revenue electronic systems and will also claim the relief through those systems.</p><p>  It is not possible to say how many jobs will be created as a result of this incentive, as numbers will depend on the level of take-up.  It is estimated that this incentive will cost approximately &euro;62 million in a full year.  This cost equates to an overall spend in the construction sector of approximately &euro;459.3 million.</p></reply>

For this reason one of the SME State Bodies Group's policy commitments under this plan was to review the availability of appropriate finance for international trade.  In July the Board of Directors of the European Investment Bank, (EIB) approved a proposal to develop trade facilitation initiatives across Europe premised on the phased roll out of trade finance activities for SMEs and mid-caps.  The EIB are beginning with countries such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland where funds may not be available from other sources on reasonable terms. The EIB have already helped Greece in this area and are now turning their focus to Ireland.</p><p>  The EIB can lend money to Irish SMEs and exporters, usually through an intermediary such as a bank, at a lower cost than is currently accessible without their help.  These favourable lending conditions provide an essential support to offset price differences in credit across European countries.  This is particularly important for our exporting companies who have to compete with other companies who have access to cheaper credit and lower operating costs.</p><p>  Since the Budget day announcement, my officials along with officials in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and with Enterprise Ireland have already met with the EIB on this subject.  Working papers on the proposal have also been exchanged and the EIB are examining the feasibility of its support for such an initiative in an Irish context.  The engagement with the EIB builds on the strong relationship that my Department has sought to build with the bank in seeking to identify and develop sustainable mechanisms to facilitate the provision of financing to SMEs.</p><p>  The overall goal of this work is to address the specific challenges of funding international trade through a broader suite of financial products and leverage EIB funding to provide much needed finance to exporters and ensure that they have sufficient working capital to grow their exports.  This will ultimately restore confidence, support trade and foster growth and employment.  Working with the EIB to develop a tailored and customised trade finance initiative would support the growth of the SME sector in Ireland.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that this is being given the highest priority by the relevant officials and I can update the House as progress is being made at each step in the process.</p></reply>

In conjunction with Skillnets' ManagementWorks programme, a subsidised financial training programme for SMEs is under development which will assist them in putting together robust credit applications to lenders.  The programme, consisting of 2 days dedicated off-site training together with expert mentoring support, will launch on a pilot basis early next year.  The costs of delivery for training, mentoring and facilities are all subject to the outcome of a public procurement process and therefore subject to some variation.  However, the estimated cost of introducing the scheme in 2014 is in the order of &euro;750,000.  It is anticipated that Government support for the initiative will reduce the cost to participating SMEs considerably.</p><p>  This programme will add to the existing frameworks of credit support available to SMEs, thereby ensuring that viable businesses are better equipped to access credit more freely as the economy continues to recover.</p></reply>

I will however, introduce an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15%.  I am doing this to continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative, including the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate detailed below and to make provision for potential State liabilities which may emerge from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties.  The additional levy within the existing legal framework will apply to pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015.  The yield from the pension fund levy in 2014 is estimated at &euro;675 million.  The yield from the pension fund levy at the reduced rate of 0.15% in 2015 is estimated at &euro;135 million.</p><p>  The revenues arising to the Exchequer from the levy are, in common with Exchequer revenues generally, not hypothecated to any particular item of expenditure or liability but have been used to help fund the various measures introduced by the Jobs Initiative.  One of the very significant and successful measures introduced by the Jobs Initiative &ndash; the reduced VAT rate of 9% on tourism and certain other services &ndash; was due to end this year. In my Budget speech, I announced the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate.  I also announced that the Air Travel Tax is being reduced to zero with effect from 1 April 2014.  The combined cost of these initiatives is estimated at close to &euro;400 million in a full year.</p><p>  The Jobs Initiative also included a number of current and capital expenditure measures.  While the details of the expenditure on these measures are a matter for my colleagues in Cabinet, I would ask the Deputy to note that the Jobs Initiative originally provided for 5,000 places under Jobbridge, the National Internship scheme and 5,900 places under the Springboard scheme. Numbers who have participated in Jobbridge have now exceeded 20,000 with an evaluation by Indecon Economic Consultants finding that 61.4% of survey respondents were in employment within 5 months of finishing their internships.  The Springboard scheme, now in its third iteration, has expanded to over 16,500 places.  The expansion of these schemes, reflective of their success, will require further funding from the Exchequer. </p><p>  The extent of the potential State liabilities from the pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties is a matter currently under examination by my colleague the Minister for Social Protection.  As I have already indicated, however, the proceeds from the levy that accrue to the Exchequer are not set aside in the manner suggested in the question and expenditure decisions on the use of those and other funds will be made as they arise in the normal way.</p></reply>

On response times, Revenue strives to respond to all correspondence and contacts within its customer service standards, i.e., 30 days.  However, as LPT is a new tax it was inevitable that there would be exceptional temporary pressures at stages of the initial implementation and it was always going to be difficult for Revenue to meet service demands.  To put the scale of the task into perspective, since early March 2013 Revenue has processed approximately 1.59 million LPT Returns, lodged in excess of &euro;200 million to the Exchequer, answered in excess of 500,000 phone calls and replied to approximately 200,000 letters/emails.  In the circumstances, Revenue has done a very good job, in my view. </p><p>  On the specific case mentioned by the Deputy, I am advised that the refund arose when a second payment arrangement was made by the owner of the property without cancelling the original arrangement.  The situation was further complicated when the individual, who is a multiple property owner, sent other correspondence to Revenue on the revaluation upwards of another property.  The letter for the second property was inadvertently associated with the refund request on the basis of a common property identification number which led to a delay in dealing with the refund request. </p><p>  Once Revenue had fully clarified all the issues concerning the various properties linked to the property owner, a refund was approved and was issued on 1 October. </p></reply>

The Department will provide &euro;5 million per annum over a three year period to such schools.  This will allow schools to reduce the cost burden on parents with young children.  These schemes can result in savings of up to 80% of the cost of school books for parents.</p><p>  The Department will advise schools of the application process later this year.

Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school.  These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.  The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country has been a key educational priority in recent years.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. </p><p>  Details of the special classes for children with autism, including details of special classes for children with autism in the Dublin 7 &amp;amp; 15 areas, are available on the NCSE website <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.

The CFRAM Programme is being delivered through six separate CFRAM Studies.  Further details on this Programme is available at .</p><p>  The CFRAM Programme is designed to assess and map the country's river systems to identify areas at risk of significant flooding.  The purpose of the Programme is to:</p><p>- produce detailed flood mapping in order to identify and map the existing and potential future flood hazard and risk areas within the study areas.</p><p>- Build the strategic information base necessary for making informed decisions in relation to managing flood risk.</p><p>- Identify viable structural and non-structural measures and options for managing the flood risks for localised high-risk areas and within each river catchment as a whole.</p><p>  There are three main stages in the Programme and a suite of documents will be produced for public consultation at each stage:</p><p> - Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment - complete</p><p> - Flood Hazard Mapping (2013 - early 2014)</p><p> - Catchment Flood Risk Management Plans (2015)</p><p>  The country has been divided into 6 river basin districts (RBD), covering all counties of the State,  and separate studies have been commissioned, in each RBD, to carry out a detailed mapping of Ireland's rivers.  The Programme will meet the requirements of the EU Floods Directive (Directive 2007/60/EC) and the 2004 Flood Policy Review Report.  The preliminary flood risk assessment completed in 2011 identified 300 locations or Areas for Further Assessment which will be the subject of detailed flood risk analysis and modelling under the CFRAM Studies.</p><p>  The River Basin Districts are:</p><p> - Shannon</p><p> - East</p><p> - South-East</p><p> - South-West</p><p> - West</p><p> - North-West/Neagh-Bann</p><p>Engineering consultants have been appointed to all six RBDs to carry out the work.</p><p>  In parallel with the CFRAM Programme, assessment and identification of flood risk on a localised basis within each county is carried out by local authorities who can apply for funding under the OPW Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme, introduced in 2009.  The Scheme provides funding for local authorities to undertake localised minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection measures or studies, based on assessment of need within their own administrative areas.  The Scheme generally applies to relatively straightforward cases where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame. </p><p>  To date, OPW has approved funding of &euro;29m through the Scheme to local authorities in respect of approximately 400 projects located in every county around the country.  Details in relation to the Scheme are available on the OPW website  under Flood Risk Management.</p><p>  Pending the completion of the CFRAM the OPW is continuing with its programme of major flood relief schemes.  These schemes are focused on locations, throughout the country, where significant flood events have occurred in the past.  Spending in this regard has been of the order of &euro;120m in the past five years and further details are available on  under Flood Risk Management.</p></reply>

The allocation was part of a major initiative by the Government to improve childcare provisions and increase the number of childcare places available.  The provision of childcare places was identified as an important mechanism for enabling women to participate in the labour force.</p><p>  Seven cr&egrave;ches were delivered under the Civil Service Childcare Initiative (CSCI): two in Dublin (Mount Street and Marlborough Street) and one each in Backweston (Kildare), Athlone, Ennis, Sligo and Cork.  My Department chairs the CSCI Board which is responsible for the oversight of the initiative and the licensing arrangements with the cr&egrave;che operators.  The Office of Public Works (OPW), the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Civil Service Unions are represented on the Board.</p><p>  A Focused Policy Assessment (FPA) of the Civil Service Childcare Initiative was carried out by the Central Evaluation Expenditure Unit (CEEU) in my Department during 2012.  The principal findings of the FPA were that there was no longer significant market failure in respect of the supply of childcare places by the private sector and that the removal of this State subsidy could result in savings to the Exchequer of over &euro;600,000 per annum.  On that basis, the assessment found that there was no longer any rationale for continued State support for the seven civil service cr&egrave;ches delivered under the CSCI and recommended that the State should end its involvement in civil service cr&egrave;ches in a structured and planned fashion. </p><p>  The OPW was asked to examine the seven purpose-built cr&egrave;che facilities, and, in consultation with the CSCI Board, they identified an interim arrangement to allow for a phased transition approach to June 2016 to facilitate a public procurement process for the provision of commercially based cr&egrave;che services at these locations which would no longer benefit from the significant subsidy being proved under the CSCI.</p><p>  In December, 2012, the cr&egrave;che operators were informed by the Board of the findings of the FPA, and, that on the expiry of their current licence towards the end of 2013, the State would no longer subsidise or have any management role in the Civil Service cr&egrave;ches.  The operators were offered an option to continue operating the cr&egrave;che under a new interim licence for the transition period to June, 2016.  The terms of the interim licence arrangements were the subject of negotiations between OPW and the operators.  These include rental cost for the property to be paid by the operator as well as other costs such as maintenance and utilities costs which heretofore had been borne by the State.  The interim licence also removes the restriction on the cr&egrave;che to only accept children of public servants.  The cr&egrave;che operators were invited at the same time to start a process of communication with the parents regarding the changes.  Once agreement on the interim licence arrangement was reached with the existing operators during the summer of 2013, the CSCI Board and OPW have been active in ensuring that operators inform parents of the new arrangements.</p><p>  In view of these circumstances and the decision to discontinue the CSCI and the significant subsidy provided under it, the fees charged for the cr&egrave;che services are strictly a commercial matter for the relevant operators, in respect of which I, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform have no role or responsibility.  With regard to the specific matters raised in the Deputy's question, I understand that notification issued to the parents on 10 October, 2013 advising parents of the new fee structure which is proposed to take effect from 1 January, 2014.</p></reply>

Permission is required from the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) before any launch of these products can take place.  They are classified as 'free floating balloons' for which written launch permission is required.  I am informed that there have been no recorded injuries in Ireland to people resulting from the use of sky lanterns.</p><p>  The establishment of a European safety standard for these products is being considered by the European Committee for Standardisation.  However, there is an acknowledgement that it is not a straightforward product for which to develop a standard.  Under article 13 of the current General Product Safety Directive, an EU Commission decision to ban certain products can be made where there is agreement by member states that the risk is immediate and that current law does not protect the health and safety of consumers.  This decision is valid for a year but can be renewed for terms not exceeding a year.</p></reply>

The CEBs support the indigenous micro-enterprise sector in the start-up and expansion phases and stimulate enterprise potential at local level.  They are the first port of call in terms of advice, direction, training and, in certain circumstances, grant support for anyone who wishes to start or expand a business.  Contact details for the CEBs are available on . </p><p>  Work is well underway to transform the support infrastructure for small and micro businesses, which will see the CEBs as presently constituted dissolved and re-formed as Local Enterprise Offices within Local Authorities working under the direction and guidance of the new Enterprise Ireland Centre of Excellence.  This will ensure that Ireland has an enhanced, seamless and benchmarked support and progression pathway for small and micro business.  I am confident that this reform will bring about a new level of engagement and interaction at both national and local level in relation to enterprise support and economic recovery and growth, and will result in an enhanced, more consistent and coherent set of enterprise supports with positive effects in terms of start-up numbers and increased employment.</p><p>  I have also introduced two targeted schemes to support an additional flow of credit into the economy, namely the Microenterprise Loan Fund and the Credit Guarantee Scheme to positively impact on entrepreneurship and job creation.  The Microenterprise Loan Fund improves access to credit for microenterprises and facilitates the growth and expansion of viable businesses with less than 10 employees from all industry sectors across the country, which have been refused access to credit from the banks.  Support is in the form of loans for up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises, with viable business propositions, that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks after one full year in operation.  As of 18 October 2013, MFI has approved 109 applications to the value of &euro;1.674m supporting 107 microenterprises and 237 jobs.</p><p>  The SME Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) supports SMEs who, because of lack of collateral or because of the sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing traditional bank credit. Commercially viable, well performing micro, small and medium enterprises that have a solid business plan and a defined market for their products or services, and can demonstrate their ability to repay the loan are the target of this scheme.  The CGS is currently being independently reviewed to help improve the Scheme for all businesses.  I intend taking appropriate action as a result of the review to ensure use of the Scheme is maximised and a report will be published shortly.  As at 4 October 2013, there were 69 live CGS facilities resulting in &euro;9.7m being sanctioned through the Scheme by the participating lenders resulting in 433 new jobs being created and 139 jobs maintained.</p><p>  In addition, JobsPlus which was a disruptive reform in the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs is a new employer incentive, now run by the Department of Social Protection.  This pays a cash grant towards employers who offer employment opportunities to the long term unemployed.  Anyone interested in availing of the scheme should contact their Department of Social Protection local office.</p></reply>

There are currently over 82,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for 2013.  New revised rent limits came into force on Monday 17 June 2013 and will be in place until 31 December 2014.</p><p>  The new rent limits were determined following an extensive review of the private rental market which showed rising rents for urban centres, particularly Dublin and Galway and reduction in rents for the majority of counties.  The new limits continue to ensure that value for money is achieved while, at the same time, people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.  The purpose of rent limits is to provide adequate access to accommodation for rent supplement tenants, while paying a minimum contribution.  Where rent limits have fallen, this is due to the local rental market's supply and demand conditions which set the local pricing levels of rental property in the respective area. </p><p>  Officials in the Department continue to examine the impact of the rent limits on those who claim rent supplement and ensure that their accommodation needs are met.  Accordingly it is not proposed to conduct a poverty impact assessment.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. </p><p>  The Department has completed a review of the maximum rent limits for rent supplement.  The revised rent limits came into effect on 17 June 2013 and will remain in place until 31 December 2014.  The emphasis of the June 2013 review was to ensure that value for money was achieved whilst, at the same time, ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.  It is essential that State supports for rents are kept under review and reflect current market conditions.</p><p>  During the rent limit review the Department used information from rental tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) to analyse actual rental costs in each county across the country.  The Department also used publicly available data sources including the Central Statistics Office rental indices, the Daft.ie Rental Report and websites, advertising rental properties to ascertain both the market trends and the current asking prices for one, two and three bedroom properties.  The new maximum rent limits will not change the "after accommodation costs" income of persons receiving rent supplement.</p><p>  The Department is satisfied that the new rent limits provide access to accommodation for persons claiming rent supplement.  While the central aim is to ensure availability, the limits do not provide rent supplement tenants with access to all housing in all areas.  Officials in the Departmental will continue to monitor the impact of the revised rates and those administering the scheme will continue to ensure that the accommodation needs of rent supplement recipients are met.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-10-23a.332.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013102300077#WRQ00400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 121 together.</p><p>  Increasing State pension age and the abolition of the State pension (transition) are steps that have been taken to ensure the sustainability of pensions into the future.  The decision to reform State pension was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the standardising of State pension age for all at 66 years and the cessation of State pension (transition).  The State pension age will then increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.</p><p>  It should be noted that until the 1970s, the standard age for receipt of State pension was 70 years of age.  This applied at a time when longevity was much lower and working patterns were more likely to be physically demanding.  State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension and was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.  Over time, the age for State pension (contributory) was reduced to 66 years.   </p><p>  However, the Deputy may wish to note that a significant number of people coming on to State pension (transition) in 2012 did not come from work as many were already on other social welfare schemes.  In December 2012 there were approximately 14,400 State pension (transition) claims in payment and of those, 12.5 per cent came from work with over 50 per cent coming from other social welfare schemes such as illness benefit, jobseekers benefit and assistance, invalidity and carers, indicating that significant numbers of people are leaving the workforce for a variety of reasons well in advance of State pension age. </p><p>  In terms of social welfare supports available to those at age 65, all short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66.  The main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker's benefit.  Persons who qualify for a jobseeker's benefit who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).  Each application for any social welfare scheme is assessed on its own merit in terms of qualifying criteria and contribution history.  Where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, a means tested assistance payment may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions including a means test.  Further consideration is being given to the social welfare position of those exiting the workforce before pension age.   </p><p>  It should be noted there is no statutory compulsory retirement age for employees in Ireland.  Responsibility for setting retirement age is a matter for the employer/employee relationship and the contract of employment.  However, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has made rulings in a series of age-discrimination cases concerning Directive 2000/78/EC, which prohibit work-related discrimination on various grounds, including age.  The CJEU has clarified that mandatory retirement ages may be set down by employers within the context of national law, whether by contract, custom and practice or other means, which must be objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate social policy aim, with the means of achieving that aim being both appropriate and necessary.  Consideration of these issues as they relate to enterprise and equality policy come within the respective remit of the Minster for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Justice and Equality. </p><p>  An interdepartmental Working and Retirement Group was initiated to consider the cross departmental policy issues that will support longer working and thereby improve the sustainability and adequacy of pensions systems.  The interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of Social Protection, includes representatives from the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation; Justice and Equality; Public Expenditure and Reform; and the Pensions Board.  Further engagement has also been undertaken with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health and Children and work in this regard is ongoing.</p></reply>

To allow us to protect these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments such as the household benefits package, including the telephone allowance.  While we have cut the telephone allowance, there have been no cuts to the electricity/gas allowance, free travel, the free television licence, the fuel allowance or the living alone increase. </p><p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme has risen each year and the number of eligible customers has increased very significantly.  In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance, today there are almost 400,000, an increase of 24%.  Each year almost 10,000 extra customers become eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients.  The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephone services were more expensive and fewer people had telephones.  In recent years the nature of the telephone market has been transformed with deregulation, mobile services and bundled services including television, broadband and telephone.  There is a wide variety of deals and great competition now available. </p><p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has responsibility for the Seniors Alert Scheme which provides grant support for the supply of equipment such as personal alarms, smoke detectors and security lighting to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes.  The grant assistance is made available through community and voluntary groups registered with the Department and the equipment supplied under the scheme remains the property of the community group.  The budget allocation for 2013 was &euro;2.35 million.  While the equipment currently provided requires the use of a landline, there are other companies in the market providing similar services based on mobile technology.</p><p>  Finally, if any person is in particular difficulty, an application may be made for an exceptional needs payments (ENP) under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, to help meet an essential, once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet out of his or her own resources.  There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined based on the particular circumstances of the case.</p></reply>

The Government has also undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where commercial operators have been unable to offer services.  The combination of private investment and State interventions such as the National Broadband Scheme means that Ireland has met the EU Commission's Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband services available to all areas by 2013.  Accordingly, every citizen should have access to at least a basic broadband service.</p><p>  The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses.  This will be achieved by providing:<blockquote>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and<br /><br />- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</blockquote>  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years.  The results of this mapping exercise will inform the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are on-going.  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of a digitally enabled economy and society.  While all citizens should now have access to at least a basic broadband service, statistics show that some 65% of households have a broadband subscription.  This highlights the need for the range of demand-led measures contained in the recently-published National Digital Strategy.</p></reply>

It will be underpinned by a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) which is a formal, systematic evaluation of the likely significant environmental effects of implementing a plan or programme before a decision is made to adopt the plan or programme.  The SEA will be carried out by my Department based on the findings of an Environmental Report.  This is in accordance with the provisions of the relevant EU legislation, including Directive 2001/42/EC and the European Communities (Environmental Assessment of Certain Plans and Programmes) Regulations, 2004, as amended by the European Communities (Environmental Assessment of Certain Plans and Programmes) (Amendment) Regulations, 2011.</p><p>  An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) differs from an SEA in that it is an environmental assessment examining the impact a particular development project, such as a wind farm, will have on the receiving and surrounding environment.  The EIA is carried out by the appropriate competent planning authority on a project specific basis.  Typically, an individual wind farm project is subject to an EIA where the wind farm has greater than 5 turbines or a generating capacity greater than 5MW.  Therefore, any party wishing to submit a planning application for a proposed project of significant scale for renewable energy export will be required to compile an Environmental Impact Statement to support the application.  In considering such applications, An Bord Plean&aacute;la will take account of the Renewable Energy Export Policy and Development Framework underpinned by the SEA completed by my Department, as well as the project level EIA, before making its decision on whether or not to grant planning permission.</p><p>  EirGrid, as with any public or private sector organisation, is required to comply with all EU Directives on environmental and appropriate assessment in progressing transmission projects, including Grid West, through the planning process.</p></reply>

The Actuarial Valuation to 31 December 2008 showed an ongoing valuation deficit of &euro;1.9 billion and a Minimum Funding Standard deficit of &euro;1.8 billion.  As required by the Scheme rules, ESB and the ESB Group of Unions formed a working group to assess how best to address the reported deficit and to protect as far as feasible the interest of ESB and the current members of the Scheme. ESB reached an agreement with staff in 2010 to resolve the pension deficit.  The measures adopted under that agreement have, I understand, had a positive effect, resulting in the Scheme Actuary recently reporting that the Scheme is now in balance on an on-going actuarial basis. </p><p>  Aside from the on-going actuarial position, the Pensions Board also requires the ESB Scheme to assess whether it could meet a certain prescribed standard, known as the Minimum Funding Standard (MFS).  This effectively tests whether the Scheme could meet all its current obligations if it were wound up immediately.  Neither the Government nor the ESB envisages the winding up of the Scheme but regardless, the Scheme is currently still required to meet the requirements of the MFS.  I understand that the Scheme Actuary reported at the end of 2011 that the ESB scheme, like many others, did not, at that time, satisfy the MFS requirements.</p><p>  I am advised that the Pensions Board does not require the MFS deficit to be addressed immediately but does require that a plan be developed to address it over a reasonable time.  I am informed that the Trustees of the ESB scheme, with the agreement of ESB, submitted a funding plan to the Pensions Board, which was approved in October 2012.  In light of the fact that the funding plan was submitted in 2011, the then existing rules relating to the Minimum Funding Standard applied - the Pensions Board published revised MFS rules in June 2012 for addressing pension fund deficits.  I am also informed that the ESB plan aims to eliminate the deficit by 2018 and that this plan remains on track. </p><p>  Finally, with regard to the manner in which ESB accounts for the Scheme in its financial statements, my Department has been assured by the ESB that having taken expert legal and financial advice, the Company is satisfied that the current accounting treatment for the Scheme is correct and in accordance with applicable laws and international accounting standards.  I understand that the ESB Scheme remains registered with the Pensions Board as a defined benefit scheme, based on the relevant definitions as set out by the Pensions Act.</p></reply>

Draft guidelines will be published for public consultation by end-November 2013 with a view to finalising guidelines by mid&ndash;2014.  The revised guidelines will apply to all wind farm development in Ireland.</p><p>  In terms of the potential export of renewable energy, one of the key requirements for proposals of a significant scale for wind energy export will be the achievement of the necessary planning consents in Ireland.  Planning permission for such projects, which will be determined by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, must await the putting in place of a clear national planning policy framework and I have asked my Department to prepare such a framework.  The policy framework will provide the opportunity to integrate relevant EU Directive requirements (including Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment), trans-boundary dimensions and stakeholder participation within the context of a national framework. </p><p>  The outcome will be a high level development framework taking its lead from the Inter-Governmental Agreement, EU Directive requirements and relevant national, regional and local planning policy considerations in conjunction with wider policies, objectives and requirements.  It will incorporate a vision and strategy coupled with technical parameters and a spatial element.  The development of the framework will be progressed by my Department over the next year or so and will provide confidence and certainty for all stakeholders through an open, fair, balanced and consultative process.</p><p>  The initial phase of public consultation has now commenced and all interested parties and members of the public have been formally invited to make written submissions on the export project which will be taken into consideration in preparing the framework.  Details can be found on a new dedicated section on my Department's website, exclusive to the project, and which will be updated as the project progresses.</p></reply>

In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport power from renewable sources, with the transport target also being legally binding. </p><p>  There are already a number of policies in place to incentivise the increased use of renewable energy.  In the electricity sector, the REFIT schemes are the principal policy supports and offer guaranteed tariffs for electricity from wind, hydropower and a number of categories of biomass.  The REFIT3 scheme also supports biomass-fuelled high efficiency cogeneration which, in addition to renewable electricity, supports renewable heat.  This builds on the increases in renewable heat which were achieved by the Greener Homes Scheme, the Renewable Heat Deployment Programme (ReHeat) and the CHP Deployment Programme.  In the transport sector, the penetration of renewable energy will grow mainly with the increased use of sustainable biofuels which is supported by way of the Biofuel Obligation Scheme.  There is also a grant scheme in place to support the deployment of electric vehicles. </p><p>  My Department is currently finalising a bioenergy strategy which will set out the actions, including any additional policies, required to optimise Ireland's bioenergy sector's contribution to the 2020 renewable energy targets.</p></reply>

Several attempts to have the developer address fire safety concerns were unsuccessful and on 3 December 2009 Dublin City Council delivered a letter by hand to each occupied apartment advising them that Fire Safety Notices had been served on the developer which prohibited the use of the buildings until such time as works specified in the Fire Safety Notices had been completed. </p><p>  The Housing Department of Dublin City Council subsequently engaged consultant engineers to carry out a detailed investigation of the buildings which identified further and more serious concerns than had been uncovered by any previous inspection.  Since that time the local authority has used the statutory powers available to it to pursue compliance with planning permission conditions and with fire safety and building standards requirements, all of which are at issue in relation to Priory Hall.  Failure by the developer to honour court undertakings to remedy fire safety defects led to the High Court orders to evacuate the development in October 2011. </p><p>  With a view to preparing for remediation of the development Dublin City Council last year commissioned a full-scale technical survey of the apartment units at Priory Hall in its ownership in order to identify all necessary remediation works required in order to bring the units into compliance with the current requirements of the building regulations.  It is understood that, while the superstructure of the development is sound, significant remediation works are required and will include: replacement or securing of the entire brick fa&ccedil;ade, stabilisation of certain floors and walls, addressing widespread fire stopping and compartmentalisation defects, correction of stairs, removal of a small number of inner rooms, securing railings and stair rails, adding insulation, and removal of pyritic hardcore in one block.  A full-scale technical survey of the remaining units will be necessary before arrangements for re-design and remediation works can be put in place. </p><p>In relation to Belmayne my Department understand s that Dublin City Council, through Dublin Fire Brigade, was previously notified by the developer of a construction defect affecting 232 properties at the Belmayne Housing Complex.  The developer, acting responsibly in consultation with his Fire Engineer, contacted the Local Authority immediately and undertook to carry out remedial works to all of the properties affected.  Dublin City Council and the Fire Consultants for the developer agreed on the works necessary to rectify the problem units.  The Fire Officer is satisfied that when these remedial works are completed this defect will have been addressed.   </p><p>  My Department understands that remediation work on 225 units has now been completed while 7 units remain to be remediated but the developer has to date been unable to gain access to these properties.  The onus in this instance is on the developer to ensure compliance with the requirements of Part B of the Building Regulations and my Department understands that the developer has retained the services of Fire Safety Consultants to carry out inspections of the works during the remediation process.   </p><p>  In relation to the more general issue of building control and fire safety concerns in other developments it is important to note that implementation and enforcement of the building control system is a matter for the local building control authority.  My Department has no function in assessing, checking or testing compliance, or otherwise, of specific works or developments.  My Department continues, however, to liaise with local authorities in relation to significant building control issues that have arisen in a number of multi-unit developments across the country.  I have urged local authorities to continue to use all of the powers currently available to them to address issues of building standards compliance, including in relation to fire safety.</p></reply>

The aim of the review was to assess the nature and level of the challenges which are currently facing the existing Producer Responsibility Agreements as well as the forthcoming challenges that are expected to arise in the management of various waste streams.  My Department also completed a consultation process with stakeholders on this issue<b>.</b></p><p>  Following completion of the consultation process and the receipt of the consultant's report, I decided, after careful consideration, not to proceed with the introduction of a packaging levy at this time.  The primary reason for my decision is that the introduction of a packaging levy is likely to generate a number of regulatory costs to business and the public sector with few identifiable benefits, given our very successful packaging recovery and recycling performance to date in Ireland.  In addition, the consultant's report does not recommend the introduction of a Deposit and Refund scheme as to establish such a scheme is inappropriate, in view of the operation of the existing packaging scheme [Repak] and policies concerning household waste collection, plus the high administrative costs of introducing such a system. </p><p>  The consultant's report is available on my Department's website and can be accessed at: <i>.</i></p></reply>

Early and effective interventions are essential to prevent the occurrence or reoccurrence of homelessness.  Wider Government policy initiatives to tackle early school leaving, unemployment, addiction and mental ill-health and supports for vulnerable families will ultimately contribute to a reduction in the number of people becoming homeless.  An effective role is also necessary at local level in identifying and addressing the needs of at risk households and groups and encouraging the development of preventative measures on a regional basis.  </p><p>  Earlier in 2013, I published the Government's Homelessness Policy Statement in which I outlined the Government's aim to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.  The statement emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness, and includes provision for homelessness preventative measures and supports for homeless people with special needs.  The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.</p><p>  Arrangements have been put in place to provide for the delegation of homelessness funding to the lead housing authority in each of the 9 regions.  These arrangements seek to ensure that the measures being pursued by housing authorities reflect the housing-led approach advocated in the policy statement, that actions are in place towards achieving the target of ending long-term homelessness by the end of 2016, and that evidence to support progress will be presented through the reports on the relevant service indicators.</p></reply>

However, during the course of 2013 the Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System (PASS), which commenced operation in Dublin in 2011, is being extended nationally.  When PASS is fully implemented nationally it will provide good quality, timely data which will allow housing authorities to report in relation to the on-going extent and the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed. </p><p>  In advance of the full implementation of PASS the most complete set of data available in relation to homelessness nationally is the Central Statistics Office's special Census report, Homeless Persons in Ireland, which was published on 6 September 2012.  This report indicated that a total of 65 individuals were sleeping rough on Census night, 10 April 2011, while identifying a further 3,743 people as housed in accommodation defined as emergency, transitional or long-term.  Of the total of 3,808 individuals included in the report, almost 60% were in long-term or transitional housing arrangements.   </p><p>  A count of rough sleepers conducted in April 2013, organised by the Dublin Region Homeless Consultative Forum, found that there was 94 persons confirmed as sleeping rough on the night in question.  These rough sleeper figures indicate the significant challenge in dealing with the complexity of the homelessness issue and the difficulties in finding answers to it.  Rough sleeping is monitored closely countrywide but particularly in Dublin.  The problem of rough sleeping is very limited outside of Dublin, with Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway City Councils reporting sufficient bed capacity on a nightly basis and that there is no one sleeping rough due to a lack of a bed.  The Dublin Region's Outreach Team works on an on-going basis to engage with all individuals sleeping rough with the specific goal of moving people into accommodation through Dublin City Council's Central Placement Service.  Indeed, Dublin City Council recently commenced a public awareness campaign to encourage members of the public to contact the Outreach team about persons sleeping rough with a view to moving people into temporary accommodation and on to independent living.   </p><p>  The priority of this Government is to ensure that homeless people have access to secure, stable, appropriate accommodation.  It is not acceptable that people should sleep on the streets of our cities and towns.  While the immediate hardship of sleeping rough may be solved through emergency accommodation, this is not a viable long term solution.  The recently published Homelessness Policy Statement outlined the Government's aim to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.  The statement emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness.  While it is clear that a proportion of funding must be used to provide sufficient bed capacity to accommodate those in need of emergency accommodation, it is equally important that resources are channelled to deliver more permanent responses in a more focused and strategic way.  In the Dublin region in 2012, 879 people moved from homelessness to independent living. </p><p>  Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with the housing authorities.  Work continues between central and local government and the voluntary sector to ensure that the considerable monies spent on services for the homeless are effectively and appropriately targeted.</p></reply>

These figures fluctuate as households are allocated housing and new households apply for support.</p><p>  In accordance with Section 21 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, I directed all housing authorities to prepare a summary of social housing assessments carried out in their areas at 7 May 2013.  The data submitted by housing authorities are currently being analysed and once verified will be collated and a report published by the Housing Agency.  The report findings will detail the number of households on waiting lists in each local authority, broken down by basis of need, employment status, age of applicant, length of time on waiting list and other categories.  This information will provide an important insight into the level and type of need for social housing support across the country.</p><p>  The current assessment is the first to be carried out since the commencement of the Social Housing Assessment Regulations on 1 April 2011, which introduced a standardised system for assessing applicants for social housing support, including revised basis of need criteria.  The results, when available, will not therefore be directly comparable to the results of the last assessment carried out, as at 31 March 2011, the results of which are available on my Department's website  and the Housing Agency's website . </p><p>  The Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, clearly identifies that the priority for Government will be to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support.  I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested.  To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing is significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government continues to be committed to other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  My Department and the Housing Agency are also engaged with NAMA to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes.</p><p>  In spite of the current challenging circumstances, almost 70% of the budget for the Department will go directly to support housing in 2014 with an investment of over half a billion on a range of programmes.  Meeting social housing need within the available resources will necessitate smarter and more innovative approaches in order to maximise output. In 2014, I will continue to focus the available resources towards the most vulnerable and disadvantaged sectors of the community.</p></reply>

These resources have been supplemented by a further &euro;50 million announced in the Budget to fund infrastructural investment primarily in the housing area and, when taken in conjunction, funding for housing is effectively maintained at 2013 levels. </p><p>  Meeting social housing need within the available resources will necessitate smarter and more innovative approaches in order to maximise output.  In 2014, I will continue to focus the available resources towards the most vulnerable and disadvantaged sectors of the community.  I expect the recently announced &euro;30 million additional Exchequer investment in social housing to deliver up to 500 local authority homes for families on the housing waiting list.  Approximately half of this investment will facilitate the construction of new infill housing developments in areas with a highest demand for social housing.  It is intended that &euro;15 million will be invested in bringing vacant and boarded-up local authority houses back into productive use.</p><p>  The detailed arrangements for the implementation of the two measures are being developed by my Department at present.  I intend to announce these arrangements as soon as possible with a view to having the investment programme up and running as early as possible in 2014.  My Department will be requesting local authorities to submit proposals for inclusion under both measures in due course.</p></reply>

The main vehicle for achieving these objectives for public domestic water supplies is the multi-annual Water Services Investment Programme.  The current Programme runs to the end of 2013 and includes contracts to address deficiencies in the quality of supply, to improve the overall capacity of the system and an accelerated programme of mains rehabilitation.  The Programme also provides for the advancement of a further range of schemes through planning, for progression to construction in future investment cycles. </p><p>  In order to create efficiencies, improve service delivery and achieve cost savings in the delivery of water services, the <i>Programme for Government</i> provides for the establishment of a new State-owned national water authority to take over responsibility for managing and supervising investment in water services infrastructure from 1 January 2014.  Irish Water will be responsible for the delivery of water services capital infrastructure from 1 January 2014, and is currently preparing a Capital Investment Plan for 2014-15.  This Plan will include taking account of the transition of projects that are included in the current Water Services Investment Plan.   </p></reply>

In that vein, each fire service is currently undertaking an initial risk categorisation process for its functional area.  In order to provide a comprehensive and effective fire service to the community, section 26 of the Fire Services Act provides that it is a reserved function of local authorities to adopt fire and emergency operations plans indicating the provision made in respect of organisation, appliances, equipment, fire stations, training, operational procedure and any such matters as may be relevant.  The risk categorisation process referred to above will help inform local decision making in this regard. </p></reply>

This extensive monitoring programme provides a good overview of current water quality and trends as they develop.   </p><p>Water quality trends emerging in recent years include a notable decline in the incidence of serious pollution events from 39 sites in the 2004-2006 period, to 20 sites in the 2007-2009 period and currently down to 11 sites.  There has also been a stabilisation in the length of river channel regarded as unpolluted, at approximately 71% of the length surveyed.  However, the period has also been marked by a steady decline in the number of river sites at high ecological status.   </p><p>  The 2013 surveys are currently under way and a new national update for 2010-2012 will be available by early 2014.  In the meantime, this year the EPA has published regional reports covering the south east, Louth/Monaghan and Galway/Mayo/Sligo, including information from 2012 monitoring.  The EPA and local authorities respond to water quality incidents and complaints on an ongoing basis.  Details of recent incidents are available on the EPA website and can be accessed at:   Additional information is available at:   Comprehensive reports on water quality are published every three years by the EPA and are available for download at .</p><p>  The ambient air quality monitoring programme in Ireland is carried out to meet the requirements of EU Directive 2008/50/EC on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe, also known as the CAF&Eacute; Directive.  The Directive requires that certain minimum levels of monitoring are conducted for the purpose of assessment and management of air quality.  The EPA has responsibility for the monitoring of air quality in Ireland, and monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants based on data obtained from the 29 monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network. </p><p>  The EPA also publishes an annual report on air quality, based primarily on the monitoring requirements of the CAF&Eacute; Directive.  The most recent report, Air Quality in Ireland 2012 - Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality, was published in September 2013 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2012, compared to the CAF&Eacute; Directive standards as well as, for the first time, assessments in relation to more stringent World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines for the protection of human health.   </p><p>  Downward trends have been identified for many pollutants and Ireland currently meets all EU standards for air quality but exceeds WHO air quality guidelines for particulate matter.  Particulate matter levels in Ireland are of concern, particularly during the winter heating season, when people's choice of fuel can impact directly on the air quality in their locality and can thus impact on health.  To maintain our good standard of air quality and ensure that in the future our air will be healthy and clean, Ireland must continue to implement and enforce the ban on bituminous coal. Households and businesses should use more efficient methods to burn fuel and shift from solid fuel to cleaner alternatives, while also striving to reduce the demand for energy consumption.   </p><p>Levels of nitrogen oxides (NOX) at traffic-impacted city centre areas may also be a challenge in the future.  Ireland must reduce traffic emissions through implementing policies to reduce travel demand, increase the use of alternatives to the private car such as cycling, walking, and public transport and improve the efficiencies of motorised transport.   </p></reply>

The current assessment is the first to be carried out since the commencement of the Social Housing Assessment Regulations on 1 April 2011, which introduced a standardised system for assessing applicants for social housing support.

The remainder are for the most part processed within one week with a small amount of more complex cases taking up to 15 days. This time frame is of course dependent on all the required documentation being provided with no queries remaining outstanding. The approval rate for applications for Irish visas lodged in China is in excess of 93% which compares very favourably internationally.</p><p>    The current application fee for a single entry visa application lodged in the Visa Office in Beijing is &euro;60.  The fee for the equivalent visa for the UK is &pound;80 or about &euro;95.  A Schengen single-entry visa also costs &euro;60.</p><p>   The Deputy may wish to note that China is one of the seventeen countries covered by the Visa Waiver Programme which allows most categories of visitor to the UK, including tourists, to travel on to Ireland without the additional need for an Irish visa. This Programme, which was introduced on 1 July 2011, has proved a significant success with the number of Chinese visitors increasing from 2010 (the last full year before the introduction of the Programme) to 2012 by 38% according to figures from the Central Statistics Office.  </p><p>  The Government has also taken other steps to make the visa process easier, including, with effect from 1 August, 2012, a more liberal multi-entry visa regime for Chinese business travellers and regular family visitors.  This regime compares favourably with the approach taken by our nearest competitors.  For example, it allows for a multi-entry visa for 3 years for &euro;100 for qualifying travellers which compares with the $180 charged by the USA for the same duration.  In addition, agreed programmes aimed at short stays for the purpose of learning English in Irish colleges, with accelerated processing of applications and reduced formalities, have been introduced.</p><p>  Whilst I am satisfied that Ireland compares favourably with international competitors regarding processing times and approval rates for visas from China, my Department continually examines ways in which the visa process can further facilitate the promotion of tourism and business links to the People's Republic of China, in conformity with the needs of an effective immigration regime.  The success of the Visa Waiver Programme and the other initiatives is very welcome and this Government is not resting on its laurels and work is continuing, through regular meetings between the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and the UK Home Office, on the development of reciprocal short-stay Common Travel Area visa arrangements which would allow tourists and business visitors, including those from China, to travel to the CTA and to travel freely between Ireland and the UK on a single visa.  A timetable has been agreed which foresees rollout of such arrangements next year.</p><p>  This exciting initiative reflects the long history of cooperation between Ireland and the United Kingdom in the protection of the Common Travel Area and now, its promotion as a tourist destination for emerging markets, including China.  </p></reply>

It remains an objective of the Government to strengthen the regulation of the charitable sector in effective and proportionate ways. To advance this, a public and stakeholder consultation on the implementation of the Charities Act 2009, and the establishment of a Register of Charities, was carried out by my Department earlier this year and published in July.

The plan is expected to take approximately two years to complete and forestry will form a significant element of the Plan.  The Forest Service will be liaising closely with the NPWS in the formulation of the TRP on aspects relating to afforestation, felling and replanting.  It is also understood that the NPWS will engage in a formal public consultation process in relation to the Plan, which it will announce at the appropriate time. </p><p>  As development of the TRP progresses, and in advance of its completion, opportunities may arise &ndash; possibly in late 2014 - to pursue an interim arrangement to allow for the limited issuing of afforestation approvals in some hen harrier SPAs.

The application and its accompanying Environmental Impact Statement are being considered under the provisions of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act and the 1933 Foreshore Act.  All applications for aquaculture licences are referred to a wide range of consultees for comment.  These include, inter alia, the Marine Institute, Inland Fisheries Ireland, the Department of Environment Community and Local Government, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, An Taisce and the National Parks and Wildlife Service. In addition the legislation provides for a period of general public consultation.  My Department's Engineering Division also provides technical advice on each application.</p><p>  In relation to sea lice, Ireland's sea lice control protocols are operated by the Marine Institute.  These protocols are considered to be more advanced than those operated in other jurisdictions for the following reasons:<blockquote>- The inspection regime is totally independent of the industry.<br /><br />- Data obtained as a result of inspections is published and made widely available.<br /><br />- Treatment trigger levels are set at a low level.</blockquote>  In 2008, the State introduced a new Pest Management Strategy, supplementing the control regime already in place.  This has resulted in a steady decline in average sea lice numbers on farmed salmon since its inception.</p></reply>

Pigmeat exports increased from &euro;8m in 2010 to &euro;44m in 2012, an increase of 450%, while our seafood exports have also grown from &euro;5.7m in 2010 to &euro;10m in 2012, a 75% increase.  Exports of hides and skins are valued at &euro;40m in 2012. </p><p>  In the first eight months of 2013, when compared with the same period in 2012, there has again been a significant increase in exports to China, rising from &euro;213 to &euro;281m, an increase of 32% with dairy exports showing a substantial increase from &euro;120m to &euro;176m, an increase of 47% in this period. </p><p>  During my Trade Mission to China in April 2012, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Agriculture and Fisheries cooperation between the Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine was signed.  This provides a framework for the strengthening of the bilateral relationship between Ireland and China in the area of agriculture and fisheries.  It also provides for the sharing of expertise and the exchange of officials, designed to provide assurances to the Chinese authorities of the integrity of our food production systems, our high veterinary and food safety procedures and our technologically advanced agri and seafood sectors, thereby enhancing trade and facilitating increasing exports.</p><p>  This MOU builds on an original MOU agreed in September 2006 and on the Action Plan on Mutual Cooperation between both Ministries which I signed on 28 May, 2011, and which provided for Chinese officials to undertake work placements in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and in the Marine Institute.  Since the signing of the renewed MOU in April, 2012, there has been a significant increase in the number of political and trade related visits from China to Ireland.  My Department hosted seven inward delegations from China in 2012, including three Vice-Ministerial visits, one inspection visit and visits by senior Chinese officials, including a joint study visit by EU and Chinese officials, as part of their cooperation agreement.  Two further Chinese Vice-Ministers visited Ireland in May and June of this year. </p><p>  Ireland has also secured full market access to China for salmon exports, which represents a sizeable opportunity for Irish salmon exporters, with demand for high-end seafood in China growing substantially each year.  This followed intensive negotiations with the Chinese authorities by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) in conjunction with the Irish Embassy in Beijing.  Both the Marine Institute and Teagasc have also developed Memoranda of Understanding with their counterparts in China, focused on developing research between both our countries. </p><p>  Because of the importance I attach to this market, I have approved the posting of an agriculture attach&eacute; from my Department to China in the New Year.  The official will have specific responsibility for assisting in addressing any market access issues with China.  I am particularly pleased to see the very significant increase in our exports to China and that the relationships which we have developed with China in the Agri food and related sectors have provided a very solid basis for growth in our exports to this key export destination.</p></reply>

This review concluded that, arising from the substantial reduction in disease levels and the changes introduced earlier this year in relation to the implementation of controls in the context of the TB eradication programme, the number of administrative staffing required in the local offices would be significantly reduced and that further significant efficiencies in terms of the number of administrative staff required would accrue from the centralisation of administrative support in one or more centralised office(s).  I have accepted this recommendation and I have decided that the centralised offices should be based in Cavan and Portlaoise.  The choice of these two centres is based on the fact that, arising from the Government's decision to centralise human resources and payroll services, the staff required to provide the administrative support to the local offices will be available in these two centres as the centralised human resources and payroll services is rolled out across all Departments.</p><p>  I would like to emphasise that the centralisation of the administrative functions of the local offices should not negatively impact upon local access and services for local customers and experience to-date indicates that there has been no negative impact on the services provided by these offices.  In the event that the administrative support currently available in the Roscommon office is centralised, the Department vets, inspectors, technical officers and limited administrative support will remain in place in the Roscommon office and will continue to provide an effective service our clients across all of the schemes that are provided from that office.  In view of this, I am satisfied that frontline services will be fully maintained and public access for all of the Departments stakeholders will continue to be available at the Roscommon office, including to livestock exporters.</p></reply>

A single person aged 70 or over with income up to &euro;700 per week will continue to have access to GP services without charges.  A couple aged 70 years or over with income up to &euro;1,400 per week will continue to have access to GP services without charges.  It is planned to have that legislation in place by the end of the year/early 2014, with reassessments beginning after the legislation is in place. </p><p>Return to work arrangements</p><p>  Currently, persons who return to work after a period of unemployment retain their medical card for 3 years, regardless of income.  Under this measure, a person that has returned to work after a period of unemployment will retain a GP visit card for 3 years, irrespective of their level of income.  The measure will not be retrospective in that the HSE will not be seeking refund of costs of any services provided to people who retained a medical card after returning to employment.  However, the current circumstances of a person who has returned to work will determine whether they qualify for a medical card or a GP card.</p><p>  The Department of Health will work further with other Departments with an implementation date early 2014.</p></reply>

For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has been set of 12 months for a first time consultant-led outpatient appointment and this is reflected in the HSE service plan.  The SDU and the NTPF will work closely with hospitals towards achievement of the maximum waiting time.</p><p>  Should a patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he or she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.

Under paragraph 27 of the GMS contract a GP shall not demand or accept any payment or consideration whatsoever from a GMS patient in reward for services provided by him/her under this contract, or for travelling or for other expenses incurred by him/her or for the use of any premises; equipment or instruments in making the services available.</p><p>  The monitoring and appropriate care of patients receiving anti-coagulation therapy with Warfarin comes within the scope of competence of general practice.  Warfarin testing is also available free of charge in hospitals.  Warfarin testing is carried out by some GPs as a matter of course in their practices and I welcome this.  This provides their patients with an option of receiving this service locally in a primary care setting rather than attending an acute hospital for the service.  In relation to other blood tests, in circumstances where the taking of blood is necessary to either (a) assist in the process of diagnosing a patient or (b) monitor a diagnosed condition, the GP may not charge that patient if they are eligible for free GMS services under the Health Act, 1970, as amended.  </p><p>  The HSE has written to GP contract holders and clarified the position in relation to this matter and has also communicated its position to the Irish Medical Organisation.  Any alleged instances of eligible patients being requested to pay for a routine service of this nature from their own limited resources is viewed as a serious matter by the HSE and the Department.  I have been advised by the HSE that its Local Health Offices will fully investigate any reported incidents of eligible patients being charged for phlebotomy services which form part of the investigation and necessary treatment of patients' symptoms or conditions.  In such cases, where a medical card holder or a GP visit card holder has been inappropriately charged for the taking of blood, the HSE will make deductions from those GPs' routine GMS payments.</p><p>  Officials in my Department are in consultation with the HSE with a view to drawing up a new GMS contract.  The appropriate arrangements in relation to anti-coagulation therapy and phlebotomy services will be considered as part of the new contract.</p></reply>

No. 483 of 2011) represents the transposition of Directive 2006/126/EC into Irish law, and came into effect on 19 January 2013.  Under these Regulations, Category B covers a car plus trailer up to 750kg, B with code 106 is a car plus trailer which can be over 750kg provided the combination of car plus trailer is not over 4250kg, and BE is car plus trailer not exceeding 3500kg.   </p><p>  Earlier this year, I received representations from farming organisations suggesting that many farmers who had a car licence before the 1989 Regulations came into effect, had unintentionally lost their trailer entitlement by not ticking the appropriate box on the form when applying for renewal.  I agreed to make an exceptional allowance for people in this position - whether farmers or not - to reclaim the trailer entitlement, where they could prove that they had previously held it.  The RSA has made arrangements to accommodate drivers in this position for a limited period.</p></reply>
