An information feature was published in the Metro Herald on 9 January. Coinciding with the visit of the College of the European Commission to Dublin, the feature marked the start of the Presidency, the 40th anniversary of Ireland joining the EEC and the European Year of Citizens. It also drew attention to the Presidency website  as a source of ongoing information for the public about the Presidency and about Ireland in Europe. This feature cost &euro;14,000 plus VAT.  Metro Herald was again used for an information feature on 2 July to outline the results of the Presidency as it came to an end. To provide information beyond Dublin and the surrounding counties, a further information feature was published with a national newspaper, the Irish Independent, on 5 July. Each of these features cost &euro;14,000 plus VAT. </p><p>  These features were placed through the advertising agency which holds a framework contract for print advertising with the government; the agency was consulted as to the reach achieved by such features, the optimum timing for publication, the availability of specific dates and of course maximising value for money given the limited budget available.  We secured 37 billboard posters for Dublin city centre from Dublin City Council as part of their scheme - there was no rental cost for these and minimal design cost as we reused the Presidency branding already developed.  There was no online or broadcast advertising undertaken and no further publications are planned.</p><p>  As is customary for an EU Presidency, a report outlining our legislative results over the six months was produced on 1 July. The cost incurred were &euro;6,236.10 for the design of the 100-page report in four language versions and &euro;3,891.96 for translation. This document, produced within a tight turnaround time, is available for download on the Presidency website at  in all four languages. There was also a limited print run of this report which was managed by the in-house printing capacity in the Department of Finance. </p><p>  These modest outlays will be covered from within the Presidency budget in the Department of the Taoiseach. As you may be aware, the overall budget for the 2013 Presidency was set at &euro;60 million, excluding security costs. This amounted to an overall figure in excess of 40% less than the cost of the 2004 Presidency.  With some costs still to be determined, it is now clear at this stage that projected Presidency spending will come under the original Presidency budget of &euro;60m. The revised projected Presidency spend is now &euro;51m, a saving of at least &euro;9m. As the Presidency concludes and as final payments are made, a full financial report will be published later this year setting out the final cost of the Presidency.</p></reply>

Since then applications received for 360 projects from 16 countries have been considered.  The focus in 2013 will be on key frontline welfare and advisory services and on projects aimed at supporting new arrivals.  I expect to be in a position to make announcements on this year&rsquo;s grants shortly.  I am pleased that, despite the difficult financial situation we face, the Government has maintained the 2013 funding for the ESP at &euro;11.59 million, the same level as 2012.  The next opportunity to apply for funding for the Emigrant Support Programme will be in early 2014.</p></reply>

Thirty-five of our bilateral Embassies carry secondary accreditations in respect of one or more countries.  In all some 85 countries are covered by these arrangements.  </p><p>  Servicing these concurrent responsibilities places significant additional demands on the Embassies concerned, which are mostly small.  A large proportion has only two diplomatic officers.  A number have multiple side accreditations extending over very wide geographic areas.  Each of our embassies implements its own business plan which includes a programme of work to support relations with any countries of secondary accreditation, avail of suitable opportunities to promote Irish economic interests and provide consular assistance to Irish citizens.  This programme may include a number of visits to the countries in question, as opportunities and needs arise, as well as other contacts.   </p><p>  The schedule of such visits is not maintained centrally and gathering and compiling the data requested by the Deputy in the time available would require a disproportionate diversion of scarce and diminishing staff resources from pressing priority Departmental business.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-11a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013071100070#WRA01600"><p>I continue to follow developments in Egypt with great concern, not least the resulting loss of lives and hundreds of casualties which I deeply regret. In particular, it is important that the events of 7 July which resulted in considerable loss of life at the Republican Guard HQ in Cairo should now be thoroughly and impartially investigated.  The situation in Egypt will be discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council due to take place in Brussels on 22 July which I will attend. Considerable discussion has already taken place at senior official level in recent days regarding the EU response to the crisis and how Europe can best contribute to bringing about a peaceful and democratic solution to the crisis.  High Representative Ashton has also issued a number of statements on the situation, most recently on 8 July. As in my own statement of 4 July, the High Representative has emphasised that the immediate priority is for all sides to refrain from any recourse to violence and show restraint. </p><p>  In common with other EU Partners, the Government strongly believes that the only solution to the situation with which we are now confronted in Egypt lies through promoting a fully inclusive process of political dialogue and reconciliation aimed at the swiftest possible restoration of democratic rule and civilian-led Government, following free and fair legislative and presidential elections. The interim President, Mr. Al-Mansour, has now proposed a road map for the restoration of the constitution and of normal democratic government which now needs to be discussed and agreed by all parties in Egypt. It also remains essential for all actors and those now in positions of responsibility in Egypt to commit to and ensure the full protection of basic human rights, fundamental freedoms and rule of law. </p><p>  It is imperative for the interim Presidency and those in position of influence to reach out to all political forces, without any exclusion, and ensure all strands of Egyptian society can truly contribute to the building of a genuine democracy and improved economic circumstances. Conciliatory moves to defuse the current crisis, including the release of those detained for political reasons, are also essential.  As I have stated previously, Egypt and its people are experiencing a difficult transition to democracy. Ireland and our EU partners, however, remain fully committed to providing whatever support it can to assist the Egyptian people along this path.</p></reply>

A second additional measure will be the performance of restructured loans.

Institutions are also required to report their performance against public targets on a quarterly basis to the Central Bank.

Interest paid on a loan taken out in 2013 to construct a home on a site, but only where such site was bought by way of a loan, which itself qualifies for mortgage interest relief, and which was taken out in 2012.</p><p>  2. Interest paid on a loan to repair, develop or improve a home but only where loan approval was in place in 2012 and part of such loan was drawn down and used in 2012 and the remainder will be used in 2013. </p><p>  Also, before relief for mortgage interest will be granted, any necessary planning permission must have been in place on or before 31 December 2012.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-11a.60.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013071100070#WRA04400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 to 88, inclusive, together.</p><p>Profits or gains arising to an owner or part owner of a stallion from the sale of services of mares within the State by a stallion or from the sale of rights to such services have been taxable since 1 August 2008.  Previously, these profits were exempt from income and corporation tax.  Figures for the profits earned from the provision of stallion stud services were required to be returned in income tax and corporation tax returns from the year 2009 onwards. The figures thus entered are as set out in the following table for the tax years 2009 to 2011, the most recent available.</p><p><bu>Profits earned from the provision of stallion stud services</bu></p><p><table><tr><th>Tax Year</th><th>Income Tax Returns<br />&euro;m</th><th>Corporation Tax Returns<br />&euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>0.5</td><td>4.0</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>0.7</td><td>2.3</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>0.7</td><td>2.2</td></tr></table></p><p>In interpreting these figures it is important to bear in mind that they are profits as opposed to the total of the fees earned by an owner.  The fees represent turnover, as opposed to profits.  Income tax and corporation tax are charged, of course, on profits or gains rather than turnover.  In calculating the profits or gains, stallions are treated as stock in trade which means that income from stud fees and profits or gains on the sale of the stallions are fully taxable in the hands of both corporate and individual owners.</p><p>In computing profits, a write-off over 4 years of the &ldquo;initial value&rdquo; of the stallion is allowed as a deduction for tax purposes.  This reflects the fact that some stallions have a short nomination life and also takes into account that the majority of stallions are unsuccessful at stud. The impact of the deduction on taxable profits during the write-off period is directly related to the success, or otherwise, of the stallion. Without this provision the cost of a stallion would, under normal rules, be allowed as a deduction upon its disposal or death.</p><p>The &ldquo;initial value&rdquo; of a stallion is its market value on the later of 1 August 2008 (i.e. the date the profits became taxable) or when it is purchased for, or appropriated to, stud activities. For this purpose, &ldquo;market value&rdquo; is the price the stallion would fetch on the open market or, where the purchaser and vendor are not connected and the transaction is at arm&rsquo;s length, the price actually paid.</p><p>The Deputy has referred to the &ldquo;amount of tax revenue foregone as a result of the current scheme for the taxation of stallion profits&rdquo;.  However, as I have outlined, the profits or gains from this activity &ndash; as opposed to the turnover- are taxable in the same way as for other activities the profits or gains of which are liable to income tax or corporation tax.</p><p>The Deputy has also asked about the contribution to tax revenues arising from the taxation of these profits or gains. However, as I advised Deputy McGrath in my reply of 11 June last (PQ Ref No. 27413/13), I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as statistics on income tax and corporation tax receipts do not generally distinguish between the yields from different sources of income, the figures of tax yields from stallion stud profits are not separately identifiable. All taxpayers, both individual and corporate, can have a number of sources of income, and can avail of a variety of different deductions and reliefs, all of which affect the final tax liability. In addition the profit figures shown above may themselves be reduced by capital allowances or losses to which that taxpayer may be entitled. Therefore, it is not possible to infer from these figures the amount of tax that is generated solely from the taxation of these profits or gains.</p><p>Income tax and corporation tax are self-assessed taxes.  Full details of deductions claimed in calculating profits are not required when a return is being filed.  Should a taxpayer be selected for audit, then these details have to be provided.  It is not clear what purpose would be served by requiring a detailed analysis of the deductions made in arriving at the profits or gains from stallions.</p><p>Finally, I do not propose to ask the Revenue Commissioners to provide a report analysing the tax paid by corporate and individual stallion owners since August 2008. The Commissioners keep the general operation of the tax system under constant review using both statistical information and information gathered from audits and other interventions with taxpayers.  Horse breeding and stud farming are subject to a similiar system of income tax on profits as other sectors and are subject to the same compliance programmes by the Commissioners as any other sector.</p></reply>

The impact of the moratorium is therefore limited to the Director of Adult Education, Assistant Principal and Special Duties allowances payable to teachers on promotion. Vacancies at this level arise due to retirements in the specific grades and typically also from the knock on effect of filling Principal and Deputy Principal posts. The Department has interim alleviation measures in place for schools that are acutely affected by the impact of the moratorium at Assistant Principal level. It is a matter for each individual school authority to re-organise and prioritise the appropriate duties for post of responsibility holders in the context of implementing the moratorium.</p></reply>

The NCSE Policy Advice does not recommend a significant change to the manner of allocating SNAs to schools, but recommends clarification of the role of an SNA. The Deputy may also be aware that my Department has published a Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Analysis Review of the Special Needs Assistant scheme, which is available on my Departments website: www.education.gov.ie.</p><p>  The Review has shown that the SNA Scheme has been successful in supporting schools in meeting the needs of students with disabilities who also have significant care needs. However, the review also found that the allocation process is generally not well understood within schools and by parents nor is the purpose of the Scheme fully understood.  The review recommended that the SNA scheme should be restated to ensure an efficient allocation of SNA resources and to clarify the 'care' nature of the SNA role for parents, schools and professionals. My Department has established a working group which is presently implementing the recommendations of the SNA Value for Money report.</p><p>  The working week for full-time SNAs is defined in their contract (Department of Education and Skills Circulars 12/05 and  15/05). SNAs are required to work normal classroom hours including class break periods and in addition to attend before and after school in order to help with the preparation and tidying up of classrooms, reception and dispersal of children etc. The exact hours of work will normally be specified by the Board of Management in the SNAs contract of employment and may vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school.  In addition the contract for Special Needs Assistants in the post primary sector specifies that SNAs are required to work the month of June.</p><p>  Furthermore, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total.  Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days.  These 12 days will now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and/or the normal school year.  SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are obviously paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment.

In that Act, a Party Whip is defined as a member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann nominated by the leader of a party in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, having not less than two members in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, to be the whip of that party.

However, this allowance was never claimed by or paid to a member of either party, and as both parties have less than the required two members, this allowance is no longer permitted to be paid.  </p><p>  Officials from my Department are currently preparing a new statutory instrument to reflect the revised rates for various allowances payable to members following the implementation of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013.

Assessments made by the EU Commission and other studies show that a comprehensive agreement could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% per annum.</p><p>  The negotiating mandate given to the EU Commission to negotiate on behalf of the EU is a broadly based one, which includes financial services. The objective is to ensure that in financial services we remove existing Non-Tariff Barriers, prevent the adoption of new Non-Tariff Barriers and allow greater market access. Negotiations should also aim at common frameworks for prudential co-operation. The EU has a very strong interest in ensuring that financial services are included in the negotiations given the potential opportunities. The market for trade in financial services between the EU and the US is substantial. The scale of business from our financial services sector, and indeed its growth, is already characterised by a high degree of integration. The Irish financial services sector has played a significant part in the development of a transatlantic market in financial services.  As formal negotiations between the EU and the US have only just begun this week, it is far too early to anticipate the eventual negotiated outcome<b></b>of the Agreement.</p></reply>

Expenditure on carers has increased significantly in recent years.  In 2013 it is estimated to be &euro;776 million compared with an estimated outturn of &euro;771 million in 2012.

The current average time taken to process carer's benefit appeals decided by summary decision is 24 weeks and 28 weeks for those requiring an oral hearing.   </p><p>  These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystallises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.</p><p>  There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the office received 35,484 appeals.  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office. </p><p>  In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is currently underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.</p><p>  These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  Good progress is also now being made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 16,542 at 1 July 2013.  </p><p>  The average waiting time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 these times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks while the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  This improvement has continued with the average processing time up to June 2013 reducing to 36.2 weeks for an oral hearing and 27.6 weeks for a summary decision.  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.</p></reply>

One such condition requires a claimant to have 39 PRSI contributions paid at the appropriate class (either A, E, H or P) in the relevant tax year or years on which their application is based.  The relevant tax years for this claim are 1985, 1991 and 1992. In each of these years PRSI was paid at either class S or class V, neither of which are reckonable for the purposes of qualifying for Treatment Benefit, as a result a grant towards the purchase of hearing aids is not payable.  PRSI classes S and V are paid at a reduced contribution rate and have reduced entitlements attaching to them.

It was for that reason that the Government last year adopted the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy with a view to giving greater public recognition to carers and their work.  </p><p>  Carers receive significant income supports from the Department of Social Protection so that people can continue living at home as long as possible.  Expenditure on carers has increased significantly in recent years.  In 2013 it is estimated to be &euro;776 million compared with an estimated outturn of &euro;771 million in 2012.  The expenditure on carers in 2012 included: &euro;509 million on carer&rsquo;s allowance; &euro;24 million on carer&rsquo;s benefit; &euro;135 million on the respite care grant and; &euro;103 million on domiciliary care allowance.  Carers also receive a free travel pass at an annual cost of &euro;6 million and carers who reside with the care recipient are eligible for the household benefits package at an annual cost of approximately &euro;30 million. </p><p>  The respite care grant is available to all full-time carers regardless of their means while the income disregard and means test for carers allowance is the most generous in the social welfare system.  Carers are entitled to an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person and a respite care grant for each care recipient.  A person in receipt of certain qualifying payments and also providing full-time care and attention to another person may qualify for a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance while retaining their main social welfare payment.  Regrettably, I am not in a position to reverse last year&rsquo;s cut in the respite care grant.   It should be noted that the supports available to carers in Ireland are among the highest rates of income support in Europe.</p></reply>

In 2013, my Department will spend an estimated &euro;284 million on this scheme, providing some 410,000 customers with a package worth almost &euro;700 per year.  Under my Department&rsquo;s supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people who have special heating needs.  A person may qualify for a heating supplement, if they can show that they have extra heating needs and increased energy costs because of their age, medical condition or disability, are living alone or only with a dependent adult or dependent children  and satisfy a means test.  Approximately 3,200 people are currently in receipt of this supplement.  </p><p>  In addition, exceptional needs payments (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet out of his or her own resources. There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is decided on the particular circumstances of the case.  The provision for exceptional needs payments in 2013 is &euro;47.6 million, with an additional &euro;11.4 million for supplements.</p><p>  Other than that already outlined above, the Department of Social Protection is not in a position to provide any additional supports, including through increases in existing social welfare schemes.</p><p>  The telephone allowance is a component of the household benefits package.  The allocation for the telephone allowance scheme has been reduced in 2013 as a cost saving measure. The estimated expenditure outturn on the telephone allowance in 2012 is &euro;113 million compared with projected expenditure for 2013 of &euro;48 million. As a result the monthly allowance was reduced from &euro;22.60 to &euro;9.50.  In response to the reduction to the telephone allowance Eircom have launched a voice product aimed at Department of Social Protection (DSP) customers only. This package, called Talktime Control, gives eligible welfare customers the option of retaining their fixed line for &euro;19.50 per month (before DSP credit). The plan includes line rental and a &euro;5 call allowance for this price.   </p><p>  The introduction of a household broadcasting charge in place of the current television licence funding regime is being considered by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  No decisions have been made at this time in relation to the household benefits package.</p></reply>

This qualifying condition is applied to all applicants, regardless of their nationality.  The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere would not normally be entitled to social welfare assistance or child benefit payments on arrival in Ireland.  The habitual residence condition (HRC), as provided for in section 246 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005 (as amended), applies to claims for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, non-contributory State pension, blind pension, non-contributory widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s pensions and guardian&rsquo;s payment, one-parent family payment, carer&rsquo;s allowance, disability allowance, supplementary welfare allowance including rent supplement, and child benefit.  A person who does not have a right to reside in the State shall not be regarded as being habitually resident in the State.  HRC does not apply to exceptional needs or urgent needs payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  </p><p>  Each case received for a determination on HRC is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the legislation and guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case.  I have no plans to make any changes in relation to the habitual residence condition in relation to carer&rsquo;s allowance.</p></reply>

Persons in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit from my Department may be entitled to credited contributions or &lsquo;credits&rsquo;. Credits are intended to protect the entitlements, particularly to pension rights of employees participating in the social insurance when they are ill or unemployed.  A person who is providing full time care and attention as a carer is awarded credits on the same basis as if they were out of the workforce due to illness or unemployment. </p><p>  For those who are not entitled to credits including those in receipt of carers allowance can, if eligible, avail of the homemakers scheme which helps to provide a higher rate of pension for those who meet the qualifying conditions.  The homemaker scheme comprises a period of disregard when calculating eligibility for a State Pension, so time taken out for caring duties for those who qualify for the scheme, can be disregarded when assessment is being made for State Pension.  </p><p>  The scheme was introduced in and took effect from 1994, and allows up to 20 years spent caring to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  It impacts on women in particular as it assists them to qualify for a State Pension (contributory) by recognising periods spent caring for children or incapacitated persons.  The homemaker disregard will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  Eligibility for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is conditional on firstly meeting the standard qualifying conditions for State Pension.   </p><p>  When pension is calculated, regard is given to the full rate carer&rsquo;s allowance and the payment which is more beneficial to the customer is awarded. In addition, for those who qualify, the half rate carers allowance continues to be available for those in receipt of State pension.  In addition, further supports continue to be made available to older carers in the form of the household benefits package and the free travel pass.  Finally, for those who do not qualify for the State pension, the means non-contributory pension will continue to be available to those with an income need.</p></reply>

The process requires trustees to arrange for an actuary to carry out a valuation of the DB pension scheme's liabilities and assets at regular intervals and submit an actuarial valuation certificate to the Pensions Board outlining the funding position of the scheme.  The date of each scheme valuation must be not later than 3 years after the last date of the previous valuation for that scheme.</p><p>  If the actuary certifies that the scheme has insufficient assets to satisfy the Funding Standard<font color="#004080">,</font> the schemes trustees must ensure that a funding proposal is forwarded to The Pensions Board with the actuarial funding certificate.  The funding proposal must outline measures which ensure that the scheme could reasonably be expected to satisfy the Funding Standard by 2023 (in line with changes made in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012).  Following approval of the funding proposals, schemes report to the Pensions Board on their compliance with the funding proposal on an annual basis<font color="#004080">.</font></p><p>  The suspension of the Funding Standard in 2008 meant that trustees were not required to submit funding proposals, however some schemes continued to comply during this time.  Therefore, not all schemes had to submit funding proposals by the 30th June deadline, depending on the last date of valuation, and some schemes may already have funding proposals in place and approved by the Pensions Board to deal with their deficits.  With the reinstatement of the Funding Standard, approximately 300 schemes were due to send in funding proposals by the 30th June 2013.  212 of these schemes did not submit funding proposals.   </p><p>  The Pensions Board has, by now, formally written to the schemes that have not submitted funding proposals to ascertain their particular circumstances.  The Board will decide what steps to take scheme by scheme on a measured basis and taking account of the individual scheme circumstances. </p><p>  The reason for the delay in trustees responding will become clearer as the Pensions Board engages with schemes individually.  The Funding Standard had been suspended since 2008 with the date extended on a number of occasions, and trustees need to adjust to the fact that the regulatory structure has been reinstated.  A number of schemes have already confirmed to the Board that submission of their funding standard is imminent.  There also appeared to be an unfounded expectation that the date would be extended again and this contributed to the number that missed the deadline.   </p><p>  Following receipt of proposals, it will be possible to get a more accurate indication of the level of under-funding in DB pension schemes.  It will also allow for the impact of the many measures already introduced to assist DB schemes to be assessed, including the potential benefits to schemes of the use of sovereign annuities/bonds.  Trustees must meet their legal obligations, and ultimately the Pensions Board will use its regulatory powers where benefit underfunding is not properly addressed.</p></reply>

It forms dense thickets along roadsides, waste-grounds and waterways, reproduces by vegetative means and is difficult to kill off once it becomes established.  This plant is included among the list of the 100 most invasive alien species of the world.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department has been working with the Northern Ireland Environment Agency to fund and manage the <i>Invasive Species Ireland Project </i>  since 2006. This initiative provides advice and guidance on the management of a range of invasive species, including the species referred to, which can negatively impact on the environment and on property on the island of Ireland. </p><p>  Best Practice Management Guidelines for the species in question have been published and can be accessed on the project website at www.invasivespeciesireland.com.  These guidelines provide practical advice to persons and organisations, including local authorities, on the removal and disposal of Japanese Knotweed. When dealing with Japanese Knotweed, it is critical to ensure that any viable rhizomes, the main means by which the plant spreads, are not given the chance to escape into the wider environment.  I should also point out that the National Roads Authority have produced Guidelines, which can assist local authorities, on &#8220;The Management of Noxious Weeds and Non-Native Invasive Plant Species on National Roads&#8221; which includes a section on the treatment of Japanese Knotweed.    </p><p>  The European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 includes provisions in relation to controlling the possession and dispersal of ecologically harmful and invasive species of animals and plants, including Japanese Knotweed.  Regulation 50 of the Regulations, which includes provisions relating to the banning for sale of invasive species listed in the Schedule to the Regulations, is not yet in effect.  It is necessary for my Department to carry out risk assessments on those invasive species which are subject to trade before I can bring this element of the Regulations into force.</p></reply>

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including them on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.  Recognising this duty of care placed on owners of protected structures, a number of State financial supports provide for the conservation and restoration of heritage structures in both private and public ownership. As the Deputy can appreciate however, the scope for funding for the conservation of the built heritage is currently constrained by the significant reduction in the public finances. </p><p>  I recently announced grant funding to thirty-four local authorities under the Department&rsquo;s Structures at Risk Fund 2013 to enable conservation works to forty-five heritage structures in both private and public ownership deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration and which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000, as amended. The Structures at Risk Fund is set up to assist with urgent works to safeguard such structures, in private and civic ownership, and in certain cases works to structures within Architectural Conservation Areas. Typical works funded under the fund include roof repairs, structural consolidation and measures to halt water ingress. This scheme, which is administered by the local authorities, has been in operation since 2011 and has encouraged regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and helped to secure the preservation of protected structures which may otherwise have been lost. Since 2011 over 70 structures have been funded under this scheme.  Funding for this scheme is fully allocated for 2013.  However, subject to on-going budgetary constraints, I hope to fund this scheme again in 2014.</p><p>  I understand that the Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also administers a number of heritage grants schemes. It is a matter for the Heritage Council to allocate its funding appropriately given competing priorities within the heritage sector.  In addition, I understand that in certain circumstances some local authorities may offer funding.  As with the Heritage Council, it is a matter for the local authorities in question to allocate their funding appropriately.  Many local authorities employ Architectural Conservation Officers, who can offer specific advice to owners of protected structures.  It should also be noted that certain conservation projects may be eligible for funding under the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme Ireland 2007-2013 which supports the conservation and upgrading of rural heritage.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each county, including County Cavan, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at <i>www.callcosts.ie</i>.</p><p>The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme.  Broadband services under the NBS are available since October 2010 from the NBS service provider, &ldquo;3&rdquo;, to persons with a fixed residence or fixed business in all of the designated NBS Electoral Divisions.  In County Cavan, the NBS covers 45 of its 93 EDs, including the EDs of Canningstown, Cootehill Rural and Corraneary.  Details of the NBS EDs within the County are shown in the table.  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p><p>With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.</p><p>In tandem with these commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.  In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My officials have just commenced a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband services over the coming years.</p><p>The results of this mapping exercise will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment so as to deliver on the targets for high speed broadband contained in the National Broadband Plan.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p><p>National Broadband Scheme (NBS) - Electoral Divisions (ED) covered by the NBS in County Cavan</p><p><table><tr><th>ED Name</th><th><br />ED Reference No.</th></tr><tr><td>ARDUE</td><td>ED 27001</td></tr><tr><td>BALLYMACHUGH</td><td>ED 27009</td></tr><tr><td>BALLYMAGAURAN</td><td>ED 27010</td></tr><tr><td>BAWNBOY</td><td>ED 27011</td></tr><tr><td>BENBRACK</td><td>ED 27014</td></tr><tr><td>BILBERRY</td><td>ED 27015</td></tr><tr><td>CANNINGSTOWN</td><td>ED 27018</td></tr><tr><td>CARN</td><td>ED 27019</td></tr><tr><td>CARRAFIN</td><td>ED 27021</td></tr><tr><td>CASTLERAHAN</td><td>ED 27022</td></tr><tr><td>CASTLESAUNDERSON</td><td>ED 27023</td></tr><tr><td>COOTEHILL RURAL</td><td>ED 27027</td></tr><tr><td>CORR</td><td>ED 27029</td></tr><tr><td>CORRANEARY</td><td>ED 27030</td></tr><tr><td>CROSSBANE</td><td>ED 27031</td></tr><tr><td>CROSSDONEY</td><td>ED 27032</td></tr><tr><td>DERRYLAHAN</td><td>ED 27037</td></tr><tr><td>DERRYNANANTA</td><td>ED 27038</td></tr><tr><td>DIAMOND</td><td>ED 27039</td></tr><tr><td>DOOGARY</td><td>ED 27040</td></tr><tr><td>DRUMANESPICK</td><td>ED 27042</td></tr><tr><td>DRUMCARN</td><td>ED 27044</td></tr><tr><td>DRUMLUMMAN</td><td>ED 27045</td></tr><tr><td>DUNMAKEEVER</td><td>ED 27047</td></tr><tr><td>KILBRIDE</td><td>ED 27052</td></tr><tr><td>KILCOGY</td><td>ED 27053</td></tr><tr><td>KILGOLAGH</td><td>ED 27055</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Since it was enacted, a broad body of legislation at national and European Union level that is directly relevant to oil and gas exploration and production activities, including planning, safety and environmental legislation, has been passed.  Against that background, my Department is currently engaged in a review of the oil and gas exploration aspects of the Act.  Insofar as those sections of the Act which refer to non-petroleum minerals are concerned, these will be addressed in the proposed new Minerals Development Bill, which will modernise and consolidate the existing Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999.</p></reply>

It also identifies approved housing bodies (AHBs) as key partners in the delivery of social housing recognising both the constrained funding levels available for local authority construction programmes and the capacity and track-record of the voluntary and cooperative housing sector. I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs. </p><p>  The financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. </p><p>  In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. Through active management of my Department's housing programme for 2013, I am now in a position to approve a limited programme of house purchases for both the local authority and voluntary housing sectors. In the case of CAS funded projects, my Department requested local authorities to give priority consideration to proposals which will provide accommodation for persons with a disability. I intend to announce details of the approved projects over the summer period.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.</p><p>  Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) have a proven track record in managing and maintaining housing estates and flat complexes and in the provision of services and supports to tenants with specific categories of need. AHBs currently play a key role in the management of properties and the delivery of a wide range of services to households and communities within the regeneration areas. AHBs are also directly involved in the planning and construction of new housing projects to provide replacement housing for families where existing poor quality housing is being demolished. It is also intended that AHBs will have a direct involvement in the refurbishment of houses and the provision of replacement housing in certain estates within regeneration areas.</p><p>  There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government's objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). In this regard, NAMA is working closely with my Department, the Housing Agency and with local authorities and AHBs in relation to the delivery of social housing and all parties are committed to the maximum possible delivery of residential properties under this important initiative.    </p><p>  At the end of Quarter 2 2013, 296 properties have been delivered for social housing to date from NAMA's portfolio, with contracts signed in respect of a further 101 properties.  This brings the overall total number of residential properties completed or committed to social housing under this initiative to date to just under 400 properties. </p><p>  While these properties did not form part of any specific Regeneration programme, they include some properties where the approved housing body has substantial works to complete to make them suitable for occupation.  NAMA has invested some &euro;6m to date in the works required to complete properties. It will continue to be my Department's objective in 2013 to maximise the delivery of social housing using all of the resources available.</p><p>  Quarterly updates in relation to the delivery of NAMA sourced units are available on my Department's website at </p></reply>

The ban was subsequently extended in several phases.</p><p>  The EPA published its <i>Review of Ambient Air Quality Monitoring in Ireland</i> in December 2010 , which examined the effectiveness of the smoky coal ban . The Review found that t he ban on the sale of smoky coal has reduced levels of particulate matter in those areas where it applies by 15-20%.   However,  levels of particulate matter remain a concern where there is widespread reliance on solid fuel for residential heating, particularly in towns where the ban on smoky coal does not apply, with the result that air quality in some smaller towns is worse than in larger cities. The EPA recommended that the ban be further extended to all urban areas.   </p><p>  The smoky coal ban has since been further extended:</p><p>- from August 2011 to Athlone, Carlow, Clonmel and Ennis; and</p><p>- from May 2013 to Greystones, Letterkenny, Mullingar, Navan, Newbridge, Portlaoise and Wicklow.</p><p>  In addition, the boundaries of most existing smoky coal ban areas were revised with effect from September 2012 to take account of more recent urban development. A ban on the burning of smoky coal inside ban areas was also introduced to complement the established ban on its marketing, sale and distribution. The ban now applies in 27 cities and towns, including all urban areas with a population greater than 15,000 people.</p><p>  Air quality monitoring undertaken by the EPA has shown improvements in air quality in towns added to the ban in 2011. The results and analysis of EPA monitoring data will be made available in the next EPA annual air quality monitoring report, which is expected to be published in September. However, further monitoring will be needed to ascertain the impact of the most recent revisions to the ban introduce d since September 2012.</p><p>  Details of Ireland's carbon emissions over the last 5 years were published on 15 April 2013 in the EPA's report, <i>Ireland's Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990 -</i><i>2011</i><i></i> which is available on the EPA's website ().</p><p>  This report notes that solid fuel (coal &amp;amp; peat products) use in homes declined by 8% in 2011 compared to 2010.</p></reply>

Taking the energy efficiency requirements established in 2005 as the benchmark, the Building Regulations (Part L Amendment) Regulations 2007 set the requirements necessary to achieve a 40% improvement (over the 2005 standards) in the energy and carbon performance of new dwellings. The requirements were subsequently upgraded under the Building Regulations (Part L Amendment) Regulations 2011 which has delivered a 60% aggregate improvement (relative to 2005 standards) in both the energy and carbon performance of new dwellings.</p><p>  Part L 2011 marks an important step on the road to carbon neutrality and puts Ireland at the forefront of EU Member States in terms of energy efficiency standards for new dwellings. All the signs indicate that Irish builders and manufacturers continue to innovate and adapt their approaches and products to meet new standards as they continue to evolve progressively over time. This is important in terms of continuing the development of the market for energy efficient buildings and products domestically while also increasing the considerable potential that exists for high energy efficiency products in export markets. </p><p>  My Department has recently prepared a nearly zero energy plan for buildings that will enable us to meet our obligations under Directive 2010/31/EU within the prescribed timeframe. In relation to buildings other than dwellings, this will involve amending the Part L requirement in two phases between now and 2020 in order to deliver a 60% aggregate improvement (relative to 2005 standards) in both the energy and carbon performance of new buildings in that category. In relation to dwellings one further upgrade of the Part L requirement is envisaged. Any proposed changes to the Building Regulations Part L will be subject to a comprehensive public consultation process and a rigorous regulatory impact assessment before such changes may be signed into law.</p></reply>

These figures fluctuate as households are allocated housing and new households apply for support.</p><p>  In accordance with Section 21 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, I directed all housing authorities to prepare a summary of social housing assessments carried out in their areas on 7 May 2013. A report on the results will be published in the autumn and this will provide an important insight into the level and type of need for social housing support across the country. The results of the assessment carried out in 2011 are available on my Department's website  and the Housing Agency's website .   </p><p>  The Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, clearly identifies that the priority for Government will be to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support. I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.</p><p>  The financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. This includes a construction programme for 185 local authority houses and 111 houses for special needs accommodation, for the Approved Housing Bodies. Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government's objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure the identification of suitable housing units for social purposes and this process is on-going. </p><p>  In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities must operate it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013.   </p><p>  The payment of rent supplement is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Social Protection.</p></reply>

Matters relating to compliance by Approved Housing Bodies (AHB&rsquo;s) with company law fall within the remit of the Companies Registration Office.   </p><p>  I will very shortly publish the Voluntary Regulation Code which has been developed by my Department to provide a framework within which statutory regulation of the AHB sector will be pursued. This will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners as it takes on the expanded role envisaged in my Department&rsquo;s housing policy statement. The Code will assist housing bodies to improve their governance, management and financial capabilities and will facilitate better oversight of the AHB sector. </p><p>  AHB&rsquo;s are the de facto owners of the properties provided under the funding schemes for voluntary and co-operative housing. Subject to the approval of the local authority and contingent on having a Mortgage Deed in place, the assets and housing stock of an AHB can be transferred to another AHB. The need to make specific provision for the transfer of assets between AHB&rsquo;s or from an AHB to a local authority will be considered in the context of the development of the statutory framework.</p></reply>

The Directive requires that certain minimum levels of monitoring are conducted for the purpose of assessment and management of air quality. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has responsibility for the monitoring of air quality in Ireland, and monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants based on data obtained from the 30 monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network.</p><p>  The EPA publishes also an annual report on air quality, based primarily on the monitoring requirements of the CAF&Eacute; Directive. The most recent report, <i>Air Quality in Ireland 2011 - Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality</i>, was published in September 2012 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2011, compared to the CAF&Eacute; Directive standards. The forthcoming report for 2012 will also include, for the first time, assessments in relation to more stringent World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines for the protection of human health.</p><p>  Downward trends have been identified for many pollutants and while no exceedances of current limit values were recorded for 2011, levels of particulate matter (PMs) are a concern, especially where there is widespread reliance on solid fuel for residential heating, particularly in towns where the ban on smoky coal does not apply. Having different standards applying to coal between larger urban and smaller urban/rural locations is not ideal, as it results in different levels of environmental protection and clean air benefits for people across these different locations. For this reason, on 6 May 2013, I announced a joint North-South study on all-island air quality to examine air pollution from residential solid fuel, in particular 'smoky' coal, to consider the potential policy options to reduce such emissions with consequential environmental and human health benefits. </p><p>  Air quality monitoring results have also shown that nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) levels in larger urban areas, derived mainly from road traffic, have remained relatively static since 2002, with signs of a slight increasing trend in the years 2008-2010. Further reductions of NO<sub>2</sub> levels will require improved emission standards from new vehicles, reduced demand for private road transport, increased use of alternatives to the private car such as cycling, walking and public transport.</p></reply>

The previous rate of grant available was &euro;2,031.58 per house or 75% of the cost, whichever was the lesser.  I propose, in the first instance, to carry out a number of pilot schemes based on the increased grant level. My Department asked local authorities to include in their requests for funding under the 2013 Rural Water Programme proposals for pilot group sewerage schemes which might be viable based on the increased grant.</p><p>  Following an examination of the proposals received, with particular regard to the environmental justification provided and the estimated costs, I approved grant assistance last March towards eight pilot schemes in eight different counties, including one, with an estimated cost of &euro;80,000, at Boston Cottages in Co. Kildare. The proposal received from Kildare County Council for Kilmacredock, which had an estimated cost of &euro;800,000, was not selected as a pilot scheme.  Progress on the selected pilot schemes will be reviewed in due course with a view to deciding how best to proceed with the grant scheme.

In particular, Operation IRENE, which is in place for the months of June, July and August, incorporates a range of policing actions to be implemented at identified locations, which with the advent of warmer weather and longer evenings may experience an upsurge in anti-social behaviour associated with alcohol consumption.

In this regard, proactive mobile policing patrols are in place, focusing on urban centres, large open areas, public parks, harbour villages, coastal areas and key tourist locations to combat all forms of anti social behaviour, in particular drinking in public places. Special attention is also being paid to licensed premises and off licenses and all available resources, including members of the Garda Reserve, are being utilised in support of a high visibility policing strategy. </p><p>  Furthermore, extra patrols are being conducted in the vicinity of beach/holiday resorts during the hot weather in order to prevent anti-social behaviour and also to regulate and to deal with traffic management particularly at the weekends. I am advised that this will continue as required throughout the summer period and that all incidents of anti-social behaviour will be dealt with in accordance with the relevant legislation.</p></reply>

The Courts are aware of the statutory entitlement to remission when passing sentence.<b></b> Section 59 (2) of the Prison Rules, 2007 allows for the discretionary granting of additional remission, up to one third as opposed to the standard rate of one quarter, where a prisoner has shown further good conduct through his engagement in authorised structured activity and where, as a result, the prisoner is less likely to re-offend and will be better able to reintegrate into the community.</p><p>  This additional concession will only be awarded in exceptional cases and where I am satisfied beyond any doubt that the prisoner concerned has demonstrated that she/he meets the requirements as set out in the Prison Rules. I should also point to the fact that despite this additional opportunity to earn additional remission our remission rates are significantly below those currently operating in the UK and Northern Ireland where rates of 50% are in place.</p><p>  While there have been a number of applications for extra remission to date one prisoner has been granted this concession.  It is not possible to provide the exact number of applications as each case is dealt with on an individual basis and this would require the manual examination of records going back over a considerable time period.  Such an examination would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.</p><p>  The discretionary granting of additional remission, as opposed to the standard rate of one quarter, will be considered where a prisoner has shown the following:</p><p>  (i)  to have displayed good industry in prison and continue to be of good conduct</p><p>  (ii) to display willingness to seek employment through education/course work whilst in prison to enhance their chances of gaining employment upon release;</p><p>  (iii) through engagement in authorised structured activity and where, as a result, the prisoner is less likely to re-offend and will be better able to reintegrate into the community.</p><p>An essential part of the criteria for rewarding one third remission is that applicants engage in offence focused work which in turn should lead to a reduced risk of re-offending.<b></b></p><p>  In September, 2012 I appointed a group to carry out a Strategic Review of Penal Policy. This group are currently examining all aspects of penal policy including prevention, sentencing policies, alternatives to custody, accommodation and regimes, support for reintegration and rehabilitation and the issue of female prisoners. The general issue of remission, including its use in the context of sexual and violent offenders, will fall within the remit of that review and I will await their recommendations before making any decision on this matter.</p></reply>

The Community Return Scheme is a recently introduced initiative whereby carefully selected prisoners can be granted reviewable temporary release coupled with a requirement to do community service work such as painting, gardening or graffiti removal in a supervised group setting. The type of work involved is intended to assist the community and the scheme is involved with a large number of charitable organisations and local community groups.</p><p>As the above information illustrates, the results of the Community Return Scheme have to date been extremely positive with almost 90% of participants having successfully completed their obligations or are currently complying with the conditions of their early release. Any participant in the Community Return Scheme who fails to comply with the conditions of their release is immediately returned to prison.  As I have previously advised the Deputy, feedback from the participants has been positive with many commenting on the supports and structure that it gives them on their release and how it has assisted in their transition back into the community.</p></reply>

The Irish Prison Service developed a set of Healthcare Standards which were published in June 2004, setting out the standards expected under each of the seven main areas of care. These standards were externally audited by KPMG in 2008. At that time compliance with standards varied significantly across prisons (38% - 61%). Issues relating to awareness of the standards, healthcare facilities, utilisation of healthcare staff, absence of a local healthcare management grade, availability of drug treatment, record keeping and absence of administrative support were highlighted.</p><p>  Since this audit there has been a significant improvement in many areas of care. An awareness campaign regarding the content of healthcare standards has been undertaken. All healthcare care staff receive training on the standards at induction. Each closed prison now has a local healthcare nursing management structure in place, which has improved the management of healthcare staff and the coordination of healthcare inputs.  Healthcare facilities in Arbour Hill, Cork, Limerick, Castlerea, Midlands, Mountjoy , Portlaoise and Wheatfield have been significantly upgraded. Loughan House healthcare facilities are currently under construction. Healthcare records are now fully computerised and one single healthcare record is maintained for each prisoner, with all healthcare professionals contributing to the single patient record.</p><p>  The Irish Prison Service is in the process of carrying out a pilot audit with a view to informing a review of the current standards, to meet the changing healthcare needs of prisoners.  The Irish Prison Service has commenced discussions with the Irish College of General Practitioners to seek to identify and implement primary care standards for prison medical services and to devise a suitable audit methodology. A collaborative approach between the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Irish Prison Service will ensure that a robust tool is developed which can be consistently applied. Conclusions arising from such audits can be implemented to ensure that the standard of care delivered to prisoners is equivalent to that which is available in the community. It is intended that a phased audit of prison healthcare will commence in the autumn.</p></reply>

The decision is that the UK will be opting-out on 1 December 2014 from the pre-Lisbon police and criminal law cooperation measures, but will seek to rejoin 35 measures, including the European Arrest Warrant and certain other measures which it regards as important tools to maintain effective operational EU police and judicial cooperation. The decision announced by the Home Secretary on Tuesday is subject to a vote in the UK parliament next week.</p><p>  The UK decision is likely to have implications for Ireland and all other EU Member States. I have previously raised the matter in discussions with members of the UK government.  I expressed concerns over the possible implications of the proposed opt out for the excellent and and extensive cooperation between the respective law enforcement authorities of Ireland and the UK, much of which takes place within the framework of EU law.  It is particularly important that the cooperation between the two jurisdictions in tackling so-called dissident republican activity should not be hindered, and I emphasised the vital role of the European Arrest Warrant in this regard. Accordingly I very much welcome the UK's stated intention to seek to opt back into the European Arrest Warrant.</p><p>  Ireland will examine the detailed implications of the UK's announcement.  It is intended to liaise closely with the UK authorities and with other EU Member States with a view to ensuring that levels of EU criminal law cooperation are maintained to the greatest degree possible. </p></reply>

The position in those respects remains unchanged.</p><p><i>&quot;Work on the details of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 is ongoing at my Department pursuant to current Government policy which is committed, under the Programme for National Recovery, to &quot;introduce comprehensive reforms of the immigration, residency and asylum systems, which will include a statutory appeals system and set out rights and obligations in a transparent way. </i></p><p><i>As I have outlined previously to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, several hundred amendments to the Bill are anticipated, the majority of a technical nature.  I also expressed the considered view that instead of engaging in an extremely cumbersome process of tabling hundreds of amendments to the 2010 Bill, it would be much more efficient to publish a new and enhanced text.  Such an approach can incorporate the many anticipated amendments while addressing key outstanding issues, several of which have been of concern to Members including those being raised by the Deputy on this occasion.  This proposition was broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee and work on the Bill continues, therefore, on that basis while also taking account of any intervening matters of relevance such as decisions by the Courts. </i></p><p><i>  It remains my objective under this new approach, and subject to having to deal with the competing legislative demands of our EU/IMF/ECB Programme commitments, to be in a position to bring a revised Bill to Government for approval and publication before the end of the year.</i></p><p><i>Pending the enactment and commencement of the new legislation and with a view to improving processing in the area of international protection, I am proposing to introduce new arrangements for the processing of subsidiary protection applications in light of recent judgments in the Superior Courts.  My Department, in consultation with the Attorney General's Office, is developing a new legislative and administrative framework for the processing of current and future subsidiary protection applications. This work is being given high priority and applicants will be advised of the new arrangements as soon as possible.&quot;</i></p><p>  As I have stated on previous occasions, the introduction of a Single Procedure under the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill for applications for international protection will remove the current multi-layered and sequential process and this will result in applicants being provided with a decision on their applications in a more timely manner.</p></reply>

The person concerned arrived in the  State on 15 May 2000 claiming to be from South Africa and claimed asylum.  Her asylum claim was refused on the grounds of credibility. A Deportation Order was signed on 23 September, 2002. By letter dated 8 November, 2002 the person concerned was informed that she was required to present to the Garda National Immigration Bureau on 15 November, 2002 to make arrangements for her deportation. She failed to present and was classed as an evader.</p><p>  In 2009 the person concerned made an application for a residence card on the basis of her marriage to an EU national and was given permission to remain in the State while this was considered. In 2010 the person concerned was informed that this application was unsuccessful as she had failed to demonstrate that her EU spouse was exercising his EU Treaty Rights in accordance with the requirements of the Regulation.  In 2011 the person concerned made a second asylum claim and when it was discovered that she was a dual applicant the application was withdrawn.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the asylum application of the person concerned was fairly and comprehensively examined. The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter outside the State. The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  As a matter of policy, I do not intend to reward persons who have failed a very fair, thorough and comprehensive asylum process, and who have then proceeded to evade their deportation.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

This was due, in part, to an error in the Departmental reference number in the details provided with the question. The absence of other references used to link the individual to their records made identification difficult and as it happens the search for records located a different person with the same name. Indeed, it is to avoid situations like this arising that I would encourage Deputies to use the Oireachtas mail facility established to provide information to Oireachtas members on immigration cases rather than the Parliamentary Questions process. This facility provides up to date information on cases and its flexible nature ensures that any clarifications can be sought and provided very quickly.</p><p>  The person  referred to by the Deputy was registered in the State for a short period from 18th February 2002 to 3rd September 2002.  The person appears to have remained here without the appropriate permission.  This is in breach of Section 5(1) of the Immigration Act 2004 which provides that no non-national may be in the State other than in accordance with the terms of any permission given to them by or on behalf of the Minister.  Furthermore, Section 5(2) of the Act provides that a non-national who is in the State in contravention of subsection (1) is for all purposes unlawfully present in the State.  In the circumstances,  I would strongly urge the person to immediately contact their local Garda registration Officer.</p></reply>

The Government is taking all the necessary steps to bring the VHI to the point of authorisation and the Department of Health is working closely with the VHI and the Central Bank of Ireland.  The Central Bank will decide on the VHI's capital requirements and readiness for authorisation and the European Commission must approve any capital injection, under State Aid rules.  When these steps are taken, the Government will then make a final decision on authorisation and the injection of any required capital.  </p><p>  In the national accounts, capital injections by government into a publicly owned company are treated as transfers and worsen the general government balance if they are made to cover accumulated (or expected) future losses.  The payment to VHI is intended to further strengthen the reserves and is not being made to compensate for accumulated or expected losses.  While the VHI does not pay dividends to government, the capital injection by government will further increase the value of the company and will allow it to continue to operate on the market.  As such, the CSO considers that it should be treated as an injection of equity and it should therefore not worsen the general government balance.</p></reply>

In this context, it should be noted that ICS research indicates that the percentage of those who use a sunbed has reduced from 9% in 2003 to 4% in 2010. </p><p>  In 2009, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is an expert body under the World Health Organisation, reclassified sunbed use as a group 1 carcinogen. This higher risk classification now places sunbed use on a par with cigarette smoking. The World Health Organisation, the Irish Cancer Society and the Environmental Health Officers' Association amongst others have expressed growing concern about the use of sunbeds. The Department has taken these developments fully into account in its consideration of the measures in the proposed legislation.</p><p>  In addition to this prohibition on sunbed businesses from permitting persons under 18 years of age from using or hiring a sunbed, the legislation will also set out a comprehensive range of measures to promote a greater public awareness across all age groups of the dangers of developing skin cancer, premature ageing and eye damage from exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR).  Key provisions in the Bill will include:-</p><p>  (i) a prohibition on anyone under 18 years of age using a sunbed on a sunbed premises;</p><p>  (ii) a prohibition on the sale to or hire of sunbeds to anyone under 18 years of age;</p><p>  (iii) a prohibition on the unsupervised  use of sunbeds in a sunbed premises;</p><p>  (iv) an exemption for medical purposes;</p><p>  (v) control on the remote sale or hire of sunbeds (internet  transactions); </p><p>  (vi) sunbed operators, sellers and hirers will be required to notify the HSE;</p><p>  (vii) a requirement that sunbed operators provide training for staff; </p><p>  (viii) an enforcement regime and the imposition of penalties for non-compliance; </p><p>  (ix) an obligation on all sunbed operators to provide protective eyewear to users;</p><p>  (x) a requirement that warning signs be displayed in all sunbed premises;</p><p>  (xi) a prohibition on certain promotional marketing practices;</p><p>  (xii) a requirement on operators to ensure that sunbed users are made fully aware of the potential dangers of sunbed use; and a related provision whereby sunbed users are required to sign to confirm that they have been made so aware. </p><p>  I am delighted to be in a position to confirm that my Department expects to complete the drafting of this legislation within the next 6-8 weeks. The legislation has been accorded priority drafting status and officials of my Department are working closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to complete the necessary drafting work. Once the drafting is completed, the legislation must be notified to the EU Commission under the EU Transparency Directive prior to its publication and initiation of the Bill in the Oireachtas. This EU notification requirement will necessitate a minimum of three months to complete.</p></reply>

This is a necessary feature of the Scheme due to the  commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above a person's contribution. The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State. If price negotiations break down, a three stage review process, can be invoked. Details of the process are set out on the NTPF website.</p><p>  When the Nursing Homes Support Scheme commenced in October, 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years. The reason for allowing this period to elapse is to ensure that trends and statistics will be available in order to inform the work. The Terms of Reference for the review of the Scheme include an examination of the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices.

Under the Health Act 2007, statutory responsibility is given to the Chief Inspector of Social Services, part of HIQA, for the independent inspection and registration of all nursing homes, private and public.  This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive regulatory framework and the <i>National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland. </i>  All nursing homes are subject to the same core standards and regulations in relation to quality and safety in order to ensure the well-being of their residents.</p><p>  In order to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme all private nursing homes, and voluntary nursing homes which previously received funding for long-term residential care under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, have a statutory obligation to negotiate and agree a price for the cost of long-term nursing home care with the NTPF.  This is necessary due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above individuals' contributions.</p><p>  The cost of care covers:</p><p>  -  nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person,</p><p>  -  bed and board,</p><p>  -  basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living, and</p><p>  -  laundry service.</p><p>  The NTPF is independent in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State. The NTPF negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process.</p><p>  The NTPF assesses nursing home process under four criteria:</p><p>  -  costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money,</p><p>  -  price(s) previously charged,</p><p>  -  local market price, and</p><p>  -  Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p><p>  If price negotiations break down, a three stage review process can be invoked. Details of the process are set out on the NTPF website.  Finally, it should be noted that the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is currently the subject of a review. This review will include an examination of the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices. It is envisaged that the review will be completed in late 2013/early 2014. </p></reply>

The programmes have three main objectives - to improve the quality of care, to improve access and to improve cost/value, effectiveness. The primary role is the development of models of care, guidelines and clinical pathways. In addition areas for process improvement are identified and direction provided to achieve these improvements.  Currently there are 33 Clinical Programmes, one of which is the COPD Clinical Care Programme.</p><p>  COPD<b></b>is one of the commonest chronic diseases and is also one of the commonest reasons for admissions to hospital. The management of these patients by a structured programme of care including Outreach and Pulmonary Rehabilitation has been shown to reduce readmission rates and significantly reduce bed day consumption. The aims of the COPD Clinical Care Programme are to save 50 deaths a year from COPD, to reduce COPD admissions by 1,500 a year and to reduce readmission rates to 20% at 3 months. These aims are being achieved by decreasing morbidity and mortality through correct and early diagnosis, and by providing correct treatment based on best practice guidelines for treatment (self management, primary care and secondary or hospital care). In this regard, the Programme has developed a COPD Outreach Model of Care and a Pulmonary Rehabilitation Model of Care, and has also developed clinical guidelines which have been submitted to the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee which provides a framework for national endorsement of clinical guidelines and audit to optimise patient and service user care.</p></reply>

A maximum wait time of 12 months for adults awaiting an inpatient or daycase procedure was set in 2011. The maximum wait time target was reduced to nine months in 2012 and this year the target maximum wait time for adults is eight months, as set out in the HSE Service Plan. For children awaiting an inpatient or daycase procedure the maximum waiting time target is 20 weeks and for those awaiting a routine GI endoscopy, it is 13 weeks.  There is no six-month target in place. </p><p>  Figures for inpatient and daycase waiting times are published on www.ntpf.ie. The published data shows a rise in inpatient and daycase waiting times since the end of last year.  This follows the very significant achievements in reducing wait times at the end of 2012 and reflects the severe pressures on Emergency Departments in the early months of this year, which impacted on waiting times. In working towards the 2013 maximum wait times, the SDU together with the NTPF is working closely with hospitals to analyse performance, to agree mitigation plans and provide extra support as necessary and to optimise the use of hospital capacity. </p></reply>

While it has been acknowledged that there may be some methodological explanation for the results obtained, e.g. private hospitals not included and only 17 public hospitals participated, I can assure the Deputy that the findings are being taken seriously.  In direct response the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) has established a group to complete a full re-examination of the data collected for the EuSOS (European Surgical Outcomes Study) and to completely re-do the study.  </p><p>  The HSE is undertaking a number of general improvements in surgery provided in Irish hospitals.  These include:</p><p>  -  the centralisation of complex cancer surgery to high expertise centres;</p><p>  -  the establishment of pre-operative assessment clinics for patients with planned surgery;</p><p>  -  promotion of the use of a safe surgery checklist in all surgical theatres;</p><p>  -  expansion of Intensive Care Unit capacity with new beds being opened in St James Hospital, Cork University Hospital, Tallaght and Drogheda;</p><p>  -  prospectively measuring mortality rates for a number of key conditions;</p><p>  -  increasing the use of simulation and human factors training, as used in the airline industry, as part of surgical training;</p><p>  -  developing surgical standards and training programmes in collaboration with the UK colleges of surgery.</p><p>  The HSE has also been active in developing its data sources in order to improve the safety and quality of surgical treatments. The National Office of Clinical Audit (NOCA) has been established as a result of collaboration between the HSE Quality and Patient Safety Directorate and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. The primary purpose of NOCA is to establish sustainable clinical audit programmes at national level which will ultimately improve outcomes for Irish patients.  It is intended that the Irish Audit of Surgical Mortality (IASM) will be the first audit stream from NOCA to be rolled out nationally.  It will be based on the methodologies used by the Scottish Audit of Surgical Mortality (SASM).  The IASM will review all &quot;in-hospital&quot; deaths occurring to patients under the care of surgeons in Ireland. The overall aims of the audit are:</p><p>  -  to reduce surgical mortality through peer review processes</p><p>  -  and, crucially also, to examine the patient pathway with the aim of improving services for all surgical patients in Ireland.</p></reply>

Under UHI, everyone will be insured and will have equal access to a standard package of primary and acute hospital services, including acute mental health services.  A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premiums for those who qualify for a subsidy. The Programme for Government states that &quot;everyone will have a choice between competing insurers&quot;.</p><p>  The Department is currently preparing a <i>White Paper on Universal Health Insurance</i>  which will provide further detail on the UHI model for Ireland in addition to the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with the introduction of universal health insurance. Broadly, this involves the development of detailed policy proposals covering issues such as the design of the UHI model, the scope and composition of the UHI basket of services and funding and financial support mechanisms for UHI.  In terms of cost, the work necessarily includes consideration of mechanisms for ensuring both appropriate cost control and long-term sustainability of our health system. </p><p>  Work on the development of detailed policy proposals is proceeding with a view to publishing the White Paper as early as possible.  Ultimately, we are committed to learning from international experience and evidence and to introducing a model of universal health insurance that best fits the Irish system. More detail in relation to the overall process for producing the White Paper, including the projects, studies and policy appraisals that need to be undertaken, is set out in the preliminary paper on UHI, <i>The Path to Universal Healthcare, </i>published by the Department in February 2013 and available on its website, www.doh.gov.ie. </p></reply>
