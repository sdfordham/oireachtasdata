There is an annual open season during which deer can be legally shot under licence. The open season for deer operates generally from 1 September to the last day of February, depending on the species and gender of deer.</p><p>I am aware that deer species are increasing in range and numbers. Control is normally a matter for the owner of the property on which they occur. On lands managed by my Department, shooting may be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.</p><p>My Department, together with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, recently published a report entitled <i>&ldquo;Deer Management in Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Action&rdquo;</i>, which recommends a series of actions on deer management and conservation in a number of areas, including addressing the impact of deer in places where they are widespread. An Irish Deer Management Forum has been established to implement the various actions listed in the report. The Forum comprises representatives from the main stakeholder areas, such as landowners, forestry, hunting and conservation organisations, as well as representatives from both Departments. The report can be downloaded from my Department&rsquo;s National Parks and Wildlife Service website at .</p></reply>

As I stated, my Department is responsible for the enforcement of the Wildlife Acts and the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 477/2011), both of which prohibit the spreading of invasive species. However, in general, control of invasive species is a matter for landowners, and my Department carries out considerable work on control of such species in National Parks and Nature Reserves. </p>  <p>  My Department does not have the resources required to extend such work into the wider countryside, or to provide dedicated funds for such work to other bodies.</p>  <p>  Control of aquatic species in rivers, lakes and canals is a complex and difficult issue, as many of the species concerned can be very difficult to detect until well established, and thereafter are persistent and may be impossible to eradicate. </p>  <p>  I am aware the work of Inland Fisheries Ireland on the Asian Clam problem, as well as a wide range of useful work on invasive species, especially in controlling aquatic and waterside invasive plants. I am aware also of work carried out by bodies including County Councils, the National Roads Authority, Waterways Ireland and the Botanic Gardens. My Department will continue to work with these and other bodies.</p></reply>

My Department provides significant support for the arts and film through its funding of the Arts Council and the Film Board while my Department provides capital supports for the development of arts and cultural infrastructure. Other financial and policy supports are also provided, for example, through the taxation system. I was particularly pleased that the Government introduced a 25% increase in the income ceiling for the artists' tax exemption for 2015. This important measure recognises the invaluable contribution which artists, including songwriters and composers, make to society and to the music industry.  The IMRO report referred to in the Deputy's question, entitled <i>The Socio-Economic Contribution of Music to the Irish Economy,</i>highlights the impressive contribution the music industry makes to the Irish economy. The report contains a broad range of recommendations for which several Ministers have responsibility. My Department is examining those of relevance to my areas of responsibility. </p><p>I am aware of the potential of the creative sector to contribute to sustainable jobs growth and my Department continues to work with other Departments in regard to the audio-visual and music sectors as part of the Government&rsquo;s overall objectives under the Action Plan for Jobs.</p><p>I would also like to add that my Department - through Culture Ireland &ndash; plays a major part in promoting Irish arts and music on the world stage.

This partnership model provides my Department with a welcome opportunity to work with other bodies and agencies to achieve its strategic objectives and specifically those concerning the promotion of biodiversity, conservation and related education.  It also demonstrates the benefits of central and local government cooperation and collaboration. The Dublin Bay Biosphere represents a significant, exciting and unique opportunity to combine the interests of central and local government with those of the private sector and local businesses and communities in the Dublin Bay area. In the <i>Programme for Government</i>, we have placed much emphasis on the importance of tourism for the national recovery and specifically improving our tourism product. In this regard, I am confident that this biosphere project of international significance will bring much needed economic stimulus and employment opportunities to local communities in the Bay area.</p><p>This designation is a significant development for the Dublin Bay Area as it will provide the catalyst for local businesses and communities to demonstrate their green and conservation credentials and to explore and capitalise on the resulting commercial opportunities. It is expected that significant economic benefits will accrue from a UNESCO biosphere designation, through investment in heritage, culture, science and education and the promotion of sustainable products and services, and also sustainable tourism. </p><p>In addition to the promotion of conservation and biodiversity issues, the biosphere presents an opportunity to develop a unique brand identity for Dublin Bay to promote its amenity and recreation value. It presents a wonderful opportunity to promote Dublin as a city close to nature, providing a new incentive for people to visit the Dublin Bay area.  It will augment the existing tourist attractions of Dublin City, attracting a new type of visitor, and as part of a multi-activity holiday will provide an added attraction that will encourage an extended length of stay and repeat visits from visitors in the valuable adventure tourism bracket. </p><p>In relation to dredging/dumping at sea proposals, it is the function of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue Dumping at Sea permits and Integrated Pollution Control licences. Applications for consent under the Foreshore Act for developments are administered by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government. My Department&rsquo;s role, as a consultee to these licensing processes, is to review the various proposals submitted by the consent authorities and provide recommendations and/or observations, if any, to the relevant consent authorities, for their ultimate decision.</p></reply>

However, in general, control of invasive species is a matter for landowners, and my Department carries out considerable work on control of such species in National Parks and Nature Reserves. </p>  <p>  My Department does not have the resources required to extend such work into the wider countryside, or to provide dedicated funds for such work to other bodies.</p>  <p>  Control of aquatic species in rivers, lakes and canals is a complex and difficult issue, as many of the species concerned can be very difficult to detect until well established, and thereafter are persistent and may be impossible to eradicate. </p>  <p>  I am aware the work of Inland Fisheries Ireland on the Asian Clam problem, as well as a wide range of useful work on invasive species, especially in controlling aquatic and waterside invasive plants.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-09-24a.68.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/973" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015092400044#WRB00400"><p>Since this Government has come into office, huge efforts have been made to solve the issue of the protection of Ireland's raised bog special areas of conservation (SACs), within the framework of the EU Habitats Directive. This has included intense and ongoing engagement with turf cutting interests, farmers, non-governmental organisations and the European Commission.</p><p>A long-term compensation scheme has also been introduced to compensate cutters for their loss arising from the cessation. This cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme is comprised of a payment of &euro;1,500 per annum, index-linked, for 15 years, or relocation, where feasible, to a non-designated bog, together with a once-off incentive payment of &euro;500.  3,134 applications have been received under this scheme to date. Of these, 719 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs.</p><p>The draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan was published in January 2014. It sets out how raised bog SACs are to be managed into the future and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed. </p><p>Notwithstanding the complexity involved, progress in relocating turf cutters to non-designated bogs is being achieved in a number of cases. Potential relocation sites have been identified for each of the raised bog SACs where relocation may be required. When relocation sites have been assessed as suitable, my Department has been seeking expressions of interest from turf cutters with a view to them moving to these sites. </p><p>For a number of these SACs, the relocation site identified may not be suitable or may not have the capacity to cater for the number of turf cutters who may wish to relocate there. In such cases, and in the context of the finalisation of the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, my Department, in consultation with turf cutting interests, is considering the available options in terms of relocation and the provisions of the EU Habitats Directive. Under article 6.3 of the Directive, consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog SAC where it can be shown that such cutting will not have an adverse effect on the site. Under article 6.4 of the Directive, consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog SAC for imperative reasons of overriding public interest. </p><p>Given the clear scientific evidence of the negative impact of turf extraction on raised bogs, it will only be possible to utilise the provisions of article 6.3 in a small number of cases. Similarly, the flexibility provided for under article 6.4, if required, will only be applicable to a small number of sites.</p><p>Final resolution of all issues in relation to the protection of Ireland's raised bog SACs will only be brought about by everyone working together, within the law, with my Department and with the Peatlands Council, which was established with the purpose of ensuring the input from all stakeholders.</p><p>The <i>Review of the Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network, </i>published in January 2014<i>, </i>provides detail on future arrangements regarding turf cutting on each of the 75 current raised bog natural heritage areas. The Review has concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network. This will entail the phasing out of turf-cutting on certain natural heritage areas by 1 January 2017 and the partial or complete de-designation of certain natural heritage areas.</p></reply>

Significant funding is provided through the Rural Development Programme (operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) to assist farmers in meeting the requirements of the Birds and Habitats Directives. It is wise in my view that this Programme, which is co-funded with the EU, is used for such purposes. Farmers in Hen Harrier Special Protection Areas   are given priority access to the GLAS scheme and can receive the higher GLAS + payment if they have sufficient eligible lands.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that participation in the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) requires farmers to abide by the statutory requirements relating to Special Protection Areas and Special Areas of Conservation &ndash; collectively known as Natura 2000 sites. </p></reply>

These safeguards included an Ecological and Screening Assessment of the proposed film work, as well as stringent bio-security protocols. Specialist staff were on site at all times to supervise the filming activity and to ensure there were no negative impacts on the island, its wildlife, habitat or built heritage.  A condition of the consent is that the salary costs and expenses of my Department&rsquo;s staff will be met by the film company.</p>  <p>  My decision to grant consent in this case was notified to UNESCO and the European Commission and neither body has indicated any issues with the process and its outcome. I am satisfied that this is an excellent example of how film-making can operate in harmony with environmental protection, providing that all necessary safeguards are in place, allowing us to showcase our unique cultural and heritage to a global audience. </p></reply>

The Programme will be an invitation to everyone on the island of Ireland and to the global Irish community to shape and engage in a diverse range of historical, cultural and artistic activities &ndash; all designed to facilitate reflection, commemoration, celebration, debate and analysis and an active imagining of our future.</p><p>Officials of my Department have facilitated an intensive consultation period over the last few months, including active engagement with schools, universities, colleges, business and voluntary organisations, arts and culture institutions, historical societies and representative groups &ndash; at home and in our Diaspora around the world &ndash; to inform, to stimulate debate and discussion about 2016, and to foster programme initiatives. Work has been ongoing to implement a comprehensive programme and planning is well underway for the range of initiatives within the seven programme strands.  </p><p>Among the key milestones achieved to date are the following:</p><p>-  Over 83 public consultations, facilitated by the local authorities, have taken place nationwide. Arising from this, 31 individual local authority plans will be launched in October.  I have allocated &euro;1 million in 2015 in current funding to support this process.</p><p>-  I was delighted to host the first of the State ceremonial events of the <i>Ireland 2016</i>Centenary Programme on 1<sup>st</sup>August to commemorate the funeral of O'Donovan Rossa in Glasnevin Cemetery, in the presence of President Michael D Higgins and the Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, T.D.</p><p>-  An allocation of &euro;22 million in capital funding is being provided through my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2015 for the &lsquo;Permanent Reminder&rsquo; projects. These capital projects are progressing well and potential launch dates have been identified.</p><p>-  The Government has announced its intention to purchase and restore the National Monument at 14-17 Moore Street, Dublin, and arrangements to this end are progressing well.</p><p>-  The Global and Diaspora Programme, including the preliminary Culture Ireland plans, was launched on 29<sup>th</sup>June and was very positively received at home and abroad.</p><p>-  On 6<sup>th</sup>August, the Arts Council announced 9 major arts projects to commemorate 1916.</p><p>-  The launch of the National Flag Initiative took place on 14<sup>th</sup>September, with the first in a series of deliveries by the Defence Forces of the National Flag and the Proclamation to over 3,300 national schools across the country.</p><p>-  The grants programme for Irish language projects under the &lsquo;An Teanga Bheo&rsquo; strand of the Programme has been completed and will be announced in the coming weeks.</p><p>-  The Education Programme strand was launched on 22<sup>nd</sup>September for the primary, post-primary and third-level education sectors.</p><p>-  Consultation is ongoing with relevant stakeholders in Northern Ireland, including official, political, media, artistic and NGO stakeholders.</p><p>Further information in relation to the various events, activities and initiatives taking place under each of the above strands can be found on my Department&rsquo;s dedicated website at .</p></reply>

My intention is to have the Commemorative Centre - which will also enhance and complement the 1916 visitor facility currently being developed in the GPO and from where the insurgents retreated to Moore Street - open to the public at the earliest possible date next year.  </p>  <p>  The objective of the Government&rsquo;s decision to acquire Nos. 14&ndash;17 Moore Street was to bring the national monument into public ownership, to secure its long-term future and to complete the development of the proposed 1916 Commemorative Centre as quickly as possible.  The Government&rsquo;s decision also clearly demonstrates that the State is acknowledging the historical importance of the site in a clear and substantive way and that the long-term future of this historical landmark will be secured and safeguarded.</p></reply>

My Department subsequently gave the committee approval under the National Monuments Acts for the archaeological investigations needed to allow this proposal to be properly assessed.</p>  <p>  My Department has met with the graveyard committee and local public representatives in the meantime to further discuss the range of the test trenching required to establish the extent of any archaeology that might be present on the current site. Arising from that meeting, an amended and reduced trenching framework was conveyed to the committee by my Department in early August, along with advice on the most efficient approach to be taken with the work so as to minimise the associated cost for the committee.</p>  <p>  My Department is now awaiting the results of these investigations.

It can happen that specific areas or specific individual properties within an unfinished estate are excluded from the 'prescribed list', while others within the estate are included. In such circumstances the onus is on the property owner to check the correct status of the property with the relevant Local Authority. Revenue has no role to play in this regard and is obliged to disallow any exemption where the property in question is not included in the 'prescribed list'.</p><p>In regard to the specific cases, Revenue has previously confirmed to both the property owners and to the Deputy that while the estate in question is included in the 'prescribed list' the actual properties in question are not. This prevents Revenue from allowing an exemption from LPT regardless of whether the property owners were previously allowed a waiver/exemption from HHC.</p><p>Given the circumstances of the cases, Revenue has again made direct contact with the property owners and explained the required qualifying criteria for exemption from LPT under the 'unfinished estate' category. Revenue also outlined the various payment options that are available to assist them in meeting their liabilities in a manner that best suits their individual circumstances and also discussed the valuation implications for properties in an estate that is partially 'unfinished'.  The Revenue officer also explained both the deferral and partial deferral options that are available for LPT, which may be of assistance to the persons.</p></reply>

It is important that this advantage is passed on to SMEs and it is a requirement of meeting State Aid de Minimus rules. Therefore it is a condition of  loan agreements between the SBCI and both AIB and Bank of Ireland that and any failure to do so would amount to a breach of the banks' contractual obligations.

I met with the six main mortgage lenders and outlined my view that the standard variable rate being charged to Irish customers was too high. Subsequent to these meetings, the main banks put initiatives in place to allow borrowers to reduce payments. Such initiatives range from lower variable rates and lower fixed rate products to new suites of variable rates based on loan to values. </p>  <p>  I have just this week concluded a further series of meetings with the main banks. The main banks have, in fact, put options in place to allow borrowers to reduce their monthly payments. Borrowers should contact their bank to see what is available to them in their particular circumstances and consider moving to another bank if the offer is not satisfactory.</p>  <p>  Competition is the best long term way of reducing interest rates paid by Irish borrowers and ensuring that Irish banks offer a sustainable product range. Higher than warranted mortgage interest rates will encourage new entrants to the Irish market over the longer term. </p>  <p>  In the shorter term, customers can foster competition by considering switching mortgage provider. Central Bank research suggests that 21% of existing PDH variable rate mortgage customers could save by switching their provider. I expect that if financial institutions are convinced that there is a threat that they will lose existing customers, they will reduce the rates that they currently charge such customers. The CCPC website www.consumerhelp.ie is a valuable source of information on the rates charged by various financial institutions.</p></reply>

This report was published and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 16th July 2014.</p>  <p>  Following the completion of the report, and taking into account what NAMA has achieved to date, my officials concluded that:</p>  <p>  - 	NAMA has made significant progress in achieving its overall objectives.</p>  <p>  -	Based on NAMA's performance to date and its financial projections in light of the strength of current investor interest in Ireland, NAMA is well positioned to achieve its objectives.</p>  <p>  -	As a result, NAMA's continuation is necessary to achieve these objectives.</p>  <p>  Following the completion of the Section 227 Report in July 2014, the NAMA Board also committed to two initiatives in addition to their debt redemption objectives. </p>  <p>  The first is to ensure the timely and coherent delivery of key Grade A office, retail and residential space within the Dublin Docklands Strategic Developments Zone (SDZ) and Dublin's Central Business District. NAMA holds an interest in 75% of the 22 hectares of developable land within the Dublin Docklands SDZ and estimate that up to 3.8 million sq. ft. of commercial space and 1,950 apartments could be delivered in all the sites in the Dublin Docklands SDZ in which NAMA has an interest.</p>  <p>  The second is to maximise the delivery of residential housing units in areas of most need, specifically through the commitment to deliver 4,500 residential units in Dublin by the end of 2016. NAMA is on course to meet this target and, since 2014, has funded the delivery of more than 1,700 new housing units across 39 sites in the Greater Dublin Area.  This activity has resulted in NAMA funding the delivery of 40% of new housing units in Dublin in 2014 and 50% in the first half of 2015. The Agency has also indicated they will facilitate delivery of new homes elsewhere in the country in line with demand over this period. </p>  <p>  These initiatives are entirely consistent with NAMA's core mandate of maximising the return to the taxpayer.  Furthermore the oversight provisions, contained in the Act, also allow me to regularly monitor NAMA's activity, role, and performance towards meetings it's objectives.</p>  <p>  For example NAMA's Annual Report and Financial Statements are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The level of disclosure in NAMA's Annual Report and Financial Statements is comprehensive and professional.  I would encourage anyone interested  in the workings and performance of NAMA who have not yet read these reports to take the time to do so as they are a rich source of information regarding NAMA's performance. </p>  <p>  In addition, under Section 53 of the NAMA Act, NAMA is also required to submit to me an Annual Statement by 30 September each year setting out its proposed objectives for the following financial year, the scope of activities to be undertaken, its strategies and policies and its proposed use of resources. </p>  <p>  NAMA is also required to report to me on a quarterly basis giving detailed information about its loans, its financing arrangements and its income and expenditure. These reports, which also include other information specified under Section 55 of the NAMA Act, track NAMA's progress on a quarterly basis.  For example, the most recent report for Quarter 1 2015 highlighted some key recent achievements on the Dublin Docklands SDZ, Residential, and Social Housing facilitation.</p>  <p>  The Chairman and Chief Executive are also accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts (PAC) and other Oireachtas committees and to give evidence to those committees whenever required to do so - and most recently  attended the PAC on 9 July 2015. Transcripts of these appearances are available from the Oireachtas website.</p>  <p>  NAMA's accounts are also comprehensively audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. For large parts of the year - typically between September and May   C&amp;AG staff are based in the Agency, performing their audit function, with unrestricted access to all its records and files.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has already produced three special reports on NAMA's activities and they have been broadly positive in their assessment of how NAMA is managing its complex business. I note that their upcoming tri-annual review will focus on value for money and will examine some of the Agency's landmark sales processes.</p>  <p>  Therefore, given the many oversight provisions already in place, I would not intend to conduct a stand-alone review of NAMA's role and remit prior to the next scheduled Section 227 report, which is due in 2019 - one year prior to NAMA's expected dissolution.</p></reply>

On 11 March 2015, the Group announced that it had agreed the sale of &euro;1.5billion of non-core Irish Commercial Real Estate loans, in addition to GBP &pound;2 billion of UK lending assets and the UK subsidiary company, CHL. Both of these transactions have since completed. On 9 July 2015, the Group announced that it had agreed the sale of c.&euro;500million  Irish Commercial Real Estate loans; this transaction is scheduled to complete before the end of October and will conclude the disposal of non-core Irish loans. The sale of residual UK assets is ongoing.  </p>  <p>  The Group also committed in the Restructuring Plan to reducing the value of defaulted Irish Tracker mortgages through a combination of measures, including cures and asset sales by a pre-determined date and according to a pre-determined schedule.  I am advised by Permanent TSB that it is their clear preference that such a reduction would be achieved by way of completed treatments in order to cure the defaulted loans rather than other means. Such an objective provides the best outcome for affected customers. If the target cannot be met through such an approach or by other means, then Permanent TSB would be required by the Restructuring Plan to sell such loans within the pre-determined timelines. </p></reply>

Its purpose is to discourage over-funding and over-accrual of pension benefits through tax-relieved and tax-subsidised arrangements. The regime achieves this by imposing a significant tax charge on the value of retirement benefits above set limits when they are drawn down. </p>  <p>  When the SFT limit was reduced in Budget and Finance Act 2011 to a level of &euro;2.3 million, with effect from 7 December 2010, and was further reduced in Budget and Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 to &euro;2 million, with effect from 1 January 2014, the clear legal advice to the Government (as at the time of the original introduction of the regime in 2005) was that an individual who had pension rights in excess of the SFT limit at the relevant dates was entitled to protect or "grandfather" those rights. Accordingly, the legislation provided that such individuals could protect their higher pension values, subject to certain ceilings and conditions, by applying to the Revenue Commissioners for a PFT certificate. </p>  <p>  The Deputy is seeking to establish the cumulative level of protection afforded and the estimated tax foregone resulting from the grandfathering arrangements outlined above. The concept of "tax foregone" is arguably more applicable in the context of tax reliefs where there is a choice as to whether to pursue the particular policy stance or not. In that regard, it is important to note that these grandfathering arrangements were not considered optional and were provided in the legislation following legal advice to that effect from the Attorney General. In other words, introducing the SFT regime required the simultaneous protection of pension rights that had been built up legitimately by individuals under the tax provisions that applied up to the relevant dates. This was the firm legal advice to the Government when the SFT was introduced and on each subsequent occasion that the SFT limit was reduced. The choice, therefore, was to introduce the SFT regime, with grandfathering, or not at all. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, according to their records, since 7 December 2010, when the SFT was reduced to &euro;2.3 million, they have issued 941 PFT certificates with a value of some &euro;2,975 million. Since 1 January 2014, when the SFT was further reduced to &euro;2 million, Revenue has to date issued a further 651 PFT certificates with a total value of some &euro;1,441 million. The combined overall value of PFT certificates issued since 7 December 2010 is, therefore, &euro;4,416 million. The cumulative additional value of pension benefits protected as compared with the SFT limits applying at 7 December 2010 and 1 January 2014, respectively is, therefore, some &euro;950 million. </p></reply>

The Revenue Commissioners cannot, for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality, disclose details of or comment publicly on the specific affairs of any individual business or taxpayer and I think that is entirely appropriate. </p>  <p>  I also think that intervention by me in the relationship between the Revenue Commissioners and a particular business or taxpayer would not be appropriate. It is a longstanding convention that the Minister for Finance does not intervene in the relationship between the Revenue Commissioners and an individual taxpayer, I would in that context, remind the House of the provision enacted by the Oireachtas in the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 whereby the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the performance of their functions was enacted in Section 101 of that Act.</p>  <p>  As previously outlined to the Deputy, the terms of reference of the proposed Commission of Investigation in relation to IBRC include the following explicit term of reference (1b) dealing with issues of public concern:</p>  <p>  The Commission shall investigate all transactions, activities and management decisions, other than those relating solely to the acquisition of assets by NAMA which occurred during the relevant period and which "are specifically identified by the Commission as giving rise or likely to give rise to potential public concern, in respect of the ultimate returns to the taxpayer"</p>  <p>  Both Houses of the Oireachtas have approved the terms of reference. It is important that I do not interfere with or prejudice the important work to be conducted by the Commission of Investigation. In those circumstances I have received legal advice that it would be inappropriate for me to comment publicly in relation to certain matters which fall under the scope of the Commission of Investigation.   </p></reply>

This was handled in the main by Department of Social Protection in terms of benefits and the Educational Training Boards/ Local Enterprise Offices in terms of courses and support for start-up businesses.  IDA Ireland, in conjunction with BOSE HR, developed a demographic and skills profile of the current staff at the BOSE facility. This profile will be central to IDA Ireland&rsquo;s marketing of the location.</p>  <p>  My focus, as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, has been on two principal issues: the first is bringing negotiations on specific job-creation projects to a successful conclusion and, secondly, marketing the BOSE facility to other potential investors.</p>  <p>  In relation to the first issue, I have announced two job-creation projects for Cavan/Monaghan in recent months, namely:</p>  <p>  -	The announcement by Combilift that it will invest &euro;50 million in its facility in Monaghan town, supported my Department through Enterprise Ireland, resulting in the eventual creation of 200 permanent jobs as well as 200 construction jobs,</p>  <p>-	  The announcement by Lakelands Dairies that it will invest &euro;36 million in its facility in Bailieborough, also supported by my Department through Enterprise Ireland, resulting in the creation of 81 permanent jobs as well as 180 construction jobs.</p>  <p>  In relation to the second issue, finding a replacement industry for Carrickmacross remains a very high priority. I have been in regular contact with IDA Ireland to ensure that everything possible is being done to market the facility abroad through IDA&rsquo;s network of overseas offices. The premises are privately owned and leased by BOSE.  Both the building itself and the skilled workforce already there are strong selling points. </p>  <p>  I have also ensured that Enterprise Ireland is likewise marketing the facility to its client base. It is worth noting that indigenous Irish companies in Co. Monaghan supported by my Department through Enterprise Ireland have performed very well in recent years with the creation of 650 jobs in the period from 2011 to 2014. For each job created in an Enterprise Ireland-supported company, an additional job is created elsewhere in the economy through supply companies and support services. </p>  <p>  Representatives of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland met with Monaghan County Council delegation on 23 September and had an in-depth discussion regarding the BOSE facility.  There will be follow up discussions in January 2016.  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland continue to work closely with the local authority in relation to this matter.</p>  <p>  I have committed to developing an Action Plan for Jobs (APJ) for every region. An Action Plan for Jobs for the border region is in preparation at present. The border APJ will seek to maximise the strengths and assets of the region to support enterprise growth and job creation and to build on the progress that has already been made.</p></reply>

The measures in this Scheme were designed to enhance animal welfare and husbandry standards as well as improve genetics through on-farm recording and evaluation of animal performance. Over 50% of Irish cattle are derived from the beef suckler herds, which combine the high yielding continental breeds with traditional breeds to adapt to Ireland&rsquo;s predominately grass-grazed production systems.</p>  <p>  This Scheme has since been superseded by the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP). The BDGP represents a &euro;52 million investment in suckler farming this year and over &euro;300 million over the next 6 years under Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Plan (RDP). The scheme aims to improve the genetic merit of Irish beef cattle, which will in turn lead to increased returns for beef producers and improve the environmental sustainability of the beef herd. The scheme also aims to reverse the decline in the maternal index seen in recent years in the Irish beef herd.   </p>  <p>It will also confirm Ireland&rsquo;s position as a global leader in the application of genomics technology and cement our reputation as one of the most important and renowned export-focused beef producing nations in the world.   </p>  <p>  The importance of this sector of the agrifood industry cannot be understated. As the Deputy is aware, Ireland exports 90% of the beef it produces and suckler farming is one of the most important indigenous industries. Food and drink exports are at the forefront of our economic recovery, and in 2014 beef to the value of &euro;2.27 billion was exported from the state, making this one of our most important indigenous export industries. </p></reply>

I understand that certain flexibilities are built into the scheme in an effort to accommodate children with special needs, such as an overage exemption, or waiver, for children with special needs who do not meet the age criteria and the option to avail of the free pre-school year over two years.  </p><p>The Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the free pre-school year.  However, the HSE does work at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such pre-school assistant supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.</p><p>The <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>children and young people's policy framework that has been developed by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs contains a commitment to develop a plan for the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school and early years settings.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has lead responsibility for the implementation of this commitment and has recently concluded an intensive process of deliberation and consultation on the matter in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Education and Skills.  Work is ongoing to develop an appropriate model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with special needs in the ECCE Programme.</p><p>Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the individual case he has highlighted.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

More comprehensive data on e-cigarette use in Ireland will be available shortly from the Healthy Ireland Survey.</p><p>E-cigarettes and other non-medicinal nicotine delivery systems are not regulated under tobacco control legislation because they do not contain tobacco.  They must however, comply with the European Communities (General Product Safety) Regulations which specify the duties of producers and distributors placing products on the market.</p><p>While e-cigarettes do not contain tobacco, they do contain nicotine, a highly addictive substance which is the driver for cigarette smoking. Hence, there are legitimate concerns about the public health benefits of allowing such products to exist without regulation. Because they are a relatively recent product, there is limited scientific information available to balance the potential harms and benefits that might arise from more widespread public use.</p><p>The EU Tobacco Products Directive (2014/40/EU), <i>inter alia,</i>provides for the regulation of certain aspects of e-cigarettes across EU Member States. My Department is working to transpose the Directive into national legislation by the May 2016 deadline.</p><p>The Directive will: </p><p>- set mandatory safety and quality requirements e.g. on nicotine content, ingredients and devices, as well as refill mechanisms etc., for e-cigarettes;</p><p>- make health warnings and information leaflets obligatory;</p><p>- introduce notification requirements for manufacturers and importers of e-cigarettes; and</p><p>- impose stricter rules on advertising and monitoring of market developments.  </p><p>In addition to the regulations under the Directive, e-cigarettes will be further regulated in Ireland through the introduction of a retail licensing system.  The legislation, approved by Government will also prohibit the sale of these products to, and by, persons under 18 years of age.</p><p>Currently the evidence base does not support prohibiting vaping in public places although individual organisations/companies are free to introduce an e-cigs free policy. My Department will continue to monitor evidence on the potential harms and benefits of these products, so as to inform decisions around any future additional regulation in this area.</p></reply>

Under these provisions, persons who are insured with (covered by) the healthcare service of one EU member state are entitled to receive healthcare in the public system of another member state in certain circumstances, at the cost of the member state in which they are insured.  Such persons may include:</p><p>- people who are employed in one member state and resident in another and their dependants,</p><p>- pensioners of one member state who reside in another and their dependants,</p><p>- visitors to one member state from another, and</p><p>- persons referred for treatment to another member state.</p><p>The EU Regulations provide for the costs to be reimbursed between member states. The Regulations also allow for two or more states to agree alternative arrangements for reimbursement other than those laid down in the Regulations, or to mutually waive reimbursement altogether.</p><p>Ireland's primary interaction has been and continues to be with the United Kingdom with whom it operates a bilateral healthcare reimbursement agreement, covering such persons as temporary visitors between the two countries, pensioners of one country and their dependants residing in the other country, and the dependant families of persons employed in the other country. Under the terms of the agreement net liability between the two countries is calculated on a lump sum basis rather than an individual basis.  The amount payable is the net difference between the costs to the Irish health services of providing care to those with only UK entitlements and the cost to the UK health services of providing services to those with only Irish entitlements.  The amount payable is agreed following compilation of the necessary data and discussions between the two administrations.  Payments are made in advance and are subject to final settlement once all necessary statistical and financial information is complete. Total payments in any one year can as a consequence relate to both final settlements in respect of previous years' liabilities and advance payments in respect of the current and/or previous years. The finalisation of accounts is normally some years in arrears to facilitate collation of relevant statistics and for the approval of the average cost prepared by each country for the year concerned at EU level.  The net payment received by Ireland from the United Kingdom in 2014 was &euro;172 m.  This amount represents the actual payment made in cash in 2014 and does not correspond to the full liability for that particular year.</p><p>As explained below, only a small portion of the above payments relates to UK visitors to Ireland and Irish visitors to the UK.  By far the largest part of the payment received from the UK authorities on an annual basis relates to the provision of healthcare to UK pensioners and their dependants residing in Ireland. Entirely separate arrangements apply to patient referrals for scheduled treatment in the other jurisdiction whereby the costs arising are reimbursed on an actual costs basis. These arrangements are administered by the Health Service Executive.</p><p>The amount payable in any one year attributable to temporary visitors between Ireland and the UK (i.e. EHIC type costs) is determined by the estimated number of visitor days and an estimate of the average cost of providing healthcare treatment.  The last accounts finalised were in respect of the year 2008 in respect of which Ireland&rsquo;s liability to the United Kingdom was calculated at Stg &pound;10,161,467 (&euro;12,269,340 approximately) for 22,945,700 visitor days (Ireland to UK) and the United Kingdom liability to Ireland was &euro;17,735,993 for 19,095,600 visitor days (UK to Ireland).  Accounts for subsequent years have not yet been finalised.

These proposals for the most part were unsuccessful. The formation this year of a more nationalist government in Israel, in which some of the proponents of those restrictive measures are now holding ministerial office, clearly raises concerns about the likelihood of further bills aimed against NGOs.  Ireland, like many other countries, supports NGOs active in defence of human rights and justice, in many countries around the world.  The occupied Palestinian territory is no different in this regard. </p>  <p>  I share the widespread international concerns in relation to these efforts and I urge the Israeli government to continue to respect the crucial role of civil society in a democratic system.  The willingness of very many Israelis in these organizations to defend justice and human rights resounds deeply to the credit of their country.  NGOs which act as whistleblowers on abuses of power, or work to uphold the legal rights existing in a country&rsquo;s own laws, are performing a valued function.</p></reply>

Post Leaving Certificate Centres provide further education courses up to Level 6 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ). However, my Department has facilitated the provision by the College of a course accredited by a third level institution at Level 8 on the NFQ for a number of years and continues to do so as an exceptional measure.</p>  <p>  Section 7 of the Student Support Act, 2011 outlines the position with regard to approved institutions for the purposes of student grants. The College is comprehended within Section 7(1)(d) of the Act as an education institution in the State in receipt of grants out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas for the provision of post-leaving certificate courses.</p>  <p>  I currently have no plans to designate further education centres as approved third level institutions for the purposes of the student grant scheme.</p></reply>

Principal duties in small to medium sized schools are carried out by teaching principals. Circular 25/02 which is available on the Department website outlines the number of days that teaching principals may take as release time in a school year in order to assist them fulfilling their principal duties. Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal. Under the current arrangements the number of days that principal teachers may take as release time in each school year ranges between 14 and 22 days depending on the size of the school. </p><p>  I am aware of the workload issue and the pressures on Principals teachers. My Department has done work at helping to ease the administrative burden on school principals. The development and introduction of the primary online database is a significant step forward in this regard. A further step forward was the recent publication of Department Circular 0033/2015 which updates and simplifies the manner in which primary schools can maintain pupil enrolment and attendance records following the introduction of the primary online database. </p><p>  Economic constraints and the moratorium on recruitment albeit alleviated to some extent for schools, have presented challenges within the education sector. They also provide an opportunity to review the role of the principal so that our principals are leaders of learning, and to reconfigure the middle management structure to support principals in their role, ensuring ownership of responsibility rather than tasks, thereby building expertise and supporting a career path within the profession. </p><p>The Department, in consultation with the representative management bodies has commenced an exploration of the opportunities to support and thereby advance our understanding of the needs of school leaders and how they might be addressed.</p><p>  The parity award the Deputy refers to arises from the 2nd report of the benchmarking body (issued in December 2007).  Under the Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009, it was agreed that the increases recommended in the second report of the Public Service Benchmarking Body would be paid in a fashion set out in that Agreement.  However, the pay terms contained in the Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009 were not implemented due to the State's worsening financial circumstances.  </p><p>  I have consulted with the Department of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the position is that having regard to this context there are no plans to implement the recommendations set out in the second report of the Public Service Benchmarking Body as they apply to any public servant.  </p><p>  However, paragraph 5.3 of the recent Lansdowne Road Agreement does outline that &quot;The Parties have agreed that any outstanding adjudication findings as referred to in paragraph 1.16 of the Public Service Agreement 2010 - 2014 (Croke Park Agreement) will be reviewed jointly by the Parties prior to the expiry of this Agreement.&quot;</p></reply>

The extract following is the material that was provided to the European Commission in respect  of question 209.   </p>  <p>  "Ireland is currently reconfiguring the way in which local and rural development interventions are implemented in sub-regional areas with a view to ensuring that local government is positioned to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of such interventions in the context of broader and more strategic considerations of the needs of the area concerned. In this context and coupled with the need to ensure sufficient budgetary resources to LAGs to facilitate full and effective implementation of local development strategies, and to ensure administrative efficiency Ireland is proposing to limit the number of LAGS to 28 to mirror Irish local government administrative areas. This will allow for more efficient and effective systems of oversight, coordination and support by both local government and the managing authority to ensure that the impact of all funding available to the sub-regional area is maximised. </p>  <p>  Most of the 28 areas outlined have total populations below 150,000. However, there are a small number of areas where the populations (excluding the cities) may breach the 150,000 limit. In order to maintain the integrity of the LAG selection process it will not be possible to be specific on which areas may result in an LDS population of over 150,000 as the populations in need of Rural Development/LEADER support will be determined through the LDS design process. While it is envisaged that no area will have populations above approximately 170,000, there is some potential for areas with populations above the 150,000 population limit outlined in the regulation and therefore Ireland is requesting a derogation from this upper population limit to take account of population levels in some rural areas, to ensure territorial coherence of the LAG area, and to support Irelands increased emphasis on more effective, coordinated systems of local and rural development at a sub-regional level."   </p></reply>

This model provides for a Performance Related Award (PRA) which is an element of &ldquo;pay at risk&rdquo;. While the award of PRA is subject to certain conditions, and is at the sole discretion of the company, a decision was made by the company in November 2014 that PRAs would not be paid in respect of 2013 and 2014. Irish Water has not paid a PRA to any of its employees in 2015.  The Labour Relations Commission issued a recent recommendation on the Irish Water pay model which is subject to ballot by the Group of Unions in early October 2015. In the event that the proposals are accepted, a temporary incremental pay model will apply to Irish Water until 31 December 2016.

This lead-in period is intended to allow site owners sufficient time and opportunity to obtain planning permission, initiate development or alternatively sell their sites in order to avoid becoming liable to the levy. The levy proceeds will be earmarked for regeneration and the provision of housing in the local areas concerned.</p><p>Supplementary to the vacant site levy, the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015amends Section 10(2) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, to provide that the current objective incorporated in local authority development plans for the &ldquo;development and renewal of areas in need of regeneration&rdquo; is broadened to provide that such objective should in future be for the explicit purposes of preventing &ndash;</p><p>-  adverse effects on existing amenities in such areas,</p><p>-  urban blight and decay,</p><p>-  anti-social behaviour, or </p><p>-  a shortage of habitable houses or land suitable for residential use or a mixture of residential or other uses.</p><p>This is intended to stimulate local authorities to adopt a more holistic approach in relation to urban decay and regeneration in the adoption of their local development plans.</p><p>In addition to the recently enacted vacant site levy, the Derelict Sites Act 1990 requires that local authorities take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become or continue to be a derelict site. Local authorities have substantial powers under the Act in relation to any such sites, including powers to require specified measures to be taken in relation to a derelict site, to impose a levy on derelict sites, or to compulsorily acquire any derelict site. Under the provisions of the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, the Derelict Site levy willnot be payable in respect of any land on which the vacant site levy is payable.</p><p>In 2014, in its Partnership Agreement with the European Commission, the Government agreed that an urban development fund would be established. The Designated Urban Centres Grants Scheme (subsequently launched in July 2015)  will enable investments in our main urban centres to the order of &euro;80 million for the period 2014-2020. This investment in sustainable urban development recognises our main cities as the engines of the regional economy, and specifically seeks to increase the number of integrated regeneration initiatives that willimprove the urban environment and revitalise Irish urban areas. </p><p>In tandem with this urban focus, the Government has this week reaffirmed its commitment to rural Ireland with the announcement of a new &euro;30m investment in rural towns and villages in the years ahead. The new scheme will support the revitalisation of our rural towns and villages, increase their attractiveness and sustainability, with the aim of improving the living and working environment in rural communities and enhancing their potential to support increased economic activity into the future. </p><p>The focus for improvements eligible under this scheme will extend to the enhancement of villages, small towns and the surrounding countryside. Actions will be particularly aimed at enhancing the environmental, amenity and surface structural aspects of these communities and is intended to support complementarity particularly with tourism and conservation of the local heritage measures supported under initiatives such as the LEADER Programme which will also see a further &euro;250m invested in rural Ireland. </p><p>The types of p<b>rojects </b>qualifying for funding support under the towns and villages scheme will include initiatives such as:</p><p>-greenways, cycleways, blueways and other environmental initiatives that support economic activity in the area;</p><p>-upgrading of parks, civic areas, river walks etc;</p><p>-remedial works, general surface upgrading and renovation of relevant derelict buildings;</p><p>-access facilities to amenities; and</p><p>-property acquisition for site assembly/rationalisation and subsequent redevelopment.</p><p>I am confident that this expanded package of measures &ndash; some of which have only been recently announced &ndash; which are now available to local authorities and communities will assist in providing a much-needed impetus towards revitalising our main urban centres as well as our rural towns and villages in the coming years, so that they are better positioned to take advantage of the upturn in our economy. </p></reply>

The design teams have at all times been trying to avail of publicly owned land to create a product that is segregated, safe and scenic. It was possible in Roscommon to avail of Coillte and Bord na Mona lands. However, even with that, 40% is through privately owned lands.  The design team in Galway have been working to exactly the same objectives and directions as the team in Roscommon. The facts are that there are no publicly owned lands within the corridor that connects the towns and villages of Ballinasloe, Aughrim, Kilreekil, Loughrea, Craughwell, Clarinbridge and Oranmore.</p>  <p>  It must be remembered that a greenway is not simply a method of getting from A to B, for example, putting the route alongside the old N6 route would not be appealing to tourists looking to sample the delights of rural Ireland. They are not coming here with their bicycles or hiring bicycles to cycle alongside a road - the route needs to be attractive in its own right. It must also link in with towns or villages every 20 kilometres. The benefits of greenways to rural towns can be seen most effectively in Newport, County Mayo, which has been regenerated through the huge numbers using the Great Western Greenway with caf&eacute;s and a hotel opening to meet demand.</p></reply>

The issues arising with Shared Ownership Schemes require careful consideration and expert financial data analysis.  Arising from the findings of the review to date, the Index Linked Shared Ownership Scheme   which operated from 1999 until 2002 has been revised with regard to the annual indexation of the rental equity balance and rental payments.  The amendments, which take effect from the 1 July 2015, will reduce the monthly cost for these borrowers and avoid existing rental equity balances increasing for the remaining term. My Department has issued directions to local authorities outlining the measures and I understand that these changes are being applied to individual loan accounts. </p>  <p>  The more recent Shared Ownership Scheme that operated from 2003 to 2011 provides a formalised mechanism for the borrower to pay off the rental equity portion of the arrangement over the course of the term of the loan agreement. Integral to this mechanism is the provision for the compounding of the rental charge by 4.5% per annum. Reducing this annual compounding would have the effect of reducing the borrower&rsquo;s contribution to paying off the rental equity balance, thus extending the term of the loan agreement and delaying the transition to full ownership. </p>  <p>  My Department, together with the other agencies, is continuing to examine the operation of Shared Ownership loans and issues arising for some borrowers, with a view to developing further measures that may assist with the affordability of these arrangements.   </p></reply>

This preliminary research project together with a public consultation in 2013 contributed to shaping the terms of reference for the comprehensive joint research programme currently on-going.</p>  <p>  I can once again confirm that no decision will be made on any proposal for the use of hydraulic fracturing, as part of any unconventional gas exploration and extraction programme, until there has been time to consider the outcome of this EPA research. </p></reply>

The design teams have at all times been trying to avail of publicly owned land to create a product that is segregated, safe and scenic. It was possible in Roscommon to avail of Coillte and Bord na Mona lands. However, even with that, 40% is through privately owned lands.  The design team in Galway have been working to exactly the same objectives and directions as the team in Roscommon. The facts are that there are no publicly owned lands within the corridor that connects the towns and villages of Ballinasloe, Aughrim, Kilreekil, Loughrea, Craughwell, Clarinbridge and Oranmore.</p>  <p>  It must be remembered that a greenway is not simply a method of getting from A to B, for example, putting the route alongside the old N6 route would not be appealing to tourists looking to sample the delights of rural Ireland. They are not coming here with their bicycles or hiring bicycles to cycle alongside a road - the route needs to be attractive in its own right. It must also link in with towns or villages every 20 kilometres. The benefits of greenways to rural towns can be seen most effectively in Newport, County Mayo, which has been regenerated through the huge numbers using the Great Western Greenway with caf&eacute;s and a hotel opening to meet demand.</p></reply>

As a result, a review of the current legislation was initiated to ensure that it remains both effective and balanced.</p><p>Stakeholders had been seeking an opportunity to input their views on the operation of section 40 of the Acts and I announced, last year, a consultation process which provided that opportunity.

The Action Plan sets out a number of actions in relation to the heritage and arts sectors. </p><p>The nature of employment within these sectors encompasses a wide range of activities, from theatre and music to archaeology and tourism, as well as the creative sectors, including audiovisual production. </p><p>For example, it is estimated that the audiovisual sector provides 6,000 full-time job equivalents.  Last year, 53 feature films were made here.  Many of those employed in the industry are graduates.  Some 65% of investment in the sector is inward investment.  My Department is working with other Government Departments and agencies to examine ways in which further support can be provided to the industry. </p><p>Many people in the creative sectors will benefit from the additional funding which my Department is providing for the Decade of Commemorations, in particular the investment in the <i>Ireland 2016 </i>programme. This comprises &euro;4m current and &euro;22m capital funding in 2015. There is also a &euro;2 million allocation directed through the Arts Council for artistic projects. Considerable employment benefits arising from the capital projects under way or being planned.  For example, some 200 jobs have been created in the construction stage of the new interpretative centre in the GPO.  In addition, some 300 high-level jobs have been created in the construction work on the National Gallery of Ireland as part of a joint project funded by my Department, the OPW and the National Gallery. </p><p>The built heritage jobs leverage scheme was a funded by a special &euro;5 million stimulus package in 2014.  It was very successful and leveraged a further &euro;10 million in private funding and many projects benefited from it.  Funding for the protection of heritage sites and buildings will continue to be provided by my Department in 2015 via a number of schemes, which will be either directly administered or delivered through local authorities or through the Heritage Council.</p><p>I am aware of the potential of the creative sector to contribute to sustainable jobs growth and my Department continues to work with other Departments as part of the Government&rsquo;s overall objectives under the Action Plan for Jobs. </p><p>The Government's policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, to increase access to and participation in the arts and to make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life.  The Government also appreciates the importance of the cultural and creative industries to Ireland and our economy and provides significant support for the arts and film through its funding of the Arts Council and the Film Board, while my Department provides capital supports for the development of arts and cultural infrastructure. </p><p>Other financial and policy supports are also provided, for example, through the taxation system.  I was particularly pleased that the Government introduced a 25% increase, from &euro;40,000 to &euro;50,000, in the income ceiling for the artists' tax exemption for 2015. This important measure recognises the invaluable contribution which artists make to society. </p><p>My Department - through Culture Ireland &ndash; plays a major part in promoting Irish arts and music on the world stage.  The Arts Council operates the RAISE programme, which seeks to enhance fund-raising skills in arts organisations with a view to reducing the sector&rsquo;s dependency on funding from the taxpayer and moving it more towards the business sector. My has Department also operated small capital grants schemes, which require to be co-funded from private or philanthropic sources. These initiatives assist the sector in securing philanthropic contributions to the arts in Ireland.</p><p>Finally, issues in relation to the arts, film and music are will be of particular relevance in the development of Ireland's first national cultural policy, <i>Culture 2025</i>.  My Department has commenced the engagement in a nationwide consultation process on the development of the policy and I look forward to working further with the all interested parties as part of that process.</p></reply>

Nonetheless, the competing priorities regarding the preservation and enhancement of the national heritage are kept under on-going review having regard to the resources available to my Department.</p><p>In 2015, under the Structures at Risk Fund, an allocation of &euro;624,000 was available,<i></i>to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000, as amended, which are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This fund which is administered through the local authorities encourages the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and helps to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  The fund was open to two applications per local authority of which one application may be in respect of a privately-owned building.  The amount of funding available per project was subject to a minimum level of &euro;15,000 and a maximum level of &euro;60,000.  Since 2011, in excess of 130 structures have been safeguarded for the future as a result of the Structures at Risk Fund.</p><p>In 2014 my Department was provided with a once-off allocation of &euro;5m Capital Stimulus funding for a new Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme to assist with works to safeguard structures, in private and civic ownership, protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  A total of &euro;15 million was invested in 540 historic structures across the country and information provided by the local authorities show that 175 jobs were created as a result of this scheme.

Kerry.  The Government considers the audio-visual industry to be very important and, in addition to the excellent work of the Irish Film Board, continues to support the growth of the sector in other ways.  In particular, section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 - the Film Tax Relief Scheme - has undergone a number of improvements, which took effect at the start of this year.  The changes have been well received.  The intention is to ensure that Ireland remains competitive in attracting film projects.  The Film Tax Relief Scheme has been extended to the end of 2020 and I am confident that this will increase the attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for film investment and allow the audio-visual production sector to maintain existing jobs and create new ones.</p><p>In terms of studio infrastructure, I am aware of a number of proposals by the sector to increase the facilities available here.  In addition, an Interdepartmental Group on the Audio-visual Sector has been established to examine and report on recommendations to increase foreign and domestic investment in Ireland&rsquo;s film and TV sound stage studio infrastructure in the face of growing demand for audio-visual content across multiple platforms.  The Group reports to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Jobs.

In terms of keeping objects of importance within the State, generous tax relief is provided under section 1003 of the Taxes Consolidated Act 1997 for donations to approved bodies of heritage items that are considered outstanding examples of their type, whose export from the State would constitute a diminution of the accumulated cultural heritage of Ireland.  Under this Scheme, 80% of the market value of the item(s) donated is offset against the current tax liability of the donor.  This scheme has allowed the retention of a significant number of artworks within the State which otherwise might have been exported. </p>  <p>  In terms of other controls, sections 49 and 50 of the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 deal with the licensing for export of articles such as documents, paintings and archaeological objects.  The issuing of licences for art works is a function of the National Gallery in accordance with powers delegated by me, as Minister, under the Act.  These provisions do not prevent the export of such objects.  The view has been taken, when these issues have been considered in the past, that the Constitutional protection afforded to property limits the action which can be taken to prevent the export of private property.  However, my Department is continuing to examine wider issues in relation to export licences for the longer-term.</p></reply>

One of the core objectives of the programme is to encourage and facilitate participation by, and the inclusion of, the citizens of Ireland to the greatest extent possible in the programme of events to commemorate this significant centenary.  Officials in the 2016 Project Office in my Department have undertaken an extensive consultation process across the Government, State agency and community and voluntary sectors to progress the development of detailed plans for 2016 and the response has been very positive.  In particular, the Deputy may wish to note that the 'Community Participation' strand of the programme is being led by local authorities across the country.  Each local authority has appointed a steering committee and a dedicated co-ordinator to drive plans to commemorate the centenary of the 1916 Rising at county level in line with the national plans for 'Ireland 2016'.  Local authorities have led an extensive programme of local consultation with interested groups and community organisations, historical societies, schools and youth organisations, relatives of those who took part in the events of 1916, and other interested parties to facilitate and assist in the development of initiatives for 2016.  Sporting bodies and other community and voluntary organisations such as the GAA, Credit Unions and Tidy Town Committees will also play a key role. </p><p>I very much appreciate the enthusiasm with which local authorities and local communities have engaged with this process.  To date, over 83 public consultations, facilitated by the local authorities, have taken place nationwide.  Arising from this, 31 individual local authority plans will be launched in October.  I have allocated &euro;1 million in 2015 in current funding to support this process.</p><p>Meetings have also taken place with other key Departments, agencies and interested parties and my Department's <i>Ireland 2016</i>Project Office is engaging with bodies such as the National Cultural Institutions, the Arts Council and the Heritage Council to ensure that a comprehensive and diverse programme for 2016 is developed.  My Department is also engaging actively with representatives of the various relatives groups, as well as with individual relatives, to hear their views on the overall programme and to ensure that they will have a central role in a number of the key State events.</p><p>Further information in relation to the various events, activities and initiatives taking place in each county will be detailed in the upcoming county plans and will be available online at my Department&rsquo;s dedicated website<i></i><i>.</i></p></reply>

As well as being of vital intrinsic importance and a great source of national pride, our cultural heritage is also a major source of employment and economic activity and is key to promoting Ireland's image abroad and attracting inward investment.  A society that values the arts is a more successful and prosperous one.  I am committed to enabling support for, and access to, the arts, culture and Ireland's rich heritage for Irish people and visitors alike.  A core objective for me, therefore, is to sustain and support these sectors, while seeking to promote and maximise their societal and economic potential.  Our rich heritage, unique habitats, diverse artistic and cultural sectors and, of course, our national cultural institutions all have a key role to play in this regard. </p><p>The Programme for Government, along with my Department's Statement of Strategy, has the overall goal of promoting and developing Ireland's world-class artistic and creative strengths at home and abroad, while maximising their societal, economic and reputational value for the country.  Developing a national cultural policy is central to these aims. </p><p>My Department is currently working on <i>Culture 2025,</i>the first ever such policy in Ireland. <i>Culture 2025</i>will set out the Government's high-level aims and policies in the area of culture for the period up to 2025 and my Department has commenced the engagement in a nationwide consultation process on the development of the policy.  I look forward to working further with the all interested parties as part of that process.</p></reply>

The amount of funding available per project was subject to a minimum level of &euro;15,000 and a maximum level of &euro;60,000.  This Fund is being administered by the local authorities and was open to two applications per local authority, of which one application may be in respect of a privately-owned building.  Since 2011, in excess of 130 structures have been safeguarded for the future as a result of the Structures at Risk Fund.  A review of the operation of the Structures at Risk Fund was carried out in 2013 prior to its reintroduction in 2015.</p><p>With regard to the operation of the Structures at Risk Fund, it is primarily a matter for the local authority to nominate its two applications to my Department.  It is also a matter for each local authority to prioritise applications for consideration under the fund.  Louth County Council submitted two applications, neither of which was for the building referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question.  Given competing priorities and the level of applications received in 2015, my Department allocated funding to those projects that were deemed in most need and that complied with the relevant criteria as requested in the call for submissions.  Details of structures awarded funding are available on my Department&rsquo;s website <i></i></p><p>Since 2011, my Department has provided the following funding under the Structures at Risk Fund as set
