    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-14a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1334" speakername="Michael Ring" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018061400050#WRA00600"><p>The CL&Aacute;R programme is an important part of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Rural Development and makes a huge contribution to supporting the most depopulated areas in rural Ireland.  The programme provides funding for small scale infrastructural projects in disadvantaged rural areas that have experienced significant levels of de-population.    </p>  <p>  CL&Aacute;R was originally launched in October 2001 to provide for targeted investment in disadvantaged rural areas. The areas originally selected for inclusion in the programme were those which suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 1996.  The Cooley Peninsula which was also included on the basis of the serious difficulties caused in that area by Foot and Mouth disease. The average population loss in the original CL&Aacute;R regions over the period 1926 to 1996 was 50%.</p>  <p>  In 2006, an analysis of the 2002 Census data was carried out by the NIRSA Institute at Maynooth University and the programme was extended to include areas with an average population loss of 35% between 1926 and 2002. </p>  <p>  Almost 900 projects have been approved for funding since I re-launched the CL&Aacute;R programme in the second half of 2016, using the areas identified in the work carried out by NIRSA. </p>  <p>  I intend carrying out a full review of qualifying CL&Aacute;R areas later this year on the basis of the 2016 Census data. The level of depopulation will continue to be a primary factor in the designation of any area as a CL&Aacute;R area.  The review will involve a detailed examination of all areas of the country, as well as stakeholder consultation. </p>  <p>  My officials plan to begin the review process in the coming months with the aim of having a full and comprehensive review completed before the end of the year. The findings of the review will inform future launches of the CL&Aacute;R programme into 2019 and beyond.</p></reply>

Following a review, I launched a new scheme which took effect on 1 November 2017.  A media and information campaign was organised to support the launch.  </p><p>The key features of the new scheme include: </p><p>- free monitoring of the alarm service for the 1st year;  </p><p>- a person no longer has to be living alone to qualify;</p><p>- a self-declaration of limited means for eligibility; and </p><p>- an increase in administrative payments to Community Groups involved in rolling out the scheme. </p><p>I am pleased to say that since the launch of the new scheme, the demand has been unprecedented. During 2017, spend on the Scheme amounted to &euro;2.7m, with over 12,700 applications approved and more than 10,000 installations completed. To the end of May 2018, over 9,200 applications were approved, with almost 10,000 installations completed. </p><p>Since the Seniors Alert Scheme commenced in September 2015, 1,648 participants have been approved for the Scheme in County Limerick.</p><p>My officials are carefully monitoring the scheme to ensure that current levels of demand can continue to be met from within the resources available to my Department.</p></reply>

The scheme is currently funded by my Department and administered through the Local Authorities.</p><p>In 2017, I allocated a total of &euro;440,460 to Carlow County Council under LIS.

I allocated a further &euro;7.4 million to the scheme from savings elsewhere in my Department's Vote at the end of November 2017. The total amount allocated to the scheme in 2017 was &euro;17.4 million, which included an allocation of &euro;250,000 for County Louth.</p>  <p>  Following on from the successful re-launch of the scheme in 2017, I announced details of the 2018 Local Improvement Scheme on 27th February last. I have allocated an initial amount of &euro;10.8 million to County Councils across the country this year under the scheme. The 2018 funding includes an allocation to Louth County Council of &euro;250,000.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for each County Council to decide which roads to prioritise for works from the funding allocated to them under LIS, and to ensure that all roads meet with the scheme criteria.  A local contribution is also made towards the cost of the improvement works.</p>  <p>  Detailed information regarding the 2018 roads selected by the Louth County Council for improvement works can be found on the Rural Development pages of my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  As part of the 2018 LIS scheme, I also requested each County Council to compile a secondary list of suitable LIS road projects which they could complete if additional funding becomes available for the scheme later in the year.  I will be monitoring the situation in the context of my Department's overall expenditure performance over the coming months.</p></reply>

A total of 16 replies from a range of stakeholders was received.</p>  <p>  Additionally, there has been substantial engagement and a number of meetings held with Irish Rural Link and the Savings Bank Foundation for International Cooperation - the international development wing of the Sparkassen group - on their proposal for a local public banking model in Ireland, based on the Sparkassen system.</p>  <p>  The project team carefully analysed this proposal, as well as assessing all the submissions received during the consultation process, in order to make sure that all the ideas and opinions were considered and reflected in the report.  </p>  <p>  The report has now been completed and Minister Donohoe and I submitted it to Government for consideration in the last few weeks.  I expect the report to be published very shortly and that there will be further engagement with key stakeholders at that stage.</p></reply>

The scheme provides funding for the development of new outdoor recreational infrastructure and for the maintenance and promotion of existing outdoor recreational infrastructure in rural Ireland. In the last two years, the scheme has funded trails, walkways, cycleways, blueways, and projects that improve access to recreational amenities across the country.</p><p>Under the 2018 scheme, applications will be accepted under three measures:</p><p>- Measure 1, will cater for small projects with a value of up to &euro;20,000.</p><p>- Measure 2, will support medium sized projects, ranging in value from &euro;20,000 to &euro;200,000.</p><p>- Measure 3 is aimed at large projects ranging from &euro;200,000 to &euro;500,000.</p><p>I have made an indicative allocation of &euro;12 million to the Scheme for 2018, across the three measures.</p><p>Local Development Companies, Local Authorities and State Agencies are all eligible applicants under the scheme. For the most part, I expect that projects under Measure 1 will be completed by the end of this year. Larger scale projects under Measures 2 and 3 are expected to be completed before the end of October 2019.  </p><p>Further details of the scheme are available on my Department's website.</p></reply>

Men's Sheds are now present in every single county on the island, with at least three sheds in every county and some with many more.  I sincerely congratulate the Association on its important work to date.</p>  <p>  There is clearly a huge demand in communities around Ireland for somewhere where men can learn, create and communicate; where they can get informed on their physical and mental health; and where they can achieve things together in an enjoyable way. The phenomenal increase in Men&rsquo;s Sheds is testament to the positive impact that they are having in communities around Ireland.</p>  <p>  I provided funding of &euro;14,900 on a once off basis, to the central Men's Sheds organisation, to purchase IT equipment to ensure better communication with its network members.</p>  <p>  Under the RAPID (Revitalising Areas by Planning, Investment and Development) programme, my Department provided funding of &euro;38,400 to eight member bodies to upgrade facilities and expand their activities.</p>  <p>  Under my Department's Communities Facilities Scheme, I provided funding to 73 individual member bodies in 2017 to a value of &euro;93,320.  </p>  <p>  The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP), which commenced in most parts of the country on 1 January 2018, also provides support to individual member bodies around the country. 15 SICAP Programme Implementers have recorded activity to support 38 such bodies under the new programme to date. </p>  <p>  SICAP Programme Implementers have also given 112 support interventions in areas such as community planning, social inclusion and equality issues, capacity building. However, no grants have been recorded to date to the network under SICAP 2018-2022. </p>  <p>  Funding for such projects is also available under the LEADER 2014-2020 Programme.

This funding will be drawn down as projects start to incur expenditure and submit payment claims.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with the LAGs who operate the scheme at local level to assess the progress on projects to date, so as to confirm the actual projects that will mature for payment in 2018, the estimated value of these claims and the month the claim will be submitted.</p>  <p>  While the pace of approvals varies between Local Action Groups, I am confident that the progress being made by the LAGs, along with the administrative improvements which my Department introduced last year, will result in a continued increase in project approvals and payments under the LEADER programme over the coming months. </p>  <p>  I will, however, be carefully monitoring spending across all capital subheads within my Department, so as to maximise the positive impact of 2018 funding for rural and community development and will consider reallocations as required.</p></reply>

In 2018, I have approved funding of &euro;10.8 million for works on over 450 roads selected by relevant County Councils.</p><p>It is the responsibility of each relevant County Council to select the road projects that will receive LIS funding in line with the scheme criteria and the Memorandum governing the scheme. Eligible roads are non-public roads, often leading to houses and important community amenities such as graveyards, beaches, piers, mountains, etc., or other non-public roads that provide access to parcels of land, or provide access for harvesting purposes for two or more persons. There must be more than one landholder on an LIS road and the road must be open to the public.</p><p>Details regarding the LIS roads selected for funding by County Councils under the scheme for 2018 are available on my Department's website, <i>www.drcd.gov.ie</i>.</p></reply>

However, they provide vital links for people living in rural areas and need to be maintained to enable people living in rural Ireland to access their homes, farming land, or amenities.  </p><p>For many years, there was no dedicated funding for LIS, due to the constraints on the public finances.  However, in September 2017 I announced the provision of &euro;10 million to Local Authorities for a Local Improvement Scheme.  Based on demand and the capacity of Local Authorities to complete works before the end of 2017, I allocated an additional &euro;7.4 million to Local Authorities for LIS roads at the end of November.</p><p>I launched the 2018 LIS scheme last February last with an indicative allocation of &euro;10.8 million to the relevant Local Authorities. This funding will support repairs to more than 400 additional roads, bringing the total number of LIS roads which will have benefitted from the scheme since last September to over 1,100.</p><p>The table below outlines, on a county by county basis, the number of roads selected by Local Authorities for improvement works under the scheme in 2018, and the total grant by my Department towards the cost of these works. Detailed information regarding the roads to be completed in each Council area can be found on my Department's website at <i>www.drcd.gov.ie</i>.</p><p><b>LIS 2018: County Allocations:</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Total Funding Request </th><th>Number of Roads </th></tr><tr><td>Carlow </td><td>&euro;243,630.00</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>&euro;295,000.06</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Clare </td><td>&euro;482,000</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Cork </td><td>&euro;1,000,000.00</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>&euro;881,458.55</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td>&euro;942,001.00</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry </td><td>&euro;726,976.00</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>&euro;249,999.00</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny </td><td>&euro;315,000.00</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Laois </td><td>&euro;264,146.43</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>&euro;250,001.00</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick </td><td>&euro;411,388.20</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Longford </td><td>&euro;249,019.97</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>&euro;249,983.73</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>&euro;855,000.00</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>&euro;359,000.00</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>&euro;250,000.00</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly </td><td>&euro;290,765.00</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon </td><td>&euro;370,290.00</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>&euro;282,000.40</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary </td><td>&euro;624,865.50</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford </td><td>&euro;282,000.00</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>&euro;282,000.00</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford </td><td>&euro;354,519.00</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow </td><td>&euro;310,000.00</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL </td><td>&euro;10,821,043.84</td><td>490</td></tr></table></p></reply>

A key priority of the Israeli Ministry of Strategic Affairs and Public Diplomacy is to combat domestic or international criticism of, or pressure on, Israel, and in particular to combat support for boycott campaigns.  Material produced by the Ministry should be evaluated against that background.  The report makes allegations against a wide range of respected European and Palestinian NGOs. Most, if not all, of the activities which are detailed in the report amount to the expression of legitimate political views, or campaigns in favour of such views.  Both NGOs and citizens are entitled to hold and express peaceful political views, including views which are not shared by their Governments.  For example, Ireland does not support commercial, cultural or other boycotts against Israel, for reasons which have been explained many times in the D&aacute;il.  However, the Government has accepted and defended the right of individual citizens, and civil society organisations, to practice and advocate so long as there is no attempt to force others to do the same, and no advocacy of violence.   The report does not differentiate between Israel and the Palestinian Territory occupied by Israel, and uses terms which imply that the occupied territory is part of Israel, for example describing the West Bank as &ldquo;Israel&rsquo;s Judea and Samaria regions&rdquo;.  Ireland does not recognise the West Bank and Gaza as part of Israel, in line with numerous UN Security Council Resolutions.  Most recently, UN Security Council Resolution 2334 of 23 December 2016 recalls, inter alia, that any changes to the 1967 lines, other than those agreed by the parties through negotiations, cannot be recognised, and that Israel, as an occupying power, is obliged to abide by its legal obligations and responsibilities under the Fourth Geneva Convention.  Nor, in fact, has Israel officially claimed that these territories are part of Israel, so there are elements of this report which are not in line with stated Israeli policy.</p>  <p>  Finally, the report makes a linkage between donor support for any activity by the selected NGOs, and support for their advocacy activities related to Israel or Palestine.  I would be concerned that accepting such a linkage could have the effect of creating pressure on NGOs to avoid controversial issues, which would reduce the space for legitimate political debate, and potentially reduce scrutiny on human rights issues linked to the occupation of the Palestinian Territory. Israel must of course expect consistent scrutiny of its actions while it remains an occupying power. </p>  <p>  The views expressed in the report, including those detailed above, have been put to my Department from time to time by Israeli authorities, and my officials have responded on the lines I have outlined here.  They were put to me directly by Prime Minister Netanyahu in my first meeting with him in July of last year.  I have always made clear my support for freedom of speech, and the importance of a vibrant civil society, and that this includes supporting the right to advocate for non-violent political views, even ones with which we disagree.</p></reply>

An online passport application service was launched in March 2017 and offers the convenience of an online application system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for Irish citizens anywhere in the world, without the need for application forms, printed photos or witnesses.  At present, the online passport application service accommodates adult passport renewal applications and passport card applications.  It is planned to extend the online application facility to other categories of renewal by the end of 2018.People who cannot or do not wish to apply online have the option of applying through their local post office.  The vast majority of applications received by the Passport Service from applicants residing in the island of Ireland are submitted through Passport Express and Northern Ireland Passport Express.  Northern Ireland Passport Express allows applicants living in Northern Ireland to apply for their passport through more than 70 post offices. </p><p>Bearing in mind the availability of both the online and postal application channels, very few citizens living in the island of Ireland are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport. In the relatively small number of cases where citizens need to travel very urgently and do not have a valid passport, the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork offer an appointment service.</p><p>Given the variety of options available, I am satisfied that the current needs of passport applicants are being met without the need for the establishment of a further passport office.  </p><p>Advice and guidance on the above channels and other useful information on passports is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at<i>www.dfa.ie/passport.</i></p></reply>

The number of applications received from January to May this year is up by over 5% on the same period last year The Passport Service is currently processing over 80,000 passport applications. These applications are going through the normal checking, processing and security stages.  The Passport Service is meeting its target turnaround times for certain categories of applicants, and I acknowledge that there are delays in other categories.  For applicants that have used the Online Passport Application service, the target turnaround timeframe of 10 working days (plus postage) is being met and in 50% of cases, applications are being processed in 5 working days (plus postage).  The target timeframe of 15 working days for Passport Express renewals is also currently being met.  The Passport Service acknowledges that for certain categories such as first time applicants and applicants with lost or stolen passports, processing is taking longer due to additional security checks The Passport Service monitors the volume of applications received on an ongoing basis to ensure that resources are available to meet demand. In order to respond to anticipated application increases and to seasonal demands, the Passport Service received sanction for 220 Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) this year to be appointed to the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork  .  These TCOs are working together with permanent staff to process passport applications and to deal with the high number of enquiries being made through the Passport Service&rsquo;s various customer service channels. In addition to the intake of TCOs, staff from other Divisions in the Department have been reassigned to assist with enquiries, and targeted overtime is available.</p>  <p>  A central element of my Department&rsquo;s approach to managing increasing application volumes has been the implementation of service improvements in order to minimise the impact unusually high application volumes have on turnaround times.  The Passport Reform Programme is delivering major upgrades to the passport service technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements. The online passport application service, which was launched last year, will continue to make a major contribution to the effective management of exceptionally high volumes by allowing existing resources to be more effectively deployed within the Passport Service.  I would encourage all applicants wherever possible to renew their passports using the online renewal service, it is the quickest, easiest and most convenient way to renew your passport.</p></reply>

To date over 200,000 adults have renewed their passport using the online facility, with an average processing time of less than 10 working days.  At present, the online passport application service accommodates adult passport renewal applications and passport card applications.  My Department plans to roll out a similar service for the renewal of children&rsquo;s passports by the end of 2018.   The online passport application service has made a major contribution to the effective management of high application volumes.  As more applications are processed online, staff have been freed up and reallocated to other essential work in the Passport Service such as the identification of fraud and the protection of the integrity of the Irish passport.</p></reply>

The same application form is applicable irrespective of whether the applicant is a renewal or a first time applicant. The notes accompanying the application form have recently been updated to include information on the Online Passport Application service which is available for adults renewing their passport.  This Online Passport Application service was launched in March 2017 and since then over 200,000 Irish citizens have applied for their passport using this service.  It is the cheapest and most convenient way for an adult to renew a passport as it can be done online anywhere in the world, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week and removes the requirement for forms, witnesses or printed photos.</p>  <p>  The Online Passport Application service is part of a wider Passport Reform Programme (2016 &ndash; 2021) which aims to roll out further online application services for other adult renewal categories and for children by the end of 2018. In 2015, as part of the launch of the Passport Reform Programme, a customer engagement survey was undertaken, the results of which indicated a very high level of interest in an online passport application service. </p>  <p>  The continued uptake of the Online Passport Application service, along with the roll-out of online application options for further categories of applicants, has benefits for all categories of applicants.  As more applications are processed online, resources within the Passport Office can be reallocated towards categories of applicants who experience longer processing times due to additional security checks being required, such as first time applicants or those with previously lost or stolen passports.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is committed to providing the highest level of service to customers and is satisfied that the Passport Service can best meet their needs by</p>  <p>continuing to deliver major   upgrades to the passport service technology platforms and business processes as well as making significant customer service improvements.</p></reply>

Those N1s with 4 seats or more and which have the passenger and cargo compartments completely separate will remain as Category B vehicles.  This will ensure that genuine commercial vehicles continue to benefit from the lower rate of 13.3% VRT.  </p>  <p>  The EU N1 category incorporates certain vehicles that by design facilitate use for non-commercial purposes (specifically those with 4 or more seats) and that were, over time, increasingly being bought and used for purposes that were clearly not commercial.  The tax advantages attached to these vehicles spurred sales volumes, creating distortions to the market and resulting in loss of revenues to the State. I am satisfied that the change in the legislation addresses this issue by providing for definitions of VRT categories A and B that accord with the design and functionality of both non-commercial and commercial vehicles.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that there are no VAT implications in relation to the VRT changes from 31 July 2018 and the normal VAT rules will continue to apply to the purchase of N1 vehicles.</p>  <p>  The VAT Consolidation Act, 2010 provides that an accountable person is entitled, subject to the normal deductibility rules, to deduct the VAT incurred in respect of the purchase of certain business vehicles. Vehicles, such as vans, lorries, pick-ups and crew-cabs are often referred to as commercial vehicles for VAT purposes; they are used exclusively for business purposes which entitles the business to claim a full refund of the VAT incurred on the purchase. Vehicles, such as cars, are mainly used for private purposes and there is no right to deductibility. However, where a car is being used for at least 60% business purposes VAT legislation provides for a VAT refund of the VAT incurred on the purchase (to a maximum of 20%), if the car is registered for VRT purposes on or after 1 January 2009 and has a level of CO2 emissions of less than 156g/km.</p></reply>

In Germany, local public banks are called Sparkassen. The way the local public banking system is structured means that Sparkassen may only operate in specific geographic regions. This means that the lending activities of Sparkassen are confined to a particular local area. The aim and philosophy of Sparkassen is promoting and encouraging regional economic development and financial inclusion rather than solely profit maximisation.  An important part of the business model of Sparkassen is working closely and building relationships with local small and medium sized enterprises to support the local regional economy. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, officials in both departments have been working closely together to conduct a thorough investigation of local public banks in Ireland, based on the German Sparkassen model. This investigation included a consultation process with stakeholders and interested parties. Additionally, there has been substantial engagement with Irish Rural Link and the Savings Bank Foundation for International Cooperation (SBFIC), the international development wing of the Sparkassen Group. As a result, the report contains an analysis of a proposal from these bodies for a possible model of local public banking in Ireland, which is based on the Sparkassen model. </p>  <p>  Following considerable analysis by officials, my colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Michael Ring T.D., and I have taken time to carefully consider the completed report on local public banking. I am satisfied that a thorough analysis was undertaken by officials. Minister Ring and I circulated the report to all Government departments before jointly submitting it to Government at a Cabinet meeting in May. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the report has now been approved by Government and I anticipate that it will be ready for publication in the near future.</p></reply>

Under section 59(3) of the 2012 Act consultation is required with the Central Bank and CUAC.</p><p>A review of the Stabilisation Levy was carried out in October 2017 and was published on my Department's website. On foot of this review the levy has been lowered to a rate of 0.017% while still meeting the original target of &euro;30 million over a ten year period due to growth in assets for the sector. I have committed to a review of the levy again in three years before the introduction of the 2021 levy.</p><p>3. The Credit Union Fund</p><p>The Credit Union Fund was established under section 57 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 (2012 Act) for a number of purposes including the provision of stabilisation support, but primarily to provide a source of financial support for the restructuring of credit unions under the Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo) and to meet the expenses of ReBo in discharging its functions. The Government provided &euro;250 million? to the Credit Union Fund specifically for restructuring under ReBo. The Restructuring Levy (ReBo Levy) is provided for under section 47 of the 2012 Act and commenced in 2014. The ReBo levy for 2015 and 2016 collected &euro;1.43 million and &euro;6.58 million respectively. The total ReBo levy collected for the year ending 31 December 2017 was &euro;1.63 million. Approximately &euro;22.6 million has been drawn from the Credit Union Fund for restructuring purposes. ReBo concluded its restructuring work on 31 March 2017 and, as such, no further levies will be imposed after 2017. </p><p>4. Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS)</p><p>EU Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive (2014/49/EU) protects depositors in the event of a bank, building society or credit union authorised by the Central Bank being unable to repay deposits. The DGS is administered by the Central Bank and is funded by the institutions covered by the scheme. The DGS protects:</p><p>- depositors if a bank, building society and/or credit union authorised by the Central Bank is unable to repay deposits;</p><p>- eligible deposits up to &euro;100,000 per person per institution;</p><p>- current accounts, deposit accounts, share accounts in banks, building societies and credit unions. </p><p>Following the introduction of the European Union (Deposit Guarantee Schemes) Regulations 2015 (S.I. No. 516 of 2015), new funding arrangements, requiring the DGS to reach a target fund level of 0.8% of covered deposits by 2024 were introduced resulting in the establishment of the DGS Contributory Fund in 2016. A risk-based methodology, in line with European Banking Authority (EBA) guidelines, is employed to calculate annual contributions for each institution based on their degree of risk and level of covered deposits. The DGS fund currently stands at &euro;157.3 million - the total contribution to the fund by credit unions to date is &euro;25.7 million. The total drawdowns on the fund in each of the last five years are as follows:</p><p>2017:&euro;39.8 million (Charleville Credit Union Limited)* - returns from liquidation not yet received but will be repaid to the DGS Contributory Fund.</p><p>2016:&euro;22.8 million (Rush Credit Union Limited)* of which &euro;15 million returns from liquidation to date has been repaid to the credit institutions in proportion to the amount which they contributed to the payout.</p><p>2015:nil</p><p>2014:&euro;11.0 million (Berehaven Credit Union Limited)* of which &euro;8.6 million returns from liquidation has been repaid to the credit institutions in proportion to the amount which they contributed to the payout.</p><p>2013:nil</p><p>* Includes small value payments issued in subsequent years in relation to these payout events.</p></reply>

Where the accommodation is provided as part of a trade carried on by the taxpayer, the income is taxable under Case I of Schedule D of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.However, where the provision of guest accommodation is occasional in nature, the income arising should be treated as miscellaneous income (taxable under Case IV of Schedule D). Under self-assessment rules, a person is obliged to submit an annual tax return showing his/her taxable income from all sources (including rental income) and pay the tax due on that taxable income.  </p><p>PAYE taxpayers who have also received profit income from the provision of rooms through online accommodation sites also come under the self-assessment system and, therefore, have an obligation to make an annual tax return showing all sources of income and to pay the tax due on that income. However, in certain circumstances, PAYE taxpayers (excluding certain company directors) whose combined taxable profit from their non-PAYE income is less than &euro;5,000 (or where the gross income is less than &euro;30,000) per annum may elect to pay the tax due on such taxable profit through the PAYE system by reducing their personal tax credits.  Where the tax due on all such income has been collected through the PAYE system for a tax year there is no obligation to complete a tax return for that tax year unless specifically requested to do so by Revenue.</p><p>Where taxpayers have already filed their 2016 tax return but have not declared profit income from sources referred to by the Deputy, or similar sources, they may self-correct their tax return without incurring penalties, provided it is completed by 31 October 2018 and they have not been notified by Revenue of a compliance intervention.  It should be noted that interest on any outstanding tax amount will still be payable and will continue to accumulate until the outstanding amount is paid. For taxpayers who have not yet filed a tax return or have not declared relevant income, they should write to their local Revenue office, setting out details of any income received and related expenses for all relevant years.</p><p>Regarding rent-a-room relief, this is provided for in Section 216A of the TCA 1997. Under the legislation, sums arising to an individual in respect of the letting of a room or rooms as residential accommodation in his or her home and from meals or other services supplied in connection with the letting are exempt from income tax, USC and PRSI where these sums are below the annual limit for the tax year in question (&euro;12,000 for 2015 and 2016 and &euro;14,000 for 2017 and subsequent years) and certain other conditions are satisfied.</p><p>The purpose of the relief is to increase the supply of affordable rental residential accommodation by incentivising homeowners to rent out a room or rooms in their principal private residence to individuals. It applies where an individual is effectively using the room either on its own or in conjunction with other parts of the residence, as his or her home. The relief is not, and never was, intended to apply to income arising from the provision of guest accommodation to occasional visitors and Revenue has consistently clarified this point and I am aware that the clarification has also been subject to significant coverage.</p><p>Revenue has recently published comprehensive guidance across all taxes, including Income Tax and VAT, on the tax treatment of income from the provision of short-term accommodation, which the Deputy may find helpful. The information is available on Revenue&rsquo;s website at the following .</p></reply>

This included, in particular, a model for a potential &lsquo;affordable rental&rsquo; scheme to provide long-term affordable residential accommodation for low to moderate income key-worker households in urban areas of high demand. </p>  <p>  In response to this outcome, it was decided to convert the commitment from a single lump sum payment into a commitment to provide &euro;10m per annum, indexed for inflation, over a longer period (20 years), which could be used to secure the development of a pilot affordable rental scheme as envisaged in Rebuilding Ireland. Provision was made for this &euro;10 million in annual funding to be allocated to the Vote of the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government in 2017.  </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government that, after further consideration and as set out in the Strategy for the Rental Sector, the commitment to develop an affordable rental model is now being progressed through kick-starting supply in rent pressure zones. Lands held by local authorities in such zones are being progressed with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units to rent, as part of mixed-tenure developments.  This is intended to allow the rental units to be made available at cost without the need for on-going rental subsidies. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the provision of &euro;10 million earmarked for the affordable rental scheme has now been redirected to support additional activity under other housing programmes.  Detail of the specific measures can be provided by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p></reply>

This is mainly done through the Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme, which has a specific module on the use and misuse of a range of substances. SPHE is currently mandatory in all primary schools and in junior cycle. It also forms part of the mandatory 'Well-being' area of learning for the new junior cycle which was introduced in September 2017. Schools are also encouraged to deliver the SPHE programme in senior cycle.</p>  <p>  Relevant topics in SPHE include student decision-making skills and safety and protection. Students learn how to exercise judgement, weigh up different possibilities, examine the steps and choices that guide them towards considered decision-making, begin to understand their own rights and the rights of others, and explore decision-making. In respect of safety, students&rsquo; ability to assess the consequences of risky behaviour is developed.</p>  <p>  Current best practice guidelines for the delivery of SPHE indicate that the classroom teacher is the best placed professional to work sensitively and consistently with students and that individual themes such as Substance Misuse Prevention should not be treated in isolation but should be integrated with the other SPHE modules.</p></reply>

Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children.  </p><p>No school, has lost supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. In addition, no school received an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year.  </p><p>An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided in the 2017/2018 school year to support the introduction of this new allocation model. The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  </p><p>The additional funding provided additional supports to over 1300 schools who identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model while ensuring that no school received a reduced allocation.</p><p>The provision of a profiled allocation is designed to give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school. </p><p>It is acknowledged and accepted that schools will have some additional pupils with special educational needs enrolling to their school subsequent to the profiles having been developed. </p><p>However, for the most part these will be balanced by the fact that some students who had additional teaching needs in the previous year will have left the school. The baseline is also designed to ensure that schools have some capacity to provide additional support to pupils. </p><p>Under the new allocation model, schools are provided with a total allocation which includes a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school&rsquo;s profile. </p><p>Schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay. Schools therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis, as schools now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.</p><p>Where a school profile significantly changes following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increase year on year additional allocations may be made.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts for the 2017/18 school year was set out in DES Circular 17/2017 (Primary School Staffing Schedule) and DES 10,11,12/2017 (Post Primary School Staffing Schedule).</p><p>Schools who qualified for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualified for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>It is also acknowledged that there will be some schools where exceptional circumstances may arise.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will also be available to support schools where schools have developed and implemented appropriate plans for the deployment of their special education needs teaching resources, but the school considers that further support may be required. This support may involve Continuing Professional Development or further training for school staff, advice in relation to the support plans that are in place, and possibly a review process once schools can clearly demonstrate that exceptional circumstances have arisen in the school.</p><p>Details of this review process are available at the following .<i><i></i></i></p><p>The criteria set out that the exceptional or unforeseen circumstances must be demonstrated to be substantially beyond that which the school profile is intended to provide for, as set out in DES Circulars 0013 and 0014, to the extent that the school is clearly unable to meet the needs of the full cohort of students even when all existing resources have been fully and effectively managed and deployed.</p><p>The NCSE will review applications to establish whether the circumstances arising in the school are so exceptional that they are beyond that which could have been anticipated by the school profile and whether the schools requires additional support.</p><p>The NCSE has confirmed that they received an application from the school referred to by the Deputy, on 19th April, 2018. The NCSE are reviewing this application to establish whether it fulfils the criteria for an exceptional circumstances review and will be in contact with the school shortly to advise the outcome of this consideration.</p></reply>

Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal.</p>  <p>  Building on measures in previous budgets to enhance school leadership, Budget 2018 made &euro;0.4 million available to fund almost 4600 additional release days for teaching principals in primary schools. This additional funding will see an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018/19 school year to 17, 23 or 29 days depending on the size of the school.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 allowed for the commencement of restoration of middle management posts as part of an agreed distributed leadership model and meant lifting the rigidity of the longstanding moratorium on these posts at primary and post-primary levels. This recognises the key role school leadership has in promoting a school environment which is welcoming, inclusive and accountable.</p>  <p>  &euro;2.75m was allocated in Budget 2017 to restore middle management positions i.e. the equivalent of approximately 1,300 middle management posts (Assistant Principal I and Assistant Principal II) at both Primary and Post-Primary. (2,600 in total)</p>  <p>  The selection and recruitment process is well under way in most of our primary schools and the majority of these new middle management posts will be filled in the current school year, including schools where the Principal is a "Teaching Principal".</p>  <p>  Circular 63/2017 was issued by the Department in September 2017 which deals and sets out a leadership and management framework for posts in recognised primary schools. </p>  <p>  While the Principal is ultimately responsible to the Board of Management for the management and leadership of the school, the Deputy Principal occupies a position of vital importance within the senior leadership team in each school. The Deputy Principal co-operates with the Principal in the fulfilment of the Principal's role and acts or deputises as the Principal in the Principal's absence.</p>  <p>  In relation to the duties assigned to Assistant Principal posts, the Principal following consultation with staff, agree the schedule of duties as best meet the needs of the school. These duties are designed to reduce the workload of the Principal.</p>  <p>   I recently announced an extension to the arrangements for schools with teaching principals to cluster their release days into full-time posts, with one teacher covering the release days of all the schools in the cluster.  Up to 50 principal release cluster posts will be put in place for the 2018/19 school year. This measure will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school.</p>  <p>  Any additional increase in the number of release days will be considered as part of the next annual budgetary process alongside the many other demands from the education sector.</p></reply>

The SWS is a multi-annual Scheme.  Over 1,650 schools, nearly 50% of schools, applied for inclusion under the current round of the scheme which reflects a very high demand.  </p><p>To date, almost &euro;80 million has been approved under the current round of the Scheme, in respect of 635 school projects, 464 primary and 171 post-primary schools,  for Gas, electrical upgrades, mechanical, sanitation and roof improvement works..  Details of the successful school applicants, are published on the Department's website <i><i>www.education.ie</i></i>. </p><p>In relation to the Summer Works Scheme 2018, over &euro;25 million will be spent on summer works projects in 2018.  This expenditure will enable the remaining approved improvement works for 178 schools nationwide to be completed. These works will be carried out by the schools themselves on a devolved basis mainly over the summer months, so the disruption to students, teachers and other school staff will be kept to a minimum.</p><p>Furthermore, the Department intends to engage with the relevant education partners in relation to giving schools a better lead-in period for planning and delivering projects under the SWS from 2019 onwards.  While the SWS is hugely successful in enabling small scale refurbishment works to be done on a devolved basis, the Department considers that the operation of the scheme could be improved by providing a better lead-in period for schools rather than in Quarter 2 as in previous years.This will also help ensure that works done under the SWS fit better with any wider refurbishment/energy retrofit plans that may be done at schools under the increased funding provided in the National Development Plan. The engagement with education partners will commence shortly and will assist in developing a better timeline for the planning and delivery of summer works projects for 2019 onwards.</p><p>Alternatively, the school may use their minor works grant, which all primary schools received last December, to carry out works in full or on a phased basis, as that grant permits, if the school considers the works to be a priority.</p></reply>

In this regard, SNA allocations (excluding SERC recommended ratios of SNA support in special schools and classes) made from September 2014 are made initially for a maximum period of three years, subject to annual review, and subject to a full reassessment of their care needs at the end of the three year period. </p>  <p>  When considering applications for SNA support from post-primary schools the NCSE will take in to account the importance of the requirement to allocate necessary care supports with the right of a child to acquire personal independence skills.

This will form the basis of discussions with the majority patron (the Catholic Bishop in most cases) concerning the transfer of patronage of an existing school to meet that demand.  Each ETB will then draw up a comprehensive report on the position in relation to each of the 16 pilot areas for submission to the Department of Education and Skills, which will subsequently publish the reports.</p>  <p>  It is planned that, following the publication of the reports, the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process will move into the Implementation Phase, involving existing patrons consulting with their local school communities on accommodating the demand for diversity by transferring patronage of an existing school to a new multi-/non-denominational patron.</p>  <p>  The new process supporting transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local families is based around principles of transparency and cooperation. Therefore, there will be a very substantial level of consultation of local communities in the process, both with the ETBs in the initial phase to establish evidence of demand by consulting pre-school parents and subsequently through the requirement for the existing patron to consult with local community and school interests in proposing to transfer patronage of an existing school to an alternative patron body, in either language medium.

The awards were last presented in 2014.  The awards commemorated the role of former Taoiseach Sean Lemass in promoting Ireland's industry and developing its infrastructure.</p>  <p>  As part of my Department&rsquo;s Action Plan for Education, a new Entrepreneurship Education Policy Statement will be published. This Policy Statement will inform the development of new Entrepreneurship Education Guidelines for Schools to support the delivery of Entrepreneurial Education and experiential learning opportunities. It is proposed in this context that a new overarching National Entrepreneurial Award for primary and post-primary schools will be established, encompassing a broader range of competition areas than at present.</p></reply>

This will allow for the delivery of 10 new apprenticeship programmes and 6,197 new apprentice registrations as set out in the Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship 2016-2020.  Future years' allocations will be determined through the normal budgetary process which takes account of competing demands and the overall availability of resources.  </p>  <p>  It is estimated that the cost of training an apprentice in one of the existing craft apprenticeships is approximately &euro;6,700 per annum and the cost of training an apprentice in one of the new consortia led apprenticeships is approximately &euro;5,100 per annum. However, as part of the 2019 estimates process my Department is currently reviewing the per capita costing for both craft based and consortia led apprenticeships.  This exercise involves collecting detailed data from both SOLAS and the Higher Education Authority and, when completed, will provide a more accurate base from which future funding requirements can be established to meet the targets set out in our Apprenticeship Action Plan. </p></reply>

The Employment Equality Acts require employers to take reasonable steps to accommodate the needs of employees and prospective employees with disabilities. Reasonable accommodation typically involves some modification to the tasks/structure of a job or workplace environment, which would enable such an employee to fully perform their work role and enjoy equal employment opportunities. However, employers are not obliged to provide special treatment or facilities if the cost of doing so is excessive or disproportionate. </p>  <p>  Under Section 24 of the Education Act, 1998 (as amended by the Education (Amendment Act, 2012) the Board of Management is the employer. The Board of Management should therefore explore in conjunction with the employee, the appropriate School Management Body and the Occupational Health Service  any appropriate enabling options.</p>  <p>  In response to the school&rsquo;s correspondence of 23/3/2018  my Department wrote to the school on 20/4/2018 advising the Principal in relation to the obligations of employers as outlined above.</p></reply>

The Garda authorities subsequently initiated a comprehensive review of all youth referrals between 2010 and 2017 and a Review Team was tasked with coordinating this work, which covers all of the 28 Garda Divisions. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy of my concern that these issues are thoroughly addressed. These matters have also been highlighted in correspondence from Minister Flanagan to the Policing Authority, in the context of their oversight role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Deputy will be aware that the Policing Authority have indicated their intention to engage further with the Garda authorities in this matter. In addition, the Acting Commissioner has been requested to ensure that the present Review is completed as soon as possible, and my Department has recently sought a further update on the progress of the review from the Garda authorities, which is awaited. </p>  <p>  The Garda Youth Diversion Programme is an essential part of Government strategy to help tackle youth crime, and it is very important that it operates effectively. The operation of the Programme by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is strongly supported by a nationwide network of 105 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs), which are funded by my Department and operated by community-based organisations.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently engaged in a wide-ranging consultation process to support the development of GYDP services over the next few years. This process is helping to distil key issues to be addressed in expanding and enhancing the provision of GYDP services, including in relation to age-appropriate interventions. Of particular importance in this regard will be the preservation of strong links with the local community and encouraging the provision of an integrated service by working in partnership with all relevant service providers, with the overarching objective of ensuring that appropriate GYDP services are available to all children who could benefit, regardless of where they live in the State.  In addition, a renewed emphasis on preventative work and on use of mentoring approaches will be key in ensuring age-appropriate responses to the needs of individual children.</p></reply>

The interim arrangements for the short period prior to the opt-in enables those seeking international protection to access the labour market through the Employment Permit Acts.  Employment permits are the remit of the Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation and I have no remit or authority in this area.</p>  <p>  The Employment Permits Section of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DBEI) inform me that one application for an employment permit has been received from an International Protection applicant, which was subsequently withdrawn.  Officials from DBEI have been in direct contact with the International Protection applicant to assist in any new employment permit application that person may make.</p>  <p>  Following Government approval, I used my executive powers to introduce an administrative scheme to allow (from the date the Supreme Court struck down the prohibition), for an additional access to the labour market not provided for under the employment permit system.  This also allowed eligible applicants to activate their qualification for such access which will continue under any new scheme to be announced. This current interim scheme provides for eligible applicants for international protection (i.e. those in the system for over nine months without a first instance recommendation), to engage in self-employment.  As on 12 June 2018, the total number of applications for self-employment received under this scheme is 713, of which 503 have been granted.  </p>  <p>  The arrangements that are currently in place are interim arrangements pending the completion of the process to opt-in to the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive.  The opt-in process has proceeded quickly and, on Tuesday 22 May 2018, the decision of the EU Commission confirming Ireland&rsquo;s opt in to the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive was adopted.  The decision was published on the Official Journal the following day. The implementation group, chaired by the Department of Justice and Equality and with representatives from all relevant Departments and Agencies, is finalising the details of the more permanent arrangements, which will include less restrictive access to different categories of work than the employment permits regime which apply in the interim period. It is expected that the more permanent and broader labour market access arrangements will be in place upon the completion of the transposing measures from the end of June this year.</p></reply>

While the number of deaths at sea in the Mediterranean has dropped significantly over the past twelve months, any death at sea, particularly in such circumstances, is tragic. </p>  <p>  Ireland supports efforts made by the European Union and its Member States to put a stop to unnecessary deaths in the Mediterranean. </p>  <p>  Ireland has been active in search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean since 2015, first through Operation Pontus, a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Italy running in parallel to Operation Sophia. Ireland has been a full member of Operation Sophia since 2017. Since 2015, Irish naval vessels have rescued thousands of migrants at sea.</p>  <p>  In addition to supporting the rescue of migrants at sea, Ireland supports other measures to address the root causes of irregular migration, such as through the EU efforts to stabilise Libya and neighbouring countries in North and West Africa, both politically and economically.  The recently established AU-EU-UN Taskforce on Libya has seen some early successes in its efforts to support migrants in Libya. </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to make its own efforts, as well as supporting those of the EU, to improve the socio-economic conditions in countries of origin and transit. In this spirit, Ireland continues to support the EU Trust Fund for Africa and our pledge doubled to six million euro in 2017. The use of awareness-raising campaigns in third countries of origin and transit has been highlighted as an area of particular importance in recent EU discourse, and I understand it will be a priority of the upcoming Austrian EU Presidency. These campaigns seek to warn third country nationals, thinking of travelling to Europe through smuggling channels, of the risks of the crossing.</p>  <p>  Ireland supports the opening up of new legal migratory pathways to Europe for third country nationals, as part of efforts to reduce irregular migration and to reduce the numbers of migrants making dangerous journeys across the Mediterranean Sea. Ireland expects to be an active participant in current and future pledges in respect of refugees and other vulnerable persons in need of protection. In this regard, we have pledged to resettle 600 refugees each year in 2018 and 2019 under the EU-UNHCR pledging exercise for the two-year period.</p></reply>

It is intended that the Strategy will make a significant difference over its lifetime to the position of people with disabilities in Irish society. </p><p>In respect of the development and expansion of Irish Sign Language (ISL) services for deaf citizens, the commitments can be summarised as follows:  </p><p>- Extension of ISL remote interpretation service; </p><p>- Resourcing of the Sign Language Interpreting Service (SLIS) to increase the number of trained sign Language and deaf interpreters, to put a quality-assurance and registration scheme in place and to provide on-going professional training and development for interpreters; </p><p>- Legislation that will ensure that all public bodies provide ISL users with free interpretation when accessing or availing of statutory services. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Irish Sign Language Act 2017 was signed into law in December 2017 and provides for the following:- </p><p>- Recognition of the right of ISL users to use ISL as their native language;  </p><p>- The placing of a duty on public services to provide free interpretation services when accessing statutory services; </p><p>- The placing of an obligation on courts to take all reasonable steps to allow persons competent in ISL to be heard in ISL.</p><p>The Act will come into operation in December 2020. </p><p>The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is responsible for progressing the commitments under the Inclusion Strategy that relate to the extension of the ISL remote interpretation service, the increase in the number of interpreters, the establishment of a quality-assurance and registration scheme and the provision of on-going professional training and development for interpreters. Work has commenced on the implementation of this programme, completion of which is expected by 2021. DEASP will be reporting periodically on its progress in this regard to the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group, (which comprises the Interdepartmental Committee, the Disability Stakeholders Group and the National Disability Authority), and at local level through its Departmental Consultative Committee.</p></reply>

Further, the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works (OPW), which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation. This includes identifying and progressing any necessary remedial or refurbishment works required at individual stations. As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016 &ndash; 2021 is an ambitious 5 year building Programme reflecting the priorities of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which will benefit some 30 locations throughout the State.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that Sundrive Road Garda Station is not included in the Garda Station Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021.</p>  <p>  I am, however, informed that, in addition to the Programme, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seeks where possible to address minor accommodation issues at Garda stations as they arise.  In that context and on foot of requests from local management at Sundrive Road Garda Station, I am informed that works have been carried out in order to provide fully serviced storage facilities at the station; and that further works have been sanctioned in respect of the refurbishment of specific areas of the station to enhance the working conditions and to allow for additional personnel. </p>  <p>  Other than these works, I am informed that local management at the station has requested additional works, which are under consideration between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the OPW having regard to the funding available for maintenance of the totality of Garda accommodation requirements nationwide. </p>  <p>  More generally, the Deputy may wish to be aware that the dispersal and use of resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities and the appropriate structures and management arrangements for delivery of these services is under consideration by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland respectively.

In terms of providing upgraded court accommodation the refurbishment, extension and development of existing courthouses has always been the Courts Service's preference. However, while this is an option for Tralee, the scope for refurbishing and developing the existing courthouse on Ashe Street to provide the envisaged accommodation is extremely limited due to the nature of the building and the constrained nature of the site.</p><p>The Courts Service has also advised that it is currently considering a number of options for Tralee Courthouse, including the level of extension and refurbishment achievable within the confines of the existing courthouse site; whether it would be feasible to acquire an adjacent town centre site and the degree of extension and refurbishment this would allow. Previous efforts to acquire adjacent sites on Ashe Street have not been successful as the sites could not be acquired at a price that represented value for money. A further option is to build a new modern courthouse on a greenfield/brownfield site and a number of potential sites are being considered in this regard. The Courts Service has informed me that a decision has not yet been made and that all options are under review.</p><p>A number of developments in relation to Courts Service accommodation requirements are outlined in the Government's recent National Development Plan 2018 -2027. They include:  </p><p>- Further new or refurbished courthouses in regional cities and county towns where facilities remain substandard (including Galway City, Wicklow Town, Portlaoise, <b>Tralee</b>and Roscommon) and further provincial locations such as An Clochan Liath (Dungloe) to serve as the Gaeltacht court for the region, and Tuam; </p><p>- Regional Family Law Centres; </p><p>- A nationwide condition survey of all court buildings in the estate will be undertaken to determine their condition and identify works required in relation to any issues identified and meet ongoing maintenance requirements.</p><p>The precise allocation and timing of additional funding over the entire ten year period remains to be fully determined. It will be dependent on the outcome of further detailed planning and analysis of costs which will determine prioritisation of projects from a timing and budgetary perspective.</p></reply>

Represented at the meeting were the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport; Housing, Planning and the Environment; and Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; the Road Safety Authority; and the Revenue Commissioners.  A separate meeting also took place with a representative from Dublin City Council on 23 April, as the representative unable to attend the cross-agency meeting.</p>  <p>  I asked my officials to arrange these consultations to identify whether there are additional legislative or other solutions which can assist in dealing with the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes more comprehensively. I am informed that at this meeting, the issue of the misuse of scramblers within public parks was a particular point of focus.</p>  <p>  My officials are now consulting further with local authorities in the context of the many examples of positive engagement fostered by local authorities with local communities, as a number of initiatives and projects are of potential interest insofar as the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes are concerned. Possible options for further discussion include the provision of designated areas, where such vehicles could be used in a safe environment. </p>  <p>  The incident in Darndale Park on Saturday underscores the dangers associated with the misuse of these vehicles, particularly in unsuitable environments, where the potential for serious injuries to innocent bystanders exists. </p>  <p>  I have requested a Garda report in relation to the incident referred to by the Deputy and I will contact the Deputy directly on receipt of same.</p>  <p>  I will continue to actively support any positive actions that can be pursued to counteract the serious public safety issues associated with the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes.</p></reply>

This included a Directive on copyright in the Digital Single Market (hereinafter the &ldquo;Copyright Directive&rdquo;). The intention of the Directive is to craft modern copyright legislation suitable for all European citizens. Among the Directive&rsquo;s many proposals are provisions aimed at ensuring greater rights for press publishers seeking to protect their content online (Article 11), and intended to address the &ldquo;value gap&rdquo;, whereby rightsholders are receiving less remuneration despite the increased usage of their works (Article 13).</p>  <p>  Officials of my Department have been thoroughly engaged in negotiations since publication of this proposal and have been successful in achieving a number of amendments to address the concerns of our stakeholders. On 25 May, the Copyright Directive was discussed by Ambassadors at Coreper and the Presidency gained approval for a mandate to commence negotiations with the European Parliament.</p>  <p>  Negotiations on the Copyright Directive have been exhaustive and while I appreciate the concerns that have been raised, I fully support the intention of this proposal which is vitally important to both the DSM and the digital economy. Our focus has always been on achieving the best balance for the competing interests of all stakeholders, including digital economy actors, rightsholders, and citizens. To that end, there has been extensive engagement with stakeholders across the various issues in Ireland, Brussels, and with other EU Member States, including at Ministerial level.</p>  <p>  My Department will engage positively with the negotiations on the proposal going forward to ensure that Ireland can benefit from its many merits as soon as possible. Once the Directive has been agreed at EU level and we begin to transpose it into Irish legislation, my Department will hold a public consultation to ensure that we have modern copyright legislation that is most appropriate for Ireland.</p></reply>

On an annual basis Enterprise Ireland works with approximately 5,000 companies through a network of market and sector advisers based across 10 national offices and 33 international offices. These manufacturing and internationally traded services companies are a critical source of existing employment and job creation in every county in Ireland.</p><p>To date 110 companies have availed of the Brexit Be Prepared Grant. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Be Prepared Grant offers SMEs a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to assist them in preparing an action plan for economic shocks, such as Brexit. The grant can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and travel expenses associated with researching the direction of their action plan. Enterprise Ireland is committed to processing all applications for the grant within eighteen days. </p><p>For example, this might involve investigating the feasibility of diversifying into new markets and market segments; investment in innovation; improvement in operational competitiveness; and/or enhancement of strategic financial capability.  </p><p>Enterprise Ireland will continue to promote the <i>Be Prepared Grant</i>to all counties and regions to ensure that the maximum number of clients are engaged in preparing for the impact of Brexit.</p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland launched the Market Discovery Fund in January 2018 with the aim of encouraging companies to expand into new markets by helping with the costs of researching viable and sustainable market entry strategies. </p><p>The Fund provides support towards both internal and external costs incurred by companies when researching new markets for products and services. Eligible companies can receive support when they are looking at a new geographic market for an existing product/service, or when looking at exporting a new product/service to a market that they already do business in.</p><p>The Market Discovery Fund is available across three levels:</p><p>- Level 1: Grant up to &euro;35K</p><p>- Level 2: Grant greater than &euro;35K but less than &euro;75K</p><p>- Level 3: Grant greater than &euro;75K but less than &euro;150K</p><p>The maximum funding is 50% of eligible expenditure up to a maximum grant of &euro;150,000. Eligible expenditure includes, but is not limited to, salary support, consultancy costs, trade fair costs and foreign travel. </p><p>The Market Discovery Fund has now been open for applications for a number of months and to date, thirty-three Market Discovery Grants have been approved.</p></reply>

The &euro;23 million exchequer funding (&euro;14 million from my Department and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) has been leveraged to provide a fund of up to &euro;300 million. </p>  <p>  The scheme features a two-stage application process.  First, businesses must apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to confirm their eligibility for the scheme. This application process requires businesses to use guidelines provided on the SBCI website to determine if they are eligible, and if so, to complete the eligibility form.  As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet the challenges posed by Brexit. The SBCI assess the applications and successful applicants receive an eligibility reference number. </p>  <p>  Successful applicants can then apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers.  Participating finance providers are the Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank with Allied Irish Bank following later this month.  Approval of loans are subject to the finance providers own credit policies and procedures.   </p>  <p>  The scheme was launched on 28 March this year.  Metrics detailing the uptake of the scheme will be available at the start of Quarter 3, 2018.</p></reply>

These costs, as well as their timing, are difficult to forecast as the Office has little or no control over the timing of when the cases will be determined. It is also the case that the Office cannot be sure of the outcome of cases in terms of costs orders and it cannot anticipate the scale of costs that other parties may seek.  Whilst it is entirely prudent that provision continue to be made to meet legal costs in the Office&rsquo;s subhead, the corollary of the uncertainty in relation to the amount, timing etc. of such costs can lead to underspends. This has been the case for the last number of years where the Office&rsquo;s legal costs have been significantly less than anticipated thus giving rise to underspends.</p><p>There have also been underspends in the pay allocation.  Over recent years, a number of senior-level vacancies have arisen within the Office through a combination of retirement, promotion and transfer to other parts of the public service.  Whilst the Office, along with a number of other State organisations, faces challenges in the recruitment of highly qualified professional staff, particularly in the current buoyant labour market, I am satisfied that it has sufficient pay monies.  At present, there are no requests for additional staffing from the Office.</p></reply>

The final Report and accompanying communication includes an apology from the HSE for the failures identified and for the anxiety that this has caused to families and those who may have been harmed. It also includes an invitation to the parents of children affected to meet with a HSE senior manager and a senior audiologist to discuss the finding of the Report and to be updated on their child's care.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed that all 49 children who needed follow-up as a result of the look-back process are either currently receiving or have already received the appropriate care they need. The HSE has been asked to contact the Deputy directly with regard to the location of any future follow-up appointments.</p>  <p>  The look-back report represents a thorough analysis of the quality of service delivery in the area against the standards for such services that were set out in the National Audiology Review Group Report (2011). Since 2011, the recommendations of this Report, including clinical governance and quality assurance processes, have been the benchmark for the quality of service delivery throughout the country.</p>  <p>  It is appropriate that our health service strives continually to improve the quality of the services it provides and promotes a culture of learning where shortcomings are identified. My priority in relation to the families and children who have been impacted by the findings of this look-back is that the HSE takes swift action, including the provision of appropriate care,  and I am satisfied that this has been done in this case.</p></reply>

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating. Lyme Disease is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe. </p><p>Lyme borelliosis is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination. The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies to <i>Borrelia burgdorferi </i>produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection. These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease. The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step.  Screening EIAs can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other spirochaete infections including syphilis, and certain viral infections including glandular fever. In addition, sera from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results.  If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (RIPL) Service of Public Health England Porton which uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities. This involves a screening serological test followed by a confirmatory serological test. All clinical (and other) laboratories must undergo continuous quality assurance to ensure that the quality of the diagnostics they provide is maintained at the highest international level for human diagnostics. This two tier approach gives a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme. </p><p>Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics. These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks. If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered. In Ireland, treatment by most clinicians is based on that laid out in evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis (formerly known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis), and babesiosis published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2006.</p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre of the HSE (HPSC) is responsible for the surveillance of notifiable infectious diseases such as Lyme Disease. The Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee, the aim of which is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland. In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency, an Environmental Health Officer and a representative from Tick Talk Ireland. The Subcommittee report on a number of areas, including initiatives undertaken to date, summary advice relating to awareness, preventive advice for the general public, preventive advice and material for those responsible for sites or locations known to have or suspected as having higher densities of ticks, and summary advice relating to GP management of the condition.</p><p>Following the establishment of the Lyme Borreliosis Subcommittee, a thorough review was performed to ensure existing material was fully up to date, comprehensible and appropriately presented to assist members of the public to obtain the necessary knowledge to protect their and their family&rsquo;s health. In addition, material to support clinicians (primarily GPs) in identifying Lyme disease was also developed. </p><p>The members of the Subcommittee identified the need to accurately describe and map laboratory practice relating to Borrelia diagnostics in Ireland. HPSC undertook a <i>Borrelia Burgdorferi </i>laboratory Survey in 2016, and following development and analysis, the survey was published in Epi-Insight in 2017. The following are the additional resources that have subsequently been identified, and developed by the Subcommittee, and are now hosted on the HPSC website:</p><p>- Laboratory testing for Lyme Disease: FAQs for general public</p><p><i>- Borrelia burgdorferi</i>diagnostic methods in Ireland: microbiology laboratory survey (2016) &ndash; this laboratory survey, had a 75% response rate.  All the major laboratories participated, and all laboratories participating were accredited to the important ISO 15189 standard.  The full results were published in Epi-Insight (August 2017)</p><p>- Erythema Migrans Diagnostic Support Tool</p><p>- Erythema migrans image slide set</p><p>- Map of Lyme neuroborreliosis in Ireland, 2012-2016 cumulative incidence</p><p>During the preparation of the Final Report, the HPSC learned that National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK were undertaking a systematic review of Lyme disease. This process resulted in the NICE Lyme disease guideline. This guideline is based on the most exhaustive systematic review yet undertaken, of the evidence around Lyme disease and focused on producing recommendations based on best available evidence relating to awareness raising, and on the diagnosis and management of Lyme disease. We delayed the final production of the report, to enable us to undertake a review of the final NICE Lyme Guideline which was finally published in mid-April 2018.  </p><p>Since then the guideline and the associated evidence and papers has been reviewed, to determine if there were any aspects of this review that would be of relevance or possibly require mention/inclusion in the Subcommittee&rsquo;s Final Report. This was important as a significant element of the Guideline relates to the evidence around raising awareness of Lyme disease.  This review indicated that the approach that we had been undertaking, both in HPSC before the establishment of the Subcommittee, and subsequent to the Subcommittee coming into being, was very much in line with that recommended by NICE. Where appropriate, reference will be made in the Final Report to the NICE Guideline.</p><p>The report is in the final stages of preparation it is planned to circulate to the members of the Lyme Subcommittee with a view to having a final sign-off meeting of the Subcommittee in late June or early July. Following this the report will be sent for consideration to the SAC (the Lyme Group is a Subcommittee of HPSC&rsquo;s SAC), with a view to then being sent out for consultation.  It would be inappropriate to consider changes to the testing or treatment and management of the condition until the report has been finalised and published.</p></reply>

Arising out of the review, a recommendation was made to examine the treatment of business and farm  assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the scheme. The Programme for a Partnership Government also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms. </p>  <p>  At present, the capital value of an individual's principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three year cap. This cap does not apply to productive assets such as farms and businesses except in cases of sudden illness or disability where specific conditions are met.</p>  <p>  It is proposed to amend the scheme to treat farm and business assets in the same manner as the principal private residence where a family successor commits to working the farm or business, i.e. to cap contributions at three years.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Health has been examining the potential for changes to the treatment of business and farm assets under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. Any changes to the scheme, if approved by Government, will require amendment of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. </p>  <p>  A Memorandum for Government setting out the details of the proposed policy change and seeking Government approval to draft the General Scheme of a bill to amend the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 has been circulated to other Government Departments for observations.</p></reply>

While it is understood that pay savings were made by the organisations, the precise mix of pay cuts or other savings measures will have varied. Also, where there were pay cuts, it is not at all clear that they were applied in a universally consistent manner, as is the case in the public sector. </p>  <p>  Therefore, the Government has put in place a process to establish a deeper understanding of the funding position in these grant - aided organisations and the true extent of the pay reductions applied. The Minister for Health asked the HSE to engage with the Section 39 organisations to establish the facts around what cuts were applied and how and when they were implemented. </p>  <p>  On foot of agreement at the WRC, a data gathering exercise was conducted. Following discussions with the Trade Unions on a draft of the report, the HSE has submitted their completed interim report to my Department on 11 June 2018. This reports covers a sample of 50 agencies identified in the WRC agreement.

In this regard, my Department is currently finalising an implementation plan in response to the Sl&aacute;intecare report, with a focus on the initial three year period.  It is my intention to bring proposals to Government in the next few weeks and to publish the implementation plan shortly thereafter.  While I accept that this is later than originally envisaged, it is important that we get it right. </p>  <p>  I have already acted on several of the specific recommendations proposed in the Sl&aacute;intecare report. A Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Office is being established in the Department of Health.  This office will be tasked with implementing a programme of reform, as agreed by Government, arising from the Sl&aacute;intecare Report.  The process for the appointment of an Executive Director to lead the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Office has been managed independently by the Public Appointments Service. It is anticipated that an appointment will be made shortly.</p>  <p>  An independent board for the HSE is being established as recommended in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  The General Scheme of a Bill has been published and it is hoped that legislation will be enacted this year.</p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare Report recommended the removal of private practice from public hospitals.  I have established an Independent Review Group to examine how private practice can be removed from public hospitals.  It will report later this year.</p>  <p>  A public consultation on the geographical alignment of Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations has recently been completed and will inform work on broader health service structural reform as recommended in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Government has demonstrated significant commitment to invest in our health and social care services since the publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Funding for new initiatives in Budget 2018 were closely aligned with proposals in Sl&aacute;intecare.  These new initiatives included investing &euro;25 million a new Primary Care fund, additional funding of &euro;25 million allocated for home care and transition beds, &euro;17 million to reduce medicine and prescription charges, &euro;75 million targeted to reduce waiting list and &euro;1 million for the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Office. </p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, The Sl&aacute;intecare report represents a significant milestone in our political and health policy history.  It is the first time in the history of the State that cross-party consensus of this scale has been achieved on health policy and I welcome this. I intend to harness the consensus generated by the Report to move forward with a significant programme of health reform.  The Government is committed to making tangible improvements in our health service and the Sl&aacute;intecare Report provides the direction of travel for this.  </p></reply>

Under Sections 5 and 11 of the Act, the role of the Minister in safeguarding the environment is set out. Section 7 provides for the attachment and varying of conditions to a licence or approval and also for the revoking of a licence. Sections 26-29 set out a range of penalties that can be imposed. These sections of the Act provide flexibility to the Minister in terms of attaching environmental conditions to an approval or licence and enforcing those conditions. </p><p>Together, the above provisions are designed to integrate the protection of the environment and legal requirements under various relevant Directives and transposing legislation, into the central decision-making process regarding licences and approvals by the Department. This is reflected in the scope of the Act, as follows; &ldquo;.... <i>to make further and better provision in relation to forestry, to provide for the development and promotion of forestry in a manner that maximises the economic, environmental and social value of forests within the principles of sustainable forest management,....</i>&rdquo;.</p><p>In this context, the Environmental Requirements for Afforestation were introduced in December 2016. These consolidated various environmental guidelines into a single coherent document dealing exclusively with afforestation, taking onboard more recent developments in relation to regulation, research and changes in forest practices. These Requirements include specific measures to ensure the protection of water quality when establishing new forests and woodlands, with a key measure being the introduction of a largely unplanted water setback alongside various defined water features. The application of the Requirements, in combination with the range of options now available under the Afforestation Scheme, allow for nuanced design, creating woodlands and forests in tune with the environment and compatible with other on-farm enterprises and activities. </p><p>The commitment of my Department to developing the forestry sector in a sustainable manner is also demonstrated in recent publications entitled <i>&ldquo;Woodland for Water: Creating new native woodlands to protect and enhance Ireland&rsquo;s waters&rdquo;</i>and the &ldquo;<i>Felling and Reforestation Policy</i>&rdquo;. The first of these documents aims to explore how new native woodland and undisturbed water setbacks can be used in combination to deliver meaningful ecosystem services that protect and enhance water quality and aquatic ecosystems. These opportunities in turn can help contribute to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the 2nd cycle of the WFD. The &ldquo;<i>Felling and Reforestation Policy</i>&rdquo; will ensure that existing forests are appropriately restructured post-clearfell, to reflect water and other environmental sensitivities on-the-ground. </p><p>The use of new native woodlands to protect water quality and the aquatic habitat for the highly-sensitive Freshwater Pearl Mussel (FPM) is being trialled by the KerryLIFE project, an EU co-funded project focusing on sustainable land use management for the conservation of the species (LIFE13 NAT/IE/000144). The project, focused on the Caragh and Kerry Blackwater FPM catchments in the southwest of Ireland, is trialling sustainable management techniques for farming and forestry in FPM catchments. Concrete measures under KerryLIFE include the stabilisation of riparian sediment sources using broadleaf planting, through the establishment of new long-term native woodland to create a protective physical buffer between aquatic zones and farming activities. Such woodlands are being created under Native Woodland Establishment, and the experiences gained will inform land-use management within other FPM catchments nationwide. My Department is a co-beneficiary in KerryLIFE, alongside Coillte. </p><p>With regard to the specific question of water testing, the existing Acid Sensitivity Protocol was developed by my Department, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and COFORD, to protect watercourses from potential acidification arising from afforestation. It applies to designated 'Acid Sensitive Areas', which account for 600,000 hectares of land or 9% of the total land area of the State. Under the Protocol, four water samples must be taken and analysed according to a set methodology, and the results must be included with the afforestation application. Depending on the results, the application is refused, referred to the EPA, or approved (subject to other checks). In January 2013, the EPA agreed with this Department, Inland Fisheries Ireland, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Woodlands of Ireland, to remove the requirement for water sampling for Native Woodland Establishment Scheme applications, due to the ability of new native woodland to protect water and to deliver other ecosystem services (biodiversity, landscape enhancement, amenity, sustainable hardwoods, etc.)</p></reply>

The proposals, as drafted, involve significant changes, including in relation to governance, the distribution of direct payments among farmers and the increasing environmental conditionality attaching to such payments.  There will be additional discretion for Member States in configuring the measures available, within parameters laid down in the draft proposals.   The new proposals must commit to a more significant environmental ambition than the current CAP schemes, including in pillar I. </p>  <p>  These are complex proposals.  We are at the beginning of what will be intensive and challenging negotiations.  I will work with the Commission and other Member States to shape these proposals into an effective new CAP.  My Department is still analysing the proposals and their potential implications for the Irish agrifood sector.  </p>  <p>  The new proposals allow for subsidiarity for Member States but with an overall commitment by the European Commission to protect the common policy and avoid distorting the single market.  </p>  <p>  Of course there are elements in the proposals as drafted that will present challenges, including   the definition of a "genuine farmer. " This was among the most difficult discussions during the last reform in 2013, and member states will have differing perspectives on the definition. Commissioner Hogan has already confirmed that the definition proposed in the new draft regulations will not exclude part time farmers, but of course we must also ensure that any definition is implementable in practice and does not lead to undue administrative burden or delay for applicants or the department. </p>  <p>  I have already indicated that I am open to some level of capping and redistribution of direct payments. Ireland has already applied the maximum level of degressivity allowable under the current regulations for payments over &euro;150,000. The new  proposals include a number of measures designed to move further in this direction, including an overall cap of &euro;100,000, degressivity for payments above &euro;60,000, a complementary redistributive income support and the convergence of payments towards a minimum of 75% of the average payment per hectare nationally. My Department is at present examining these  proposals carefully to assess their potential impact on applicants, and to ensure that any such mechanisms can be implemented without undue complexity. </p>  <p>  I am also broadly supportive of the proposals to support young farmers and new entrants. This has been a priority in the current CAP and will continue to be. The new proposals include a mandatory complementary income support for young farmers and will allow member states to configure support measures appropriately in the period 2021-2027, having regard to the range of priorities to be met from each national envelope. </p>  <p>  The Article referred to by the Deputy requires "young farmers" to be defined  within the parameters laid down in the Council Regulation. The supports proposed are for young farmers who have newly set up a holding  for the first time or those who have newly set up a holding for the first time as head of the holding and have the necessary training or skills as defined by the member states. These elements will require further elaboration as the negotiations progress, but it appears that there will be some member state discretion in configuring the necessary supports. </p>  <p>  There are also new governance proposals regarding how schemes and plans can be approved and made operational.  I will be seeking to ensure that any new systems do not lead to delays in approval and operation of schemes and that there is clarity for farmers with regard to their obligations. </p>  <p>  I have recently concluded a transparent national consultation for citizens on the future CAP.  Now that the Commission proposals have been published, I have  announced a further consultation to take place early  in July.  Ultimately the shape of the regulations will be determined by engagement with the Commission, Member States the European Parliament, but I am anxious that Irish citizens have an opportunity to have their voices heard in the process. </p>  <p>  Underpinning all of this is the CAP budget. While the shape of any new Multi Annual Financial Framework is ultimately a matter for Finance Ministers, and the European Parliament,  I have been working successfully with counterparts in other Member States to build support for the retention of a strong budget.  </p>  <p>  Over the coming months there will be detailed negotiations at all levels across the EU as we work together to shape the final outcome.  At the centre of all our considerations will be the need to ensure that the new CAP, properly funded, will continue to support farm families and the rural economy.</p></reply>

The necessary regulatory steps have been put in place to give effect to this measure.  It is worth noting that this measure is not &lsquo;new&rsquo; for about half of kerbside household waste customers, who are already on an incentivised usage pricing plan, i.e., a plan which contains a per lift or a weight related fee. </p><p>As announced in mid-2017, mandatory per kilogramme 'pay by weight' charging is not being introduced. Allowing for a range of charging options, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste, provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances. </p><p>The Price Monitoring Group has considered eight months of data to date. While fluctuations in prices and service offerings have been observed, the overall trend is relative price stability. The Price Monitoring Group has reported that there are currently 9 different types of price models on the market. The main price examples include a service charge plus charge per bin lift, with an excess per kg charge, and a service charge plus per kg weight charge. The most popular service offering now is the &lsquo;service charge including weight allowance, plus per kg charge for excess above allowance&rsquo;. </p><p>An annual support of &euro;75 per person is being made available for persons with lifelong or long-term medical incontinence. This will help people meet the average annual cost for the disposal of medical incontinence products.  My Department is in discussion with the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive, and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner regarding the administrative details and arrangements of the support, as well as engaging with the relevant  stakeholders.  I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to finalising the details for this support as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Under section 60(3) of that Act, I, as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance, in specific cases, by a local authority of their statutory functions under the Act. </p>  <p>  The most recent iteration of Regional Waste Management Plans set out how waste generated will be managed over the time period 2015-2021, in line with national and EU waste management policy, and support the development of up to 300,000 tonnes of additional thermal recovery capacity nationally. This figure was determined, firstly to ensure that there is adequate and competitive treatment capacity in the market, and secondly to ensure the State&rsquo;s self-sufficiency requirements for the recovery of municipal waste are met. The Plans also reflect the move away from landfilling because it is the least desirable method of managing waste. Furthermore, that level of thermal recovery capacity takes account of the requirement to achieve a recycling rate of municipal waste in excess of 60% by 2030, which is in line with one of the new EU recycling targets. The three Regional Waste Management Plans themselves have a headline target for the prevention and recycling of waste.</p>  <p>  My role as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment in relation to waste management is to provide a comprehensive legislative and policy framework through which the relevant regulatory bodies, such as Local Authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency, operate. </p>  <p>  Our national waste policy is predicated on and consistent with European Union waste policy, which has the waste hierarchy as its cornerstone. Under the waste hierarchy, the prevention, preparation for reuse, recycling and recovery of waste is preferred to the disposal or landfill of waste.</p></reply>

Funding has, therefore, been allocated in my Department's budget this year to support the provision of public charging. </p>  <p>  A key aspect of the work of the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, involves examining how best to support the development of the public charging network.  The first phase of the Taskforce's work, which focuses on electric vehicles, is nearing completion and I expect to bring forward proposals that will support further provision of effective and efficient publically accessible electric vehicle charging.</p>  <p>  In this regard, funding for public charging in local communities is already available through the Better Energy Communities Scheme.  The scheme, which is administered by the SEAI, supports community based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of homes, businesses and community facilities in a local area.</p>  <p>  The operation and maintenance of the existing public charging network is a matter for the ESB. In relation to the provision of a charge point in Dingle, I understand there is already a charge point in this location. However, the ESB has informed my Department that there have been some technical issues with this charge point in recent days which are being addressed.</p></reply>

Today, 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. By 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan. </p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area.  This process is now in its final stages. </p><p>The specialist NBP procurement team will continue to engage intensively with all relevant stakeholders, including the bidding consortium, to ensure the earliest possible achievement of the Government&rsquo;s objective of providing reliable high quality, high speed broadband to all premises in Ireland. When the procurement process reaches a satisfactory conclusion for Government, a contract will be awarded and network rollout will commence.  </p><p>For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure. The Department of Rural and Community Development maintain a list of Broadband Officers, a link to which is available on my Department's website at </p></reply>

No. 460 of 2009 Air Navigation (Notification and Investigation of Accidents, Serious Incidents and Incidents) Regulations 2009, provides under &lsquo;Occurrences involving State aircraft and foreign state aircraft [&hellip;] 23. (1) Where a foreign state aircraft is involved in an occurrence in the State these Regulations shall apply&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  The particular incident to which the Deputy refers occurred over international waters on 3 June 2018 at 13.04 hrs UTC.  The aircraft, a McDonnell Douglas DC 10 tanker, was on a flight from the UK to the USA. While over international waters, the flight crew advised Shannon that they had shut down one of their three engines and, as they were unable to maintain the assigned flight level for the Atlantic crossing, they requested a diversion to Shannon. The aircraft landed at Shannon at 14.03 hrs UTC without further incident. </p>  <p>  The AAIU Inspector-On-Call was kept apprised of the situation by Shannon ATC throughout the aircraft&rsquo;s flight and landing. As the event occurred over international waters the responsibility for assessing if an investigation by a Safety Investigation Authority (SIA) is warranted, and for conducting such an investigation, rests with the State of the Operator. For completeness, the event as described would not appear to meet the definition of a Serious Incident, and accordingly the AAIU does not consider an investigation by an SIA is warranted.</p></reply>

If individuals provide personal records to the Commission, it is the policy to photocopy these and return the originals to the people concerned on the day. The Commission does not have a role in assisting individuals in resolving broader questions on their identity or in tracing birth relatives. Persons seeking such information should contact the Information and Tracing services of TUSLA, the Child and Family Agency (), which holds records from a number of former mother and baby homes and adoption societies, or assistance is also available through the Adoption Authority of Ireland ().</p></reply>

There has been a 46% (4,458) reduction in cases awaiting allocation to a social worker since Tusla was established.  All cases are screened at point of referral and any case requiring immediate follow up receives same and all other unallocated cases are reviewed by a Team Leader on an on-going basis.</p><p>Using the most recent data available (March 2018), I can inform the Deputy that there were a total of 4,689 cases awaiting allocation of a social worker. From this group, 734 were High Priority, 2,971 were Medium Priority and 984 were Low Priority.</p><p>Tusla does not publish data on average time waiting by area. However, data on the number of cases awaiting allocation by time band is collated. Using this most recent data available (March 2018), 126 cases were waiting less than 1 week, 421 cases were waiting 1-2 weeks, 248 cases were waiting for 2-3 weeks, 565 cases were waiting 3-4 weeks, 534 cases were waiting 1-2 months, 395 cases were waiting 2-3 months, and 1,896 cases were waiting for more than three months.</p><p>The information is provided in the following two tables.</p><p>Addressing the number of children who are awaiting the allocation of a social worker is one of my key priorities. I secured funds in Budget 2018 which will allow Tusla to carry out the third year of a 3 year plan to provide for the allocation of a dedicated social worker to all children who need one. Tusla are also funded to recruit family support workers, social care staff and administrative staff to work alongside social workers in supporting vulnerable children and families.</p><p>An unallocated case relates to a case about a child that is deemed to need a social work assessment, but has not yet been allocated to a social worker.  All urgent and emergency cases receive immediate attention by the local duty social work team. The majority of unallocated cases are new referrals. However, they may also include children living with their families who had an allocated social worker, or to a child in care, where there is now a social work vacancy.</p><p>I am informed by Tusla that a case awaiting allocation may be listed as 'active on duty'. Tusla indicate that this may include checking with professionals who see the child regularly, or visiting the child and family at home, getting additional information about the child's situation and, in some instances where a child is in care, organising a Care Plan Review and visiting the child. </p><p>I, and my officials, will continue to engage directly with the Tusla Board and Senior Management Team to monitor and review progress in reducing the number of unallocated cases and the waiting time for the allocation of a social worker to a case assessed as requiring a social work service. </p><p><b>Number of Cases Awaiting Allocation (March 2018) </b><table><tr><th>Area</th><th>A.

Once projects are formally approved, the LAGs have a role to play in publicising these projects and informing the local community about the funding provided for their area.  Details of all projects approved by the LAGs are also published on the LEADER pages of my Department's website, <i>www.drcd.gov.ie</i>.

My Department also conducted a public consultation, seeking views on the concept of a community banking model. The invitation to submit responses was open to all, and was particularly extended to main stakeholders and members of the Oireachtas. The consultation ran for four weeks and 16 submissions were received. These have been assessed in detail and the views of the respondents will be reflected in the forthcoming report.</p>  <p>  The report has now been completed and the project team has submitted their findings to the Minister for Finance and myself.

The remit of the Commission is to promote the economic and social development of the Western Region, covering counties Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Roscommon, Galway and Clare.</p>  <p>  The Commission has achieved a lot since its establishment, and I believe it has an important role to play in the Government&rsquo;s emphasis on achieving more effective regional development through initiatives such as the Regional Action Plan for Jobs, the Action Plan for Rural Development, the development of Atlantic Economic Corridor and the National Planning Framework.  </p>  <p>  Minister Ring appointed a new Board to the WDC in August 2017 and has delegated responsibility for oversight of the Commission to me.  I met with the new Chair and the Acting CEO in November 2017, and last month I met with the new Board to discuss issues of priority for both the WDC and the Department.  </p>  <p>  There is also on-going engagement between my Department and the WDC at executive level to deepen the Commission&rsquo;s involvement in the regional development agenda and to benefit from their experience.</p>  <p>  In this context, the WDC has been involved in an increasing number of initiatives.  For example:</p>  <p>  - The WDC is represented on the Monitoring Committee for the Action Plan for Rural Development and on the Implementing Committees which oversee the delivery of the Action Plans for Jobs for the West and North-West regions.</p>  <p>  - The Commission is also represented on the Taskforce which I chair to progress the development of an Atlantic Economic Corridor area along the western seaboard.   The WDC has been a key contributor to sub-groups of this Taskforce. </p>  <p>  The Commission also continues to implement initiatives to support the development of SMEs and emerging sectors in the western region.  I recently launched a new &euro;2 million fund for the Commission to encourage the film, television, animation and games industry in the West of the country. I look forward to continuing to work with the new Board as they seek to support the regional development agenda.</p></reply>

I chair the Taskforce which includes senior representatives from the business sector, key Government Departments, other public bodies, and Third Level institutions.  The Taskforce has met five times since it was established, and will continue to meet on a regular basis. </p>  <p>  A number of sub-groups of the Taskforce are also working to progress specific aspects of the overall proposal, such as examining infrastructure needs and enterprise property assets, and developing a communications strategy.</p>  <p>  Local Authorities are playing a key role in the development of the AEC, and in particular are helping to ensure a cohesive approach is taken across the corridor.  My Department is providing funding of &euro;30,000 to each of the 10 Local Authorities along the AEC to support the appointment of a dedicated AEC Officer to help drive the project in each area.  The Local Authorities are currently in the process of assigning these officers. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the AEC Officers will have a particular focus in supporting the work of the Taskforce's sub-groups.  They will also play a role in the overall communications strategy which will promote the benefits of the corridor and raise awareness of the AEC as an attractive region to invest in and to live in.</p></reply>

Each LAG is representative of its local area and any decision to approve a project must be taken with a majority of non-public sector representatives present.</p>  <p>  No works can commence on a project until formal approval has issued.

All are designed to assist rural and urban communities in need.</p><p>The new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) launched in January 2018 will run for a five-year period until 2022. </p><p>SICAP focuses on reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion and equality in Ireland through supporting communities and individuals using community development approaches, engagement and collaboration. SICAP is overseen and managed by the Local Community Development Committee (LCDC) in each local authority area. The Department has engaged Pobal to work on its behalf to manage and oversee the delivery of SICAP nationally. More information about the programme can be found on the Pobal website.</p><p>I recently launched the Community Enhancement Programme (CEP),<b></b>which replaces and builds the good work of two existing schemes (Communities Facilities Scheme and RAPID). The programme has a budget of &euro;4.5m for 2018. This is an increase funding for each Local Authority area compared with their combined RAPID and CFS funding for 2017. LCDCs will continue to administer the programme at local level and are at present seeking applications. They will be advertising locally for suitable projects and will provide details on how to apply in each area. The closing date for applications is 30 July 2018.</p><p>The CL&Aacute;R programme<b></b>provides funding for small scale infrastructural projects in disadvantaged rural areas that have experienced significant levels of de-population. The scheme is funded by my Department and delivered, for the most part, by the Local Authorities in consultation with groups in local communities. The 2018 CL&Aacute;R programme will see funding provided under three measures:</p><p>Measure 1: Support for Schools/Community Safety MeasuresMeasure 2: Play AreasMeasure 3: First Response Support Measure</p><p>The deadline for applications under the 2018 CL&Aacute;R programme passed on 30 April 2018, but the criteria used for Measures 1 and 2 are available from Local Authorities, while the criteria and application form for Measure 3 are available on my Department's website.</p><p>The Local Improvement Scheme (LIS) is a scheme for carrying out improvement works on private/non-public roads. It is funded by the Department in conjunction with the County Councils who administer the scheme and carry out the works. Applications are submitted to the County Councils who prioritise projects within their allocation and forward them to the Department for final approval. The criteria for eligible roads are set out in the memorandum governing the scheme. Generally, they are non-public roads, often leading to houses and important community amenities such as graveyards, beaches, piers, mountains, etc. or other non-public roads that provide access to parcels of land, or provide access for harvesting purposes (including turf or seaweed) for two or more persons.</p><p>Funding of &euro;15m has been earmarked for the 2018 Town and Village Renewal Scheme.  Local Authorities are required to advertise for expressions of interest from towns and villages in their area and proposals from a group may be considered if the application displays a strong economic benefit to the community. The deadline for the submission of applications to the Department by Local Authorities is 30 June 2018. </p><p>The LEADER programme provides funding assistance to address the challenges facing rural areas over the course of the programme period, particularly under the themes of economic development and social inclusion. Applications from various groups for funding can be made directly to the relevant Local Action Groups. Promoters interested in accessing assistance under the LEADER Programme should, in the first instance, submit an Expression of Interest to their Local Action Group (LAG)</p><p>The Department also has lead responsibility for developing the relationship between the State and community and voluntary sector. The Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO) provides multi-annual funding towards core costs of national organisations in the sector, with a focus on organisations that provide supports to those who are disadvantaged. The current three-year scheme runs to 30 June 2019, and all funding has been fully allocated for 2018. </p><p>Further information for potential applicants on these and all other funding programmes and schemes is available on my Department's website<i>www.drcd.gov.ie</i></p></reply>

Its remit is to make recommendations regarding the national minimum wage, ensuring that all decisions are evidence based, fair and sustainable, and do not create significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness.</p>  <p>  The National Minimum Wage Act 2015 also allows the Commission to examine and report its views and recommendations on other matters, related generally to the functions of the Commission under the Act, as may be requested of it from time to time.  In this context, in order to obtain a better understanding of the impact of the NMW on younger people the Commission was asked in 2016 to examine the sub-minima (special youth and trainee) rates of the NMW. </p>  <p>  The Commission undertook a public consultation process and commissioned research from the ESRI on the use of sub-minima youth rates both in Ireland and internationally.  The Commission was also instrumental in the development by the CSO of National Minimum Wage specific data, through the addition of a question on National Minimum Wage for the first time to the CSO&rsquo;s Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS), now the Labour Force Survey in 2016.  This data shows that the numbers in employment on age-based rates are very low: an average of just 1.5% of all employees (22,500) reported earning less than the &ldquo;adult rate&rdquo; of the NMW in 2017, and around a quarter to one-third of these reported being on age-based rates. </p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission submitted its report on sub-minima rates to me in December 2017.  It concluded that there is little evidence of any significant abuse of the youth rates.  The Commission&rsquo;s recommendations with regard to the age-based and first employment rates were that these rates should be retained, but on a simplified basis to improve both compliance and the ease of operation. </p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s report considered the abolition of youth rates but concluded that the rates would then no longer give any recognition to the difference between a young inexperienced worker and a more experienced colleague, which could lead to employers no longer seeing a value in hiring young people (and potentially impact on youth employment rates).  </p>  <p>  The Commission also concluded that abolishing youth rates could potentially act as an incentive for young people to leave education and take up employment, which could have a negative impact on their long-term prospects.</p>  <p>  I accepted the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission, and Government gave its approval to my proposals regarding their implementation in February this year.  The necessary amendments to the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 are being implemented in the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and were uncontested and unanimously accepted with cross-party support at Committee stage in the D&aacute;il in mid-May.  The Bill will be progressing to Report Stage later this month. </p>  <p>  The remit of the Low Pay Commission as it is currently set out in legislation covers all employees in receipt of the NMW, younger and older workers alike (with certain exceptions, including apprentices and close family members).  The remit of the Commission therefore already covers young people.</p></reply>

In this context, the Government determined that work should commence on modernisation of the voter registration process to effect improvements in the registration of voters, which would also facilitate the registration of voters resident outside the State in the event of an extension of the franchise being approved by the people in a referendum.</p>  <p>  While the current registration system has served us well, I acknowledge that there is work to be done to modernise the registration process and to make it more streamlined and accessible for electors.  We need to ensure, on the one hand, that everyone entitled to be on the register is registered and that their information is accurate, and on the other hand, that appropriate measures are in place to counteract any possible abuses.</p>  <p>  Work on scoping potential improvements to the electoral registration process, including proposals such as online registration, is now underway in my Department.  This work is looking at, among other things, proposals made by the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht in its report of the consultation on the proposed Electoral Commission in 2016. </p>  <p>  Conscious of the importance of the register and its role in our democracy and the need to ensure security and integrity are key priorities for any changes being considered, the process being planned is expected to take 2-3 years to complete.  This will include a significant consultation element at an early stage, currently anticipated in the Autumn, which will offer an opportunity to all relevant stakeholders and the public to contribute.  </p></reply>

The intention was that this investment would be off-balance sheet and in Budget 2015, the Government announced that &euro;400m of public investment would be made available, including the proceeds from the sale of Bord G&aacute;is, to provide 2,000 homes.  The objective was that this investment could leverage private sector finance from the EIB, ISIF, pension funds, credit unions and other financial institutions.</p><p>A structured, formal process was put in place to facilitate engagement with these bodies.  A body called the <i>Social Housing Investment Proposals Clearing House Group</i><b><i></i></b>was established to examine and consider proposals and to meet with the companies, groups and institutions involved. However, despite a detailed investigation of options to use the available funding in this way, including a high level of engagement with potential social housing providers and potential financiers of social housing, no new model that would, of itself, be capable of providing and/or financing social housing on an off-balance sheet basis could be identified that would be capable of utilising the available funding.</p><p>In response to this outcome, it was decided to modify the original commitment in relation to the &euro;400m funding to provide &euro;10m per annum, indexed for inflation, over a longer period (20 years), which could be used to secure the development of a pilot affordable rental scheme, as envisaged in <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>.  Provision was made for &euro;10 million to be allocated to my Department's Vote in 2017.</p><p>Furthermore and taking account of the work and analysis of the Clearing House Group, it was considered that it would be more constructive to use the existing social housing funding and support mechanisms and, where appropriate, make adjustments to those mechanisms, in order to provide a framework with more realistic prospects of harnessing private investment in an off-balance sheet manner.</p><p>This approach resulted in the design of an alternative delivery mechanism, the Enhanced Long-term Leasing Social Housing Scheme, which was launched on 31 January 2018.  Funding is in place to support the delivery of this new scheme and the principal objective of the scheme is to encourage larger levels of private investment in social housing, while ensuring that the resulting leasing arrangement is off-balance sheet in respect of Government expenditure.  The scheme is targeted at new build or new to the market properties to be delivered at scale and will complement the existing long-term leasing arrangements, which will continue to be available for leasing existing properties.</p><p>In respect of the commitment to develop an affordable rental model, this is now being progressed through an initial pilot project in Dublin, based on a cost rental model, where local authorities can release the value of their land, and also access funding for enabling infrastructure, to reduce the construction costs of providing such rental units and facilitate the delivery of the optimal number of affordable homes to rent for low- to moderate-income households, as part of mixed-tenure developments.  Lands held by local authorities, particularly in urban areas where there are high rental costs and significant housing demand, are being identified for cost rental projects, including a large-scale cost rental site in Dublin city, details of which I expect to announce shortly.</p></reply>

Under the Act, planning authorities are required to establish a register of vacant sites in their areas, beginning on 1 January 2017.  Planning authorities have issued notices to owners of vacant sites by 1 June this year in respect of vacant sites included on their respective registers on 1 January 2018, indicating that the levy will apply to those sites on 1 January 2019. </p>  <p>  My Department does not maintain a central register of vacant sites as each local authority administers the vacant site register in respect of their functional area.  As provided for under the Act, the register in respect of each local authority is available for inspection at its offices and online on its website. </p>  <p>  On foot of a recent review of the on-line vacant site registers across all local authority areas, I understand that there are collectively approximately 230 individual sites currently on the local registers.  Of these, just under 190 sites were entered on the local vacant site registers on 1 January 2018 and will therefore be subject to the levy in 2019, unless development works are activated in the interim. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor implementation of the levy to ensure that it is being fully used, in line with its intended purpose of incentivising the development of vacant or under-utilised sites in urban areas and so that the full potential of the measure can be realised.</p></reply>

Therefore, the Government has taken significant action to increase housing supply through the <i>Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>.  This is having a significant impact, particularly for those on lowest incomes, with nearly 26,000 households having their social housing needs met in 2017.</p><p>More generally and in order to increase overall house-building at scale, a suite of actions is underway, including, for example, actions to fund infrastructure, streamline planning, and reduce building costs.  There is evidence that these measures are working with housing planning permissions and commencements growing by 27% and 23% respectively, year on year as evidenced in the most recent Monthly Housing Activity Report, which can be accessed at the following .</p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring that housing is affordable for households on low to moderate incomes. Recognising that people want a choice of affordable purchase and rental, depending on their stage of life and circumstances, we are progressing both through a range of initiatives.  </p><p>I announced new measures in January specifically targeted at delivering more affordable homes to households generally with maximum income of &euro;50,000 for single applicants and &euro;75,000 for joint applicants.  Based on initial estimates, the initiatives have the potential to deliver some 4,000 new affordable homes to buy or rent, with a target delivery of at least 10,000 new affordable homes in the medium to long term.  The emphasis initially will be on delivering affordable homes from the public land bank, particularly in urban areas where affordability issues are greatest. </p><p>Already, proposals for a number of large mixed-tenure projects, that will include affordable homes, are progressing for local authority sites in Dublin, including Kilcarberry in Clondalkin, as well as O'Devaney Gardens and Oscar Traynor Road in the Dublin City Council area. These sites can accommodate 2,000 to 2,500 new homes.  I also expect to announce a major cost rental project on a Dublin site shortly. </p><p>Finally, to support local authorities, I have secured additional funding for enabling infrastructure which will facilitate affordable housing provision, and I expect to issue a call for proposals for this funding to local authorities very shortly.</p></reply>

Harnessing the off-balance sheet potential of private investment in social housing is an important objective of the Government and the social housing targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland over the period to 2021 reflect the ambition in that regard. </p><p>Of the 50,000 social housing homes to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland, 10,000 are targeted to be leased by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) under leasing arrangements from a range of different sources, including 3,500 homes targeted using the Repair and Lease Scheme (RLS), and 6,500 homes using a  combination of the existing social housing leasing arrangements, and the new Enhanced Lease Scheme.  All homes delivered under leasing arrangements, including a new Enhanced Leasing Scheme, will be funded under the Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP).  </p><p>It is intended that up to 2,000 units will be leased by Local Authorities in 2018 through a combination of the existing Long Term Leasing arrangements, the Repair and Leasing Scheme and the new Enhanced Leasing Scheme.</p><p>The new Enhanced Leasing Scheme has been developed by my Department, together with the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), the Housing Agency and local authorities, in order to harness the potential of private sector interest in social housing delivery in a new set of long-term leasing arrangements, in a manner designed to leverage off-balance sheet funding opportunities in accordance with Rebuilding Ireland objectives.  The new Scheme is targeted at new build or new to the market properties to be delivered at scale and will complement the existing long-term leasing arrangements, which will continue to be available.  There are, however, a number of key differences between the existing long term lease and the enhanced lease, the purpose of which is to facilitate larger levels of private investment in social housing while ensuring that the capital investment is off balance sheet in respect of Government expenditure. </p><p>The scheme will be governed by my Department and operated by local authorities.  The Housing Agency will manage and administer the scheme on behalf of my Department and will act as a national co-ordinator. </p><p>A call for proposals was launched on 31 January 2018 and the Housing Agency accepted submissions from interested parties until 12 April 2018.  All proposals are subject to a range of criteria as set out in the &ldquo;Calls for Proposals for Enhanced Long Term Social Housing Leasing Scheme&rdquo; and the proposals will be assessed and marked in accordance with the terms set out therein.  The Call for Proposals is available on the Housing Agency website at the following .</p><p>A total of 33 submissions were received from interested parties which represents strong interest from the market. The Housing Agency is currently reviewing the proposals and will complete the initial review process in the coming weeks.  Of those assessed, 14 proposals were returned on the grounds that they did not meet certain minimum qualifying criteria, 4 proposals did not pass suitability or appropriateness tests and 1 proposal has been deemed withdrawn.  The remaining 14 proposals are still in the assessment process or awaiting further information. </p><p>Detailed information with respect to the numbers and locations of the units proposed for leasing under the Scheme will only be available once the individual proposals have been assessed, marked and accepted in accordance with the terms and methodology set out in the Calls for Proposals document and the respective Local Authorities have signed any Agreements for Lease arising.</p></reply>

As such, in general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, the homeowner, the builder, the developer and/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme. </p><p>It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including the multi-unit residential buildings referred to, nor does it have a budget for such matters.  </p><p>However, in August 2017, my Department published a Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings,which is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern.  The Framework will also be of assistance to professional advisors, both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations.</p><p>Where apartment buildings that are non-compliant with building regulations or defective from a fire safety perspective come to the attention of the local authority fire services, they work with management companies and other stakeholders to ensure that appropriate levels of fire safety are achieved to minimise the probability of life loss. Actions are taken on a case by case fire safety assessment.</p><p>In addition, in response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy and in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety, the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in my Department was tasked with co-ordinating a high-level Task Force to lead a re-appraisal of fire safety in Ireland.  The Task Force's report, which was published recently and is available at the following .<i></i></p><p>It makes a number of recommendations in relation to fire safety in apartment buildings, including;</p><p>- the registration of fire stopping sub-contractors;</p><p>- the roles and responsibilities of Building Management Companies e.g. to review and maintain fire safety arrangements, to keep a Fire Safety Register, to advise residents on what to do in the event of a fire alarm (in particular the evacuation arrangements); and</p><p>- that local authority Fire Services should offer training to Building Management Companies on key life safety issues.</p><p>In addition, my Department has embarked on a three pronged Building Control Reform Agenda, including: </p><p>- Amendments to the Building Control Regulations; </p><p>- Establishment of a shared services National Building Control Management Project; and </p><p>-The development of new legislation through the Building Control (Construction Industry Register Ireland) Bill 2007.</p><p>These reforms have already brought and, through their full implementation, will continue to bring a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects, creating an enhanced culture of and focus on compliance with the Building Regulations.</p></reply>

I asked the Task Force to oversee and report on this initial action, as well as, among other things, reviewing existing arrangements and systems for fire safety and related issues which impact on fire safety in Ireland.</p><p>The work of the Task Force has now been completed and it has provided me with a full report, titled &ldquo;<i>Fire Safety in Ireland: Report of the Fire Safety Task Force</i>&rdquo;, which describes its work, its conclusions on the state of fire safety in Ireland and its recommendations for moving forward.  </p><p>With regard to the review of multi-storey, multi-unit social housing, local authorities were directed to examine fire detection and alarm systems, emergency lighting systems, common escape routes, including corridors, stairways and emergency exits, and to ensure that such systems were both in place and fully functional.  The assessment by local authorities of the fire safety measures in their existing multi-storey, multi-unit social housing is considered to be a comprehensive exercise and provides considerable reassurance of the standard of fire safety within this profile of social housing stock.  This local authority survey examined fire safety arrangements in 1,227 buildings with more than 16,000 residential units.  Almost 95% of buildings covered by this review were found to have appropriate facilities, and the assessment process resulted in improvement works where necessary, underlining that local authorities are engaged fully on their fire safety responsibilities towards those who rely on social housing.</p><p>By identifying a small number of buildings where upgrade works were required to early warning systems and through engaging with Approved Housing Bodies and owners of private buildings leased in full by the local authority, the review process undertaken is seen to have had a positive effect and to have made contributions to both enhancing fire safety in multi-storey, multi-unit social housing and also raising fire safety awareness among owners/ landlords with statutory fire safety responsibilities.</p><p>However, the devastating fire at Grenfell Tower highlights the critical importance of fire safety in residential accommodation and the need for sustained vigilance in this regard.  As such, it is considered appropriate by the Task Force that fire safety in these buildings would be subject to regular and consistent review and it has recommended that a review exercise of the type undertaken in 2017 should be undertaken and reported every five years.</p><p>I have accepted the Task Force&rsquo;s recommendations and its report was brought to Government on 6 June 2018.  I have now mandated the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management to oversee and report on the implementation of the relevant recommendations.</p><p>Copies of both the Report and the Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links:</p></reply>

ANIAR Ecology were appointed by my Department to undertake the review following a public tendering process.    My Department is expecting a final report from the consultants shortly and following consideration of the draft report by my Department the final report will be published.   </p>  <p>  An interim report was received from the consultants in April this year which included recommendations in respect of the derogation process including in relation to the 2018/19 declarations.</p>  <p>  I am arranging for a copy of the documents referred to by the Deputy in relation to the renewal of the declarations for the period commencing 1 May 2018 to be sent to her together with a copy of the consultants&rsquo; interim report which will also be published on the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department.
