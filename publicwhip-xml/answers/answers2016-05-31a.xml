Supplementing this Exchequer-funded investment with investment from the wider semi-state sector (&euro;14.5 billion), and PPPs (&euro;500 million), brings total state investment to &euro;42 billion over the period.  Capital investment increased from &euro;3.6bn in 2015 to almost &euro;4bn in 2016.  Based on the most recent figures published in the April 2016 Stability Programme Update Capital investment is projected to increase by 3.7% in 2016.  This level of investment represents a forecast average of about 3.2% of GNP per annum over the period of the Plan.  </p><p>The scale and profile of the Exchequer component of the Capital Plan published in 2015 was developed following a strategic review of infrastructural requirements and with reference to the Government's medium term economic growth forecasts, while also ensuring that it was fully consistent with both our national and European fiscal rules.</p><p>The<i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>commits to a review of Government priorities within the capital plan as published, in the context of the Mid term review to be undertaken by mid 2017.  This Review will also provide the Government with an opportunity to consider the scope for increased levels of investment, consistent with the fiscal rules.  However, the Programme already provides for the Government to propose Oireachtas approval for a cumulative, additional &euro;4billion in exchequer capital investment up to 2021 in the areas of transport, broadband, education, health and flood defences, to accelerate delivery of priority infrastructure requirements.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-31a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016053100049#WRA01000"><p>The Moratorium on the Recruitment in the Public Service no longer applies.  It was formally brought to an end last year.  In 2015, public service numbers increased by more than 8,500 and so far this year, public service numbers have increased by more than 2,000.  It is important to note that the increases recorded in 2016 are largely a result of Budget-day decisions to provide funding for more than 2,200 new teachers, 600 more Garda&iacute;, and increased medical and health care staff in the health service.  </p><p>In terms of employment control measures, all Government departments are now operating under new delegated staff management arrangements, which allows them to hire staff as needed, within the expenditure ceilings proposed by Government and voted on by the D&aacute;il.  It is a matter for each department to develop and manage similar delegated arrangements with their agencies.  This new approach provides more local control of recruitment and staff allocation generally, giving managers increased flexibility to respond to service needs.</p><p>Underlying this is a requirement to implement reforms that improve how public services are delivered and that achieve savings which can be reinvested in frontline services.  The Public Service has delivered significant productivity gains and service improvements over the last number of years, as set out in the recently published Annual Progress Report on the Public Service Reform Plan.  We must build on this progress and it is essential that targeted recruitment and investment in public services is carried out in tandem with further reform.  This includes, for example, more digital delivery of services and improved customer service and business processes.</p><p>It is still the case that approval must be sought for additional posts at more senior levels (above Principal Officer level) and for new State bodies.  I have the relevant information about such posts for the Deputy in hard copy, which shows that the number of requests for additional posts, over and above those announced by the Government in the Budget, is less than 100.  The most notable request arising for new State Bodies was the approval for 21 staff for the new Policing Authority, which was established on 1 January this year.</p><p>Up to date information on current staffing levels across the public service is available on my Department's web site at .</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-31a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016053100049#WRA01200"><p>From the period 2009 to 2013 the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Acts introduced pay reduction measures.  These measures, together with the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) implemented in January 2011, are estimated to have resulted in over &euro;2.2bn in direct reductions in public service remuneration and pensions annually. </p>  <p>  The Government has now, through the negotiation and agreement of a financially prudent public service agreement on pay and related issues, provided for a gradual unwinding of the FEMPI measures as they apply to public servants.  The terms of this agreement, the Lansdowne Road Agreement, are being implemented under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015 with effect from 1 January 2016 at a full year cost of &euro;844m to 2018.  Additional provision has also been made for an amelioration of the PSPR  for public service pensioners at an additional full year cost of &euro;90m in 2018.  This approach has also enabled resources to be assigned for the ongoing recruitment of additional front line public service staff such as Garda&iacute;, Teachers and Health professionals to support the delivery of our vital public services.  </p>  <p>  The cost of repealing the remaining FEMPI pay reductions is estimated at some &euro;1.4 billion.</p>  <p>  Under section 12 of the FEMPI Act 2013, I am required to review the necessity of FEMPI legislation annually and cause a written report of my findings to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  In that context, economic  and fiscal progress in the years ahead will determine the scope and timing of the possible further scale-back or elimination of the financial emergency measures.</p></reply>

This culminated in the publication in 2015 of 'Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021', which outlines a &euro;42bn framework for infrastructural investment across Ireland.  The Plan prioritises spending on what were considered to be the areas of greatest need as the economy continues its strong recovery. </p>  <p>  As always, to support traditional procurement, alternative means of funding were also explored which included 'off-balance sheet' methods allowed for under the fiscal rules.  To support the &euro;27bn Exchequer and &euro;14.5bn commercial State sector investment elements of the plan, a new third phase of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) to a value of &euro;500m was announced as part of the capital plan.  The projects chosen for this PPP investment were specifically targeted at addressing priority needs in three areas - education, health and justice - while Phase 2 of the PPP programme announced in Budget 2015 targeted social housing.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to a review of Government priorities within the capital plan in the context of the mid term review to be undertaken by mid 2017.  The programme also provides for the Government to propose Oireachtas approval for a cumulative, additional &euro;4billion in exchequer capital investment up to 2021, in the areas of transport, broadband, education, health and flood defences, to accelerate delivery of infrastructure requirements.  In undertaking the mid-term review of the Capital Plan, my Department will work closely with line Departments to identify the potential for reprioritisation of existing resources and also potential areas to benefit from any additional funding available.  The Government will continue to consider the potential for alternative financing mechanisms including off balance sheet PPPs.   </p>  <p>  The proposed Budgetary Reform Process which I announced with the Minister for Finance last week, also has a very important role to play in contributing to the assessment of capital investment priorities.</p></reply>

Any further consideration of remuneration for any group of public servants, including issues relating to more recently recruited public servants, will fall to be examined within the provisions of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013 -2018 (Lansdowne Road Agreement).  Such arrangements will of course require compliance with provisions of the Lansdowne Road Agreement on the part of the staff interests.  It will also of course have to comply with the terms of the Financial Emergency in the Public Interest Acts 2009 - 2013 (FEMPI), as well as its affordability being underpinned through delivering enhanced work place practices and productivity. </p>  <p>  Under the Lansdowne Road Agreement the process of restoring public pay is commencing.  An important feature of this is the flat rate increase which is being implemented.  This is proportionately more valuable to those early in their careers. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also states that Government will establish a Public Service Pay Commission to examine pay levels across the public service.  The precise structure of such a commission and the technical aspects as to how it would operate have yet to be decided upon and would require broad consultation, including engagement with staff representatives as was committed to in the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  My officials have begun to review international best practice in respect of public service pay determination models.  This will help frame the Government's thinking on how to establish a fair, transparent and accountable process for determining public service pay, taking into account the views of all stakeholders.</p></reply>

In addition, with the encouragement of my Department, the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions have introduced enhanced mechanisms for rigorous examination of claims for fees. </p><p>The work of the Law Offices is, as you are aware, demand-led.  The area has experienced a very significant increase in the work being handled by the Offices in terms of both complexity and size.  However, due to the initiatives outlined above, it has been possible to maintain the overall allocations for counsel fees payable by the Offices at broadly the same level as pertained in 2011.</p><p>In tandem with the reduction of fees to counsel, the Office of Government Procurement in my Department is working on reducing the cost of solicitor services provided for the State.  The Office intends putting in place during 2016 a National Framework for Solicitors Legal Services for Whole of Government.</p><p>This Framework will be underpinned by the following: </p><p>- Improved operational efficiencies and reduced costs; </p><p>- Discipline, continuity and consistency to the provision of legal services;</p><p>- Establishment of a supply base with broad service coverage and improved service quality;</p><p>- A framework structure which has the potential to impact positively on the Irish economy and society.</p><p>The Framework will provide an opportunity for public service bodies to leverage the full buying power of the State in delivering value for money in the legal costs area, reduce risk through standardised terms and conditions, and reduce their own administration costs.</p></reply>

For Budget 2016, the Department produced analysis of the distributional impact of tax measures.  These are contained in the Tax Strategy Group papers and inform the budgetary decision process.  Further distributional analyses in relation to expenditure measures are carried out by my Department and the Department of Social Protection including distributional analysis of Budget measures and social welfare changes. </font></p><p><font color="#181818">Overall, the analysis and transparency of the decision making process has been undergoing constant improvement over recent years and I envisage this continuing.</font></p><p><font color="#181818">In order to facilitate a more comprehensive assessment of the impact of budget measures on household living standards, my Department is currently developing a new Social Impact Assessment (&quot;SIA&quot;) Framework designed to focus on policy areas that cannot easily be incorporated into the existing SWITCH model, for example the impacts of spending on service provision expenditure on recipient households.  The framework aims to complement existing processes with additional information on where Government resources are spent and who the key beneficiaries are.  It is intended to reflect the Programme for Government commitment to develop a process of budget and policy proofing as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights within this framework.</font></p></reply>

Delegation is contingent on Departments remaining with the overall pay ceilings (as agreed at Budget time and voted by the D&aacute;il); on them complying with monthly and quarterly reporting on numbers and pay; and on adherence to workforce planning.  Departments may also institute similar delegated arrangements with agencies or bodies under their aegis.  This new approach provides more local control of recruitment and staff allocation generally, giving managers the means to respond to service needs as they arise</p><p>Under this arrangement then, my Department is no longer directly involved in the direct sanction of recruitment or promotion to posts (up to PO level).  At an overall Budget level however, in both the 2015 and 2016 Budgets, provision was made for additional staff in the Health Sector (including student nurses and interns); more teachers, Special Need Assistants and Resource teachers in the Education sector; and additional Garda&iacute;.  Across the Public Service as a whole, following the lifting of the Moratorium, numbers increased by 8,600 in 2015, and by more than 2,000 so far this year. </p><p>As I have referred to, it is still the case that approval must be sought for posts at more senior levels (above Principal Officer level) and for new State bodies.  The number of such requests, over and above those announced by the Government in the Budget, is less than 50.  The most notable request and approval, in respect of new State bodies, was for 21 staff for the new Policing Authority, which was established on 1 January this year.  In terms of the process for seeking and gaining sanction, it falls to the line Department to make the business case for the additional posts, including outlining the benefits and costs.  Proposals are then examined by my Department with regard to the strength of the business case made and in the context of overall budgetary affordability.</p><p>Up to date information on public service numbers can be found on my Department's website at .</p></reply>

Managing the delivery of public services within budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and their Department, and measures are in place to help ensure that our key fiscal targets continue to be met.  My Department is in regular communication with all Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters.  The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against the published expenditure profiles.  There is regular reporting to Government on these matters, and information is published monthly, as part of the Exchequer Statement.</p>  <p>  The end-April Exchequer returns show that most Departments continue to manage expenditure within profile.  However, these returns provide some indications of areas where there may be some pressures.  As outlined in the analysis of Gross Voted Expenditure published with the Exchequer Returns, Health gross current spending was over profile by &euro;78 million (1.7%) at the end of April.  </p>  <p>  As outlined in the 2016 Stability Programme Update (SPU) it was estimated at that time, on the technical no policy change basis on which the SPU was prepared, that over the course of the year, voted spending pressures amounting to c. &frac14; per cent of GDP could materialise.  Given the potential upside to the revenue projections it is envisaged that additional spending of this level can be accommodated within the fiscal rules. </p>  <p>  In relation to investment in infrastructure, the Programme for Government commits to protecting the existing capital investment plan published in September 2015.  In addition, the Government will look to take advantage of the recent change to the Medium Term Objective, set out in the SPU, to propose a cumulative additional &euro;4 billion in Exchequer capital investment up to 2021.  The specific areas to be targeted for additional capital investment will be outlined following the mid-term review of the Capital Plan which, as outlined in the Programme for Government, is expected in mid-2017.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Programme for Government sets out certain priorities for the first 100 days of the Government.

This will allow expenditure to be increased to meet the additional costs arising from an ageing and growing population and to provide for targeted improvements in public services.</font></p><p><font color="#181818">The Programme for Government recognises that economic and social progress go hand in hand.  Only a strong economy supporting people at work can pay for the services needed to create a fair society.  The Programme for Government, therefore, sets out a clear strategy for increasing spending in a sustainable way built on stable revenues.  A key focus of the Government is on providing the best environment for job creation.  Much progress has been made in recent years with significant growth in the numbers at work.  Unemployment has fallen from a peak of over 15% to a seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for April this year of 7.9%.  The Government's ambition is to help create 200,000 new jobs by 2020, including 135,000 outside of Dublin. </font></p><p><font color="#181818">When comparing investment in public services relative to the rest of the European Union, account needs to be taken of the impact the economic crisis had on the public finances.  In addition, the Deputy will also be aware that the basis for the comparison can have a significant impact.  Expenditure compared against GDP, GNP or a hybrid of the two may give different results and, given Ireland's relatively young population, adjusting for the demographic profile of the population can also impact on the comparisons.</font></p></reply>

There has also been successful recruitment to civil service entry level and senior grades.  Overall public service numbers have increased by just over 12,000 with the largest increases in the Health and Education sector.  Actual recruitment levels would be higher in order to cover replacement demand (retirements and leavers). </font></p><p><font color="#181818">With the improving economy and job market and where the public service is competing nationally or internationally for specialist skills, we will continue to review issues that may inhibit recruitment into the public service.  In conjunction with the wider public service, my Department will continue to provide solutions to recruitment issues, where that is necessary to ensure the public service remains an attractive option for job seekers, and while being mindful of the necessity to secure fair value for the tax payer.</font></p></reply>

In this regard, the Programme commits that the new Government will propose Oireachtas approval for a cumulative, additional &euro;4billion in exchequer capital investment up to 2021. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also states that following the publication of the Expert Group report on the Future Funding of the Higher Education Sector, the Government proposes that the relevant cross party Oireachtas Committee review its recommendations and outline a proposed funding plan for this sector.

In that respect I do not see that a unilateral initiative from Ireland would be appropriate in this case, not least given the fact that this is a delicate situation involving the borders between two other Member States.  We also need to bear in mind that a defining characteristic of the people camped in Calais has been their very strong desire to go to the UK as their ultimate destination and that this is unlikely to change.  Persons who are currently in another EU Member State, including those in the camps in Calais, and who are in need of international protection, are entitled to make an application for asylum in that country, should they wish to do so.</p>  <p>  I share the concerns in relation to unaccompanied minors as an especially vulnerable group and expect this issue to remain high on the agenda at EU level.  As regards unaccompanied minors in the State, statutory responsibility for the care of unaccompanied minors in Ireland rests with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  The EU Relocation Programme, under which applicants for asylum in Greece and Italy are relocated to other EU Member States to have their asylum applications processed there, does provide for an intake of some unaccompanied minors from refugee camps in Greece and Italy.  Officials of the Department of Justice and Equality are in preliminary discussions with Tusla with a view to the State taking in unaccompanied minors under this programme.</p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the Red Cross regarding pledges of accommodation and other supports made by members of the public to assist those coming to Ireland under the Resettlement and Relocation Programmes.</p></reply>

The cause of death is determined by a jury on the basis of the information presented to the Coroner&rsquo;s Court.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has confirmed that there were 3 deaths determined as being death by suicide in 2009, and 3 deaths determined as death by suicide in 2010.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has also advised that the numbers of persons who died in its custody in the period from 2011 to date is 43.  There are a number of inquests pending and the cause of death is therefore not available in all cases.  The Irish Prison Service has confirmed the following:</p>  <p>  -  There were 6 deaths in custody in 2011, 1 was determined as being a death by suicide, 4 as death by misadventure, and 1 was a narrative verdict in accordance with the medical evidence given to the Coroners Court.</p>  <p>  -  There were 5 deaths in custody in 2012, 2 were determined as being death by suicide, 1 as being a death by misadventure, 1 was an open verdict, and 1 inquest is pending.</p>  <p>  -  There were 9 deaths in custody in 2013, 2 were determined as being a death by suicide, 1 as a death by misadventure, 2 from natural causes, 1 was an open verdict, and 3 inquests are pending.</p>  <p>  -  There were 8 deaths in custody in 2014, 2 were determined as being a death by suicide, 1 as a death by misadventure, 1 was from natural causes, 1 was an open verdict, 1 was a narrative verdict in accordance with the medical evidence given to the Coroners Court, and 2 inquests are pending.</p>  <p>  -  There were 14 deaths in custody in 2015, of which 1 has been determined as an open verdict, and 13 inquests are pending.</p>  <p>  -  There has been one death in custody to date in 2016, this inquest is still pending.</p>  <p>  The circumstances of each death in custody and incident of self-harm are examined by a suicide prevention group in each institution.  The groups are chaired by the Prison Governor, and include representatives from the various services, including the Prison Doctor, Psychiatry, Psychology, Chaplaincy, Probation, Education, and Prison staff.  The Groups are required to meet quarterly, or more often if necessary.  Their examinations fully cover the background and circumstances of each death.  Their objective is to identify, where possible, measures which might be implemented to contribute to a reduction in the risk of deaths in the future.  In addition, the National Suicide and Harm Prevention Steering Group chaired by the Director General, Irish Prison Service, provides a forum for collating the reports of the local Suicide Prevention Committees and disseminating significant findings throughout the prison system. </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has also advised that a comprehensive training programme in Mental Health Awareness is being delivered to all staff within the prison service to deal with persons in custody who present with mental health difficulties.</p>  <p>  All prisoners on committal to prison, receive a comprehensive health assessment which includes a risk assessment for mental health issues.  Management interventions to ensure the prisoners safety including recommendations on accommodation within the prison, observation levels to be conducted on the prisoner, increased healthcare inputs, and any other specific measures that may be appropriate are implemented to reduce the risk in individual cases.  In such cases, further assessments are undertaken by the in-reach mental health services, and a multi-agency approach to deal with prisoners needs.  Where appropriate, prisoners are kept under review by both the local healthcare team and the in-reach mental health specialists, and are reviewed at a weekly multi-agency meeting.</p></reply>

The rollout of enhanced security measures has made it more difficult for prisoners and visitors to secrete contraband and improvised weapons.  </p>  <p>  The Operational Support Group (OSG) has prison officers assigned across its three areas, the Security Screening Unit, the Canine Unit and the Operational Support Unit, which have responsibility for scanning equipment such as airport style walk through detectors.  X-ray scanners are also provided to each closed prison and all hand bags, briefcases, packages, coats etc. are subject to screening.  Stricter searching is carried out on all persons committed to custody and prisoners returning from court, temporary release, after visits or on receipt of intelligence.</p>  <p>  Other existing security measures include the installation of nets over exercise yards to prevent access to contraband items, including mobile phones and drugs, use of phone detectors and blocking technology, the introduction of hand held metal detectors and the introduction of Body Orifice Security Scanner (BOSS) Chairs which are used to scan all prisoners for metal secreted in their body cavities.  In addition the introduction of booked visits, greater use of screened visits; greater vigilance in examining mail by prison censors and searching of other items entering the prison also contribute to preventing the entry of contraband into prisons. </p>  <p>  Prisoners identified as exerting undue influence or pressure over other prisoners receive close and continued attention and targeted searching from the Operational Support Group and prisoners identified as threat to good order and security of any prison can be and are removed from normal regime activity.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Irish Prison Service recognises that constant improvements are required in this area.  Additional security measures implemented during 2015 and 2016 were aimed at further enhancing the security of our prisons.  Such measures included the introduction of a new free confidential telephone line in 2015 where prisoner, visitors, staff or members of the public with information on the trafficking of prohibited items into our prisons can pass on that information in the strictest confidence. </p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors, including crime trends, demographics and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure that optimal use is made of Garda resources. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that the deployment of Garda armed units is directed at highly dangerous threats, whether from organised crime or terrorism.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s primary armed special intervention capacity is in the Emergency Response Unit, which forms part of the Special Detective Unit.  The Garda armed response capability is supported by a number of regionally located and deployed Armed Support Units which can provide mobile armed intervention support in extreme incidents in regional locations. </p>  <p>  At the request of the Commissioner earlier this year, the Government moved decisively to strengthen Garda resources to deal with gang-related crime in the Dublin area.  Funding was approved for the establishment of a dedicated Armed Support Unit for the Dublin Metropolitan Region given the identified need to enhance armed support capability in Dublin and to free up the resources of the Emergency Response Unit.  </p>  <p>  The Dublin Armed Support Unit is, as a matter of priority, in the process of being set up and trained and I understand that it will have a complement of some fifty five Garda members.  Steps are also being taken to ensure that the Unit is fully equipped and to upgrade the equipment available to the Emergency Response Unit and the Special Detective Unit. </p></reply>

The literacy curriculum concentrates on the needs of the individual and aims to improve self-esteem and build confidence. </p><p>All prisoners who come into the Education Centre of each prison have an individual interview to assess their educational attainments, needs and interests.  Those with literacy difficulties are identified at this stage and are prioritised for support.  Such prisoners are asked to undertake the Adult Basic Education (ABE) test to assess their literacy levels. </p><p>The Irish Prison Service is currently exploring the feasibility of surveying the prison population using the 8 key competences for lifelong learning as defined by the European Commission. These include literacy and language competence along with mathematical and digital competence.  Expressions of Interest have been sought from Irish Universities to enter into a research partnership with the Irish Prison Service to undertake this survey.</p><p>I can inform the Deputy that the education service in Irish Prisons devotes considerable resources to the provision of basic literacy education for persons in custody.  In conjunction with this professional service the Irish Prison Service facilitates a peer led basic literacy service amongst persons in custody called &ldquo;Toe by Toe&rdquo; where those with poor literacy and/or learning difficulties are mentored by individual volunteers who are also persons in custody but who receive specific training in this regard.</p><p>The Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills on a partnership basis provides the Irish Prison Service with 220 whole time equivalent teaching posts.  I am informed by officials in the Irish Prison Service that many of these educators have completed modular courses in dyslexia, ESOL (  <font color="#2F2F2F">English for Speakers of Other Languages), adult literacy etc, and frequently work with students in prison on a one-to-one basis.</font></p></reply>

The aim of the Education Service is to deliver a high quality, broad, flexible programme of education that helps prisoners cope with their sentence, achieve personal development, prepare for life after release and establish an appetite and capacity for life-long learning. </p><p>Educational services are available at all institutions and are provided in partnership with the Educational Training Boards (ETBs) and a range of other educational agencies.  The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of 220 whole-time teacher equivalents to the prisons through the ETBs in the current academic year 2015/16.  The Service seeks to deliver relevant programmes that cater for holistic needs, ensure broad access and high participation, and prioritise those with basic education needs.  It promotes the principles of adult and community education and supports a multi-disciplinary approach within the prison system. </p><p>Programmes are adapted to take account of the diversity of the prisoner population and the complex nature of prison life, including segregation requirements and high levels of prisoner turnover.  Educational courses and curricula which are based on individuals participating in one or more subject areas for an academic year and then sitting examinations are only appropriate for a small number of prisoners. </p><p>The Junior and Leaving Certificate courses are available but increasing numbers of prisoners require a more flexible curriculum which has multiple entry and exit points that take account of prior educational attainment.  FETAC accreditation is therefore widely used with assessment by portfolio compilation.  All prison Education Centres meet the quality assurance standards demanded by FETAC.</p><p>Organisations who provide in-reach education and complementary roles include Open University, the Samaritans, the Red Cross, Grow, Toe by Toe, Writers and Artists in prison.  Other courses run through the education centres include pre-release programmes, parenting, hairdressing and Alternatives to Violence.</p><p>The Irish Prison Service has recently completed a new joint Education Strategy with the ETBs for the 2016 to 2018 period.  The Strategy encompasses the following broad areas:</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  strategic Action 1: Supporting the Prison Education Service.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  Strategic Action 2: Accredited and Non-Accredited Education and Digitalisation</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  Strategic Action 3: Consultation and Integration</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  Strategic Action 4: Service Quality Benchmarking</font></p><p>I will be launching this Joint Strategy along with the new 3 Year Strategic Plan for the Irish Prison Service next month.</p></reply>

However, as the Deputy will be aware, we have had a dedicated Drug Treatment Court operating in Ireland for some time now.  This is a problem solving court and makes an important contribution, not least as an alternative to prison.  The Drug Treatment Court operates on the basis that a criminal matter has not proceeded to formal conviction and the presiding Judge reviews matters at each adjournment, frequently over an extended period of time, to assess progress, before the matter before the Court is eventually finalised.  The catchment area served by the Drug Treatment Court was significantly expanded in July 2013 to encompass the whole of County Dublin and the programme has also found a way to facilitate participants from outside of Dublin, with participants from Portlaoise and Cork being admitted in 2015.</p>  <p>  Apart from the Drug Treatment Court, courts in Ireland place several thousand defendants every year under the supervision of the Probation Service in the community, either without proceeding to conviction or post-conviction.  Defendants can be placed on Probation Orders or supervised by Probation Officers during deferment of penalty.  Both of these sanctions operate without proceeding to conviction and the defendant can be called back to Court to answer the original matter, if they fail to comply with supervision.  Courts also have a number of other sanctions, incorporating supervision in the community by a Probation Officer, available to them as a post-conviction measure.  These are Community Service Orders, fully suspended sentences with supervision and part-suspended sentence Supervision Orders and post-release Supervision Orders.  Constitutionally, any post-conviction review is not possible.</p>  <p>  My Department has led a Working Group of Justice Sector officials to consider options for moving forward on the proposal to establish a Community Court which is a problem-solving court. Building on the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, the Working Group has been considering proposals to enhance our approach to tackling low level offenders and effectively addressing their offending behaviour through a Community Justice Intervention type programme.  This would be a diversion from the courts system and would build on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Adult Cautioning Scheme which has the potential to respond more effectively to one-off and repeat, low level offending with the emphasis on speedy processing aimed at reducing the risk of re-offending and would also offer quick referral to the necessary services.  Issues such as the format and most appropriate model that would apply to the Irish system are under active consideration in my Department and I anticipate to have more definite details on this initiative in the near future.</p></reply>

It commits the Government to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing in every community, including the most minimal response times possible. </p>  <p>  In support of this objective, the Policing Authority will be asked to oversee a review of, among other things, both the boundaries of Garda districts and the dispersement of Garda stations in rural areas, and in developing urban and suburban areas, with a view to ensuring both an efficient and optimum geographical distribution of stations and minimal response times, including taking account of station closures since 2012.</p>  <p>  Under the Programme, the Government is committed to launching a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.  My officials will shortly be in contact with the Policing Authority with a view to putting in place the necessary arrangements for the review and I will ensure that the outcome of the review is put before the House.</p>  <p>  The Deputies will be aware that some 139 Garda stations were closed on foot of the implementation of the Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme, which was implemented in 2012 and 2013, following the completion by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of a comprehensive review of its district and station network.  As the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources at her disposal, the review was undertaken with the objective of identifying opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation.  It concluded that a revised district and station network commensurate with the organisation&rsquo;s resource base would best meet public demand.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the closures have allowed front line Garda to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility and in a more focused fashion particularly with regard to various targeted police operations. </p>  <p>  I understand that the estimated savings on utilities and maintenance as a result of the closure of each station building is approximately &euro;4,000 per annum giving an estimated total saving to the state of &euro;556,000 per annum.  I am advised that compiling a report in relation to the cost of reopening each and every station closed would involve a disproportionate amount of time and resources.  However, I would stress that the key objective involved when closing Garda stations was to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than to secure modest cash savings.  </p>  <p>  While I welcome the beneficial outcomes that have accrued to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na arising from the Station Rationalisation Programme, the Programme for Government recognises that there is a need for a review along the lines that I have outlined to the House.</p></reply>

A further 31 Syrians are expected to be relocated to the State from Greece during June and another 40 are expected towards the end of July.

After 32 weeks of training, Garda recruits are attested and move on to the first point of the Garda pay scale &euro;23,750 rising to a maximum of &euro;45,793 per annum after 19 years.  They may also qualify for other allowances depending on their assignments.</p>  <p>  The number of members in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as of 31 March was 12,866.  Based on this figure, the year one cost of increasing the strength of the force to 15,000, 15,500 and 16,000 (assuming a commencement date of 1 January) is, I am informed, approximately &euro;41 million, &euro;50 million and &euro;60 million respectively, although increasing Garda numbers to such an extent immediately is not feasible due to the training requirements Garda&iacute; must undergo.  It should be noted that these costs reflect the pre and post attestation payroll costs for the first year.  These figures include Employer's PRSI but exclude any allowances which the recruits may qualify for following attestation.  Moreover the annual cost will obviously increase as the members&rsquo; move up the Garda pay scale each year.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that the cost of training recruits is subsumed into the overall training costs of the Garda College and is not easily identifiable.  However, the total cost of running the Garda College in 2015 was approximately &euro;19m, which includes the salary costs of all College personnel.</p></reply>

Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme for Government, &quot;<font color="#333333">A Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to</font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.</p><p>The Garda College reopened in September 2014 with the first intake of new recruits since 2009.  Since then a total of 700 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 450 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year.  To date  there have been seven  intakes of Garda Trainees to the Garda College, giving a total intake of 700, broken down as follows, 200 in 2014, 350 in 2015 and 150 so far this year.  It is expected that there will be a further intake into the Garda College of 150 trainees next month, with further intakes scheduled for September and November of this year.  This will bring the number of new recruits to 1,150  by the end of 2016.  </p><p>So far 395 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties and are on the ground in communities nationwide.  It is expected that a further 300 trainees will attest by the end of this year which, when taking account of projected retirements, will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark this year.</p><p>We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I will be engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake this year and in coming years.  In accelerating recruitment it is, of course, essential to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to train larger numbers without any diminution in the quality of its excellent Bachelor of Arts in Applied Policing, and to provide appropriate supervision and support to newly qualified Garda&iacute; to ensure that victims, and the public generally, are well served by their policing service.  My officials will be engaging with Garda management and also with the Public Appointments Service as a matter of priority in relation to the preparation of a recruitment plan for the next five years that will deliver increased numbers of Garda&iacute; without any compromise on the quality of those recruited or the training programme.</p></reply>

The contribution payable by a person in receipt of legal aid or advice is set by the Minister for Justice and Equality by way of the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996-2016.  The minimum legal aid contribution was raised from &euro;50 to &euro;130 in September 2013 as a result of a 2013 Legal Aid Board review of the financial eligibility criteria.  Since then the Board has made no further proposals to change the eligibility requirements.</p>  <p>  No contribution is payable in respect of the defence of proceedings brought by the Child and Family Agency under the Child Care Act 1991.  Practically all other cases require the applicant to pay a contribution unless it is fully or partially waived on hardship grounds.</p>  <p>  Based on the number of legal aid certificates issued in 2015, the estimated cost of reducing the minimum contribution from &euro;130 to &euro;100 would be approximately &euro;230,000 in a calendar year.  The estimated cost of reducing the minimum contribution from &euro;130 to &euro;50 would be approximately &euro;605,000 on the same basis.  However, it should be noted that any such reduction would reduce the resources available to the Board and could have a consequential negative impact on service delivery and waiting times.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Review Group recommended that the relevant Departments and agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, should immediately consult in relation to the most appropriate and effective means of targeting this group within the context of current and future resources.  The Irish Youth Justice Service is currently engaged with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the recommendation having regard to the experience of the existing Diversion Programme for persons under eighteen years of age.  The Deputy might wish to note that the existing Diversion Programme is currently the subject of a comprehensive review by a group established by the Garda Commissioner.

An Estimate of &euro;38.963m for the Probation Service is provided in 2016.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, I published the Report of the Penal Policy Review Group on 17 September 2014.  The Report proposes the adoption of a penal policy with the dual purposes of punishment and rehabilitation both in the imposition and management of criminal sanctions.</p>  <p>  The Review Group identified rehabilitation and reintegration as a core principle and significant factor in reducing crime and considers that such aims are best achieved in a non-custodial environment as far as possible.  Prison is not the only solution when it comes to those convicted of lesser non-violent offences.  Re-offending can also be tackled head on by imposing a supervised community sanction, with appropriate supports, which could see punishment being served, but which would also lead, not only to rehabilitation, but to a reduced risk of re-offending.  I have established an implementation group to oversee implementation of these recommendations and to report back to me on a regular basis.  The group is chaired by Dr. Mary Rogan, Associate Professor, School of Law, Trinity College who was a member of the review group.  I expect to receive a report from this group shortly setting out the state of implementation.  It is also my intention to publish this report.</p>  <p>  My Department has also led a Working Group of Justice Sector officials to consider options for moving forward on the proposal to establish a Community Court.  Building on the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, the Working Group has been considering proposals to enhance our approach to tackling low level offenders and effectively addressing their offending behaviour through a Community Justice Intervention type programme.  This would be a diversion from the courts system and would build on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Adult Cautioning Scheme which has the potential to respond more effectively to one-off and repeat, low level offending with the emphasis on speedy processing aimed at reducing the risk of re-offending and would also offer quick referral to the necessary services.  Issues such as the format and most appropriate model that would apply to the Irish system are under active consideration in my Department and I hope to be in a position to outline definite proposals in this regard shortly.</p></reply>

This was In line with recommendations of the Inspector of Prisons to effect changes in regime and culture and to ensure the safe and secure custody of juvenile and young adult offenders.

The Programme has been supported by the reallocation of resources and key personnel from within both services.</p>  <p>  The Programme targets well behaved prisoners serving sentences of between 1 and 8 years imprisonment who are making genuine efforts to desist from reoffending.  Prisoners serving sentences of less than one year are ineligible for Community Return and may instead be considered for release under the Community Support Scheme. Persons serving sentences of over 8 years generally fall within the Parole Board process.  The legislative basis for making decisions on temporary release is fully set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003.

There is currently an average of 15 persons each week awaiting transfer to the CMH.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service, in collaboration with the NFMHS, has established two dedicated areas where high support is provided to vulnerable prisoners with mental illness; D2 wing in Cloverhill Prison (for remand prisoners), and the High Support Unit in Mountjoy (for sentenced prisoners).  Both units provide a dedicated area within the prison where mentally ill and vulnerable prisoners, who present with a risk of harm to self or to others, can be separated from the general prison population and are closely monitored in a safer environment.  The High Support Units have managed vulnerable and mentally ill prisoners in a more effective and humanitarian environment and has resulted in greater access to care and regular reviews by the prison in-reach team.</p>  <p>  A Psychiatric In-reach and Court Liaison Service (PICLS) is delivered by the HSE/CMH at Cloverhill Prison.  The diversion system ensures as far as possible that those people presenting before the courts, or indeed at an earlier stage of the criminal justice system, where the infraction is a reflection of an underlying mental illness, are referred and treated appropriately.  This approach has reduced the number of mentally ill people committed to prison. </p></reply>

This includes access to harm reduction methods, detoxification, stabilisation, and opiate replacement therapies.  These interventions are based on a multi-professional approach to ensure that the prisoner's motivation, commitment and likelihood of success are always at the centre of planned care. </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has advised that the healthcare team which delivers these treatments include GP Specialist Addiction services, Consultant Addiction psychiatrist, specialist addiction nurses, addiction counsellors, addiction links workers, pharmacists, primary care GP's, and prison nurses.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service also works very closely with the Probation Service, community, voluntary, and statutory agencies to maintain a pathway of care ensuring supports remain in place for prisoners on their release from custody.</p>  <p>  All prisoners have access to group and individual counselling services where they can address their own personal requirements, and specific support arrangements can be put in place and implemented during the prisoners period in custody.

The latest cell accommodation census was produced in April this year and showed that on 7 April, 2016 there was 3,782 prisoners in custody and 2,020 (approximately 53%) had access to single cells.</p><p>It is clear, given the current number of prisoners in custody, that the Irish Prison Service is not in a position to provide single cell accommodation to all prisoners at this time.  I can inform the Deputy that all committals are assessed upon arrival to prison.  This assessment process also seeks to ensure that wherever possible, prisoners are accommodated in cells appropriate to their needs. Some prisoners are more suited to multi-occupancy cells, while others are more suited to single-cell occupancy.  It should be borne in mind that in certain cases prisoners are housed together for reasons other than lack of capacity.  Family members and friends often elect for or are assigned a shared cell.  Shared cell accommodation can be very beneficial from a management point of view particularly for those who are vulnerable and at risk of self-harm.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that my officials are concentrating on aligning our prisoner population numbers with the Inspector of Prisons' recommended bed capacity of 3,997 insofar as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system.</p><p>I wish to add that the Director General of the Irish Prison Service accepted the recommendations contained in the Report of the Commission of Investigation into the Death of Gary Douche (commonly referred to as the McMorrow Report).

These programmes offer purposeful activity to those in custody while serving their sentences and encouraging them to lead law abiding lives on release.  These programmes are available in all prisons and all persons in custody are eligible to use the services.</p><p>On committal, including committal for first time offences, all persons in custody are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  Persons in custody may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of 220 whole time teacher equivalents in partnership with the Irish Prison Service through the Education and Training Boards (ETB).  The focus is on providing education which is quality assured, student centred and facilitates lifelong learning through helping those in custody to cope with their sentence, achieve personal development and prepare for life after release.  A broad and flexible curriculum is provided which ranges from basic literacy classes and peer led tutoring to Open University.  There is an increasing focus on QQI (formerly FETAC) accreditation as the modular structure is suitable to the needs of students in prison.</p><p>The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years.  Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), and the Guild of Launders and Cleaners and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled the Irish Prison Service to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification.</p><p>The guiding principles which underpin the prisons' work and training service are to make available work, work-training and other purposeful activities to those in custody.  Training activities are chosen to give as much variety as possible and also to give opportunities for those in prison to acquire practical accredited skills which will help them secure employment on release.</p><p>Each prison also has fully equipped gymnasium that prisoners  access on a structured basis, which plays a significant role in prison life by providing positive outlets for energy.</p><p>It is the aim of the Prison Service to allow prisoners to spend as much time as possible each day out of their cell or room to associate with other prisoners.  Rule 27(3) of the Prison Rules 2007 states &quot;<i>In so far as is practicable, each convicted prisoner should be engaged in authorised structured activity for a period of not less than five hours on each of five days in each week&quot;. </i></p><p>In general prison cells are unlocked at approximately 8.15am each morning for breakfast.  Prisoners collect breakfast and return to cells, which are then locked from 8.45am to 9.15am.  Cells are again unlocked for prisoners to attend work, school , visits and exercise.  Prisoners return for lunch at 12:00pm and cells are locked at 12.30pm.  Afternoon unlock commences at 2.15pm and prisoners return to structured activities in schools, workshops and visits.  Evening tea is served from 4pm and cells are locked from 4.30pm to 5.20pm when evening recreation commences until all cells are locked at 7.30pm.  This allows for total out of cell time of up to 8 hours.</p></reply>

However, the Deputy will appreciate that on occasion, it is necessary for vulnerable prisoners and others to be separated from the general prison population.</p><p>The restriction of a prisoner's regime can occur due to a number of factors including the protection of vulnerable prisoners.  This is provided for under Rule 63 of the Prison Rules 2007.  A prisoner may, either at his/her own request or when the Governor considers it necessary, in so far as is practicable and subject to the maintenance of good order and safe and secure custody, be kept separate from other prisoners who are reasonably likely to cause significant harm to him/her. </p><p>In addition, the Governor may decide, for the maintenance of good order in the prison, to remove a prisoner from general association or structured activity to reduce the negative effect that a prisoner or prisoners may have on the general population.  This is provided for under Rule 62 of the Prison Rules 2007.  There may also be a smaller number of prisoners who would be restricted for medical (Rule 64) or discipline reasons (Rule 67).</p><p>The fact that prisoners seeking protection are immediately separated from the general population or from specific prisoners identified as presenting a threat, clearly demonstrates the commitment of the Irish Prison Service to ensure their safety and security.  The status of each prisoner on a restricted regime is regularly reviewed and they always have interaction and meaningful human contact with staff, chaplains if requested and medical services.  If possible, prisoners can be transferred to other institutions where a restricted regime would not be necessary.</p><p>I am also advised by the Irish Prison Service that a census of restricted regime prisoners is published on a quarterly basis on their website .  The latest restricted regime census was produced in April this year.  </p><p>A group to examine these matters has been set up and is chaired by the Director General. Regular meetings are held and these have helped to focus on and reduce the number of prisoners on 23 hour lock up and to introduce measures to reduce the number of prisoners held on restricted regimes.  Since the introduction of the group, the number of prisoners on 22/23 hour lock up has decreased by 126 or 60% from 211 to 85. </p></reply>

The visiting room now consists of eight round tables with four chairs around each in a warm and colourful environment, prisoners on standard regime have access to this style of visit.  Limerick Prison has also established a &lsquo;family room&rsquo; which is available to prisoners on an enhanced regime. </p>  <p>  Limerick Prison has worked closely with the Irish Prison Service Training College and the Childhood Development Initiative (CDI) in developing and delivering a number of learning and development programmes.  Training have been delivered to over 40 staff to include: (1) 'Front-of-House' training to improve customer service, and increase awareness of the challenges faced by families with a loved one in custody; (2) Family Liaison Officer training to support the prisoners in their role as parents and to co-deliver the Parents Plus parenting course to prisoners; and, (3) Children First awareness training.  Further staff training is planned for the second quarter of 2016. </p>  <p>  The Parents Plus Charity and Childhood Development Initiative have worked with the Irish Prison Service to tailor the &lsquo;Parents Plus&rsquo; parenting programme to meet the need of parents in prison.  Family Liaison Officers in Limerick Prison facilitate parenting skills course for prisoners, and &lsquo;Bedford Row&rsquo; charity works simultaneously to deliver the parenting programme in the community.  This programme has been successfully delivered to 24 prisoners.  A review of the 'Parents Plus' programme by University of Limerick is currently underway which will inform future development.  </p>  <p>  Further small capital projects are underway to enhance visit facilities across the prison estate.  Funding was awarded to St. Vincent de Paul to extend their Visitor Centre facilities to Wheatfield Prison.  The Irish Prison Service has recently allocated funding to appoint a Family Links Coordinator and to extend the Family Links model to Wheatfield Prison in 2016 and Cork Prison in 2017.  This will commence with staff training for Wheatfield Prison staff in Summer 2016 and delivery of the first 'Parents Plus' parenting programme in partnership with Tusla to families in Wheatfield Prison in Autumn 2016.</p></reply>

The terms of reference for the Group included an examination and analysis of the role of penal policy in crime prevention; sentencing policies; alternatives to custody; custodial accommodation and regimes; reintegration and rehabilitation; and any special issues relating to female offenders.</p>  <p>  The Review Group considered those offences for which temporary release is prohibited other than for &ldquo;a grave reason of humanitarian nature&rdquo;.  These concern persons sentenced to the presumptive minimum or mandatory sentence for certain drugs and firearms offences and those convicted of capital murder Section 5, Criminal Justice Act 1990.  Given the seriousness with which society rightly regards crimes of capital murder, the Review Group did not recommend any change in the prohibition of temporary release to this latter category of offender.  It did recommend the removal of the prohibition on temporary release for those in the former category i.e. offenders who receive the presumptive mandatory sentence for a drugs or firearms offence should be removed.</p>  <p>  This matter is being kept under review.</p></reply>

This policy will ensure critical areas are highlighted in prisoner throughcare under six key pillars: Housing/Accommodation Needs, Financial Supports, Healthcare, Public Safety and Statutory Requirements, Families and Personal Relationships, Education, Training and Employment. </p><p>Furthermore, the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service have published a number of Joint Strategies.  These strategies set out how the two Services will work together with other statutory, community and voluntary sector partners to provide a multi-agency approach to offender management and rehabilitation.  While the Prison Service and the Probation Service are two separate entities, the work they do is closely linked and has the same ultimate goal - to reduce re-offending leading to safer communities.  Co-operation and working together is integral to achieving this common goal. </p><p>In addition, I published the Report of the Penal Policy Review Group in September 2014 and subsequently established a Group to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the Review Group. The Group is chaired by Dr. Mary Rogan, Associate Professor, School of Law,Trinity College who was a member of the Review Group.</p><p>The Review Group recommends that there must be greater emphasis, if necessary through legislation, on promoting inter-agency cooperation in the management and rehabilitation of offenders.  Indeed inter-agency and inter-Departmental working is a key theme emerging from the work of the Implementation Oversight Group.  Clearly, the input of other Departments and agencies will be critical to the implementation of the Review Group recommendations. In that context the Implementation Oversight Group organised a Workshop on 8 February 2016 of the key actors in order to discuss the recommendations of the Review Group and advance their implementation. The theme of the workshop was interagency co-operation.</p><p>I expect to receive a report from the Implementation Oversight Group shortly setting out the state of implementation.

In order to achieve this aim the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service have a multi-agency approach involving considerable resources devoted to offender management and rehabilitation from pre- to post-imprisonment in order to reduce re-offending and improve prisoner outcomes.  </p>  <p>  Where the Courts have ordered the post-release supervision of offenders on completion of sentence, or in the case of life-sentenced prisoners released on reviewable conditional release by the Irish Prison Service, prison-based Probation Officers complete appropriate risk assessments to inform future case management.  This case management is undertaken by Probation Officers in the community for the duration of the specified community sanction. </p>  <p>  In addition the Prison Service provide a range of services to prisoners to enhance their chance of successful reintegration. </p>  <p>  The Integrated Sentence Management process is  a prisoner-centred, multi-disciplinary approach to working with prisoners with provision for initial assessment, goal setting and periodic review to measure progress. </p>  <p>  A primary function of the Psychology Service in prisons is to assist offenders address factors that place them at risk of re-offending including emotional regulation, mental health, substance abuse, sexual and violent offending.  The guiding principle which underpins the Prison Education Service and the Prison Work and Training Service is to make available work, work-training, education and other purposeful activities to assist offenders cope with their sentence, achieve personal development and prepare for life after release. </p>  <p>  The Chaplaincy Service provides pastoral and spiritual care to any prisoners who wish to avail of the service.  The Irish Prison Service provides funding to the Irish Association for the Social Integration of Offenders (IASIO) for two operational services, the 'Gate' Service and the Resettlement Service. </p>  <p>  The  'Gaining Access to Training and Employment' (GATE) Service is a vocational service that offers guidance counselling and placement supports to referred prisoners with the overall aim of securing a placement in training or employment post-release.  The Resettlement Service is a primary needs resettlement support service for prisoners with less than 18 months left to serve.  The Resettlement Service provides one-to-one support from the prison to the community.  Since 2007, the Irish Prison Service has engaged Merchant's Quay Ireland to develop and deliver an effective prison-based Addiction Counselling Service. </p>  <p>  Local review meetings are held in prisons on a regular basis where a prisoner&rsquo;s sentence progression is discussed.  They are chaired by the Governor with the attendance of all members of the prison-based multi-disciplinary team.  Elements of these review discussions include the risk of re-offending on release, risk of homelessness on release, and proposed supports pre &ndash; and post- release in the case of prisoners being assessed for early release.</p>  <p>  The Community Return Programme is an incentivised early release scheme co-managed by the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service.  This involves an initiative whereby carefully selected prisoners can be granted reviewable temporary release coupled with a requirement to do community service work in a supervised group setting.  In addition a Community Support Scheme has been introduced to reduce recidivism rates of short-term prisoners by arranging for additional support structures post release and by providing for a more structured form of temporary release.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service are actively engaged with senior management in the Department of Social Protection and Department of Environment with an overall aim of establishing a protocol between departments for the case management of offenders who are at risk of homelessness.</p>  <p>  A new release planning policy for the Irish Prison Service will shortly be put into place and will represent considerable improvements to current pre-release planning and practices in Irish prisons.  This policy will address issues arising for the individual in custody under six key pillars: Housing/Accommodation Needs, Financial Supports, Healthcare, Public Safety and Statutory Requirements, Families &amp;amp; Personal Relationships, Education, Training and Employment.</p></reply>

However the threat posed to the criminal justice process by individuals, terrorist groups and organised criminal groups who seek to intimidate jurors or potential jurors cannot be ignored.  Article 38.3.1&deg; of the Constitution allows for the establishment of special courts in accordance with the law in cases where it is considered that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice.  Section 38 of the Offences against the State Act 1939 provides for the establishment of Special Criminal Courts.  Section 38 of the 1939 Act as amended also provides that the Government may, whenever they consider it necessary or desirable to do so, establish additional Special Criminal Courts as they think fit.  It also provides that whenever two or more Special Criminal Courts are in existence the Government may, if and so often as they think fit, reduce the number of such Courts and abolish those existing Courts that appear to be redundant.</p>  <p>  Given the considerable length of time it takes for cases to come to hearing in the Special Criminal Court, together with the particular types of offences with which the Special Criminal Court is concerned, last year I sought the necessary Government approval to appoint judges to the Second Special Criminal Court, thereby bringing it into existence.  The second Special Criminal Court became operational on 25 April 2016 and sat for the first time on 6 May 2016.  Prior to the first sitting of Second Special Criminal Court, the waiting time for the hearing of cases, indicated to be ready for trial, was 24 months.  This has now been reduced to 18 months and, as the two Special Criminal Courts continue to sit, the waiting times will continue to reduce.</p>  <p>  The establishment of a Second Special Criminal Court does not necessarily mean that more cases will be referred to the Special Criminal Courts but that cases will be dealt with more quickly.  The Deputy will be aware that the decision as to whether a particular case will be prosecuted before the Special Criminal Court is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions who is, by law, independent of the Government.  There have been calls for the abolition of the Special Criminal Court, including by the United Nations Human Rights Committee, but the Government is not prepared to consider such a step at this time.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that the Office of the Inspector of Prisons is a statutory independent office established under the Prisons Act, 2007.  All death in custody reports are published on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  The Inspector&rsquo;s investigations and reports are part of a three pronged process &ndash; the other aspects being the investigations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the investigations and Inquests conducted by the Coroners.  I am satisfied that this process ensures that Ireland is in compliance with its national and international obligations regarding deaths in prison custody, and meets the strict criteria laid down by the European Court of Human Rights when interpreting the procedural requirements of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. </p>  <p>  In addition, the circumstances of each death in custody are subject to an internal review process by the suicide prevention group for the prison institution concerned.  This group is chaired by the respective prison Governors, and includes representatives from all the services across the prison estate, including medical, psychology, chaplaincy, probation, education, and prison staff.  The internal review fully covers the background and circumstances of each death in custody, and its objective is to identify any possible measures which may be implemented which can contribute to a reduced risk of deaths in custody in future. </p>  <p>  The Internal Review Reports are considered by the National Suicide and Harm Prevention Steering Group, which is chaired by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service.  The Steering Group then ensures that the relevant findings of those reports are disseminated throughout the prison system.</p>  <p>  In relation to the coroner system, the Coroners Bill 2007 is already under review in my Department at my request, as elements of that Bill have become outdated.  However, changes have already been introduced in relation to an inquest, where the person has died in prison custody or immediately after being in prison custody. Part 6 of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013, which amended the Coroners Act 1962 and the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, provides for  legal aid to be available to the deceased's next of kin so that they can be legally represented at the coroner's inquest where the person has died in, or immediately after being in, State custody.  </p>  <p>  This responds to the importance under the European Convention on Human Rights of ensuring that the next of kin can effectively participate and engage in the inquest process in such cases. </p></reply>

The allocation of dedicated staff in each establishment greatly enhances the effectiveness of the sentence management system and facilitates the growing numbers of prisoners participating in the process.  These 24 Integrated Sentence Management Coordinators are further supported by prison management and the prison-based multi-disciplinary team, which includes the Psychology Service, the Education Service, the Work Training Service, the Chaplaincy Service, the Probation Service, the Resettlement Service, the Addiction Service and the prison Healthcare team.</p>  <p>  Newly committed prisoners with a sentence of greater than one year are eligible to take part in Integrated Sentence Management.  This involves a specific orientation in the delivery of services to prisoners with an emphasis on prisoners taking greater personal responsibility for their own development through active engagement with both specialist and non-specialist services in the prisons.  </p>  <p>  The Integrated Sentence Management process is a prisoner-centred, multi-disciplinary approach to working with prisoners, with provision for initial assessment, goal-setting and periodic review to measure progress.  Important issues such as accommodation, employment and education are addressed to help the prisoner resettle into the community on release and reduce the risk of re-offending. </p>  <p>  Integrated Sentence Management Coordinators are also active participants in sentence planning for certain categories of prisoners serving less than one year, for example, female prisoners, prisoners who have declared their risk of homelessness on release, or prisoners participating in the Community Support Scheme.  The Integrated Sentence Management process has played a key role in the success of the Community Return Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service continues to invest in IT developments to support the Integrated Sentence Management process.  In January 2016, the Irish Prison Service introduced a new central information platform on the Prisoner Information Management System (PIMS) where both Integrated Sentence Management Coordinators and members of the multi-disciplinary team can record a range of information with regard to ongoing sentence management for individual prisoners and raise post-release concerns.  This centralised information-sharing resource will assist prison-based services to improve the transition from custody to the community for offenders with the overall aim of reducing risk to the individual and reducing risk of re-offending post-release. </p>  <p>  The current Integrated Sentence Management policy is currently under review by the Irish Prison Service in order to improve service delivery to individual prisoners.</p></reply>

Under this scheme when an accused has been convicted of an indictable offence confiscation orders can be made against the accused to deprive him or her of the benefits of the crime.   The process to confiscate post conviction under the 1994 Act is based on the civil standard of proof.   </p>  <p>  Of course, the Deputy might have in mind measures that would be more a feature of corporate enforcement law. The law in this regard, most notably the Companies Acts, would fall within the remit of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  </p>  <p>  More generally, the Deputy may also be aware that the area of regulatory enforcement and corporate offences is currently the subject of work being undertaken by the Law Reform Commission which earlier this year published an Issues Paper on the subject for consultation as part of its current work programme.</p></reply>

This prohibition is restated in the International Protection Act 2015 which is expected to be commenced later this year.  The key concern in this regard is that both the asylum process and the wider immigration system would be undermined by giving immigrants who secure entry to the State, on foot of claims to asylum, the same access to employment as immigrants who follow the lawful route to employment.  There is an effective visa and immigration system in place for those who wish to lawfully migrate to the State for employment purposes.  Any change in public policy with regard to 'right to work' would also have to have regard to the unemployment situation pertaining in the State at any given time.  I would point out that the International Protection Act provides for the introduction of a single application procedure for international protection, which is specifically aimed at addressing the length of time persons spend in the protection process.  The new procedure will significantly streamline and speed up the processing of protection applications and will reduce the length of time that persons spend in the Direct Provision system. Preparations for commencement of the single procedure are progressing.</p>  <p>  The Report of the Working Group on Improvements to the Protection Process, including Direct Provision and Supports to Asylum Seekers (McMahon Report), has implications for a number of Government Departments and services.  The 173 recommendations in the Report were taken forward by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.  To date, some 90 of the recommendations have been fully implemented and more than 30 others are in the process of being implemented.  Work on implementing a further number of the recommendations is continuing.  The International Protection Act 2015 responds to 26 of the Report's recommendations.   </p>  <p>  At the end of April 2016 there were 4,486 persons residing in Direct Provision accommodation of which 1,170 were under the age of 18.  The median processing time in respect of asylum decisions taken during the period 1 January 2016 to 30 April 2016 for those in Direct Provision accommodation was 25 months approximately.  This is an improvement of over 3 months on the median processing time applicable over the period 1 January 2015 to 30 April 2016.  In addition, and in line with the recommendations in the Working Group Report, a concerted effort has been made to process cases of those over 5 years in the system.  Of those in this category, the majority either have been granted status and will transition out of the system or have a Deportation Order issued against them and are thus required to remove themselves from the State.  </p>  <p>  In 2015, the total amount paid for direct provision accommodation was &euro;53.143m.  As the Reception and Integration Agency is currently engaged in a tendering process for the provision of services at the seven State owned accommodation centres, it is not considered prudent to provide any further breakdown of the total figure provided at this time.

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources. </p><p>The stations mentioned are part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) South.  The number of Garda&iacute; stationed in Rathfarnham and Tallaght on the 31 March 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, and on the 31 December  2010 to 2015, are set out in the table following.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme for Government, &quot;<font color="#2F2F2F">A Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to</font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the Government of the time introduced a moratorium on recruitment and the four year National Recovery Plan, published in 2010, envisaged a steady reduction in Garda numbers.  Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, a total of 700 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 450 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year.  So far 395 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that 30 newly attested Garda&iacute; have been assigned to the DMR South Garda Division.</p><p>It is expected that a further 300 trainees will attest by the end of this year which, taking account of projected retirements, will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark.  We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I will be engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake this year and in coming years.</p><p><b>Tallaght Garda District Strength</b><table><tr><th>Date.</th><th>Tallaght</th><th>Rathfarnham</th></tr><tr><td>31/03/2016</td><td>177</td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td>31/12/2015</td><td>176</td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>31/12/2014</td><td>170</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>31/12/2013</td><td>174</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>31/12/2012</td><td>188</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>31/12/2011</td><td>194</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>31/12/2010</td><td>199</td><td>76</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Roadmap to Ratification, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, sets out the substantial legislative agenda required for ratification.  We are on track to ratify the Convention within 6 months.</p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015, and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 was passed by the Seanad on 26 January this year.  When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial. </p>  <p>  Work is also under way on drawing up an Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to progress miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification.  It is intended that the Bill will address issues such as the Convention's requirements in relation to reasonable accommodation and deprivation of liberty, as well as removing archaic references in existing legislation relating to mental health.  We intend to publish the General Scheme of the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill shortly.</p></reply>

As part of this Scheme, the Board has established a panel of private solicitors who will provide advice.  A Duty Solicitor will also be present in courthouses ahead of each repossession court list.</p>  <p>  The Board treats applications to review Personal Insolvency Arrangements (PIAs) as a priority.  Where services are provided under the Scheme of Advice and Aid for Home Mortgage Arrears, there is no financial eligibility test to qualify for this service and no contribution payable but again the applicant must satisfy the merits test.</p>  <p>  The position in relation to tenants is that applicants seeking legal services in respect of eviction or ejectment are provided with advice by the Legal Aid Board.  Proceedings of this nature for eviction/ejectment are proceedings that concern rights and interests over land and, as such, may be a designated matter and outside the Board&rsquo;s remit.  While the Board may not be able to issue a certificate allowing for representation in court to defend these proceedings, applicants for legal services in such matters will be offered advice and correspondence and/or negotiations may be entered into on their behalf .</p>  <p>  Legal aid and advice will be provided to assist tenants who claim an entitlement to a tenancy as a family member under Section 9(1) of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act 1982 or on the basis of long occupancy under Section 13 (1) of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act 1980 (as amended by the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act 1994).  Similarly, legal aid and advice may be granted to tenants seeking to fix the terms of a new tenancy under Section 23 of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act 1980 (as amended by the 1994 Act).  Advice will also be given in respect of rights and obligations under the Residential Tenancy (Amendment) Act 2015.</p></reply>

The word "hatred" is defined as "hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the Travelling community or sexual orientation".</p>  <p>  In addition, where criminal offences such as assault, criminal damage, or public order offences are committed against a person based on their race, religion or belief, the offences are prosecuted as generic offences through the wider criminal law.  However, a racist or religious motivation, for example, may be taken into account as an aggravating factor at sentencing. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I have approved a review of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 in the light of reports by civil society, international obligations and the experience of other jurisdictions, given the age of the legislation, the changes in Irish society and the use of the internet and social media since its enactment.  The outcome of this review will inform the case for legislative change.</p></reply>

No. 569 of 2011).  The application fee, stipulated at &euro;175, is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation and a certification fee is payable on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is set at &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of recognised refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil.  </p>  <p>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.  I might also add that following the grant of citizenship it is no longer necessary for the person to register their presence in the State with the Garda National Immigration Bureau which requires the payment of a fee of &euro;300 per registration. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that formal citizenship ceremonies have been introduced at no extra cost to applicants.  These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of dignity and occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship. </p>  <p>  All of the fees payable under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 are kept under ongoing review by my Department; however, there are no plans to reduce or abolish these fees.</p></reply>

I want to assure the Deputy that the new Garda training programme and new supervisory arrangements which are now in place should ensure that, as far as possible, there should be no recurrence of the types of incidents which feature in the O'Higgins report, including the matters raised by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  I understand that under current operational regulations for the Garda&iacute;, the daily performance accountability and learning framework, meetings take place at which incidents occurring in the previous 24 hours are discussed with the District Superintendent or the Inspector on his or her behalf and with Garda&iacute; and supervisors.  Directions and instructions are provided on matters under investigation.  It is a much more collaborative and inclusive reporting and accountability mechanism. In a further recent development, a nominated supervisor is now allocated to all matters under investigation.  Required actions are marked on associated PULSE incidents under investigation and must be attended to by investigating Garda&iacute;.  All incidents are reviewed by managers to ensure all actions and investigations are progressed. </p>  <p>  Since I reopened the Garda College in September 2014, all Garda recruits undertake the new two-year training programme leading to a Bachelor of Arts in Applied Policing, accredited by the University of Limerick.  This programme is the outcome of a comprehensive review of foundation training for entrants to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and exemplifies best practice.  Phase one, which lasts 32 weeks, is based in the Garda College and places a strong emphasis on problem-based learning, with students learning in small groups through engagement with realistic policing scenarios.  Phase two, which lasts for 65 weeks, is primarily based in Garda stations, with appropriate training and development structures in place, including access to a trained tutor Garda and a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who are thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.  During the course of their placement, trainees move through three development stages - assisting their Garda tutors, taking the lead role and being assisted by the tutors, and finally the autonomous stage, in which they are deployed in regular policing activity and work independently within the operational unit.  Over the course of the placement, Garda&iacute; also return to the Garda College for a number of weeks to further enhance their skills in specialist areas, including sexual assault, intelligence-led policing, file preparation and court presentation.  Phase three consists of seven weeks of preparation for final exams and assessments.</p>  <p>  While these new training and supervision arrangements are core to addressing the shortcomings which Mr Justice O'Higgins found, I have asked the Garda Commissioner to examine the Report of the O'Higgins Commission and to indicate to me what further measures might be taken to prevent the type of difficulties outlined in it in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na arising again and her proposals to respond to the  recommendations which are related to the Garda service.  I await the Garda Commissioner's response to the report which is likely to assist with the identification of further measures to ensure that our citizens can enjoy effective policing. </p>  <p>  The Policing Authority received a copy of the report in the context of its statutory role in relation to oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Authority and the Garda Commissioner held their first meeting regarding the Report on 26 May 2016 and further meetings are planned, including two public meetings.</p></reply>

This was an important legislative change, as it introduced a new power for the courts to approve and impose a personal insolvency proposal made by a borrower which has been rejected by the creditors, provided that the judge considers, using criteria set out in s. 115A, that the proposal is fair and reasonable to all concerned. </p><p>Under this provision, an application  for the new court review can be made by an insolvent person who has proposed a personal insolvency arrangement, if the proposal:</p><p>- has been refused by their creditors,</p><p>- includes a mortgage, or other debt, whose payment is secured on the borrower's home (their principal private residence, as defined in the Personal Insolvency Acts),</p><p>- and the borrower was in arrears on that mortgage or other debt on 1 January 2015 (<i>or</i>on that date was in a restructure of such arrears, but remains insolvent.)</p><p>The appropriate Court for hearing the review applications is normally the Circuit Court, where the cases are heard by the specialist personal insolvency judges.  Under the amending Act, all applications to court for this review, and their outcomes, must be notified to the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI).  The ISI has indicated that it intends to publish overall details of the s. 115A applications on a regular basis. </p><p>The new provision was commenced with effect from 20 November 2016, after the necessary changes to the relevant Rules of Court had been put in place. As of 24 May 2016, the ISI advises that 46 review applications to Court have been notified to the ISI.  The courts had decided 5 applications - in 4 of these, the borrower's proposal was approved by the Court, while in 1, it was rejected by the Court.  5 further cases had been withdrawn while 2 had been struck out by consent: these outcomes can result from settlement negotiations between the parties.  34 other applications were before the Courts: in 32 of these, the Court has held an initial hearing but new affidavits or additional material had been requested and adjournments have been given to allow for filing of this material in advance of a full hearing.  The remaining 2 cases were awaiting an initial hearing. </p><p>A further relevant development is the new Scheme of Access to Independent Legal and Financial Advice for Home Mortgage Arrears, which I announced on 22 January and which is expected to come into operation very shortly.  The objective of the Scheme is to ensure that an insolvent borrower at risk of losing his or her home due to mortgage arrears can get the necessary expert advice and help to identify their best option to resolve their financial difficulties.  MABS, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, will act as gateway to the Scheme and will be able to refer the borrower to  a personal insolvency practitioner, solicitor or accountant if needed, without cost to the insolvent borrower and at fixed cost to the Scheme.  The Scheme includes, in particular, a component to ensure that an insolvent borrower can access expert financial assistance and legal aid for seeking the new Court review, where needed.</p></reply>

This provision is restated in the International Protection Act 2015, which is expected to be commenced later this year.  The internationally recognised convention is that persons who are forced to flee their homeland should seek international protection in the first safe haven they encounter.  The concept proposed by the Deputy would appear to suggest that persons would, in effect, select the country they wished to make application for asylum.  This would be contrary to EU law, in particular the Dublin Convention, which provided that persons arriving in the EU must claim asylum in the first Member State they arrive in.</p>  <p>  Ireland remains committed to playing its part in addressing the current migrant crisis facing Europe.  In addition to accepting applications for refugee status from persons who are in or at the frontiers of the State the Government agreed, in September 2015, to establish the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and to accept up to 4,000 persons overall under the EU Resettlement and Relocation Programmes.</p></reply>

In terms of the future development of mortgage insurance, this is a matter that will have to be considered in the context of the Government's overall policy on housing and also in the context of the Central Bank's macro prudential framework for residential mortgage lending.  In that context, in the Programme for a Partnership Government the Government has committed itself to work with the Central Bank, as part of its upcoming review of its mortgage lending limits, to develop a new &quot;Help to Buy&quot; scheme to ensure availability of adequate, affordable mortgage finance or mortgage insurance for first time buyers as new housing output comes on stream.</p></reply>

To ensure sufficient progress towards this objective, annual targets were set for the headline deficit between 2010 and 2015.  The Council Recommendation did not specify annual targets for the structural balance for Ireland, although a cumulative structural improvement over 2011 to 2015 was required.  The 2016 Stability Programme Update, published 27 April, included an estimate that the structural balance improved by 0.9 percentage points (pp) of GDP in 2015.  Outturn data show that Ireland has reduced its headline deficit to 2.3 % of GDP in 2015 (or 1.3 % of GDP on an underlying basis).  On this basis, the European Commission has issued a recommendation for a Council Decision to abrogate Ireland's EDP procedure.</p>  <p>  Following our exit from the EDP, Ireland will be subject to the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  Under the preventive arm, the required minimum pace of structural budgetary adjustment is predetermined on the basis of cyclical conditions in Member States.  In both 2016 and 2017, Ireland is required to deliver an improvement of 0.6pp in the structural balance of GDP, as required under 'normal' cyclical conditions.  These requirements have been set or 'frozen' on the basis of European Commission estimates of the output gap for these years outlined its Spring forecast exercise conducted in 2015 and 2016 respectively.</p>  <p>  On an ex-ante basis, for 2016, my Department projects an improvement in the structural balance of 0.4pp of GDP.  While this is below the required improvement, the deviation of 0.2pp of GDP is not considered significant in the fiscal framework.  Furthermore, on the basis of its analysis contained in its assessment of our Stability Programme Update, the Commission deems Ireland to be compliant in 2016 on an ex-ante basis with the second pillar of assessment considered under the preventive arm the expenditure benchmark.  On a no-policy change basis, as set out in the Stability Programme Update, my Department projects a structural budgetary improvement of 1.2 per cent of GDP for 2017.</p></reply>

This increased the general government expenditure for 2015 on a one-off basis by c.&euro;2.1 billion and worsened the general government deficit for 2015 by about 1% of GDP.  Excluding this one-off transaction, the deficit was 1.3% of GDP.</p>  <p>  Compliance with the expenditure benchmark is calculated by comparing the year-on-year change in general government expenditure, excluding certain items such interest expenditure, and there is no provision for the exclusion of one-off transactions.  As a result, the general government expenditure outturn for 2015 does mean that there is a significant buffer now built into the calculation of Ireland's compliance with the expenditure benchmark in 2016.</p>  <p>  However, as the Deputy is aware, the expenditure benchmark is only one of the two pillars used to assess compliance with the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  The second pillar is the balanced budget rule, which requires a Member State to move towards its medium-term budgetary objective or MTO in accordance with its adjustment path.  The MTO is set in structural terms, which means it excludes the effects of the economic cycle and one-off transactions, such as the AIB transaction in 2015.</p>  <p>  In assessing compliance with the preventive arm of the SGP, the European Commission undertakes an overall assessment based on both pillars.  Given the one-off issue, it is possible that the Commission will place greater emphasis on the structural balance pillar for 2016 and not the expenditure benchmark as would normally be the case.  With regard to 2017, the AIB transaction will have no effect as compliance with the expenditure benchmark will be measured by reference to the level of expenditure in 2016.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that I and my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Pascal Donohoe T.D., will be publishing the Summer Economic Statement on behalf of the Government in mid-June and it will contain updated fiscal forecasts for, inter alia, 2016.</p></reply>

Section 89 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act (CATCA) 2003 provides for 'agricultural relief'.  The relief takes the form of a 90% reduction in the taxable market value of the gifted or inherited agricultural property.  </p>  <p>  The person taking the gift or inheritance (the 'beneficiary') of the agricultural property must qualify as a 'farmer' for the purpose of section 89 CATCA 2003.  This means that a beneficiary's agricultural property must comprise at least 80% by gross market value of the beneficiary's total property at a particular date.  The Revenue Commissioners take the view that land on which a wind turbine is installed is not agricultural property for the purpose of establishing whether or not a beneficiary satisfies this '80%' test.  Thus, depending on the amount of an individual's land that is actually occupied by wind turbines (and not merely subject to an option over the land), the use of agricultural land for wind turbines may result in a beneficiary's failure to satisfy the '80%' test and to qualify for agricultural relief.  </p>  <p>  A condition for agricultural relief that applies in relation to gifts and inheritances taken on or after 1 January 2015 is that a beneficiary, or a lessee where the beneficiary leases the agricultural land, must actually farm the land for a period of at least 6 years after taking the gift or inheritance.  It is unlikely that the ability to farm the land would be affected by the granting of an option over the land to a wind turbine developer or the registration of a burden over the land with the Land Registry.  However, the ability to farm the land would be affected where the option is exercised by the wind turbine developer and a wind turbine is actually installed.  As it would not generally be possible to farm any part of the land occupied by wind turbines, the change in the use of land from farming to the generation of energy within the required 6-year period would result in a withdrawal of some, or all, of any agricultural relief that had been granted, depending on how much of the land is diverted to this alternative use.</p></reply>

Firstly, within the expenditure benchmark pillar of the fiscal rules investment in capital formation is granted favourable treatment.  Within the rules spending on capital formation is smoothed over four years with the result that only one quarter of the increase in investment for capital formation purposes must be funded in the first year from within the fiscal space available under the expenditure benchmark.  This provision demonstrates that the rules are designed to actively promote public investment and capital spending.</p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, the loosening of the medium term budgetary objective (MTO) to which Ireland is subject results in an additional &euro;1.5 billion in fiscal space becoming available once the MTO is achieved.  Taking account of this, together with the benefit of the capital smoothing treatment explained above, the Programme for Government includes a commitment to deliver an additional cumulative &euro;4 billion in capital spending.  We are also leveraging additional funding to invest in the development and construction of housing.  The joint venture fund Activate Capital established by Ireland's Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) is a strong example of such a commitment.</p>  <p>  The second source of flexibility - and that to which the Deputy refers -  is the 'investment clause' provision within the Stability and Growth Pact.  Subject to meeting certain eligibility criteria temporary leniency may be granted with regard to the required pace of structural budgetary adjustment.  The purpose of this is to promote greater spending on investment projects.  Where it can be shown that projects generate increased levels of investment with a major net positive impact on the growth potential of the economy and on the sustainability of the public finances, the need for budgetary adjustment may be temporarily deferred by up to 0.5% of GDP in one year.</p>  <p>  However, the eligibility conditions necessary to invoke this clause are restrictive, requiring the presence of negative real GDP growth or the existence of a negative output gap of at least 1.5 per cent.  On the basis of my Department's current macro-economic outlook, as published in the 2016 Stability Programme Update on 27 April, this condition alone excludes Ireland from applying for the clause at present and for the foreseeable future. </p></reply>

Of course, these are proportionate thresholds and individual banks have a certain flexibility to provide a limited amount of lending at higher LTV thresholds subject to also meeting consumer protection requirements and having satisfying themselves that the consumer borrower is likely to be in a position to meet the obligations of the credit agreement.      </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Central Bank will carry out a review of the current macro prudential rules later this year with publication expected in November.  To that end, the Bank has indicated that the existing rules can be recalibrated if the evidence suggests that such an adjustment would be warranted.  </p>  <p>  However, an overriding primary policy objective in the area of housing is to deliver affordable and sustainable housing and credit markets over the course of the economic cycle and to avoid the boom and bust cycles which we have experienced in the past.  The macro prudential policy framework put in place by the Central Bank is intended to help achieve that objective.  From a financial stability perspective, mortgage insurance needs to effectively transfer risk away from the banking system and from the State in a cost effective way (and to do so without giving rise to stability concerns elsewhere in the financial system) while also operating in the best interest of consumers.  Due to this imperative to effectively transfer risk, I would not see a role for the State in underwriting, or guaranteeing the provision of, mortgage default insurance in relation to high LTV residential mortgages.</p></reply>

The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are accepting and adequate provisioning to meet these risks.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) is to provide a certain minimum level of protection for non-life insurance policyholders should an insurance company go into liquidation.</p>  <p>  The Fund also allows insurance company administrators to apply to the High Court for funding, where necessary, in order to enable them to meet their financial obligations as they arise. </p>  <p>  Section 6 of the Insurance Act 1964 provides that the Central Bank of Ireland has responsibility to carry out an annual assessment of the needs of the Fund and, where it is of the opinion that the state of the Fund is such that financial support should be provided for it, the Bank is allowed to determine an appropriate contribution to be paid to the Fund by each insurer in relation to insured risks in the State.  The Central Bank is independent in this assessment and I, as Minister for Finance, do not have a role in deciding annually on the amount of the levy.  The ICF levy is currently charged as 2% of the aggregate of total gross written premium of each non-life insurer, the maximum level the Central Bank is allowed to set the levy as per Insurance Act 1964.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the levy is charged on the insurance industry and not on individual policyholders and, therefore, it is a matter for each insurance company to decide the amount of the levy, if any, that they wish to pass on the individual policyholder.

It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which comes into operation on 1 July 2016.  The Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears provides protections for borrowers who endeavour to meet their commitments in relation to their mortgages and the 2015 Act ensures that these protections apply when a loan has been sold.  Credit servicing is broadly defined and includes managing or administering repayments under the credit agreement and the process by which a relevant borrower's financial difficulties are addressed.  </p>  <p>  It is a matter for the purchaser of loans to ensure that they comply with all Irish legislation, including the rules relating to credit servicing.  Purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm that is regulated by the Central Bank. </p>  <p>  Requiring pre-approval runs the risk of imposing unnecessary costs on possible purchasers when the credit servicing will be regulated in any case.</p></reply>

Rather NAMA has acquired loans and its role is that of a lender with claims over security for its loans, like a bank, rather than a property owner or lessor.  In that capacity, NAMA holds security over properties that are owned by its debtors or, in the case of enforcement, which are managed on behalf of those debtors by duly appointed insolvency practitioners. </p><p>I am advised that there are approximately 6,000 completed residential properties over which NAMA holds security in relation to its loan portfolio.  99% of these properties are occupied.  The other 1% is frictional vacancy due to tenants relocating as leases roll over and expire.</p><p>I would refer the Deputy to the information provided in my response to Parliamentary Question 115, of 24th May 2016, which outlines the extent of NAMA's involvement in residential properties in County Louth. </p><p>Separately, in relation to County Meath, NAMA has an exposure to approximately 60 residential properties through its loans, comprising 35 apartments, 32 of which are currently occupied, and 27 houses, 23 of which are occupied.  I am advised that similar to County Louth, the unoccupied units represent frictional vacancies as properties are in process of being sold or tenanted.</p><p>NAMA has consistently been mindful of commercially attractive opportunities in the social housing sector and has innovated to combine its commercial priorities with due consideration of ancillary social contributions.  In this regard, I am advised that NAMA has offered 6,635 residential units, which were potentially suitable for social housing, to Local Authorities. </p><p>I am advised that, as of end March 2016, 30 such units were offered in Louth and 235 in Meath.  Demand was confirmed for 27 units in Louth, all of which have been delivered, and there was no demand confirmed for the remaining 3 units.  Of the 235 units offered Meath, demand was confirmed for 63 units, 38 of which have been delivered and 25 of which are being readied for delivery.  I understand that there was no demand confirmed for 60 units, and a further 28 units were not accepted as they would have led to an over concentration of social housing.  I am further advised that the remaining 84 units offered, by NAMA, in Meath were either sold or rented in the private market over the course of their consideration for social housing.</p><p>Determining the take up and suitability of offered properties for social housing purposes rests with the Local Authorities, the Housing Agency and the Approved Housing Bodies.  Where demand is confirmed for a property, NAMA makes whatever funding is needed, more than &euro;100 million to date, to ensure that previously unfinished properties are completed and comply fully with all building standards.  </p><p>While there are no further units currently on offer for social housing in Louth and Meath, I understand that NAMA is currently re-examining the entirely of its remaining portfolio to identify if any additional units may be available to offer to local authorities nationwide.  </p><p>There is extensive information on this initiative on NAMA's website via:. </p></reply>

The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), the new system of financial supervision comprising of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the national competent authorities of participating EU countries, including the Central Bank of Ireland, represents a sea change in advancing financial integration and stability in Europe.</p>  <p>  Under this new system of supervision, the SSM identifies and addresses risks at an early stage and is able to take suitable countermeasures.  The SSM requires banks to give due consideration to a broad range of relevant factors when designing their business models including capital, liquidity, leverage, interconnectedness and systemic significance and structure.  It has led to considerably more and higher-quality capital for banks; new standards for liquidity reserves and indebtedness in banks; and considerably stricter risk management and governance requirements.</p>  <p>  In agreeing the structure of the SSM, EU member states, including Ireland, were satisfied that the exposure of European banks to lending in any sector of the economy is monitored and addressed under this new joint supervisory framework.</p>  <p>  Also, the Eurogroup regularly considers Europe-wide economic and financial matters and discussions have included issues such as emerging risks in the international arena, including fluctuations in the price of oil.  There are also opportunities for similar discussions when I meet with my European ministerial colleagues in the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin).</p>  <p>  Fluctuations in the price of oil is one of the risks monitored by my Department.  As such, we are cognisant of any impacts of such fluctuations on the economy. In addition, my officials regularly meet with their counterparts in the Central Bank to discuss operational matters, including risks faced by the financial sector.  Indeed, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is currently undertaking a Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP) that focuses on the risks and vulnerabilities to the sector, which included extensive discussions between my officials, Central Bank officials and the IMF.

The anti-bullying procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils.</p>  <p>  The anti-bullying procedures make clear that schools also have obligations under equality legislation in relation to the prevention of sexual harassment.  In that regard, the procedures outline that schools are required under equality legislation to take such steps as are reasonably practicable to prevent harassment and sexual harassment.  Equality legislation prohibits harassment on any of the nine grounds: gender including transgender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community.  Under equality legislation, sexual harassment is also prohibited. The anti-bullying procedures make clear that these prohibitions apply to all aspects of school life, for example classrooms, sport fields or school tours and that schools may not permit pupils to harass other pupils.</p>  <p>  The template Anti Bullying Policy contained in the Anti Bullying Procedures also requires the school's board of management to confirm that the school will, in accordance with its obligations under equality legislation, take all such steps that are reasonably practicable to prevent the sexual harassment of pupils or staff or the harassment of pupils or staff on any of the nine grounds specified.</p>  <p>  Schools and school personnel are also required to comply with my Department's "Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools" which are based on the "Children First &ndash; National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2011". The purpose of the procedures is to give direction and guidance to school authorities in the implementation of Children First when dealing with allegations/suspicions of child abuse and neglect.  The child protection procedures recognise that in some cases potentially abusive behaviour occurs between children and schools are required to follow the guidance provided in Children First on the identification of and reporting of such cases.  In accordance with Children First, the procedures for schools require that if school personnel have concerns that children may have been abused or neglected, or are being abused or neglected, or are at risk of abuse or neglect, the matter shall, including where the alleged perpetrator is another child, be reported without delay to the Child and Family Agency.</p>  <p>  The Children First Act 2015 when commenced, will put key elements of Children First on a statutory basis.  The Children First Act, 2015 will require mandatory reporting of child protection concerns by certain key professionals, including registered teachers, and other persons working with children.  The Act will also place an obligation on all organisations which provide services to children, including schools, to undertake a risk assessment and to then prepare a Children Safeguarding Statement which outlines the policies and procedures which are in place to mitigate the risks identified.</p></reply>

Following consideration of their recommendations and consultation with stakeholders on implementation arrangements, an Apprenticeship Implementation Plan was published in June 2014.  A key recommendation of this review was the establishment of an Apprenticeship Council.  The Council was established in November 2014 and its first task was to issue a call for proposals for new apprenticeships from consortia of industry bodies and education and training providers.  Over 80 proposals were received, all of which were evaluated against a set of criteria.</p>  <p>  The Council assigned category 1 status to 25 proposals which were deemed to be at an advanced stage of design, planning and collaboration between education and industry and ready to enter a detailed development phase. The Council is working closely with consortia within this group to develop them into sustainable national apprenticeships.  It is envisaged that up to nine of these will be in a position to move to enrolment in 2016 and that the remainder will be rolled out in 2017.  The Council is also working with the other consortia to ensure that a strong pipeline of new apprenticeships is in place.</p>  <p>  In the Programme for Partnership Government we have committed to double the number of apprenticeships by 2020.  We will target over 100 different apprenticeship schemes spread across sectors of the economy and in every region of Ireland.  The achievement of this ambitious target will require commitment from a number of key stakeholders including the Apprenticeship Council, SOLAS, the ETBs and Industry and is dependent on strong employer demand.</p></reply>

It also operates a payroll for payment of pension to retired school staff.  The number of teachers and other school staff who retired on pension in the years from January 2011 to December 2015 total 7,000 approximately.  The cost of lump sum gratuity payments made to the retiring staff in that period totals circa &euro;691 million.  A breakdown by calendar year of the number of retirees and the gratuity costs is set out in Table 1.</p><p>There are in excess of 26,000 retired teachers and other retired school staff in receipt of pension from my Department.  Expenditure on pension is of the order of &euro;3.4 billion for the above categories for the 5 year period.  A yearly breakdown is set out in Table 2.  It is not possible to readily dis-aggregate the separate pension cost of those who retired in each of the last 5 years.

Resultant vacancies continue to be filled in the normal way.  In addition and notwithstanding budgetary pressures, teacher numbers are increasing due to the on-going and significant increases in demographics at primary and post-primary level.

The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection, local authorities and the Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  The outcome of the latest demographic exercises was that on 17 November 2015, 4 new primary schools and 9 new post-primary schools were announced to open in 2017 and 2018 to cater for increased demographic needs.</p>  <p>  For school planning purposes, the areas of Ongar, Hansfield and Littlepace fall within the Blanchardstown West school planning area.  In relation to these areas, my Department is satisfied that there is sufficient post-primary capacity to cater for the students living in these areas.  The existing two post-primary schools located within this planning area, Hansfield Educate Together Secondary School and Phibblestown Community School, can between them cater for the demand for places in the area.</p>  <p>  In addition, among the 13 new schools (4 primary and 9 post-primary) announced to open in 2017 and 2018 to cater for increased demographic needs, is a new post-primary school which will open in 2017 in the Carpenterstown/Castleknock school planning area, which is adjacent to the Blanchardstown West area.  When fully developed, this school will provide an additional 1,000 pupil places, supplementing provision in the wider area.</p>  <p>  My Department's priority is to ensure that all schools in an area can between them cater for all students seeking a school place. This may, however, result in students not being offered a place in the school of their first choice.  As with other school planning areas nationwide, the demographic data for the area outlined by the Deputy will be kept under ongoing review by my Department to take account of updated enrolment data and capacity increases in this and adjoining school planning areas.</p></reply>

In this regard, patron bodies and prospective patrons applying for the patronage of a new school announced by my Department must collect and demonstrate evidence of parental demand for the model of provision proposed as part of their application under the patronage process.  Expressions of parental preference are not submitted directly to my Department by parents.</p>  <p>  As you may be aware on 26 April 2016 applications were invited for the patronage of nine new post-primary schools to be established, six in 2017 and a further three in 2018.  This included a proposed new school to serve the Carpenterstown/Castleknock area of Dublin 15.</p>  <p>  The closing date for receipt of applications for this process is Wednesday 8 June 2016 and in line with the arrangements referred to above, patrons must submit with their application a parental preference template in which parents have been requested to declare their preference for their child(ren) to be educated through that patron's school model and also their preference with regard to education through the medium of English or Irish.</p>  <p>  Following the closing date, my Department will carry out an analysis and draft a report based on the applications received for the consideration of the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG) which will submit a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.</p>  <p>  I will announce the successful patrons and the language medium of instruction for these new post-primary schools in due course.  All of the relevant information in relation to the post-primary patronage process is available on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection, local authorities and the Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  The outcome of the latest demographic exercises was that on 17 November 2015, it was announced that 4 new primary schools and 9 new post-primary schools will open in 2017 and 2018 to cater for increased demographic needs.</p>  <p>  For school planning purposes, the areas of Ongar and Littlepace fall within the Blanchardstown West school planning area.  In relation to these areas, my Department is satisfied that there is sufficient post-primary capacity to cater for the students living in these areas.  The existing two post-primary schools located within this planning area, Hansfield Educate Together Secondary School and Phibblestown Community School, can between them cater for the demand for places in the area.</p>  <p>  In addition, among the 13 new schools (4 primary and 9 post-primary) announced to open in 2017 and 2018 to cater for increased demographic needs, is a new post-primary school which will open in 2017 in the Carpenterstown/Castleknock school planning area, which is adjacent to the Blanchardstown West area.  When fully developed, this school will provide an additional 1,000 pupil places, supplementing provision in the wider area.</p>  <p>  My Department's priority is to ensure that all schools in an area can between them cater for all students seeking a school place. This may, however, result in students not being offered a place in the school of their first choice.  As with other school planning areas nationwide, the demographic data for the area outlined by the Deputy will be kept under ongoing review by the Department to take account of updated enrolment data and capacity increases in this and adjoining school planning areas.</p></reply>

These changes were incorporated into the Teaching Council's Policy Paper on the Continuum of Teacher Education, which set the criteria for providers of initial teacher education.</p>  <p>  A revision to the registration regulations is required to provide for the recognition of graduates of the 59 reconceptualised programmes of initial teacher education which are accredited by the Council as qualifying persons to teach in Ireland.  The revised regulations will also give effect to changes made in the Teaching Council (Amendment) Act 2015, such as the placing of the garda vetting of new teachers on a statutory footing.  Revised regulations have recently been approved by the Teaching Council and will shortly take effect.</p>  <p>  Further to significant stakeholder engagement following publication of draft revised registration regulations in 2014, the new regulations will provide for persons currently registered with the Council under Regulation 3 on the basis of holding a level 8 Montessori qualification.  The Regulations will also allow for the registration of persons who obtain a level 8 Montessori qualification, where the course is commenced on or before 1 October 2016 and the qualification is obtained before the end of 2021.</p>  <p>  The Department has no plans to change the current position whereby teachers who are registered with a level 8 Montessori qualification under Regulation 3 (or its equivalent in the new regulations) are eligible for employment as teachers of pupils with special education needs in recognized mainstream primary schools and special schools.</p></reply>

Some students choose to participate in educational programmes through further adult educational programmes or in adult settings. </p>  <p>  While the Department of Health and Children/Health Service Executive assumes direct responsibility for young adults with special educational needs who are over 18 years, my Department may allocate funding towards an educational component of such provision so that students can continue to participate in educational programmes through further adult educational programmes or in adult settings. </p>  <p>  Vocational training is provided through a network of ETB funded Specialist Training Providers (STPs), specifically for learners who have physical, intellectual, mental health or sensory disabilities.  Learners on these programmes have the opportunity to participate in training ranging from level 3 to 5 on the NFQ. </p>  <p>  Funding is also provided through the co-operation hours scheme operated by Education and Training Boards (ETBs) where the local service provider makes application to the relevant ETB for tuition hours.  Funding is also provided to the National Learning Network and to Vocational Training Centres for this purpose.</p>  <p>  Young adults with disabilities are eligible to access SOLAS mainstream services.  SOLAS also contracts Specialist Training Providers, in locations country-wide, to deliver training courses to people with disabilities who require more intensive support than would be available in non-specialist training provision.  Specialist training offers additional supports to learners which include individualised training and progression plans, literacy and numeracy support, longer training duration, adapted equipment, transport arrangements, enhanced programme content and enhanced trainer/learner ratio.</p>  <p>  Work is nearing completion on the development by SOLAS and the ETBs, on a major Further Education and Training (FET) data infrastructure &ndash; the programme learner support service (PLSS), which is currently being piloted and will be fully operational in 2017.  It will include a national FET programme calendar and make it easier for all individuals, including teachers, parents and guidance practitioners, to access information on all FET provision nationally and to plan accordingly.  The website www.fetchcourses.ie which is now live, is already populated with all ETB (education and training boards) provision and is available for all to access.  Other resources that support planning and provide information relevant to education and employment planning include the DES funded Qualifax.ie and CareersPortal.ie. </p>  <p>  The development of the INTREO and JobPath services have also led to improvements in the provision of assistance and advice on employment, training and personal development opportunities for those who are unemployed.  Strengthening career guidance with the aid of employer engagement is a key focus in the National Skills Strategy 2025 which provides for a review of guidance services and careers information for schools students and for adults that will recommend changes to improve the services available.   In this regard, work is currently underway to develop and deliver a new integrated FET Guidance Strategy in 2016. </p>  <p>  FET programmes are available to all learners including persons with a disability who meet the eligibility criteria and guidelines provided for each programme.</p>  <p>  Young people with a verifiable disability are also entitled to apply to eighteen higher education institutions via the Disability Access Route to Education scheme, which offers higher education places on reduced points to students with disabilities.</p>  <p>  Once in college, support is available through the Fund for Students with Disabilities, managed by the HEA on behalf of my Department.</p>  <p>  I can also advise that the National Council for Special Education recently published guidelines on Planning for Life After School that includes a section on options for progression to further, vocational and higher education.</p></reply>

The SEC provides a rationale for its decisions in refusing accommodations where these are not warranted at the initial decision stage.  Candidates who are unhappy with the SEC's decision following consideration of their application for support have a right of appeal to an Independent Appeals Committee.  However, it has been the case that a decision rationale was not also provided to appeal applicants following an unsuccessful appeal to the Independent Appeals Committee.  Applicants not satisfied with the decision of the Independent Appeals Committee can apply to the Ombudsman or the Ombudsman for Children to consider their complaint.</p>  <p>  A recent Judicial Review judgement in the High Court quashed a decision of the Independent Appeals Committee to refuse accommodations applied for by a candidate under the RACE scheme, as it did not give any reason for the Committee's decision.</p>  <p>  The SEC has advised me that it has taken the following steps in light of the High Court Judgement.  The SEC has assessed the implications of the judgement for all candidates for the 2016 examinations who had appealed the SEC decision not to award accommodations sought and whose appeal had come before the Committee prior to the date of the judgment.</p>  <p>  In the first instance, the Independent Appeals Committee reviewed the cases of the 81 appeals which clearly mirrored the situation of the candidate involved in the High Court case and last week notified the candidates involved, through their schools, of the accommodations which have now been granted.  Over the past week the Independent Appeals Committee has also reviewed the appeals of all others who had previously made an appeal to the Committee in order to confirm their initial decision and provide a written rationale for their decision to refuse accommodations in each case.</p>  <p>  This process is now complete and letters of decision have been issued to the candidates via their schools.  Of a total of 404 appeals heard by the Committee prior to the date of the judgement on 29th April, 57 had been granted in full by the Committee at first hearing; 81 have had some or all of the accommodations applied for allowed by the Committee in light of the Judicial Review judgement; the remaining 266 applicants have had their case reviewed by the Committee in light of the judgement; remain ineligible for supports but will receive a letter from the Committee setting out the reasons for their decision to refuse the appeal. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the SEC's review of these matters was not just confined to applications for readers; all previous appeals against decisions to refuse applications for reasonable accommodations have now been reviewed.</p>  <p>  Any new appeals which have come before the Independent Appeals Committee, since the date of the judgment, have been considered in light of the ruling and the Committee is now providing written reasons in respect of any decisions they make to refuse applications for reasonable accommodations.</p>  <p>  The Reasonable Accommodations scheme is demand led. It has not been subject to any budgetary cutbacks in recent years.  Supports are provided to any candidate who meets the conditions of eligibility for the accommodations applied for.</p>  <p>  Figures are not yet available for 2016 as the SEC continues to process late applications up to the start of and throughout the written examinations.  In 2015, 16,194 candidates (14%) of the total cohort of over 117,000 students sitting examinations had some form of reasonable accommodation provided to them in order to enable them to access the certificate examinations.</p></reply>

In particular, the Strategy recommended consolidation within the sector and a pathway of evolution for those consolidated institutes of technology, to allow them to demonstrate significant progress against robust performance criteria and to apply to become technological universities. </p><p>Mission of Technological Universities:</p><p>The intention has always been that a Technological University would be distinctly different from traditional universities and institutes of technology by virtue of their mission relating to graduate formation, applied research and scholarship, dissemination of knowledge to meet the needs of society and enterprise with a very strong regional focus.  However, the mission of a university in Ireland as set out in the 1997 Universities Act is broad and comprehensive and as such it is not surprising that there may be some evidence of some elements of overlap between a University and an Institute of Technology or Technological University.</p><p>  This differentiated mission for a Technological University includes:-</p><p>- a systematic focus on the preparation of graduates for complex professional roles in a changing technological world,</p><p>- the advancement of knowledge through applied research and scholarship and the dissemination of this knowledge to meet the needs of society and enterprise, and </p><p>- the particular contribution the university will make to the needs of the region in which it is located. </p><p>I would also like to underline that this is much more than a rebranding exercise &ndash; the institutions concerned are required to achieve high standards across a range of areas before being designated as technological universities.  These include standards relating to the qualifications of staff, the quality of research output, the proportion of students engaged in lifelong learning, and other relevant issues.</p><p>The following is a list of some of the key features expected of a Technological University: </p><p>- the range of teaching provision (levels 6-10), with the associated scope for progression via appropriate pathways; </p><p>- the strength of provision for work based, and lifelong, learning; </p><p>- the weight of postgraduate research activity relative to that in Institutes of Technology;</p><p>- the key role of experienced practitioners in teaching and research;</p><p>- very close employer links with involvement in curriculum design, teaching and supervision;</p><p>- a strong vocational/professional orientation; </p><p>- a strong regional as well as a wider focus;</p><p>- highly developed responsiveness and flexibility in delivery, with demand (via feedback from employers) as a key driver; and</p><p>- an approach to research that entails building strength in focused areas in close partnership with users. </p><p>The mission and vision for each of the individual proposed technological universities is developed by the consortia, in consultation with stakeholders including staff and students, and is contained in the implementation plans subsequently developed.</p><p>Regional Focus:</p><p>There will also be a specific focus on the particular contribution the university will make to the needs of the region in which it is located.  The development of technological universities has the potential to deliver greater opportunity to students in these regions, to staff working in the institutions, and to the broader local economy and society.</p><p>International usage of the term Technological University:</p><p>As outlined in the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 the purpose of the process for designation as a Technological University is &quot;...to fundamentally protect the core mission and orientation of the institutes and to simultaneously challenge the institutes that wish to be re-designated to demonstrate that they have reached new levels of performance on these fronts.&quot;</p><p>There is no standard use of the term technological university internationally.  In Europe many colleges previously known as polytechnics have become Universities of Applied Science (e.g. Finland and Netherlands).  They remain differentiated from traditional universities through their links to the labour market and strong emphasis on undergraduate rather than post-graduate activity. </p><p>In other jurisdictions there are Higher Education Institutions that appear similar in some respects to technological universities as envisaged for Ireland but are not known as technological universities (e.g. RMIT University, Melbourne Australia, or Swinburne University of Technology).</p><p>Consortiums who have applied:</p><p>As part of the implementation of the Strategy, the Higher Education Authority in 2012 published a four-stage process and criteria for applicant groups of institutes of technology wishing to apply to become technological universities. </p><p>The designation process consists of four stages as follows &ndash; </p><p>- an expression of interest, </p><p>- the preparation of a plan to meet the criteria, </p><p>- an evaluation of the plan, and </p><p>- an application for designation. </p><p>  There are currently four consortia engaged with the process to become designated as TUs.  These are TU4Dublin (Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Tallaght, Institute of Technology Blanchardstown), Technological University for the South-East (TUSE &ndash; consisting of Waterford Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Carlow), Munster Technological University (MTU &ndash; consisting of Cork Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Tralee) and the Connacht Ulster Alliance (CUA &ndash; consisting of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Sligo and Letterkenny Institute of Technology). </p><p>Status of Consortia:</p><p>At the end of 2014, two consortia successfully passed stage 3 of the four-stage process.  These are the TU4Dublin consortium and the Munster Technological University consortium.</p><p>In early 2015 the Connacht-Ulster Alliance also expressed an interest in merging and in applying to become a technological university.  This application was approved to proceed to the next stage.  In line with the process for designation as a Technological University, Stage 2 of this process involves the preparation of a plan by the Connacht-Ulster Alliance, to meet the criteria for designation as a Technological University.</p><p>With regard to the Technological University for the South-East, consisting of Institute of Technology, Carlow (ITC) and Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT), following the publication of the Kelly report, a preliminary facilitation process which was underway since September 2015, has recently been completed and a Report of the process was received by my Department on 13 May 2016.  There was strong engagement in the process by both parties.  This facilitation process has been an important building block in terms of building trust between the parties and in developing a strong working relationship between the Presidents and Chairs of both institutions.  As part of this process, the Presidents of the two institutions, have jointly developed an initial work-plan to support the development of a joint TU proposal.</p><p>In addition to this both Institutions made a recent joint presentation and submission to the Higher Education Authority, seeking funding to underpin the next phase of engagement.  This was part of the latest call issued by the Higher Education Authority regarding the restructuring of the higher education landscape.  The call sought submissions for funding support in respect of the costs arising from mergers as part of the implementation of the National Strategy for Higher Education.</p><p>Future Funding for landscape re-configuration in the Higher Education sector:</p><p>It is recognised that these changes to the landscape of Irish higher education carry some up-front additional costs and the HEA has provided for a fund to support HEIs with these costs.  In terms of additional financial support, having regard to the benefits that will arise for the institutions, students and the higher education system more generally, the HEA has provided funding in 2013, 2014 and 2015 to provide some support to institutions involved in the TU process, the details of which are set out for each consortium below.</p><p>In relation to 2016, the HEA have ring-fenced a level of funding to support costs arising from the continuation of landscape reform projects as part of the implementation of the National Strategy for Higher Education.  This funding, of up to &euro;8.7m in 2016, includes a specific &euro;2 million allocated in Budget 2016 to support Technological University projects.  This funding will be allocated by the HEA to the various landscape reform projects in due course.</p><p>The HEA has also invited further submissions for funding support in respect of the costs arising from mergers as part of the implementation of the National Strategy for Higher Education.  The total funding available in this call in 2015 will be c. &euro;3.75 million.  Not all of this funding is for Technological Universities as there are also other mergers taking place in Higher Education, i.e. NUIG/ St. Angela's College, Sligo and DCU/ St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra/ Mater Dei Institute of Education.</p><p>  Costs:</p><p>Summary of Overall Costs to date and projections for 2016:</p><p>Costs incurred to End 2015 Estimate for 2016 Future projections</p><p>TU4 Dublin &euro;3,113,000 &euro;2,200,000 To be fully determined as part of the Stage 4 </p><p>Application process</p><p>MTU &euro;1,053,026 &euro;2,100,000 To be fully determined as part of the Stage 4 </p><p>Application process</p><p>TUSE &euro;495,655  To be fully determined as part of the Stage 2 </p><p>Application process</p><p>CUA &euro;400,000  To be fully determined as part of the Stage 2 Application process</p><p>Total &euro;5,061,681 &euro;4,300,000 </p><p>The process for designation as a Technological University consists of four stages.  The &quot;phase-gate&quot; model for the process allows for assessment of the projects at set points.  In relation to costs, these are considered during each stage of the process and in particular there is an onus on each consortium to develop financial models and estimated costings.  In terms of the financial costs, the two consortia that have finalised stage 3 and developed implementation plans acknowledge the costs involved in merger and the designation process, but also commit to meeting those costs within their own budgets.  They also acknowledge that while there are up-front costs in the shorter term, in the longer term, designation as a Technological University will allow them to recoup these costs and provide for new income streams.</p><p>In common with the Munster TU consortium, TU4Dublin has sought to ensure that cost estimates and projecting are robust.  It is essential to understand that, due to the complexity of both of these projects, cost estimates and projections must be continuously reviewed and revised as the project progresses. </p><p>Stage 4 Process:</p><p>Details of the Stage 4 process, including timeframes, for designation as a Technological University are set out in the Technological Universities Bill, 2015.  Sections 39 to 43 of the Bill set out the process for the making of an application to become a technological university, and the information which must be included in such an application, provide for the appointment of an independent, expert advisory panel to examine the application, for the provision by that panel of a report and recommendation to the HEA, and the subsequent provision by the HEA of the report, its views on the report and any other relevant information to the Minister.</p><p>Section 44 of the Bill provides for the making of a proposed decision by the Minister in relation to the application for Technological University status. </p><p>Position of Technological Universities Bill:</p><p>In relation to the position of the Technological Universities Bill, this Bill was at Report Stage at the time of dissolution of the previous D&aacute;il in February 2016.  I recognise that there were a significant number of matters raised in respect of the Bill at both Committee and Report Stage.  It is my intention to now consult with all of the relevant stakeholders in relation to both the matters raised during the legislative process and the commitments contained in the Programme for Government.</p><p>Following the finalisation of this consultation process I will then advance the legislation having determined a position in relation to any matters raised as part of this consultation process.</p></reply>

This improvement takes effect from next September.  It brings the basis of allocation from 19:1 to 18.7:1 for the 2016/17 school year.  This improvement of 0.3 in PTR allocation is a restoration of 50% of the teaching resources that were removed when the allocation of guidance posts was brought within quota. </p>  <p>  Restoring the guidance counsellor allocation to 100% will require an additional 300 teaching posts at an estimated cost of &euro;19m per annum.</p>  <p>  The delivery of the 50% restoration through a change in the staffing schedule will allow each school to determine how best to allocate the additional resources to meet the guidance needs of the school.  The circular issued earlier this year by my Department outlining the allocation of teaching resources clearly stated that this additional resource is to complement existing resources in order to best meet the guidance needs of the school in line with the school's guidance plan.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that in previous changes to guidance counselling allocations in 2012, as a consequence of the Budget adjustment which had to be made at the time, all 195 DEIS schools were effectively sheltered from these changes as a result of the more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1.  This was a 0.75 point improvement compared to the current PTR of 19:1 that applies in non-fee-paying second-level schools.</p>  <p>  That was a very important protection for the cohort of our schools in DEIS most in need of support. DEIS schools will also further benefit from the 0.3 improvement to the staffing schedule which will give them an enhanced allocation on the basis of 17.95:1 in respect of the 2016/17 school year.</p>  <p>  In the next Budget I will consider the best approach to further meeting commitments in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

This resource was allocated in accordance with pupil enrolment.  42% of second-level schools at the time were allocated at least 22 hours per week in respect of guidance (22 hours being the equivalent of one teaching post) while the remainder of the schools were allocated between 8 and 17 hours of guidance per week.</p>  <p>  Since September 2012 at post primary level guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation.  Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students.  This operates at local school level and therefore the information requested by the Deputy on the number of guidance counsellors in secondary schools is not available centrally within my Department. </p>  <p>  The current budget provides an improved staffing allocation to second level schools for the purpose of enhancing guidance provision.  This improvement takes effect from next September.  It brings the basis of allocation from 19:1 to 18.7:1 for the 2016/17 school year.  This improvement of 0.3 in PTR allocation is a restoration of 50% of the teaching resources that were removed when the allocation of guidance posts was brought within quota. </p>  <p>  Restoring the guidance counsellor allocation to 100% will require an additional 300 teaching posts at an estimated cost of &euro;19m per annum.  The current average cost of a teaching post at post primary level is &euro;63,000 per annum.</p>  <p>  The delivery of the 50% restoration through a change in the staffing schedule will allow each school to determine how best to allocate the additional resources to meet the guidance needs of the school.  The circular issued earlier this year by my Department outlining the allocation of teaching resources clearly stated that this additional resource is to complement existing resources in order to best meet the guidance needs of the school in line with the school's guidance plan.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that in previous changes to guidance counselling allocations in 2012, as a consequence of the Budget adjustment which had to be made at the time, all 195 DEIS schools were effectively sheltered from these changes as a result of the more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1.  This was a 0.75 point improvement compared to the current PTR of 19:1 that applies in non-fee-paying second-level schools.</p>  <p>  That was a very important protection for the cohort of our schools in DEIS most in need of support. DEIS schools will also further benefit from the 0.3 improvement to the staffing schedule which will give them an enhanced allocation on the basis of 17.95:1 in respect of the 2016/17 school year.</p>  <p>  The new National Skills Strategy provides for a  review of the full range of guidance services, tools and careers information available to students and adults.  The review will map future priorities and make recommendations for improvements.</p>  <p>  In the next Budget I will consider the best approach to further meeting commitments in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

To incentivise reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases, cars registered from 2008 onwards are taxed on the basis of CO<sub>2</sub>emissions.</p><p>In the case of cars taxed on engine capacity, the banding is structured so that the level of tax payable increases as the engine size increases, with bands ranging from &euro;333 to &euro;1,809 per annum.  In the case of cars taxed on the basis of CO<sub>2</sub>, the banding is structured so that higher emitting cars attract a higher rate of tax than lower emitting ones.  The bands range from &euro;120 per annum for zero emitting vehicles (i.e. electric vehicles) to &euro;2,350 for the highest emitting vehicles. </p><p>While the highest CO<sub>2</sub>band attracts a rate of tax higher than the top engine capacity rate, it is acknowledged that, overall, the average annual tax is lower on CO<sub>2</sub>vehicles (&euro;275 v &euro;503).  Accordingly, higher percentage increases have been applied to cars taxed on CO<sub>2</sub>in recent Budgets with a view to re-balancing the tax base while retaining an environmental incentive to purchase more environmentally friendly vehicles.  The percentage increase in motor tax for passenger vehicles taxed on engine capacity was 7.5% in Budgets 2012 and 2013, compared with increases averaging 25.5% in Budget 2012 and 19.8% in Budget 2013 for vehicles taxed on CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>The move to CO<sub>2</sub>has been effective in reducing emissions.  95% of all new vehicles purchased are now in the lowest emitting A and B bands, which attract the lowest tax rates.  Overall, the average emissions from new cars purchased in Ireland in 2014 was 117g CO<sub>2</sub>/km (the most recent figure available), down from 164g CO<sub>2</sub>/km in 2007, before the CO<sub>2</sub>system was introduced, meaning that the country had reached the EU target of 130g CO<sub>2</sub>/km for 2015 well ahead of target.  The target for 2021 is 95g CO<sub>2</sub>/km.  Accordingly, I do not currently intend to remove the environmental incentive and revert to the older basis of taxation on the basis of engine capacity.  Any amendments to rates are for consideration in a budgetary context.  All of these matters are kept under on-going review.</p></reply>

The Agency has also highlighted the importance of utilising existing housing stock to meet the housing shortage where possible.  In this regard, vacant units in areas that are already serviced may provide opportunities.  In order to fully ascertain the potential from vacant units more information is required on, inter alia, the up to date number of units, which will be available from this years&rsquo; census, their location and the local demand for such dwellings, the reasons the properties are vacant, any obstacles to bringing the units up to standard and back into productive use and the associated costs. </p>  <p>  The potential to bring vacant units, in private ownership, back into productive use will be examined in the context of drafting the Action Plan for Housing.  All options for the delivery of good quality houses and apartments, particularly in areas that are already serviced, are being examined by my Department. </p>  <p>  In relation to vacant local authority units, high priority has been placed on supporting local authorities to return vacant social housing units to productive use for those on the housing waiting list.  Between 2014 and 2015, some 5,000 such units were remediated with the support from the Exchequer and were made available to those on housing waiting lists.  Work was also carried out by local authorities themselves on vacant houses through normal pre-letting works.   </p>  <p>  Over the last two years, my Department has provided some &euro;60 million for this purpose.  This investment is a very significant support to deal with the backlog of vacant social housing units and a key element in addressing urgent social housing need.</p></reply>

Following on from this, a number of measures, including restricting the number of posters per candidate and the display of posters in designated areas only, were pilot-tested during the 2009 Local and European Elections.  Local authorities were canvassed for their views on these measures.</p><p>Several local authorities indicated that any restriction on the number of posters per candidate would be difficult to police effectively.  There were also concerns that restricting the number of posters per candidate would favour larger parties with several candidates running, while restricting the number of posters per party would disadvantage candidates with running mates.  Furthermore, there were concerns that any such measures would disadvantage first-time candidates and thus interfere with the democratic process.  Other concerns included the diverse geographical nature of constituencies, e.g. small urban versus large rural electoral districts.</p><p>  As a result, no measures were introduced to restrict the number of posters.  However, section 19(7) of the Litter Pollution Act 1997 was amended by the Electoral (Amendment) (No.2) Act 2009 to introduce a 30-day time limit prior to an election taking place, during which election posters can be displayed.  Prior to this amendment, the relevant legislation had required that election posters be taken down within 7 days of an election but provided no time limit for the period prior to an election within which posters could be displayed.  While not dealing directly with the number of election posters on display, this legislation ensures that posters are only displayed for a finite and reasonable period.</p><p>  I am satisfied that, overall, the existing arrangements are operating quite well and therefore have no plans in the short term to revise the legislation related to the erection of election posters.</p></reply>

Since then the Programme has been expanded a number of times to provide for new types of supply and to involve a greater range of agencies and bodies in providing accommodation.  SHCEP currently supports the delivery of social housing by providing financial support to local authorities for the longterm leasing of houses and apartments from private owners, developers, Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) and the NAMA Special Purpose Vehicle, NARPS (National Asset Residential Property Services Ltd).  Lease arrangements vary between ten and thirty years in duration and my Department recoups to local authorities the cost of the agreements that are made.</p><p>In addition, local authorities have the option to lease vacant and unsold affordable units to AHBs with the units concerned being made available to households eligible for social housing support.  The interest on the loans associated with these units is recouped to local authorities by my Department under the SHCEP.  The rationale for using unsold affordable units to accommodate social housing tenants in the short to medium term is to match existing vacant housing stock available to local authorities with social housing need.</p><p>In 2015, 1,477 new units became operational under the SHCEP and were made available to local authorities for social housing.  The following table breaks down the ownership of the new units that became operational under SHCEP in 2015.  My Department does not record information in relation to the previous use of properties coming under the SHCEP for the first time.

To this end, local authorities have been given substantial powers under the Act in relation to any such sites, including powers to require specified measures to be taken in relation to a derelict site, to impose a levy on sites which are included in the local authority&rsquo;s derelict sites register, or to compulsorily acquire any derelict site.  It is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas.</p><p>Under section 8(5) of the Act, a copy of the derelict sites register for any local authority can be inspected at the offices of that authority during office hours.  This positions members of the public to engage with their local authority in relation to addressing individual derelict sites.</p><p>In addition, the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, which was enacted in September 2015, introduced a vacant site levy, aimed at incentivising the development of vacant and under-utilised sites in urban areas for residential or regeneration development. </p><p>Under the provisions of the Act , planning authorities are required to establish and maintain a register of vacant sites in their functional areas with effect from January 2017.  From January 2019, the Act further empowers planning authorities to charge a levy on the registered owners of sites that remain on the vacant site register in the preceding year at a rate of 3% of the market value of each site, with reduced or zero rates applying in specific circumstances. </p><p>In addition to the foregoing, the Programme for a Partnership Government proposes the examination of a number of planning reforms to regenerate derelict and under-used buildings, including:-introducing a similar scheme to the &ldquo;Living city Initiative&rdquo; to regenerate town centres and villages throughout Ireland,</p><p>-  the establishment of a national register of derelict sites, in addition to the new vacant site levy, to bring vacant and under-utilised sites into beneficial use for housing and urban regeneration purposes,</p><p>-mandating local authorities with better land management powers, including the possibility of additional CPO (Compulsory Purchase Order) capabilities, and</p><p>-reclassifying and incentivising the use of under utilised or vacant areas over ground floor premises in towns, for both residential and commercial use.</p><p>Furthermore, the potential to bring vacant units, in private ownership, back into productive use will be examined in the context of the drafting the forthcoming Action Plan for Housing.  All options for the delivery of good quality houses and apartments, particularly in areas that are already serviced, are being examined by my Department.</p><p>In relation to vacant local authority units, high priority has been placed on supporting local authorities to return vacant social housing units to productive use for those on the housing waiting list.  Between 2014 and 2015, some 5,000 such units were remediated with the support from the Exchequer and were made available to those on housing waiting lists.  Work was also carried out by local authorities themselves on vacant houses through normal pre-letting works.</p><p>Over the last two years, my Department has provided some &euro;60 million for this purpose.  This investment is a very significant support to deal with the backlog of vacant social housing units and a key element in addressing urgent social housing need.</p><p>In effect, there is already a considerable range of measures in place aimed at bringing derelict buildings and sites, as well as inhabited buildings in need of repair, into productive use, with potential additional measures being examined so that the issues of dereliction and vacancy can be addressed as comprehensively as possible with a view to assisting in the provision of increased housing supply. </p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme and applies to all existing local authority houses, other than those classes of houses excluded under legislation.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum.   </p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the Scheme is determined by the relevant housing authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014.  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, housing authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income.   </p>  <p>  The provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, are designed to enable the development of mixed tenure sustainable communities.  Part V units are excluded from the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme to ensure that units delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time.  The continued development of mixed tenure communities remains very important in promoting social integration.   </p>  <p>  The new Scheme is in the very early stages of implementation and my Department is monitoring the operation of the scheme in consultation with housing authorities.  In line with the commitment in the new Programme for a Partnership Government to make the scheme more attractive for social housing tenants and to raise new funds for housing development, I intend to undertake a review of the scheme following the first 12 months of operation.  I will bring forward any changes to the terms and conditions of the scheme which are considered necessary based on the evidence gathered at that stage.</p></reply>

These measures are identified in the Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness (May 2014) and in the Action Plan to Address Homelessness (December 2014).  These Plans represent a whole-of-Government approach to dealing with homelessness.  The implementation of measures identified in these Plans is co-ordinated by my Department and is being overseen by a group of senior officials drawn from key State agencies concerned.  This group which is chaired by my Department includes the Department of Social Protection; the Department of Health; the Department of Children and Youth Affairs the Health Service Executive; Tusla (the Child and Family Agency); the Irish Prison Service; and local authorities.  The Plans and quarterly progress reports on the implementation of the measures therein are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i></i>.  <i></i></p><p>The long-term solution to the challenge of homelessness is to increase the supply of homes.  With regard to the supply of social housing, the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i><i>2020</i>provides for clear, measurable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list with flexibility to meet future demand.  In total, 110,000 new social housing units are targeted for delivery with 35,000 new units to be delivered by local authorities and approved housing bodies, and 75,000 households to be supported mainly through the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme.  The <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p>The Social Housing Strategy 2020 and associated funding of &euro;1.7 billion under budgets 2015 and 2016 provided for the delivery of 13,000 social housing units in 2015, under a range of programmes, by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  This represents an increase of 86% on the circa 7000 units delivered in 2014.  The target for 2016 is again ambitious at 17,000 units.</p></reply>

In this way, the Strategy recognises the record of steady achievement by AHBs over the past 20 years in providing in excess of 28,000 units of quality accommodation.</p><p>Under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), my Department, together with local authorities, can support AHBs to construct, purchase or lease housing units and make them available for social housing.  The housing units are secured under long-term leases/ availability arrangements between local authorities and AHBs. </p><p>In addition, capital support is made available to AHBs through the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF), which provides an up-front capital payment of up to 30% of the relevant construction or acquisition cost of a project, facilitating AHBs in raising private finance, including from the Housing Finance Agency (HFA), to acquire or build new social housing units.  The capital advance is repayable by the AHB to the local authority at the end of a payment and availability agreement, usually 30 years. All proposals for CALF are submitted to my Department by AHBs for review and to ensure that the project complies with the terms of the CALF and that there are sufficient funds available.  The local authority is also required to examine the proposal and report to my Department that it is suitable to meet housing need in the local area; that the properties comply with relevant standards and regulatory requirements; and that the objectives of sustainable communities are being met (for example, that there is not already an over-concentration of social housing in the area).  A detailed independent financial appraisal of the proposal is then conducted by the Housing Agency on my Department&rsquo;s behalf, including a review of the acquisition or construction costs and details relating to the market rents and availability payments sought by the AHB, in order to ensure that the project is sustainable in the long-term and represents value for money.</p><p>Subject to my Department&rsquo;s approval to the proposal, the local authority then enters into a Capital Advance Agreement (CAA) and a payment and availability agreement with the AHB concerned whereby the properties in question are provided for social housing support purposes for a specified period between 10 and 30 years.  Monies paid by the local authority to the AHB for these units are recouped to the local authority from my Department. </p><p>The project specifically referred to in the Question involves the acquisition of units by an AHB in a new residential development.  The project was assessed by my Department and the relevant local authorities, including from the sustainable communities point of view.  While the relevant AHB has received approval for CALF assistance, subject to the normal terms and conditions of the scheme, it is my understanding that the AHB is continuing pre-contract negotiations with the developer and is proceeding with due diligence.  The units, if secured, would provide secure high quality social housing for approximately 42 households,  including many families, in an area of significant social housing demand.</p></reply>

Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) are published to accompany each of the parts and provide guidance indicating how the requirements of that part can be achieved in practice.  These TGDs can be freely accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website at: <i><i>.</i></i></p><p>Where works are carried out in accordance with the relevant technical guidance such works are considered to be, <i>prima facie</i>, in compliance with the relevant regulation(s).  Compliance with the Regulations is the responsibility of the owner or builder of a building or works while enforcement is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities.</p><p>In response to the many building failures that have emerged over the past decade, my Department introduced the which require greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals and builders, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.</p><p>Statutory certificates of compliance, where relevant, must be given at commencement (design only) and completion and must be signed by a registered construction profession (i.e. an Architect or a Building Surveyor or a chartered Engineer who is included on a statutory register maintained respectively by the Royal Institution of Architects of Ireland, the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland or Engineers Ireland).  The statutory certificate of compliance on completion must also be signed by the builder.</p><p>In effect, the statutory Certificate of Compliance on Completion certifies that a building is compliant with all relevant requirements of the Building Regulations, including the fire safety requirements set out in Part B and the accompanying technical guidance.</p><p>The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 were reviewed following their first 12 months in operation.  It is clear from this review that the recent reforms have brought a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects.  In this regard, I am confident that as the transition to the new arrangements for the control of building activity continues to progress, these reforms will in time prove capable of transforming the culture of the construction industry in Ireland to one of improved compliance and quality.</p><p>Complementary to the above , Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI) has been established as a voluntary register of builders, contractors and specialist trade persons by the Construction Industry Federation (CIF).  Under the Government has signalled its commitment to placing the register on a statutory footing.  This is seen as an additional essential consumer protection measure giving consumers who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator.  Legislative proposals in this regard are currently being prepared by my Department with a view to their being presented to Government for consideration in the near future.</p><p>These measures taken together will foster a greater emphasis on competence, professionalism and quality in our construction industry into the future thereby ensuring that homeowners and clients can rely on getting the high quality homes and buildings they expect and deserve. </p></reply>

Emissions Trading is a &ldquo;Cap and Trade&rdquo; scheme whereby an EU wide limit or cap is set for participating installations.  The cap is reduced over time so that total emissions are reduced.  Within that limit &ldquo;allowances&rdquo; for emissions are auctioned or allocated for free.  Individual installations must report their CO2 emissions each year and surrender sufficient allowances to cover their emissions.  If their available allowances are exceeded an installation must purchase allowances.  If an installation has succeeded in reducing its emissions, it can sell its leftover allowances or keep these for a later period.</p><p>The ETS system is designed to bring about reductions in emissions at least cost, and to date has played an increasingly important role in assisting European industry implement the type of reductions envisaged in the EU Commission&rsquo;s limit of at least an overall 20 per cent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by 2020.  The Scheme came into being in 2005, with Phase One introduced as a three-year pilot which ran until 2007.  Phase Two operated between 2008 and 2012, and Phase Three from 2013 until 2020.  A proposal for Phase Four, which will run from 2021 to 2030, was made by the European Commission in July 2015 and is currently being debated in the relevant committees and working parties of the European Parliament and Council.  Under Phases One and Two, all installations were entitled to some free allocation based on historical emissions.  The methodology is described in the National Allocation Plan as approved by Irish Government and the EU Commission.</p><p>Under Phase Three, there is no free allocation to the Power generating sector (except in ten of the newer Member States).  Free allocation to industries (and aircraft operators) is on the basis of EU- wide rules and benchmarks.  Verified production/activity data gathered by EPA from the installations and aircraft operators is forwarded to the EU Commission as the basis of the free allocation application from operators of installations and aircraft.  The Commission approve a National Allocation Table and any amendments made to it subsequently as a result of closures, significant reductions in capacity or new entrant applications.  The current National Allocation Table is available on the EPA website at: <i>.</i></p><p>In relation to the number of Emission Allowances issued since 2008, allowances were auctioned under Phase One to cover administration costs, including a final auction in March 2008 of the left over allowances from installation closures and unused new entrant reserve allowances.  Allowances from the pilot phase could not be used in subsequent phases of the ETS. </p><p>For Phase Two, the Government decision of 10 April 2006 stated that up to a maximum of 0.5% of the total allowances might be sold to defray the costs of administering the emissions trading scheme.  The total amount of allowances sold in Phase Two was 575,000.  These sales were administered by the National Treasury Management Agency. </p><p>Under Phase Three, allowances are auctioned on a Common Auction Platform co-ordinated by the Commission and run by EEX in Germany.

A scheme exists whereby a local authority (LA) can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages, thus enabling the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (LA- Mortgage-to- Rent).  The other scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body (AHB) to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage, which also enables the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (AHB- Mortgage-to- Rent).  Both schemes assist families with income difficulties whose mortgages are unsustainable, and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.  Both schemes are part of the overall suite of social housing options and an important part of the mortgage arrears resolution process.</p><p>Information in relation to LA-Mortgage-to- Rent scheme transactions during its pilot phase in Dublin City Council and Westmeath County Council in 2013 and annual transactions, broken down by local authority, following national roll out of the scheme in 2014 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website: <i></i><i></i></p><p>To date in 2016, my Department has funded a further 3 transactions in the Dublin City Council area.

A number of specific measures have been, and will continue to be, introduced to reduce the amount of waste generated in the State and to increase the segregation of waste which cannot be prevented in line with Government policy.  The introduction of pay-by-weight charges for the collection of household waste is one such measure.</p><p>The legislation requires that the collector will charge for each kilogramme of waste collected.  The Government has set a <i>minimum</i>mandatory fee per kilogramme for the different types of household waste: 11c for black bin (residual waste), 6c for brown bin (food/organic waste) and I have decided that a zero cent <i>minimum</i>fee per kilogramme should be set for green bins (recyclate).  The collector may also charge a service fee, which will typically cover staff, collection, administrative and back office, capital and overhead costs. </p><p>As is now the case, it will be a matter for the collector to set charges at the level they consider to be competitive from 1 July 2016, in compliance with the requirements of the legislation.</p></reply>

Furthermore, it is not possible for a household on the waiting list of one housing authority to transfer its application to another authority and to carry the time spent on the previous list.</p>  <p>  The Social Housing Strategy 2020 includes a commitment to examine the possibility of introducing a &ldquo;housing passport&rdquo;.  The basic premise is that households in receipt of, or qualified for social housing support in one local authority area could potentially transfer to, or be allocated, social housing in another local authority area.   </p>  <p>  The &ldquo;housing passport&rdquo; proposal has been examined on an initial basis and my Department has sought information from local authorities on the potential for them to accommodate households from other local authority areas.  Given the pressures on each local authority to accommodate households on their own social housing list, local authorities have reported no spare capacity at this time. However, the &ldquo;housing passport&rdquo; approach is being considered in the context of the local authorities that are operating the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), where there may be some capacity in private rental markets to accommodate households from other local authority areas. </p></reply>

The Control of Dogs Acts 1986, set out a range of requirements for all dog owners or any other person in charge of a dog.  In particular, section 9 of the 1986 Act requires the owner or any other person in charge of a dog to accompany it and keep it under effectual control in any place other than the premises of the owner, the premises of the person in control of the dog, or other premises with the consent of the owner of the premises.  Section 21 of the 1986 Act provides that the owner of a dog shall be liable in damages for damage caused in an attack on any person by the dog; it is not necessary for the person seeking damages to show a previous mischievous propensity in the dog, or the owner's knowledge of such previous propensity, or to show that such injury or damage was attributable to neglect on the part of the owner.</p>  <p>  In addition to the foregoing, the Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 set out further requirements that owners of specific breeds of dogs have to follow, namely that such dogs must be muzzled and led, on a sufficiently strong leash or chain not exceeding 2 metres in length, by a competent person over 16 years of age when in a public place.  The specific control requirements for these restricted breeds are a balanced and workable arrangement which recognises the rights of dog owners, respects animal welfare to the extent possible, while also taking account of the needs of society to be protected from dogs with a significant capability to inflict very serious injury, or cause death. </p>  <p>  The Control of Dogs Acts 1986 &amp;amp; 1992 and subsequent regulations also refer to the licencing and control of dogs.  My Department has also progressed the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 which commenced on the 1 January 2012.  This has put in place appropriate controls for the breeding of dogs.   </p>  <p>  In my previous role as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I announced legislation for compulsory micro-chipping of all dogs on 20 February 2015.  The dog micro-chipping programme was rolled out on a phased basis, beginning with pups in September 2015 and was expanded to all dogs in March 2016. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the restrictions under the current legislative framework provide the necessary controls for the protection of society and, therefore, I have no plans to amend the legislation in respect of these matters.  I also understand that Veterinary Ireland is undertaking an in-depth policy review at present, which includes, inter alia, an examination of the effectiveness of the Control of Dogs Regulations 1998.</p></reply>

A number of specific measures have been, and will continue to be, introduced to reduce the amount of waste generated in the State and to increase the segregation of waste which cannot be prevented, in line with Government policy.  The introduction of pay-by-weight charges for the collection of household waste is one such measure.  During the period in which local authorities were directly involved in the collection of household waste, a minority of individual Councils offered different levels of discount to selected households, based on different qualification criteria.  As local authorities exited the waste collection market, some required the private operators which took on the Councils&rsquo; customers to provide a level of discount for existing waiver customers only, and even then for a limited time.  The vast majority of such contractual commitments for private operators to provide a waiver have now expired. In that context, the number of households in receipt of waiver discounts is likely to decline over time, especially as some householders were able to take advantage of special reduced offers elsewhere which actually undercut the waiver price.  However, selected private operators still offer some level of discount to former waiver customers on a voluntary basis.</p>  <p>  In addition, a very limited number of local authorities make financial contributions towards the cost of, or pay for, the collection of waste from certain households.  Again, the qualification criteria and level of support differ from area to area.  Such expenditure means that these local authorities divert funding from other areas to support these waiver provisions.</p>  <p>  With the exception of one or two municipal districts, local authorities no longer collect waste and the market is now serviced by a diverse range of private operators, where the fees charged are a matter between service provider and customer and the services offered vary across the country.  In that regard, it is becoming increasingly apparent that a national waiver scheme could not be imposed in the context of an open market for waste collection.</p>  <p>  However, under pay-by- weight charging for household waste collection, there is an opportunity for everybody to have more control over their waste charges and to minimise their waste costs by preventing waste and segregating waste through using the food waste and recyclable waste bins properly.  In this regard, a pay-by- weight awareness campaign, launched on 18 May 2016, will be rolled out at national, regional and local levels in the coming weeks and will give invaluable advice to householders on minimising their waste management costs under pay-by- weight charging.</p></reply>

The need for extensions can arise to address overcrowding, as well as for older people or people with a disability who may require the installation of a downstairs bedroom or bathroom.  Local authorities also use their existing housing stock to meet such need (downsizing as well as upsizing) but, in some instances, the best option is to adapt/extend a family&rsquo;s existing accommodation and this funding supports local authorities in responding to that need.

This policy is supported by the Risk-Based Approach (RBA) to managing emergency service provision.  My Department, in conjunction with the Contracting Authorities of the three Regional Communications Centres, worked to develop a national model for a Risk-Based Approach to fire cover in all fire authorities.  Initial RBA reports, which enabled and supported the first Area Risk Categorisation process undertaken by each fire service in 2013/14, were issued to each fire authority in July 2012.</p>  <p>  A second batch of RBA reports, using an expanded data-set, was generated in 2015.  These model the predicted order of attendance of primary fire service resources to every geographical area, based on the travel time from fire stations to those individual areas.  The results were based on a combination of actual turnout times of the fire stations, using three years of cumulative response data, together with the predicted travel times.  These provide an evidence base to support fire authorities in reviewing and redefining the pre-determined attendances (PDAs) in their functional areas and to give effect to the principle of mobilising the &ldquo;nearest available resource&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The RBA II project was recently submitted to the newly established Fire Services National Oversight and Implementation Group (FSNOIG) for consultation between management and staff representatives, following which a jointly agreed implementation process should issue.</p>  <p>  In the particular case referred to in the Question, the responsibility for the provision of fire services rests with the relevant fire authorities who are, Wicklow County Council and Dublin City Council; the latter provides fire services for the four Dublin local authorities, through Dublin Fire Brigade.  I expect that these authorities will jointly review service provision at the interface between their fire authorities in accordance with national policy when the FSNOIG consultation process is complete.</p></reply>

I believe that economic and labour market conditions have changed for the better since the scheme was introduced in 2011 and that the time may now be right for a more targeted scheme.</p>  <p>  JobBridge was developed in 2011 in response to the unemployment crisis to serve a dual purpose.  First, to help jobseekers to secure the work experience vital to enhancing their employment prospects and break the vicious circle of &lsquo;no experience no work but no work no experience&rsquo;.  And second to support employers in taking the first step in recruitment at a time when access to finance was very limited and business risk was very high.  JobBridge also addressed the anomaly in the social welfare code whereby unemployed jobseekers who voluntarily undertook unpaid work experience or internships lost their entitlement to a jobseeker payment.  Under JobBridge participants retain their jobseeker payment and in addition receive a top up towards the cost of work of &euro;52.50 per week.</p>  <p>  JobBridge has been very successful in meeting its objectives over the past five years.  It has helped about 19,000 mainly small employers to provide valuable work experience to nearly 48,000 unemployed jobseekers.  An independent evaluation of JobBridge published in 2013 found that overall satisfaction levels with the scheme were very high.  Two thirds of participants would recommend the scheme to a friend or family member, and levels of abuse of the scheme by employers were very low.  Most notably the evaluation found that about 61% of participants progressed into paid employment within a short period of about completing their internship.  This is a very high progression rate and suggests that JobBridge has been instrumental in helping about 30,000 jobseekers to secure employment.</p>  <p>  JobBridge is giving opportunities to jobseekers across the spectrum of qualifications.  Participation on the scheme is voluntary.</p>  <p>  Given the numbers of unemployed jobseekers holding graduate and post-graduate qualifications, it is obviously necessary that JobBridge is in a position to offer them an internship that reflects their abilities, aspirations and qualifications.  In this regard a previous criticism directed at the Department was that the terms of its jobseeker payments prevented jobseekers, including graduate jobseekers, from taking up internship opportunities as a route into employment, JobBridge addresses this issue.</p>  <p>  The Department has a number of controls in place to prevent abuse of the scheme.  These include requirements on host organisations to provide a mentor to the intern, to sign and operate a standard agreement, to submit regular monitoring reports to the Department and to co-operate with random monitoring visits.  There are also limits placed on the number of internships that can be offered by any one organisation related to the number of staff employed by the company and there are restrictions on the repeat or sequential use of internships.  I am satisfied based on the Department&rsquo;s own monitoring visits and the report of the independent evaluation that these controls are working effectively.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these achievements JobBridge has been subject to a high level of criticism much of which is based on anecdote or very small scale surveys by various interest groups.  I intend to respond to these criticisms in the design of a new scheme.  It is however important that the design of a new scheme be informed by the best evidence possible.</p>  <p>  It is for this reason that I intend to await the results of a second large scale evaluation of JobBridge currently underway.  The results of this evaluation, which is again being undertaken by Indecon, are expected in September and I will announce my proposals for a new scheme shortly thereafter.</p></reply>

The 2016 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;2.8 billion.</p>  <p>  It is accepted that periods of unemployment are a normal feature of the acting and artistic professions and people in these professions can qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment when they are unemployed.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments compensate for periods of involuntary unemployment only and it is not the function of my Department to provide income support through the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes to any group, including artists during periods of unemployment, which are involuntary.  For this reason, social welfare legislation provides that all jobseeker&rsquo;s must satisfy certain qualifying conditions in order to be entitled to an unemployment payment including, being available for full-time work and be genuinely seeking work.  The legislation does not impose any restriction or limitation on the right of a person to the opportunity to engage in the employment of his or her choice.  All unemployed persons should avail of reasonable employment opportunities and Artists are treated no differently to any other unemployed person.  My Department&rsquo;s INTREO service now provides a more focussed service to those in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, including Artists.</p>  <p>  My Department has no plans to introduce new sector specific working age payments that provide exemptions to be available for and genuinely seeking employment.</p>  <p>  It is essential to the sustainability and integrity of the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes that these criteria remain a core feature of the State&rsquo;s supports for the unemployed.</p></reply>

The package is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the household benefits package retain that entitlement.  The Department will spend approximately &euro;227 million this year on the household benefits package for over 418,000 customers.  All aspects of the HHB package are continually reviewed and improvements made to the scheme where necessary.</p>  <p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen significantly each year, as the number of eligible customers grew, arising from the increased number of pension recipients.  The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance was estimated to provide annual savings of &euro;48 million.  These savings meant that the Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence.  Any decision to restore the telephone allowance would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department is currently examining the rent limits in the context of the Government commitment and it is intended that revised rent limits, taking account of geographic variations in market rents, will be introduced as early as possible subject to agreement by Government.</p><p>At this time of constrained supply, the Department continues to implement a targeted, flexible, case-by-case approach where rents exceed limits.  This ensures that people at risk of homelessness or loss of their tenancy are supported under the rent supplement scheme where increased rental payments are required.  Currently, over 8,300 households are supported through this approach.</p><p>The Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute.  Following engagement with the relevant agencies this protocol was recently extended to the commuter counties of Meath, Kildare and Wicklow on 25 April, 2016, with plans to extend the service to Galway City over the coming week.  The Programme for a Partnership Government has identified expanding this Protocol nationwide, and the Department will continue to work with colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, local authorities and Threshold to support this extension.</p><p>A breakdown of rent supplement recipient numbers since 2010 is provided in the attached tabular statement.  Statistics on the rent supplement recipients by household composition are not available.</p><p>Any person experiencing increased rents or facing the threat of the loss of their tenancy are encouraged to contact the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service responsible for their rent supplement clam without delay.</p><p><b>Rent Supplement: Recipient Numbers from 2010 to Present</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Recipients as of 31 Dec</th></tr><tr><td>2010 </td><td>97,260</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>96,803</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>87,684</td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>79,788</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>71,533</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>61,247</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>55,531</td></tr></table></p><p>At end of May 2016.</p></reply>

Scheme service is defined as years and months of full or equivalent and permanent company service, completed by the former employee at the date of the windup of the Scheme, for the purpose of determining expected pension in retirement, to a maximum of 40 years.  It includes periods of service purchased for backdated pension purposes.</p>  <p>  While contract service was not pensionable, under the rules of the schemes, former contract workers who became permanent employees and members of the pension schemes were allowed to purchase periods of service.  This purchased service is included in calculations for both the lump sum and pension.  The Department has obtained legal advice, which confirms that unpurchased service at the date of winding up of the Waterford Crystal Pension Fund cannot form part of the liabilities of the pension scheme for the purposes of section 48B of the Pensions Act.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Each application is considered on the circumstances presented.</p><p>The Department was represented on the Taskforce for Transitional Support for Persons granted status in Direct Provision, which was established on foot of recommendation 5.169 of the Working Group on Improvements to the Protection Process (McMahon report).  This Taskforce developed an information programme for persons granted status which is being rolled out by the Citizens Information Board and also an information booklet to support the transition from direct provision.</p><p>Persons who have been granted protection and are seeking to establish eligibility for a social welfare payment should contact their local Department of Social Protection Intreo Centre for information.

The 2016 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme of &euro;2.45 billion.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify for a Jobseeker's Allowance payment a person must meet all the conditions for the scheme.  Being habitually resident in the State is a requirement, among others, for receipt of certain social protection payments including jobseeker's allowance.  It applies to all applicants for and recipients of such payments including those who have been granted leave to remain.</p>  <p>  Asylum seekers only have permission to remain in the State until their applications for refugee status or subsidiary protection have been determined and cannot be considered to satisfy the habitual residence condition during this period.  As they do not satisfy the habitual resident condition during this period they are not eligible for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s published guidelines on the application of the habitual residence condition specifically address the issue of those who have been granted leave to remain.</p>  <p>  Where someone has been granted residency and are available and seeking employment they can apply for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  However, they must satisfy the means test and the habitual resident condition among others, which applies to all applicants in order to receive payment.</p></reply>

This process began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) previously available at 65, thereby currently standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  The changes introduced in 2011 were on foot of a Government commitment included in the National Recovery Plan published in 2010 and in the subsequent Memorandum of Understanding with the EU/ECB/IMF.</p>  <p>  The purpose of these changes is to make the pension system sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  More people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  Therefore, the duration for which an average pension will be paid will continue to increase.  The number of pensions is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually as a result of this demographic change.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision, resulting in an additional cost of some &euro;1 billion every 5 years, before other matters, such as rate increases, are factored in.</p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  While its abolition would not realise that saving in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseekers Benefit (although at a lower rate than that of the State pension), and some may have claimed for Qualified Adults on their spouse&rsquo;s pension, it is estimated that well over half of that cost may have been saved each year as a result of this measure.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no general retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  I would encourage employers, where possible, to recognise the contribution that older workers make to their businesses, and not to automatically end their employment on their 65th  birthday, particularly given the fact that the State pension age is now 66.</p>  <p>  In terms of financial supports, social welfare benefits will continue to be available up to the age of 66 for those who are contractually obliged to leave employment.  People who have worked in the private sector until their 65th  birthday will generally qualify for Jobseekers benefit (which is not means-tested) rather than Jobseekers allowance, if they are unemployed and seeking work.  </p>  <p>  Jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66.  Where a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claim spans two benefit years, a new Governing Contribution Year requirement is not applied to the second benefit year of a claimant aged 65 (effectively this means that they may receive payment in both years based upon eligibility in the first year).</p>  <p>  There are no plans to introduce legislation to change from the current position, as doing so would result in a significant cost to the Exchequer and further undermine the sustainability of the pension system, which already faces significant demographic challenges.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The project was delivered by the Walkinstown Association for People with an Intellectual Disability (WALK).</p><p>The objective of the DACT programme was to explore a variety of routes towards ensuring that people with disabilities were enabled to avail of progression, education and development opportunities within the world of work.  Similar to many other projects with EU funding, a key criterion used when selecting projects for the programme was that appropriate learning should be capable of being independently mainstreamed into the future.  It was on this basis that each of the DACT projects was awarded funding with a specified end-date of 30 April 2015.  It was not intended that the funding for the projects would continue in the long-run or that they would become ongoing service delivery organisations in their own right.</p><p>In the final phase of the programme, it was recognised that was a short-term need for some further funding so as to allow projects to ensure that their participants finished their involvement in an orderly manner.  Therefore my Department decided to provide some further funding to seven of the DACT projects for the short period to the end of July 2015.  On this basis, all DSP funding to WALK PEER project ceased at the end of July 2015.  I understand that the WALK PEER project was subsequently successful in obtaining additional funding from a private-sector organisation.  I also understand that this is this source of support that is referred to in the clarification to the question and that this support will end in July.</p><p>Given the objectives of previous support for this programme and the overall circumstances set out above, my Department has no plans to reinstate funding to the DACT pilot projects and accordingly there is no provision in the Department's estimates to provide funding to the WALK PEER project.</p><p>In relation to alternative supports, my Department provides a range of programmes designed to support the employment of people with disabilities, including the supported employment programme, EmployAbility, and the wage subsidy scheme.  Participants exiting the WALK PEER project may seek to avail of these supports, where appropriate.  Other supports available may be accessed through the health service executive.  I should also stress that participants, where eligible, will continue to receive their weekly income support payment so that their income support needs continue to be met.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy<b>.</b></p></reply>

This working group has been tasked with identifying the next steps in the context of future Disability Activation activities under the new ESF programme, Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL), 2014-2020.

One of the first schemes selected for evaluation was JobBridge.</p><p>The aim of the evaluation is to assess the effectiveness of the scheme in terms of its key objective of improving employment outcomes for unemployed jobseekers.  The evaluation involves a number of elements including:</p><p>1. Surveys of host organisation and participants to capture their perspective on, and experience of, JobBridge.</p><p>2. An assessment of whether or not JobBridge may be displacing paid employment in the economy.</p><p>3. A comparison of employment outcomes of JobBridge participants to matched non-participants.</p><p>The JobBridge scheme has been an effective labour market intervention to date.  It is estimated that some 15,000 interns went directly into paid employment immediately following a JobBridge internship.  Independent research indicates that this rose to 29,000 interns, or 61% of all participants after five months, compared to an average of 34% for comparable programmes in other European countries.</p><p>I know people who took part in JobBridge and have benefitted from it.  But it was very much a scheme for its time, and I&rsquo;m planning to replace it with a more appropriate scheme.  JobBridge was launched at a time of massive economic uncertainty and widespread unemployment.  Companies were simply not hiring because they couldn&rsquo;t afford to recruit, and in many cases insisted on a minimum level of experience.  But large numbers of recent graduates and people who lost their jobs in the recession couldn&rsquo;t get the relevant workplace experience they needed to get a first or a new job.</p><p>That crisis is now over, the economy is growing and employers are hiring again.  The labour market has changed and new graduates are once again finding work.</p><p>Job creation was at the heart of the last Government with more than 125,000 jobs created, and we have a new target to create a further 200,000.  Unemployment has fallen below 8% for the first time since the crash.  Although the evidence is largely anecdotal, I am concerned at reports that some employers might be using JobBridge as an alternative to hiring new employees.  On the other hand, I am very conscious that there are still many people who lost their jobs in the depth of the recession who are struggling to break back into the labour market and schemes like JobBridge can provide a valuable pathway to such citizens, in particular in instances where it is associated with a training programme.</p><p>In order that the design of a new scheme be informed by the best evidence possible and reflect the experience of stakeholders, I am awaiting the results of a second large scale evaluation of JobBridge.  This evaluation is currently well advanced; an interim progress report is expected towards the end of June and the final report in September.  This report will provide an evidential basis upon which to consider what changes should be made to improve outcomes for Jobseekers and value for money for the State.</p></reply>

JobPath is one of the range of activation supports, including schemes such as CE and T&Uacute;S, catering for long-term unemployed jobseekers.  In order to manage the allocation of activation support places effectively the Department does not facilitate or encourage jobseekers to leave one scheme early in order to take up a place on another scheme.  Jobseekers spend a year on JobPath.  Participation in other schemes and programmes, including CE and T&Uacute;S, remains an option that will be assessed by case officers once the jobseeker&rsquo;s participation on JobPath is completed.</p>  <p>  Participants on JobPath receive intensive individual support to help them address barriers to employment and to assist them in finding full-time sustainable jobs.  If they are placed into a job they continue to receive support for at least three months, and up to twelve months, while in employment.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

To this end, a key objective in Pathways to Work 2016-2020 is to progressively extend and intensify the pro-active engagement approach at Intreo Centres to people with disabilities.  Currently, people with a disability, including those receiving a Disability Allowance (DA) payment, can voluntarily avail of the Intreo service, where a range of supports are available.  Those who present themselves at an Intreo Centre seeking employment supports are referred, without delay, to a Case Officer, or to the Local Employment Service (LES).  Through this process a person can access a range of schemes and services, many of which are exclusive to people with disabilities.  These include, the Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS), the Employability (supported employment) Service, Specialist Training Provision and referral to a free and confidential literacy service.  In addition, DA recipients can take up employment (which has been certified as rehabilitative) and earn &euro;120 a week with no impact on their weekly DA payment.  Furthermore the JobBridge internship scheme is also available to recipients of a wide range of payments including Disability Allowance.</p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that DA recipients are not required to switch to a Jobseeker&rsquo;s Payment to avail of the range of Intreo Service supports available to people with a disability.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

Budget 2014 further extended the reduced rates to recipients under 26 years of age.  This is a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency.  To guard against the development of welfare dependency I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If a young jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.  The Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that all young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed.  There is now monthly engagement with all young jobseekers.  Youth unemployment rose rapidly in the recession to over 30% in 2012.  According to the Quarterly National Household Survey for Quarter 1 2016, youth unemployment continues to fall in line with the overall recovery and now stands at 16.9%.</p>  <p>  The review of jobseekers allowance rates for young persons under 26 years of age is ongoing and I expect that this review will be completed later this year.  I am committed to ensuring my Department identifies effective measures to incentivise and support young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  The best way to do this is through engagement processes and by incentivising them to avail of educational and training opportunities, thereby enhancing their employment prospects.</p></reply>

It provides a direct monthly financial incentive to employers in the form of a monthly grant paid over two years with two levels of grant payable.  The level of payment depends on the length of time the person is unemployed.  As part of the introduction of an EU-wide Youth Guarantee, my Department reduced the JobsPlus eligibility threshold from 12 months to 4 months for those under 25 years of age.  As a result, an employer will be paid &euro;7,500 over a two year period if they recruit and retain in employment a person who is under 25 years of age and unemployed for at least 4 months in the previous 6 months.  An amount of &euro;10,000 will be paid if they are unemployed for at least 24 months.</p>  <p>  JobsPlus is promoted through the Intreo offices nationwide, as well as through employer engagement fora and JobPath, the new approach to unemployed clients who need high support to find work.  Overall, it is worth noting that the first quarter of this year has seen a 30% increase in unemployed persons registering to confirm their eligibility for JobsPlus, compared the same period last year.</p></reply>

Running costs of the Intreo employment and benefits service cannot reasonably be allocated across age groups &ndash; given that, for example, individual staff deal with both young and older unemployed clients in their day-to-day work.  Therefore data on the actual total expenditure on the Youth Guarantee for the years 2014 and 2015 are not readily available.  The YGIP also details how the Youth Guarantee is to be funded through the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) and European Social Fund (ESF).  The YEI is being delivered in Ireland as a dedicated priority axis within the ESF Operational Programme for Education, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020, for which the Irish Managing Authority is the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the total amount allocated to YEI under PEIL is &euro;204,436,257.  This allocation is comprised of &euro;68,145,419 of specific EU funding for YEI, with matching amounts from Ireland&rsquo;s ESF allocation and from Exchequer funding.</p>  <p>  It is intended to claim funding in respect of expenditure on certain programmes which make up Ireland&rsquo;s response to the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee, including Youthreach, the JobsPlus Incentive Scheme and Momentum.</p>  <p>  The overall range of such programmes is set out in the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan, which estimated annual expenditure on the core programmes involved of approximately &euro;336 million, with a further expenditure on other relevant programmes (Apprenticeship and PLC courses) of &euro;192 million.</p></reply>

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.  This strategy has been succeeding; by Q1 2016 the level of employment is up by 159,000 from the lowest level reached in 2012.  Youth unemployment is estimated at 15.0% (27,900 persons) in May 2016 and has fallen from a peak of over 30% at the trough of the recession.</p><p>The Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s <i>Pathways to Work</i>strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan (YGIP).</p><p>Within this framework, the Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment within four months of engaging with the Intreo Service.  The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  In 2015 monthly engagement by case officers with all young unemployed was implemented.  For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training.  Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment.</p><p>Places on most of these programmes are demand led.  While it was anticipated that take-up on the relevant programmes in 2014 might be as high as 28,000, actual take-up was 23,000.  As the economy has improved, inflows into these programmes have decreased further, reflecting the drop in youth unemployment.  There were just over 19,000 places taken up in 2015.  The number of starters during the first three months of 2016 is detailed in the table.  On the basis of the trend in the early part of the year, it is estimated that the full-year intake in 2016 will be somewhat below the 2015 figure of 19,000.</p><p><b>Quarter 1 2016 Starters (information available up to 27th May 2016)</b><table><tr><th>Programme</th><th>Number of starters up to Q1 2016</th><th>Note</th></tr><tr><td>Youthreach</td><td>n/a </td><td>Youthreach (q1 figures will be available in June)</td></tr><tr><td>Community Training Centres</td><td>532</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>JobBridge  </td><td>370</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>T&uacute;s</td><td>258 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>JobsPlus ( including JobsPlus Youth)</td><td>35</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Momentum</td><td>118</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>BTEA (excl Momentum)</td><td>62</td><td>Intake is mainly in September</td></tr><tr><td>BTWEA</td><td>46</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VTOS</td><td>n/a </td><td>Enrolment begins in September</td></tr><tr><td>Former F&Aacute;S/SOLAS</td><td>1319</td><td>Based on Specific Skills Training, Traineeship, Bridging &amp;amp; Local Training Initiative starters. </td></tr><tr><td>International Work Experience and Training</td><td>0 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gateway</td><td>3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Community Employment</td><td>301</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>3,044</td><td>Excluding where figures are not available</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Under the Youth Guarantee the main innovation in dealing with young people on jobseekers&rsquo; payments relates to earlier engagement with this group than is normal under the general activation arrangements for unemployed people through INTREO.  This means that young people on jobseekers&rsquo; payments are referred to a caseworker, and are engaged with more systematically in terms of their rights and responsibilities, at an earlier date than older unemployed people.  For such young jobseekers, engagement with activation measures through the Intreo service is a mandatory condition for continued receipt of welfare payments.</p>  <p>  Any young person with a disability is at all times free to avail of the INTREO service on a voluntary basis and a complete range of activation supports for people with disabilities is available at Intreo Centres.  Young people with a disability, requiring activation/intervention supports, are referred immediately to a caseworker within Intreo or at the Local Employment Service (LES).  There was thus no need to apply the new engagement arrangements to young people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  A caseworker working with a young person with a disability can arrange access for that young client to the full range of services and programmes that are available to young people on jobseekers&rsquo; payments.  This includes access to programmes such as JobBridge, the Back to Education Allowance, and SOLAS training for unemployed people.  The Department is also currently considering how people with disabilities might best be included in any future iteration of the Momentum programme. </p>  <p>  Over and above these general programmes, a caseworker dealing with a young person with a disability can arrange access to a range of additional services and supports that are specific to people with disabilities and are not available to other young jobseekers.  These supports include EmployAbility, the Wage Subsidy Scheme, Community Employment, and Employment Supports including the following; Workplace Equipment Adaptation Grant; Job Interview\Personal Reader Grant; Employee Retention Grant Scheme; Disability Awareness Support Scheme. </p>  <p>  Young people with disabilities also have access to the full range of SOLAS training courses for unemployed people and to Specialist Training Programme provision specific to their needs.</p>  <p>  I hope this answers the Deputies question.</p></reply>

Its aim is to address a previous limitation of the welfare system by explicitly recognising and responding to the reality that some people with disabilities do have a capacity to engage in open market employment while continuing to need some income support.  The scheme is open to people who are in receipt of Illness Benefit (IB) for a minimum of six months, or are in receipt of Invalidity Pension (IP).  The scheme is designed to incentivise such people to return to the workplace.  PCB allows a person to return to work (if they have reduced capacity to work) and continue to receive a payment from the Department.  There is no restriction on earnings or number of hours they can work and participation in the scheme is voluntary.  A recipient of PCB can opt to revert to IB or IP if, for example, their employment ceases or they find they cannot continue to work.</p>  <p>  Subject to the normal reviews, payment of PCB will continue as long as the person has an underlying entitlement to payment of IB or IP.  Therefore, when a person in receipt of IB exhausts their entitlement the payment of PCB ceases, they may (in line with IB requalification conditions) requalify for PCB having accrued 13 additional relevant PRSI contributions.</p>  <p>  There are no current plans to change the qualification conditions for PCB or the duration of payment.</p></reply>

Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness, disability and caring schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process.  Delays can also arise when the application form is not competed fully or supporting documentation is not provided at claim stage; if information is required from social security organisations in other jurisdictions and where additional information has been requested from the applicant but remains outstanding.  For example, pension claims on hand for more than three months typically occur in the case of EU/bilateral pensions where information from other jurisdictions is awaited or, in the case of self-employed, there may be outstanding PRSI liabilities.  These delays impact on the award of household benefits in many cases as these secondary payments are linked to the award of the primary benefit. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Intreo service integrates employment and income supports and provides for a streamlined and personalised service to clients in accessing job opportunities and availing of supports to enable them to get back to work at the earliest possible opportunity.  The Intreo centres also include a single integrated decision-making team that integrate and streamline the processes formerly undertaken by the different agencies now amalgamated into my Department.  Already clients are seeing the benefits of the integrated decisions process in the form of shorter decision times and in the reduced recourse to supplementary welfare payments. </p><p>There is no backlog in family income supplement (FIS), new claims are processed promptly within 2/3 weeks and renewals are processed in advance of the previous claim period ending. </p><p>Treatment benefit is also processed without delay, usually within 1 to 1.5 weeks of receipt. </p><p>90% of Illness Benefit claims are processed within 7 days. </p><p>Both carer&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance, which are means-tested schemes, are experiencing some delays presently.  Delays are also occurring in domiciliary care allowance.  This primarily is due to an ongoing increase in new claim intake over the past few years to all three of these schemes and the complexity attached to processing of these applications.  In addition, there is reluctance, sometimes, on the part of applicants to give full information at application stage thereby slowing down the processing of their application and in some cases necessitating a visit by a Departmental investigative officer. </p><p>Reducing these waiting times is a priority for my Department.  As part of its programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.  The move towards on-line services has begun and a considerable expansion of these facilities will occur in the next year or so. </p><p>In addition, staffing needs are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The main focus of this unit is to ensure that families receive an income maintenance payment, under the terms of the relevant legislation, from my Department. In addition non-Irish homeless families have been referred to this unit directly by the Central Placement Service, operated on behalf of the four local authorities by Dublin City Council, and the staff in the NCU have facilitated booking these people into emergency accommodation.  This accommodation is sourced and funded by Dublin City Council under Section 10 of the Housing Act (1988).  The practice, whereby staff in the NCU act as booking agents in such circumstances, is a residual one from when the NCU was based in the HSE.  Officials from  my Department are considering the appropriateness and nature of the NCU&rsquo;s involvement in the delivery of this service at present.  Information in relation to the number of individuals presenting to the NCU seeking emergency accommodation is not retained.

Passports were subsequently delivered by An Post on 27 May.</p>  <p>  Both passport applications were received by the Passport Service on 29 April through Passport Express.  This service which is operated in partnership with An Post offers a target turnaround time of fifteen working days from posting for correctly completed passport renewal applications.  Unfortunately, in the case of these applications the target was not met.  It should be noted that the target is not a stated guarantee and the volume of passport applications has an impact on turnaround times.  Overall applications are up almost 13% so far this year over last year which is exceptional.</p>  <p>  To respond to the seasonal spike in demand and the more general increase in applications, 223 temporary staff have been recruited so far this year.  This is an increase of 52 officers on last year.  Furthermore, processing work has been redistributed across passport offices in recent months and staff re-deployed from other areas of the Department.  The Passport Service will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure the effective deployment of staff resources and that turnaround times are kept to within target as far as possible.  </p>  <p>  The Passport Service has faced challenges in recent weeks in adequately handling a very high volume of customer queries.  Additional staffing resources are currently being allocated to the customer care area to assist and there will be enhancements to the on-line application tracking function and to web-based communications in the coming months.

Meetings such as those the Taoiseach and I held with President Obama, Vice President Biden, Speaker Ryan, Senator Schumer and other key Congressional contacts around St Patrick&rsquo;s Day have provided an important opportunity to reiterate our concerns in relation to the undocumented Irish and to encourage progress on a comprehensive legislative package by Congress.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Government is aware of and has raised the matter of waivers of three and ten-year travel bans imposed by the US authorities on Irish undocumented who have overstayed their visa in the United States, most notably with President Obama during the Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit to Washington for St Patrick&rsquo;s Day last year.  At my request, the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade wrote to the US Ambassador to ask him to explore the question of such waivers further.  I have also had the opportunity to directly discuss the matter with the US Ambassador on a number of occasions.</p>  <p>  In response to the Government&rsquo;s representations the US Embassy has pointed out that the US waiver system operates uniformly worldwide and is applied in strict accordance with US laws and regulations.  Individuals who have received a three or 10 year ban for overstaying a visa in the US can apply for a waiver and these applications are assessed individually on a case-by-case basis, with the final decision on each a matter for the US authorities in Washington.  The US Embassy also noted it was not possible for applicants to predict with any degree of certainty whether they would be successful in this process.</p>  <p>  The Government has been assiduous in seeking to advance all viable opportunities to achieve relief for our undocumented citizens in the United States.  While I am disappointed that representations to the US on this matter have not resulted in a more encouraging outcome, ultimately it is a matter for the US Government and US Embassy to interpret and implement their immigration laws.</p>  <p>  The new Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our Embassy in Washington, will continue to actively pursue all opportunities to achieve relief for the undocumented with the US Administration and the US Embassy in Ireland.</p></reply>

It represents one of the most pervasive forms of gender based violence.  Its prevalence in certain regions is in general not the result of Government policy but of traditional practice, based on a complex range of factors.</p><p>Experience has shown that, through constructive engagement with Governments and communities, consistent progress on harmful practices such as FGM can be achieved.  While the rate of progress has been uneven, there has been a considerable decline in the prevalence of FGM over the past three decades.  The achievement of agreement at the United Nations in 2015 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development includes a target shared by all UN members to eliminate the practice of FGM by 2030.  Ireland played a central role in co-facilitating the process which led to this agreement and, nationally, advocated strongly for the inclusion of the target on FGM.</p><p>Our trade relations with countries in which FGM is prevalent do not have a particular relevance to the work to eliminate the practice.  They do not in any way prevent us from raising human rights issues.  Ireland has made strong statements against FGM internationally, in particular during our term in the Human Rights Council.  For example, we made specific recommendations in relation to FGM in the context of the Universal Periodic Review of Guinea.  These recommendations were accepted by the Government of Guinea. </p><p>In addition through our programme of development assistance, we focus on tackling many of the root causes of FGM, including persistent poverty, gender inequality, and gender based violence.  Our aid programme in Sierra Leone prioritises the empowerment of women and girls, and in 2015, for instances we provided more than &euro;2 million to address some of the root causes of FGM in the country.  </p><p><font color="#37605E"> </font>We also provide core funding to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) and the UN Fund for Children (UNICEF) which operate a Joint Programme on FGM in 17 countries, including Egypt, Sudan, Mali, Somalia, and Guinea.  In 2015, Ireland provided &euro;7.2 million in core funding to UNICEF, and &euro;2.8 million in core funding to the UNFPA.</p><p>We also support UN Women and the UN Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women.  Operating at local, national and international levels, these UN agencies work to combat gender inequality, to mobilise action by young people, families, communities, and civil society groups to end the practice of female genital mutilation.</p></reply>

When enacted this Bill, together with the 2005, 2007, 2009, 2012 and 2015 Acts, will collectively be the most extensive set of repealing measures in the history of the State, and the most extensive set of statute law revision measures ever enacted anywhere in the world.</font></p><p><font color="#181818">Consideration will be given to continuing with this project in the context of other priorities which I am progressing.</font></p></reply>

In this letter An Taoiseach echoed the concerns previously outlined and expressed the view that Eurostat's approach poses a significant threat to the ability of Governments to continue to use PPPs as a legitimate means of complementing direct Exchequer investment, thereby undermining the generally agreed objective of supporting greater investment in much needed infrastructure across Europe.</p>  <p>  From discussions with colleagues from other Member States, I are aware that Ireland is just one of many Member States to have expressed these views to the Commission.  We will, of course, continue to pursue this matter through appropriate channels, with a view to securing the necessary clarity and certainty in terms of how the ESA 2010 rules are to be applied by Eurostat when determining the balance sheet treatment of PPPs.</p></reply>

However, based on available data sets and making reasonable projections as to future retirements and mortality rates, and factoring in the PSPR amelioration provided by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015, the numbers of pensioners impacted by PSPR over the period 2011 to 2017 are estimated as follows:</font><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Amount</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>84,000</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>90,000</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>88,000</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>88,000</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>87,000</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>70,000</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>48,000</td></tr></table></p><p><font color="#181818">On 1 January 2016, increases in the annual pension thresholds before PSPR applies became effective.  These exemption threshold increases remove PSPR entirely from a significant number of pensions with relatively lower values, while those pensions which continue to be impacted by PSPR receive a boost of &euro;400 per year.</font></p><p><font color="#181818">On 1 January 2017, additional PSPR amelioration, acting principally via further exemption threshold increases, will fully remove PSPR from another significant tranche of public service pensioners, while at the same time boosting those pensions which remain affected by PSPR by &euro;500 per year. </font></p><p><font color="#181818">On 1 January 2018, the third stage of PSPR amelioration will ensure that all PSPR-impacted pensions with values up to &euro;34,132 will be fully restored, meaning that PSPR will no longer affect such pensions, while those pensions which continue to be impacted by PSPR will get a boost of, in most cases, &euro;780 per year.</font></p><p><font color="#181818">This pension restoration across the public service will cost an estimated &euro;90 million on an annual basis and, when fully implemented, will ensure that only the top 20% higher value public service pensions will continue to be impacted by the PSPR.</font></p></reply>

The first is often referred to as a "holding suspension" which is normally part of what might be termed "protective measures".  A holding suspension, or other protective measures, can be applied in specific circumstances pending the outcome of an investigation.  This type of suspension is not a disciplinary sanction and the employee is paid during that process.  Recent case law has established the circumstances under which this type of suspension is appropriate. </p>  <p>  This holding suspension is very different to the second type of suspension, which is suspension as a disciplinary sanction.  Suspension as a disciplinary sanction can be unpaid and should only be applied following a disciplinary process that has complied with appropriate fair procedures. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Civil Service, my Department has responsibility for the design of disciplinary procedures.  As the relevant employer, each Civil Service organisation is responsible for managing disciplinary cases in their own organisation and we do not collate that information centrally. </p>  <p>  My Department has developed a new Disciplinary Code for the Civil Service which will be implemented later this year.

The total Capital allocation on the 2016 Vote of the Office of Public Works (OPW) is &euro;133.9m of which &euro;51.1m is allocated for the Flood Risk Management area.  This allows primarily for costs related to the design, planning and construction of major flood relief schemes and the funding of minor flood relief and coastal erosion works undertaken by local authorities.  Provision is also included for the progression of certain strategic studies and programmes including the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management  (CFRAM) programme, Flood Studies Update and Flood Risk Data Management.  There are almost 40 major schemes currently at various stage of advancement and it is hoped to commence construction on up to eight major schemes this year.  It is therefore envisaged that the full allocation under the Capital Programme will be expended in the current year.</p>  <p>  The OPW has responsibility for maintenance of works completed under the Arterial Drainage Acts (1945 &amp;amp; 1995).  The OPW maintenance programme and funding nationally, including the South West, is fully committed for 2016 in any event.  However, the OPW continuously monitors the projected outturn on each of the Subheads of expenditure on the OPW Vote.  In the event of possible savings or excesses the OPW may apply to the Department of PER to vire funding between Programmes or Subheads.</p></reply>

Together with the Birds Directive, it sets the standard for nature conservation across the European Union and enables all 27 Member States to work together within the same strong legislative framework in order to protect the most vulnerable species and habitat types across their entire natural range within the EU.  The Directive aims to promote the maintenance of biodiversity, taking account of economic, social, cultural and regional requirements.</p><p>Rivers by their nature are a particularly sensitive ecosystem within the broader environment, with many freshwater habitats and species showing higher rates of decline compared to other ecosystems, both nationally and internationally.  In its drainage and flood risk management operations, t<font color="#2F2F2F">he Office of Public Works (OPW) must have due regard to </font>an array of applicable legislation and policy such as Environmental Assessment Directives, Habitats &amp;amp; Birds Directives, the Water Framework Directive, the Wildlife Acts, the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar Convention) and the National Biodiversity Plan.  All works in rivers are required to comply with this ever increasing matrix of environmental requirements.  Authorities proposing works, typically carry out a whole series of investigations and assessments to design the proposed works to minimise any environmental impact ranging from flora &amp;amp; fauna through to archaeology.  In addition, for certain scenarios, third parties have a right for judicial review of environmental decisions or can lodge a complaint to the European Commission where they judge that an Irish authority has not complied with the relevant European legislation.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">OPW has carried out a significant volume of environmental research to increase knowledge and identify methods of operation that are both environmentally sensitive and effective for drainage and flood relief purposes.  A significant volume of research has been completed in partnership with Inland Fisheries Ireland in addition to other research completed with environmental non-government organisations and environmental consultancies.  OPW&rsquo;s Arterial Drainage Maintenance service has developed a suite of Environmental Management Protocols and Standard Operating Procedures which minimise the potential environmental impact of operations.  </font></p><p>While it is acknowledged that the provisions of the Habitats Directive have imposed constraints on the OPW's flood relief and drainage activities in or near Special Areas of Conservation, the Office has altered its procedures and protocols to deal with these constraints in the discharge of its statutory duties under the Arterial Drainage Acts.  It is not envisaged that any work planned for the current year on the schemes under OPW&rsquo;s care will be prevented by issues raised by the provisions of the Habitats Directive.</p></reply>

Any further consideration of remuneration for any group of public servants, including issues relating to more recently recruited public servants, will fall to be examined within the provisions of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013 -2018 (Lansdowne Road Agreement).  Any such consideration  will also of course have to comply with the terms of the Financial Emergency in the Public Interest Acts 2009 - 2013 (FEMPI), as well as its affordability being underpinned through delivering enhanced work place practices and productivity. </p><p>It is particularly worth noting that under the Lansdowne Road Agreement (LRA) the process of restoring public service pay is commencing.  An important feature of this process is the flat rate increases which are  being implemented and which are proportionately more valuable to those public servants including Teachers who are at an early stage in their careers.  Furthermore and specifically in respect of Teachers the restoration of the Supervision and Substitution payment is also provided for under the LRA subject to there being  compliance on the part of the relevant unions with the provisions of that Agreement.</p><p><font color="#181818">  The Programme for Government also states that Government will establish a Public Service Pay Commission to examine pay levels across the public service.  The precise structure of such a commission and the technical aspects as to how it would operate have yet to be decided upon and would require broad consultation, including engagement with staff representatives as was committed to in the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  My officials have begun to review international best practice in respect of public service pay determination models.  This will help frame the Government's thinking on how to establish a fair, transparent and accountable process for determining public service pay, taking into account the views of all stakeholders.</font></p></reply>

It has a conservation remit to maintain the National Monuments in State care and an active role in facilitating presentation and public access under the terms of the National Monuments Act 1930 which makes provision for the protection and preservation of National Monuments including the admission of the public to National Monuments.</p><p>The approach of the OPW Heritage Services is essentially conservation oriented with the bulk of resources dedicated to this end.  The vast majority of properties in State care are presented to the public without specific visitor facilities such as a guide service.  Public access to heritage attractions has a high priority and much effort has been made to improve access and information at all built heritage sites. </p><p>There are a total of almost 1,000 individual National Monuments in State care at approximately 768 locations around the country.  These are managed and maintained by the OPW and include both sites which are in full State ownership and others which are privately-owned but where Guardianship arrangements exist and where the OPW provides maintenance services.  A small number of sites have National Monuments which are State owned and others which are privately held at the same location. </p><p>As a general policy, the OPW facilitates visitor access to as many National Monument sites as possible.  However, access is not always feasible because of a range of issues including physical location, risks associated with dangerous structures and restrictions imposed in some cases by landowners who may wish to limit access, either temporarily or more longer term, by reason of accident risk, livestock etc.  The OPW would estimate that approximately 10% of the National Monument sites in its care are not accessible at any given time.</p><p>As part of its remit, the OPW also provides enhanced visitor access, together with guide facilities in some cases, at approx. 70 of the more prominent visitor locations nationally.  These include many of the most iconic heritage sites in the country such as Kilmainham Gaol, the Rock of Cashel, Newgrange etc as well as a number of smaller, less well known properties.  In general visitor numbers are only recorded at those sites where there is a guide service.  However, there are a small number of sites where footfall counters have been installed.

The management of public expenditure by Government Departments has played an important role in ensuring that these key fiscal targets have been achieved.  The EU Commission has recommended that Ireland has met the requirements to exit the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact at the end of 2015. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy suggests, Public Service Reform was a key element of the Government's response to the crisis and the strategy for recovery.  The reforms implemented over the past five years enabled us to maintain and improve public services in the face of the necessary reduction in staff numbers and budgets, at a time of increased demand for public services.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government recognises that economic and social progress go hand in hand. Only a strong economy supporting people at work can pay for the services needed to create a fair society. The Programme for Government, therefore, sets out a clear strategy for increasing spending in a sustainable way built on stable revenues. </p>  <p>  A second Public Service Reform Plan (2014-2016) was published in January 2014.  While maintaining an emphasis on efficiency and reducing costs, this Plan puts a particular focus on improved service delivery and achieving better outcomes.  The actions set out in the Reform Plan address areas such as: greater use of shared services and innovative approaches to service delivery; increased use of technology and improved engagement with service users; more efficient and effective public procurement; increased accountability and transparency in public decision making; enhanced leadership and performance management; and a continued focus on building the required capacity to deliver reform.    This second Annual Progress Report on the Public Service Reform Plan 2014-16 published in April 2016 sets out the significant progress that has been made over the last year in implementing the cross-cutting reform actions set out in the Plan</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, managing the delivery of public services within Budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and their Department, and important measures are in place to help ensure that these budgetary targets continue to be met.  My Department is in regular communication with all Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against the published expenditure profiles. There is regular reporting to Government on these matters, and information is published monthly, as part of the Exchequer Statement.</p>  <p>  The end-April Exchequer returns show that most Departments continue to manage expenditure within profile. However, these returns provide some indications of areas where there may be some pressures.  As outlined in the analysis of Gross Voted Expenditure published with the Exchequer Returns, Health gross current spending was over profile by &euro;78 million (1.7%) at the end of April.  </p>  <p>  As outlined in the 2016 Stability Programme Update (SPU) it was estimated at that time, on the technical no policy change basis on which the SPU was prepared, that over the course of the year, voted spending pressures amounting to c. &frac14; per cent of GDP could materialise. Given the potential upside to the revenue projections it is envisaged that additional spending of this level can be accommodated within the fiscal rules.</p></reply>

In the process leading up to the publication of the current capital plan: 'Building Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021' the previous Government sought to ensure that  resources were focused where needed in order to protect economic recovery and meet social needs. </p><p>Identifying the capital needs of an economy is undoubtedly a complex process.  To come to a firm view on the scale and composition of infrastructural needs, over the short, medium and long term, a number of factors need to be considered and analysed, such as for example:</p><p>- the existing level and composition of public capital stock;</p><p>- the social and economic value of infrastructure; </p><p>- the scale of the infrastructural deficit;</p><p>- geographic considerations; and </p><p>- economic growth projections. </p><p>It is also very important that the investment is efficient. Assessing the efficiency of investment requires methodologies to identify projects and programmes with the most favourable cost-benefit ratios.</p><p>Investment plans must also be fiscally sustainable.  As we know from our experiences in the period from 2008 onwards, the  costs of a fiscal crisis are such that the funding of investment plans must be strictly consistent with the overarching parameters of budgetary policy.  </p><p>Following final Government deliberations, the 2016-2021 plan was published last September with a commitment to conduct a mid-term review in mid 2017. This commitment has been confirmed in 'A Programme for a Partnership Government'.  </p><p>This review will provide the Government with the opportunity to review capital spending plans and allocate the additional funding identified in the Programme for Government to priority areas. </p><p>In specific terms, the Programme for a Partnership Government has proposed, subject to Oireachtas approval, an additional &euro;4billion in exchequer capital investment up to 2021. Following the mid-term review of the Capital Plan the Government will increase capital investment in transport, broadband, education, health and flood defences.</p><p>In the appendix attached to this reply, details are provided of investment plans in the specific areas referenced in the Deputy's question.</p><p>Appendix</p><p>Road, rail, air and sea transport:</p><p>The Exchequer transport capital allocation is largely framed by the recommendations and priorities set out in the published Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport. These priorities are threefold: to maintain and renew the strategically important elements of the existing land transport system; to address urban congestion; and to improve the efficiency and safety of existing transport networks.</p><p>In recognition of the fact that medium and long-term planning of transport infrastructure is well developed, the &euro;9.6 billion capital envelope for transport will be provided over seven years. This will include &euro;6 billion for investment in the national, regional and local road network and &euro;3.6 billion in Public Transport. A &euro;28 million investment package for safety and security enhancements at the regional airports to ensure connectivity for balanced regional development is also included in the Capital Plan. The largest single project will be a new metro link in Dublin. Based on the outcome of the Fingal/North Dublin Transport Study, the National Transport Authority has recommended that a revised metro project be selected as the appropriate public transport project to address the transport needs of the Swords/Airport/City-Centre Corridor. It is planned that Metro North will be in operation by 2026/2027. </p><p>Access to high speed reliable telecommunications:</p><p>An initial allocation of &euro;275m of Exchequer funding has been provided to the National Broadband Programme as part of the first six years of an envisaged 20 year contract. While it is expected that the network will be built between 2016 and 2020, the overall funding will be spread over 20 years and this envelope represents a proportion of that funding. </p><p>Another significant development in this context is the creation of the Connectivity Fund, which has been formed from the proceeds of the sale of the Government's shareholding in Aer Lingus. The Fund, which operates on a commercial basis, is available to provide support for commercial investment projects with a connectivity theme, including data and energy connectivity.  </p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government also commits to providing additional exchequer capital, if needed, to deliver on the commitment to bring next generation broadband to every house and business in the country by 2020. </p><p>Renewable energy:</p><p>The Government is committed to reducing carbon emissions and increasing our use of renewable energy. &euro;444 million has been provided for investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes from 2016 to 2021.</p><p>Housing:</p><p>Direct Exchequer investment in the area of social housing of nearly &euro;3 billion has been provided. This will help deliver an additional 35,000 housing units by 2020. Around 18,000 of these additional housing units will come on stream between now and 2017 with the balance provided between 2018 and 2020. A further 75,000 households will have their housing needs met through leasing and renting in the private rental sector.</p><p>This is supported by PPP investment of &euro;300m which is expected to deliver 1,500 social housing units. This investment is to be delivered in three bundles, each of approximately &euro;100m with 500 units expected to be delivered through each.  Details of Bundle 1 were announced last October and include:</p><p>- Ayrfield, Malahide Road (Dublin City) - 100 units</p><p>- Corkage Grange (South Dublin) - 100 units</p><p>- Scribblestown (Dublin City) - 100 units</p><p>- Dunleer, (Co. Louth) - 70-95 units</p><p>- Convent Lands (Wicklow) - 60-70 units</p><p>- Craddockstown, Naas (Kildare) - 75 units</p><p>Sites for Bundle 2 have been selected and are expected to be announced by the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government in the near future.</p></reply>

With civil service salaries averaging around &euro;49,000over the period, it can be seen that these retirements gave rise to a gross reduction in the civil service pay bill of c. &euro;300 million. However, it should be noted that there is a corresponding increase in the pension bill. The civil service annual pension pay bill increased by c. &euro;75 million over the same period. This latter number is lower than might be expected because it is affected by savings as retirees die, and pensions generally being slightly less than 50% of pay (which is the rate that applies after 40 years of service).<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>No. of retirees</td><td>1,056</td><td>1,826</td><td>829</td><td>1,275</td><td>1,276</td></tr></table>Voluntary redundancy has been primarily a public service rather than civil service phenomenon with over 900 staff leaving the wider public service over the period, with none in the civil service.</p><p>CSO Earnings and Labour Costs</p></reply>

Significant progress has been made since the publication of the first Public Service Reform Plan in 2011, including in the area of reducing costs.  This includes, for example, a very significant reduction in the Public Service pay bill and changes to terms and conditions such as reduced sick leave entitlements and additional working hours. In addition to the reduced cost of the Public Service overall, reform is also delivering savings across a range of specific areas such as shared services, procurement reform and property management.</p><p>A second Public Service Reform Plan (2014-2016) was published in January 2014.

Between 1976 and 2013, the EUYO was supported by the EU as a Cultural Ambassador under various EU funding programmes in the creative sector.  Between 2000 and 2014, EU programmes for culture have provided the Orchestra with funding worth &euro;10.5m.</p><p>In 2014, the Commission launched <i>Creative Europe</i>, the EU&rsquo;s new programme for the cultural and creative sectors. Competition for <i>Creative Europe</i>funding is extremely strong, and the programme selects only a limited number of projects.</p><p>The EUYO successfully applied for funding in 2014. However, in 2015, the Orchestra's next application was unsuccessful. Indeed out of the 112 projects submitted, I am advised that only 15 were selected for funding. My colleague, Minister of State Sean Kyne, TD, is today attending the Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council, where this matter is on the agenda.

This fund is administered through the local authorities and seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties, and give support to owners/occupiers in their long-term commitment to securing the future of the architectural heritage which might otherwise be lost.  Applications for this scheme have now closed for 2016, and recommended projects are currently being finalised.  </p><p>On 21 October 2015, I launched a new &euro;2 million scheme - the Built Heritage Investment Scheme - for the repair and conservation of structures that are protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).  This scheme is operating via the local authorities on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which ran in 2014.  Its aim is to support a significant number of labour-intensive, small-scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled and experienced conservation professionals, craftspeople and tradespersons in the repair of the historic built environment.  The scheme for this year is now fully allocated.</p><p>The terms and conditions for both these schemes can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.ahg.gov.ie</i></p><p>My role, as Minister for Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht, with regard to the protection and management of our architectural heritage, is set out in the provisions of relevant legislation, as is the role of local authorities. Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides for the protection of architectural heritage and gives local planning authorities primary responsibility to identify and protect architectural heritage by including structures on the Record of Protected Structures. The making of an addition to, or a deletion from, the Record of Protected Structures is a reserved function of the relevant planning authority.  As the structure referred to by the Deputy is currently not on the local authority&rsquo;s Record of Protected Structures, and therefore not protected under the Planning and Development Acts, I would suggest that the local authority is contacted with a view to enquiring about this process.</p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  For 2016, the Council is administering a community based heritage grants scheme available for projects that contributed to particular heritage themes.  The Council would be able to advise if the particular structure referred to by the Deputy would be eligible for funding, now or in the future.

The process included full public consultation and an indepth review of all proposed candidate sites.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department has engaged with local authorities and local groups from the areas with proposals on the Tentative List to gauge the extent of the support available to advance the proposals and to clarify the work and resources required for that purpose.  The fundamental requirement is that each site must be capable of demonstrating Outstanding Universal Value to UNESCO. </p>  <p>  Technical evaluations have been produced for each of the six sites forming part of the Royal Sites serial nomination which are currently being reviewed by experts.  My Department is examining a draft of the Burren evaluation document which will be completed as quickly as possible to allow the evaluation itself to proceed.  In the case of the Historic City of Dublin proposal, this is being advanced by Dublin City Council and my Department is represented on the Steering Committee </p>  <p>  The next steps will involve developing Management Plans for each site (a UNESCO requirement) and the designation of core and buffer zones in each case.  At each stage local consultation is required.  This process will also have to take into account the fact that some sites will be managed by the Office of Public Works, others by local authorities and that two monuments on the Royal Sites list are privately owned.  Another - Eamhain Macha in Armagh - is in Northern Ireland.  The culmination of these steps will be the creation of the full nomination documents for each site for submission to UNESCO. </p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting the current proposals in every way that I can but the process is a lengthy one and all of the work at every stage must be supported and developed from the local level up with stakeholder buy-in and commitment at each and every stage.  While this adds to the timescale, it is infinitely preferable than a top down approach that fails to engage with local communities.  It also ensures a far better chance of best care and support for the protection and preservation of these sites into the future. </p></reply>

It, in tandem with a number of local authorities and village communities, prepared a toolkit which was launched in October 2012 at the inaugural community-led VDS workshop.  The toolkit sets out a step-by-step guide to undertaking a community-led VDS in Ireland, using a collaborative and participative process, and has been developed in accordance with the UNECE Aarhus Convention and the European Landscape Convention (ELC).  The Heritage Council, in collaboration with a number of local authorities, has since been proactive in helping interested communities to develop VDS.  In many ways, the approach followed is similar to the Historic Towns Initiative (HTI) framework, also developed by my Department in collaboration with the Heritage Council, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and relevant local authorities, although it is focussed on smaller communities.</p><p>Given the limited scope for funding, my preference is for the continued fostering of a community-led approach rather than the development of a nationwide plan, while considering the possibility of a prioritised targeted approach to towns and villages with a view to not only protecting their character and heritage, but also contributing to regional development through encouraging economic growth and employment.</p><p>However, all approaches are still under consideration as I seek to further strengthen the protection of our built heritage, which I recognise cannot be achieved without the full engagement of the respective local authorities, local communities and interested organisations.</p></reply>

To date, no public health service in Europe has approved it for reimbursement. </p>  <p>  Each country has its own reimbursement approval process.  The Irish process is laid down in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  Under this Act, the HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products through the community drug schemes.  It is appropriate that these should not be political decisions and that a scientific and evidence-based approach is taken to determine the extent to which patients would benefit from treatment with expensive new drugs.</p>  <p>  Prior to reimbursing a medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness, and the resources available.  The process for reimbursement approval of new high tech drugs in Ireland involves three steps.  The first step involves a rapid review, which has been completed by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) for Orkambi.  The second involves a full health technology assessment by the NCPE.  This process iscurrently being undertaken in respect of Orkambi.  This expert assessment evaluates whether the claims made about the benefits of a new drug are valid, and to what extent, in terms of its impact on issues including life expectancy, quality of life, reducing hospital admissions and a reduced need for transplants.  The NCPE will also consider which patient groups might benefit, how the drug compares with existing treatments and if it is cost-effective at the price sought by the manufacturer. </p>  <p>  On completion of the assessment process, the NCPE will make a report to the HSE for consideration.</p></reply>

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government states that the Government will improve services and increase supports for people with disabilities, particularly for early assessment and intervention for children with special needs.   In that context, the HSE is in the process of reconfiguring services for children with a disability under their National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years).</p>  <p>  The aim of the Progressing Disability Services Programme is to achieve a national, unified approach to delivering disability health services so that there is a clear pathway to services for all children, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability.  The Programme is organised at national, regional and local level and includes representatives from the health and education sectors, non-statutory service providers and parents.  It is envisaged that the Programme, when implemented, will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services for all children who require access to health related supports.  An additional &euro;4m has been specifically allocated in 2016 to drive implementation of the Programme.  This equates to approximately 75 therapy posts.  Following detailed consideration by the Executive, these additional therapy posts have now been allocated and the recruitment process to fill same is currently underway.  </p>  <p>  As implementation of the Programme is a service matter, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

It also provides consultation and advice to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Courts Service of Ireland.</p>  <p>  A wide range of services are provided by the NFMHS, primarily through the Central Mental Hospital (CMH) in Dundrum.  The current provision of these services, and plans to develop this specialty into the future, are outlined in the HSE Service Plan, 2016 and in greater detail in the Mental Health Division Operational Plan 2016 (pages 41-46), both of which are available on the HSE website.  The Operational Plan outlines the service priorities for this year in detail. The NFMHS provides high and medium levels of therapeutic security, within a model of forensic recovery.  This includes, for example, in-patient services at the CMH, along with supports for individuals in community settings or independent living, day centres, and specialised clinics.  Improved service linkages have also been developed, including the Prison In-Reach and Courts Liaison service, and links to the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS).</p>  <p>  The HSE is improving all aspects of the NFMHS, including the construction of a modern forensic facility at Portrane, for both adults and children, to replace the Central Mental Hospital, and the planned development of regional centres, and enhancement of out-reach services.</p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure, and every application must be assessed on that basis. </p><p>Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.</p><p>The Programme for Partnership Government 2016 commits to maintaining a humane approach for discretionary medical card provision.  Under this approach numbers of discretionary cards has risen from 52,232 in June 2104 to 104,671 in May 2016.  The Deputy may be aware of the &quot;Keane&quot; <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility</i>with a key recommendation that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  It also recommended that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  </p><p>The Clinical Advisory Group was established by the Director General of the HSE in January 2015 to provide clinical oversight and guidance to the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system.  Its establishment followed the completion of the work of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility.  The Group is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions.  The Clinical Advisory Group continues to meet on  regular basis and it is expected that the Group will make a report to the Director General of the HSE when it has completed its work in the near future.</p><p>In mid-2014, approximately 11,000 discretionary medical cards were re-issued for a year to enable more sensitive arrangements to be put in place by the HSE.  In order to see further implementation of the administrative arrangements, these cards have been previously extended in 2015.  It is expected that the Clinical Advisory Group will report to the Director General of the HSE in the near future on improvements to take account of the burden of a disease on an individual.  In light of the expected report of the Clinical Advisory Group to the Director General of the HSE, it was decided to extend these cards by a further 6 months in order to allow time for the Minister and the HSE to consider the Clinical Advisory Group's report</p></reply>

An independent evaluation would be an intrinsic element to this initiative; determining the utility, safety and cost-effectiveness of the supervised injecting facility in an Irish context.  The outcome of such an evaluation will inform any decision to licence further facilities.  In line with the experience of other countries which have established such facilities, it would be expected that the numbers would be few and the locations carefully selected to address most effectively the requirements and concerns of the service users and the wider community.  </p>  <p>  There is no finalised costing for the opening of supervised injecting centres.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-31a.1882.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016053100079#WRFF06000"><p>&euro;650m has been made available in Exchequer funding for the new children's hospital project, demonstrating the commitment of both the previous Government and this Government to the project.  The 2014 estimate for the project, as set out in the approved Project Brief, affirmed delivery of  the core hospital, including both satellite centres, within this envelope.  The estimate includes provision for inflation, VAT and contingencies. It does not include equipment or ICT which can be purchased, licensed or leased separately.  Philanthropic and commercial funding streams are to be targeted as appropriate for supporting elements of the project to include car parking and research facilities.  As with any capital project, it is essential that cost estimates be reviewed and refined as appropriate, including making prudent provision for construction inflation.  Ultimately, costs for the new children's hospital project at the St James's campus, and the satellite centres at the Connolly and Tallaght campuses, will be determined during the tendering process, which is expected to be very competitive, with significant interest from contractors.</p>  <p>  The cost of transitioning the new children's hospital to a site at or adjacent to Connolly Hospital has not been assessed in any detail, as no such project exists.  It is of course well understood that construction costs on a greenfield site are likely to be less than on an urban site and this was addressed in the 2012 Dolphin report, and in the further analysis sought by the Minister for Health to inform the Government decision on the location of the hospital.  However, transition of the new children's hospital from the current site at St James's to any other site would require the abandonment of the current project, for which planning permission has now been secured and in relation to which tenders for enabling works contract have been received by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB).  As well as re-opening planning risk for this much-needed hospital, a new site would mean that costs incurred to date would be likely to be, in the main, written off.  More importantly, the new hospital would be significantly delayed; based on the experience at both the Mater campus and the St James's campus, it is likely that if the hospital were to move to a third site, a period of three to four years would elapse before a planning decision was received.  Only then would construction begin, subject to a favourable planning decision.  This much longer timeline would mean that construction inflation would be likely to have a significant impact on project costs.  Together with lost expenditure on the project to date, that could offset much if not all of any savings to be obtained from building on a greenfield site. </p>  <p>  The previous Government's decision on the location of the new children's hospital was not determined by construction cost, but by clinical considerations.  The fundamental aim of this vital project is to ensure the best possible health outcomes for children and young people in Ireland.  As announced in July 2015, it is intended that the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital will relocate to the St James's campus in time, achieving tri-location of paediatric, maternity and adult services on one campus.  Tri-location has benefits for children, adolescents, newborns and mothers.  In all cases, the benefits of tri-location are maximised where the adult hospital provides the broadest possible range of clinical sub-specialties and expertise, and delivers significant breadth and depth of clinical and academic research on site.  St James's Hospital has the widest range of sub-specialties and highest level of clinical complexity of all hospitals in the country, as well as a strong and well-developed research infrastructure, making it the hospital that best meets the criteria to be the adult co-location partner.</p>  <p>  A significant upgrade of Connolly Hospital would be required to achieve the same quality of clinical outcomes as co-location/tri-location with St James&rsquo;s.  As set out in the Dolphin report, Connolly Hospital would need very substantial investment of human and capital resources to develop over time into an adult tertiary hospital with critical mass supported by leading edge research facilities, additional to the capital cost of developing the children's hospital itself on the campus. </p></reply>

However, an estimate of the timeline can be arrived at by considering the work required in order to obtain planning approval at the suggested location.

For example, under the General Scheme the creation of embryos for research and other experimental practices will be prohibited. </p>  <p>  Once the draft General Scheme is complete my Department will conduct a widespread consultation on the document during which stakeholders and members of the public will be invited to share their views.  In addition, the General Scheme will be submitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for pre-legislative scrutiny. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding, the proposed legislation that my Department is developing, research involving embryos is also regulated under the Medical Council's Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners (2016).

A person who contravenes these Regulations is guilty of an offence. </p>  <p>  Medicines which have a high potential to be misused are subject to additional and stricter controls under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  These medicines include benzodiazepines and certain z-drugs.  The Misuse of Drugs Acts and Regulations impose restrictions on the production, supply, importation and exportation of controlled drugs.  A person who has in his possession a prescription medicine containing a controlled drug for the purpose of selling or supplying it in contravention of the Misuse of Drugs legislation, is guilty of an offence under that legislation. </p>  <p>  Following a Court of Appeal decision on 10 March 2015 which declared unconstitutional the section of the Misuse of Drugs Act empowering the Government to declare substances to be controlled under the Act, the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2015 was urgently enacted to recontrol all substances which had previously been declared controlled by Government order.  A further Bill to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act so as to allow the Government to declare substances to be controlled, including prescription medicines, is currently being drafted and is intended to be published as soon as possible.  This will bring under the scope of the Act new substances, and allow the introduction of stricter controls on substances such as benzodiazepines, which are already covered under the legislation.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the problem of abuse of  prescription medicines will not be solved by Regulations alone, and that prescribers need to ensure that these substances are only prescribed as appropriate.  The Health Product Regulatory Authority which is the competent authority for human medicines, Revenue&rsquo;s Customs service and an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work closely to prevent the unauthorised flow of illegal medicinal products into and out of the State.  The enforcement of the law relating to the sale of drugs, including prescription drugs, continues to be a priority in the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling the issue of drug misuse.  </p></reply>

Moreover, there is great diversity in AHR funding and reimbursement policies and practice within Europe, for example, funding of a limited number of IVF cycles, to unrestricted reimbursement with co-payments and third-party reimbursement by private insurance companies.  The cost of AHR treatment in Europe shows marked variability among countries, generally reflecting the costliness of the underlying healthcare system.  There are direct costs such as medical consultations, ultrasound scanning, embryo transfer and hospital charges.  While indirect costs are less well appreciated, they include caring for babies of multiple birth pregnancies (e.g. twins, triplets of which there is a higher incidence in AHR) who tend to have poorer clinical outcomes.</p>  <p>  As outlined previously in my answer to Parliamentary Question Numbers 164 and 165 of 19 May 2016, the former Minister for Health, Leo Varadkar, commissioned an evidence review of international public funding models, which will provide a comprehensive report of the existing evidence, thereby, enabling us to determine the most appropriate funding model for AHR in the State.  This review is still ongoing and, therefore, I am not in a position to provide a more detailed response at this time.</p></reply>

The Department of Health, is at present considering in appropriate detail how best to progress this important commitment, including the need to dovetail this with existing policy and service priorities, and to improve inter-agency linkages such as that relating to the education and youth sectors.  I intend that the Task Force will be established as quickly as possible, and the Deputy may rest assured that I will continue to closely  pursue developments in this regard.</p></reply>

Funding for mental health in 2016 will increase from the 2015 outturn of &euro;785m, to a projected budget of &euro;826m in the 2016 National Service Plan, an increase of &euro;41m or 5.2%, including &euro;35m ring-fenced for new developments this year.</p><p><i>AVFC </i>recommends the provision of 80 additional child and adolescent psychiatric in-patient beds nationally.  The HSE Operational Plan for Mental Health 2016 indicates that there are 76 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) beds in the system, of which 66 are operational at present.  In the context of expanding CAMHS bed capacity, the HSE is endeavouring  at present to address staff recruitment or retention difficulties in certain CAMHS facilities, such as the Eist Linn unit in Cork.  As these staffing issues are resolved, the potential  exists to increase capacity, whether for in-patient or community based CAMHS care, in line with AVFC.</p><p>The issue raised by the Deputy is kept under review by the Department of Health and the HSE.  In relation to the costing of existing or planned staffing provisions raised by the Deputy, as this is service specific, this has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.  If you have not received a reply within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

Progress in this area has been significant, as evidenced by the fact that the number of such admissions to adult units in 2008 was 247, declining to 89 at the end of 2014.  The trend was reversed slightly, with a increase of 6 such admissions in 2015, against the background of increasing demands on CAMHS services overall.  </p>  <p>  In March 2016, 98.7% of bed days used were in Child and Adolescent Acute Inpatient Units, an improvement on 97.2% in February.  Performance continues to be above the HSE Service Plan target of 95%, indicating that where a child has been admitted to an adult acute inpatient unit, the length of stay has been kept to a minimum. </p>  <p>   It is important to note, that while figures for 2015 show 95 admissions of children to adult psychiatric units, the number of admissions does not necessarily equate to the actual number of children admitted, as a child may be admitted on more than one occasion in any given year.  In 2015, there were a total of 356 CAMHS admissions, of which 261 (73%) were to age-appropriate units and 95 (27%) to Adult Units. The HSE National Service Plan 2016 allows for some operational flexibility surrounding emergency placements in Adult Units, particularly where very short-term placements take place, taking account of the preferences of all those involved and geographical factors relating to access  or visiting.  In this context, this HSE continues to monitor all CAMHS admissions to adult units, with a view to minimising admissions to Adult Units as much as possible.</p></reply>

The Strategy aims to provide a set of specific actions that need to be taken to bring about a real improvement in quality of life for Travellers and Roma.  A number of cross-cutting themes have emerged in the consultation process for the Strategy such as accommodation, employment, health and education.  It is intended that the Strategy will include agreed actions in relation to improving the health of travellers.

The overall objective of the Strategy is to continue to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on the five pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.  A Steering Committee, chaired by former General Secretary of the INTO John Carr and with representatives from the Statutory, Community and Voluntary Sectors, has been established to advise on the development of a new National Drugs Strategy, which will cover the period from 2017 onwards.  The Steering Committee has met 5 times this year and on one occasion in December 2015. </p>  <p>  A high level review of the current drugs policy has been undertaken by a panel of international experts, which will highlight the key issues that need to be addressed under the new Strategy.  The Committee will also consider the approach to drug policy in other jurisdictions and a review of international evidence on interventions to tackle the drug problem.  Supply Reduction, Continuum of Care, Education and Prevention and Evidence and Best Practice Focus Groups have been established to advise the Steering Committee on the relevance of the Strategy in tackling problem drug use in Ireland and to identify any gaps arising.  I will shortly be announcing details of the consultation process on the new Strategy, which I intend to be as broad, comprehensive and inclusive as possible. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to a health-led rather than a criminal justice approach to drugs use.  It is envisaged that this approach will be among a range of issues that will be considered by the Steering Committee in the course of developing a new Strategy. </p></reply>

Its main function is to advise Government on the prevalence, prevention, treatment and consequences of the use and misuse of drugs and alcohol in Ireland.  It has been allocated &euro;388,000 by my Department for research projects in 2016. </p>  <p>  In line with the National Drugs Strategy, the NACDA has carried out a number of studies which focus on the impact of substance use on children and young people.  A 2011 study highlighted the need for precise, accurate and timely prevalence estimates to inform policy and the planning of services to meet the needs of children affected by substance misuse.  Knowledge of the overall number of children with parents misusing substances in a particular geographic area is important for quantifying the scale of the issue. </p>  <p>  In 2014, the NACDA commissioned research to estimate the prevalence of children of, or living with, substance misusing parents.  It is anticipated that the results will be published this year.  These estimates will help to assess the potential burden of parental substance misuse on health, social care services and family members in Ireland and hence are of relevance to a variety of policy arenas.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, a Steering Committee has been established to develop a new National Drugs Strategy, which will commence in 2017.  Areas for future research will be determined in the course of the development of the new Strategy.</p></reply>

Under this legislation and regulations made thereunder, over 200 substances (legal highs) were controlled by means of statutory instruments in May 2010 and a further 60 in November 2011.  Substances were controlled either by means of individual names or by means of generic definition.  </p>  <p>  Experience has shown that new psychoactive substances can quickly emerge and there will always be a time lag before such new substances can be made subject to control under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  Accordingly, the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010 was introduced as a general criminal justice measure to deal with new psychoactive substances as they emerge, making it a criminal offence to sell, import or export, for human consumption, a psychoactive substance which was not regulated or controlled under other legislation.  The Act works in tandem with the ongoing controlling of specified substances under the Misuse of Drugs Acts and continues in place as supporting legislation to the Misuse of Drugs Legislation.  On foot of these two pieces of legislation nearly all of the over 100 head shops then existing were closed in 2010.  The legislative actions above were taken in tandem with education and awareness-raising initiatives informing of the potential dangers of the use of psychoactive substances.  </p>  <p>  While there has been no formal evaluation of the approach taken, a study by researchers in Trinity College Dublin published in June 2015 has shown a significant reduction in both recent and problematic use among young people of novel psychoactive substances in the year after the Government introduced legislative changes targeting the sale and supply of such substances.  The researchers acknowledge that the study cannot prove a causal relationship between the closure of the head shops and reductions in NPS use by these adolescents, however their findings have shown that the implementation of legislation, targeted primarily at the vendors of NPS, coincided with a fall in NPS use among this high risk group of teenagers who attend a drug and alcohol treatment service. </p>  <p>  The results of the most recent General Population drugs prevalence survey for 2014/15, which will be released by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol later this year, will provide up-to-date data on the prevalence of NPS use in the population.</p></reply>

At present, eligible land under the scheme is designated by reference to criteria such as stocking density, family farm income, population density and the percentage of the working population engaged in agriculture.  Under the new system of designation which must be introduced in 2018, eligible areas will have to be designated on the basis of biophysical criteria such as temperature, dryness, soil drainage, moisture and stoniness, and slope of the terrain. </p>  <p>  My Department has commenced work on this project, and relevant technical experts are currently working on sourcing and analysing the data in relation to the new criteria.  Once this process is complete, the data will provide the basis for the identification of eligible areas in the ANC scheme from 2018 onwards.

I am pleased to confirm that some 38,000 farmers have been approved into the first two tranches of GLAS, GLAS 1 and GLAS 2, while ensuring adequate provision remains for Tranche 3 of the scheme.  The unprecedented level of applications to the Scheme has meant that for the second tranche of GLAS, priority was given to what are called Tier 1 and Tier 2 candidates, i.e. those who either manage key environmental assets like endangered birds, protected habitats or high-quality water courses, or who have committed to undertake particularly valuable environmental actions like growing feed-crops for wild birds, adopting low-impact tillage techniques or using low-emission slurry spreading methods.   </p>  <p>  Farmers had been urged to present the highest standard environmental plans under GLAS 2, and to adopt actions that would promote them from Tier 3 to a higher tier, thereby significantly increasing the chance of selection.  I am delighted that over 80% of applicants in this second tranche of GLAS opted to do so, and with the funding available to me I have been able to approve all of these. </p>  <p>Some 14,000 applications for GLAS 2 were received on the Departments online system with over 11,500 of these applications receiving approval into the scheme with a contract start date of 1 January 2016.  Based on the eligibility and selection criteria 2,411 GLAS 2 applications were not admitted to the scheme.  An additional small number of applications are currently under review by Department officials, and if found to be successful, will be admitted to the scheme.  </p>  <p>A third tranche of GLAS will open later this year and any applicant who was unsuccessful under GLAS 2 has the opportunity now to re-examine their proposed farm-plan in consultation with their advisor to see how it might be improved to increase their chance of selection under GLAS 3 and submit a new application for GLAS 3 when the scheme is opened.</p></reply>

The Code emphasises that owners and keepers must take full responsibility for the physical and social well-being of greyhounds in line with best welfare practice. Oversight mechanisms in place regarding greyhound exports include inter-agency co-operation, co-operation with fellow members of International Greyhound Forums and from intelligence/information which is received from Welfare Officers during the course of investigations carried out under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 (the Act). Where any breaches of welfare standards are identified under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011, Bord na gCon takes stringent actions and prosecutions ensue in accordance with the Act.</p>  <p>  Officials of my Department have recently met with Bord na gCon and the welfare members of the International Greyhound Forum (represented by the ISPCA and the Dogs Trust) to consider the issues surrounding the export of greyhounds.

The principal requirements of this programme for Ireland each year, insofar as scrapie is concerned, are to take samples and test for the presence of scrapie in 10,000 sheep over 18 months of age which die on farms (fallen sheep) and 10,000 sheep over 18 months of age which are slaughtered for human consumption. The samples must be taken in a manner that is representative of region and season. It is also a requirement that Ireland target its sheep sampling programme so that, over successive years, samples are submitted from all flocks having more than 100 breeding animals. This reflects a known higher incidence of scrapie in flocks with larger numbers of sheep.</p>  <p>  The total number of positive scrapie cases since 2003 is 190, with a peak of 37 cases in 2006. There were 8 cases in 2015 and one case to date in 2016.</p>  <p>  The direct cost to my Department for scrapie testing in 2015 was &euro;0.164m. There is no additional cost to farmers with flocks with more than 100 breeding animals beyond the cost which would arise in any event of the collection and disposal of fallen animals.</p></reply>

The hectares declared must be eligible and must have an agricultural activity carried out on them.</p><p>The governing EU regulations define an agricultural activity as <i>the production, rearing or growing of agricultural products, including harvesting, milking, breeding animals, and keeping animals for farming purposes and maintaining an agricultural area in a state which makes it suitable for grazing or cultivation.</i>An applicant is free to choose an activity that best suits their farming enterprise and if s/he so wishes can choose to just top the land.</p><p>Where an officially approved environmental management plan under the Birds or Habitats Directives requires certain management practices to be conducted on agricultural areas, such management practices will take precedence in determining the level of agricultural activity to be conducted on agricultural areas declared for payment.</p><p>Article 32(2)(b)(i) of Regulation (EU) 1307/2013 provides that an eligible hectare includes any area which gave a right to payments in 2008 under the single payment scheme and which no longer complies with the definition of 'eligible hectare' as a result of the implementation of Directive 92/43/EEC, Directive 2000/60/EC and Directive 2009/147/EC.</p><p>In that regard, the 2016 BPS Terms and Conditions set out details with regard to land eligibility and payments. Section 1.5 refers to land eligibility and states that in order to draw down payment in respect of BPS entitlements, applicants must have an &ldquo;eligible hectare&rdquo; to accompany each entitlement. As previously stated, an eligible hectare is land that is used for an agricultural activity. </p><p>Section 1.5 of the Terms and Conditions further makes reference to The Birds and Habitats Directives and provides that land that no longer complies with the definition of eligible hectare as a result of the implementation of Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds or Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora is eligible for payment where the following conditions are met:</p><p>(i) The land must have been claimed under the 2008 Single Payment Scheme;</p><p>(ii) The land must have been eligible for payment under the 2008 Single Payment Scheme;</p><p>(iii) Any increase in the ineligible area should be directly linked to the  management requirements for the habitat.</p><p>Where an applicant is claiming on land that is otherwise considered ineligible, such land will be deemed eligible for payment where the applicant satisfies the requirements as set out above.</p><p>It is also worth noting that in 2015 all applicants for the BPS were provided with &quot;A Guide to Land Eligibility&quot; booklet which details all the requirements that applicants must comply with to ensure that their land remains eligible for payment. The requirements as set out in this booklet equally apply in 2016. Notwithstanding this, my officials are in constant communication with the Commission to ensure that the legal provisions that relate to land eligibility are being correctly interpreted and applied in Ireland.</p></reply>

Since 2015 a number of simplification measures have been announced by the Commission, with the following range of measures introduced in 2016. These measures are either under way or will be announced shortly.</p>  <p>  Following pressure from Ireland and some other Member States, the Commission has introduced a simplified system of administrative penalties and a &ldquo;yellow card&rdquo; system for first time breaches of certain direct payments rules. This system reduces the administrative penalty by 50% for a first-time breach for minor over-declarations i.e. less than 10% of the overall area. However, the farmer will be subjected to an on-the-spot inspection in the following year. While the implementation of the penalty element of this system can be introduced quite easily, the current requirement to re-inspect all yellow card recipients in the following year is more complex. This requirement will not result in reduced administration costs and I am pressing the Commission to ensure that a more targeted approach is taken on this particular issue.</p>  <p>  The Commission has also introduced a facility allowing Member States to conduct preliminary checks of aid applications which will allow farmers to make corrections to their applications for up to 35 days after the final date of submission, without penalty. This is most welcome and my Department is implementing this system for online applications, which comprise over 75% of all Basic Payment Scheme applications in 2016. </p>  <p>  On Rural Development, the publicity requirements for smaller farmers and the programming rules for financial instruments have been simplified and were recently adopted.</p>  <p>  Commissioner Hogan will announce a greening package at the Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting in June, which is intended to be in place for the 2017 claim year. I would like to see a comprehensive and effective greening package be introduced, given the many difficulties encountered in this area and notified by Member States to the Commission, and have asked for consideration to be given to the requirement to sow catch crops on 100% of arable land under the equivalence criterion.</p></reply>

As one of the proposers of the Dairy Forum my goal is to ensure that it continues to work constructively as a vehicle for addressing issues of concern to farmers and others in the sector. The Forum has come forward with some good initiatives for farmers already, including an initiative on improving cashflow planning at farm level, which will be rolled out shortly.</p>  <p>  The price of milk and dairy commodities is determined by a range of factors, including supply and demand at international level. Food commodity markets including dairy markets have been characterised by significant levels of volatility for a number of years and this trend has continued throughout 2015 and into 2016. Factors contributing to this global price volatility include the Russian Ban and the softening of Chinese demand on one side, coupled with increased production among key global producers, including the EU on the supply side. The longer term demographic and demand perspectives remain positive, but there is no doubt that 2016 will continue to be a challenging year.</p>  <p>  Dealing with price volatility is a major challenge for the sector. The Single Farm Payment provides some measure of income stability, and EU market support measures will have a role to play. These measures are not enough on their own, however. The sector needs to look at measures to reduce costs on farms, and at the development of new tools, including fixed price contracts, futures markets and more flexible financing arrangements for farmers. I expect all of the stakeholders in the sector, including processors and banks, to play an active role in the development of such instruments.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome the EU Presidency conclusions on a package of support measures to address challenges in the dairy and pigmeat sectors agreed in Brussels at Council in March. This follows on from an earlier package of measures agreed in September of last year and takes account of the ongoing difficulties in the sector.</p>  <p>  The package includes a number of proposals by Ireland to the Commission in advance of Council, in particular the doubling of the intervention ceiling for skimmed milk powder and butter. This extra allocation has been utilised in the interim and as recently as last week Commissioner Hogan has indicated the Commission&rsquo;s willingness to further increase this threshold to 350,000 tonnes. SMP intervention is the key EU support tool for dairy markets and helps to put a floor under prices in this extended period of downward price volatility. This extension will be particularly welcomed by Irish producers in the context of Irish dairy production patterns in the dairy sector which peak during the current period.</p>  <p>  In terms of input costs at farm level, Ireland has called on the Commission to consider temporarily suspending EU import tariffs on fertilisers. I understand that the Commission is examining this request at present. At national level, I will continue to support the work of Teagasc, the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation and Animal Health Ireland to increase on farm efficiency and reduce input costs. The EU Presidency conclusions also refer to the possibility of advance payments under CAP, as was done in 2015. In addition my Department recently paid &euro;26.4m in direct aid to dairy farmers, co-funded by the exchequer and the EU, to assist with liquidity and cash-flow issues on dairy farms.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the proposal for the European Investment Bank (EIB) and member states to work together with the Commission on the feasibility of an EU export credit tool. My Department will continue to engage with the Irish banking system to ensure there is a full appreciation of the temporary impact of downward price volatility on farm enterprises which are financially sound in the medium term. </p>  <p>  It remains clear that we need to deal urgently and effectively with this temporary problem. We must ensure that EU farmers are protected from the worst impacts of low commodity prices in an appropriate way, but remain well placed to avail of emerging opportunities when markets recover.  Ireland is strongly positioned as a competitive producer of dairy, and while conditions are extremely difficult at present, Irish dairy farmers will be well placed to avail of the opportunity presented by market recovery in due course.</p></reply>

However at the request of Ireland and some other member states the EU Commission introduced a provision last year permitting payment of the levy in three annual instalments, without interest, on the understanding that the full amount of the levy was paid to the Commission by the Member State in 2015.  The Scheme required applicants to pay at least one third of their levy by October 2015 with the balance to be paid in 2016 and 2017.  Ireland was one of the few Member States to implement this scheme and make it available to its farmers.  The scheme design was agreed in advance with the co-ops and farm organisations here.  The person named by the Deputy is an applicant under this Scheme.</p>  <p>  As part of the discussions in the run-up to the March Council of Agriculture Ministers, Ireland proposed a further deferral of the payment to 2017 and 2018, to ease the financial burden on liable farmers in 2016.  I also raised the matter with Commissioner Phil Hogan, in our recent bilateral meeting, as well as at the recent Council of Ministers meeting and encouraged him to reflect again on whether a legal basis could be found to facilitate a further deferral in superlevy repayments for farmers.  However the European Commission advised that the legal basis for the Regulations underpinning the scheme are no longer in existence and therefore further amendments were not possible.  While Ireland has again raised the matter with the Commission, we understand that the view of its legal services remains that there is no legal basis for any adjustment to the timelines provided for in the relevant regulations.</p></reply>

The application was not approved into the GLAS scheme and accordingly no payment is due under the scheme.  The unprecedented level of applications to the Scheme has meant that for GLAS 2, priority is being given to what are called Tier 1 and Tier 2 candidates, i.e. those who either manage key environmental assets like endangered birds, protected habitats or high-quality water courses, or who have committed to undertake particularly valuable environmental actions like growing feed-crops for wild birds, adopting low-impact tillage techniques or using low-emission slurry spreading methods.</p>  <p>  Farmers had been urged to present the highest standard environmental plans under GLAS 2, and to adopt actions that would promote them from Tier 3 to a higher tier, thereby significantly increasing the chance of selection.  Over 80% of applicants in this second tranche of GLAS opted to do so, and with the funding available were approved.</p>  <p>  As the application by the person named was ranked as a Tier 3 application it was not selected into the scheme.  A third tranche of GLAS (GLAS 3) will open later this year and the person named and any applicant who was unsuccessful in the second tranche will have the opportunity now to re-examine their proposed farm-plan, in consultation with their advisor, and see how it might be improved to increase their chance of selection under GLAS 3 and to submit a new application for GLAS 3 when the scheme is opened.</p></reply>

The largest component of my Department&rsquo;s travel expenditure is required for home travel in the control inspections for EU schemes, animal health controls and meat inspection services. Also, my Department&rsquo;s travel expenditure includes the costs associated with our obligations to attend meetings in Brussels related to the European Union. Additional foreign travel is undertaken for the purpose of increasing access to important third country markets. </p>  <p>  Travel expenditure is continuously being monitored and activities that require regular travel are reviewed with a view to reducing travel costs. In the period 2008 to 2015 the Department reduced annual travel and subsistence expenditure by some &euro;8.259m (54%). These considerable savings have been delivered by deploying technology, improving business processes and rationalising inspections. However, it must be borne in mind that much of my Department&rsquo;s business takes place on farms and other premises, which are in remote locations.</p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming. </p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map 2020, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area, which is the subject of procurement. The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services. The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area where commercial operators have committed to providing services, to ensure that those services are delivered. The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention. The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including County Wicklow.</p><p>Over 750,000 premises are the focus of the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire ( 'PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum. Five responses were received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March 2016. The five responses are being assessed in line with the criteria set down by the Department with a view to shortlist of qualified bidders proceeding to the next stage of procurement. </p><p>The second stage in the procurement process will be a formal invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to shortlisted bidders. I expect that my Department will move to this stage in the next month. The third stage of the procurement process involves the issue of final tender documentation which follows the dialogue process. Following the submission of final tenders by bidders, a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy. The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s). It is expected that contract(s) will be awarded by June 2017.</p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and / or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht. Once contract(s) are in place, I expect to publish a detailed rollout plan for the network. </p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits also to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys will lead on the establishment of county or regional broadband taskforces,  working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p></reply>

Limerick. However, an application for that facility has been received under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme (LASPP).</p>  <p>  The Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme (LASPP) provides grant aid to local authorities towards the capital costs of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools. Askeaton Swimming Pool was included in the 2000 round of the LASPP and received the maximum grant of &euro;3.8m for a replacement pool which was officially opened in August 2007.</p>  <p>  In January of this year, my Department contacted local authorities and sought expressions of interest in a limited round of swimming pool allocations, subject to funding becoming available from other projects where those projects would not be progressed.</p>  <p>  Prior to the closing date for expressions of interest Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council contacted my Department to enquire about the nature of the projects likely to be funded and mentioned that Askeaton Pool and Leisure Centre required remedial works. Limerick CCC was informed that the intention was to fund new pools in locations where no pool currently existed and there was a very significant demand for a pool. Limerick CCC was also informed that, given that Askeaton Pool was already included in the 2000 round of the programme and had received the maximum grant of &euro;3.8m, it was unlikely that any further funding would be provided to it. Limerick CCC subsequently submitted an expression of interest for remedial works for Askeaton Pool.</p>  <p>  There were three expressions of interest received for new pools, two of which were valid and both in Dublin. Having assessed existing commitments and the funding available, including funding that will become available from withdrawn projects, it was considered prudent to progress one additional new pool project at this time. Following consideration of the expressions of interest, and the two valid proposals for new pools, it was decided to include the proposal from South Dublin County Council (SDCC) for a new swimming pool in Lucan in the LASPP.​</p></reply>

Retention of the existing company structure and transfer of the Ministerial shareholding in the company to the local authority; or</p>  <p>  2. Dissolution of the existing company structure and transfer of all assets, liabilities and employees into local authority structures, where the port will be administered as a functional area of the local authority.</p>  <p>  The local authorities concerned have commenced a due diligence process with the ports due to be transferred.  My Department has provided some funding towards the process and continues to liaise with local authorities and ports with regard to facilitating the transfer process and the model of transfer.</p>  <p>  With regard to funding for ports, National Ports Policy clearly outlines that commercial port companies must operate on a commercial basis without recourse to State funding for dredging or infrastructure development.  While there is no Exchequer funding provided to ports, ports are encouraged to explore all other avenues of funding available to them.</p>  <p>  Following the transfers of the Ports of Regional Significance to local authority control, where a port company transfers under the transfer of shareholding model, the company will continue, as before, to fund all activities, including dredging, from its own resources. In the case of a port company that is dissolved and transferred directly under a local authority, it will continue to generate income from port activities under the local authority.</p>  <p>  In relation to D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has procured consultants to conduct the due diligence of the company as part of the planned transfer of the company to the Council.  This exercise is intended to assist in the decision as to the most suitable model of transfer.  The procurement and management of the due diligence process is a matter for the Council, and I understand that the process is now well advanced.  In addition, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council have established two transitional teams which are working on the practical issues associated with the transfer.</p></reply>

The fees cover the test undertaken at the testing centre, cost of the certificate of roadworthiness (CRW) and a road safety levy payable to the Road Safety Authority in respect of an annual test.</p>  <p>  In this jurisdiction, the CVR testing system is operated on a fully commercial basis and without any financial contribution from the State.  This means that commercial vehicle roadworthiness (CVR) tests are delivered by privately owned garages who are responsible for the provision of the necessary infrastructure and facilities and they carry the financial and operational risks associated with that investment.</p>  <p>  The road safety levy is being used to fund several aspects of the commercial vehicle roadworthiness reform programme which is intended to support safer roads and compliant operators.  The RSA has financed the upfront capital investment associated with the reform programme to date.</p>  <p>  The model for commercial vehicle testing was reviewed and it was decided by Government that the prevailing model involving the delivery of commercial testing by privately owned garages should continue. Accordingly, I do not have any plans to revisit the test fees at this time.</p></reply>

This is subject only to the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000. There is nothing to prevent employees reaching individual or collective agreements with employers on higher rates based on qualifications or other agreed criteria.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment and equality legislation, including the National Minimum Wage Acts and the Organisation of Working Time Act, protects all persons legally employed in Ireland on an employer-employee basis and provides robust safeguards for employees. </p><p>The Industrial Relations Act 1946 provides that a trade union, or any organisation or group of persons claiming to be representative of workers or employers in any sector can ask the Labour Court to establish a Joint Labour Committee (JLC) for their sector. </p><p>A JLC is composed of equal numbers of representatives of employers and workers in a sector and they meet regularly, under an independent chairman, to discuss and agree terms and conditions, including pay, to apply to specified grades or categories of workers in the sector.  When it reaches agreement on terms and conditions, the JLC publishes details and invites submissions.  If, after consideration of any submissions received, the Committee adopts the proposals it will submit them to the Labour Court for consideration. The Labour Court will then make a decision on the adoption of the proposals. If the Court decides they should be adopted it will forward a copy of the proposals to the Minister. If it is considered appropriate to do so, an Order giving effect to such proposals will be made by the Minister. Such an Order is known as an Employment Regulation Order. The Hotels Joint Labour Committee Establishment  Order was last amended in January 2014 on foot of a Labour Court review of JLC's.</p><p>There are Joint Labour Committees in place for the Catering Sectors based in Dublin and outside of Dublin and Hotels based outside of Cork and Dublin. However, due to non-engagement of employer bodies within those Sectors, no EROs have been made which would set down terms and conditions for employees in other areas of the country. Therefore the only legally enforceable minimum rates of pay in those areas are those provided for in the National Minimum Wage Acts. </p><p>If employees are not receiving their entitlements they can choose to have a complaint investigated by an Inspector from the Workplace Relations Commission or adjudicated upon in a hearing.  If an employee believes that his/her rights may have been infringed and would like to obtain redress he/she should contact the Workplace Relations Commission on Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90 or via its website <i>www.workplacerelations.ie</i>.  Complaints can also be submitted electronically on the &quot;Workplace Relations e-Complaint Form&quot; which can also be found on the Commission&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

The Report of the Copyright Review Committee entitled &ldquo;Modernising Copyright&rdquo; was published in October 2013.  In its Report, the Committee made in excess of 60 recommendations covering a diverse range of copyright issues with a view to modernising the copyright regime in Ireland.   Since the publication of the Report, my Department has conducted extensive analysis of the recommendations, including an in-depth assessment of the complex legal issues involved in certain of the proposals with the Office of the Attorney General, as well as examination of the proposals from a policy perspective.  I hope to be in a position, over coming weeks, to bring to Government the Department's response to the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations and, to seek approval for legislative proposals in relation to a number of the Committee's recommendations.</p>  <p>  In addition, the European Union (Collective Rights Management) (Directive 2014/26/EU) Regulations 2016 were recently signed into law in Ireland.  The Directive puts in place a harmonised system of governance for the operations of Collective Rights Management organisations (CMOs) across the EU.  CMOs represent the licensing rights of copyright owners including authors and artists and collect royalties in relation to the use of their copyright protected works.  The Directive as transposed in law in each Member State will strengthen the rights of copyright holders, including artists, to receive remuneration for the use of their rights in a timely manner.</p>  <p>  Artists who are employees in Ireland have the same rights as all other employees. In cases of self-employed artists, as with other self-employed workers, the application of competition law would only be a consideration if there are allegations of anti-competitive behaviour.</p></reply>

The number employed in such companies experienced a relatively small dip during the recession but has now not only recovered but has reached the highest FDI employment levels in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s history, with over 187,000 employed at the end of 2015. Our work in continuing to attract international investment in Ireland will be guided by both my Department&rsquo;s strategies on Enterprise and Innovation and IDA Ireland&rsquo;s own five-year strategy &ldquo;Winning - Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019&rdquo;. Other government departments also play a crucial role in delivering on complementary policy actions, such as the National Skills Strategy 2025, to provide an environment that is conducive to job creation and supports the development of a competitive and sustainable enterprise mix.</p><p>IDA is now working to challenging targets over the period 2015 to 2020, namely:</p><p>-  to create 42,000 net additional jobs</p><p>-  to win an additional 1,080 investment projects</p><p>-  &euro;3.6bn in RDI investment by overseas firms</p><p>In addition to promoting Ireland to first-time investors, IDA Ireland continues to work in partnership with its existing client base to explore additional investment opportunities, with 70% of all investment projects coming from already established companies who want to expand their presence here.</p><p>As part of the growth strategy, IDA Ireland is committed to increasing the level of investment into each region of Ireland by between 30% and 40% and is working as part of a team of stakeholders in each region under the eight Regional Action Plans published by my Department. A key support measure in achieving the ambitious targets for the regions is the significant IDA property investment programme announced in February 2015. This programme of investment will ensure that there is an adequate supply of first-class property solutions to attract investment.</p><p>Under the Global Sourcing Initiative, both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are working together to maximise the opportunity for greater sourcing of materials and services by multinationals from indigenous.

The mandate for their negotiation derives from the Cotonou Agreement of 2000, between the EU and the ACP states.  Their central objective is the reduction and eventual eradication of poverty, consistent with the objectives of sustainable development, and the gradual integration of the ACP countries into the world economy. These Agreements aim to promote regional integration and integration into the world economy, and to enhance predictability and secure legal certainty.  Trade Agreements are implemented in a gradual manner with favourable trade preferences given to our African partners.  They are negotiated on a regional basis and are coupled with targeted co-operation and assistance to help ACP countries implement them.  They are expected to have a positive impact on our ACP partner countries.</p>  <p>  The timing of ratifications is, of course, linked to the legal requirements of relevant signatories and the need to maintain a World Trade Organisation-compatible trading regime.  Since the conclusion of three EPAs with African countries in 2014, the EU has been working with the 27 African countries involved to achieve ratification by 1 October 2016.  Ireland has played its part in this process.  Ireland signed the EU-West Africa Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) in December 2014 and this Agreement was approved by the D&aacute;il on 26th November 2015.  The signature, subject to ratification, of the EU-Southern African Development Community EPA and the EU-East African Community EPA was authorised by Government on 17th May 2016.</p>  <p>  Ireland is actively engaging in ongoing consultations on timing of implementation to ensure that these important trade and development Agreements can achieve their potential to support the development priorities and needs of these African countries.  We believe that the implementation of these agreements will promote economic growth and assist in the overall strengthening of democratic institutions and help these less developed countries take their place in the global trading community.</p></reply>

Section 45 makes similar provision in respect of Labour Court decisions under the Act which remain unimplemented after a period of 42 days.  It is an offence to fail to comply with an order under section 43 or 45 of the Workplace Relation Act, directing an employer to pay compensation to an employee. The Act provides for a defence to proceedings for this offence for the defendant to prove on the balance of probabilities that he or she was unable to comply with the order due to his or her financial circumstances.

The purpose of the insolvency payments scheme, which operates under the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act, 1984, is to protect certain outstanding pay-related entitlements due to employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer. These entitlements include wages, holiday pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of minimum notice due under the Minimum Notice &amp;amp; Terms of Employment Acts, 1973-2001, and certain pension contributions.  Various other statutory awards made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal, Rights Commissioners, etc., are also covered by the scheme. There are statutory limitations on the amount payable. The Minister for Social Protection, Leo Varadkar T.D., has responsibility for the administration of the payments from the insolvency payments scheme.</p>  <p>  There are companies which cease trading without engaging in a formal winding-up process and in some such cases those employers may owe monies to their employees.  Such employees are not eligible for payments under the insolvency payments scheme.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection has previously indicated that it is reviewing the position to establish what, if anything can be done to progress payments to individuals in these situations.</p></reply>

This increase has been in full-time jobs rather than casual or temporary jobs, with full time jobs accounting for most of the jobs growth. The CSO data for April 2016 indicates that in the year to April 2016 the number of casual and part-time workers decreased by 8.3%, while part time under-employment has also fallen year on year &ndash; from 114,800 in Q1 2015 to 99,100 in Q1 2016.    While the latest CSO jobs figures and the trends in those figures are very encouraging, I am committed to considering an appropriate policy response to the report of the University of Limerick of their study of zero hour contracts and low hour contracts in the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  The University of Limerick was appointed in February 2015, following a competitive tendering process, to carry out a study into the prevalence of zero hour contracts and low hour contracts in the Irish economy and their impact on employees. The study, published in November, 2015, found that zero hour contracts as defined within current Irish employment rights legislation are not extensively used in Ireland. It found low working hours can arise in different forms in employment contracts, such as regular part-time contracts with fixed hours or a contract with &ldquo;If and when&rdquo; hours only or a hybrid of the two. If and when contracts are contracts where workers are not contractually required to make themselves available for work.</p>  <p>  The UL report made a range of recommendations relating to contracts, hours of work and notice, minimum hours, how contracted hours should be determined, collective agreements, data gathering and wider contextual issues.</p>  <p>  It is important to point out that the UL study was an independent study and the conclusions drawn and the recommendations made in it are those of UL. Therefore, it was essential that the various stakeholders who contributed to the study and indeed other interested parties who may not have had an opportunity to engage with UL, were given an opportunity to consider and respond to the report. </p>  <p>  To this end, my Department sought submissions from interested parties by way of a Public Consultation. A large number of submissions were received by 4 January 2016, the closing date for receipt of such submissions. The responses contain a variety of views both for and against the findings and recommendations as made by UL, which require, and are currently being given, careful consideration by my Department. This will inform the policy response to be considered by Government arising from the study.</p></reply>

My predecessor published the draft Scheme of a comprehensive, consolidated Consumer Rights Bill for public consultation in May 2015 and indicated that he hoped to submit the draft Scheme to Government for approval in early 2016.  In December 2015, however, the European Commission published legislative proposals for Directives on consumer contracts for the supply of digital content and consumer contracts for the online and other distance sale of goods.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposals overlap very substantially with two of the main parts of the draft Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill.  Discussions on the digital content proposal at working party level have proceeded rapidly with a first reading of the proposal completed by April 2016.  At its next meeting on 9 June, the Justice and Home Affairs Council is due to have a policy debate on the digital content proposal with a view to approving the common understanding of basic principles identified during the first reading and to endorsing political guidelines for future work on the proposal.  </p>  <p>  In this situation, I will have to give serious consideration to whether it would be premature and inadvisable to bring forward a legislative proposal to the Oireachtas when a directly related and fully harmonised legislative proposal is proceeding through the European Union legislative process.

No. 500 of 2015 pursuant to EU Council Regulation No. 524 of 2013. </p>  <p>  To date, one ADR entity has been successfully notified as a qualified entity under the notification procedures operated by the CCPC and a number of applications are under consideration.  With regard to the matter of whether a dispute resolution entity chooses to seek qualification as a notified ADR entity under the legislation, this is a decision proper to an individual organisation and neither the CCPC nor my Department have any statutory function to compel dispute resolution entities to undertake the notification process necessary to achieve statutory notification.  However, the CCPC affords assistance to dispute resolution entities who indicate their intention to undertake the notification process.   </p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them.

Where the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), which is responsible for securing compliance with employment legislation, receives a complaint involving somebody described as an au pair, the WRC will investigate with a view to establishing whether a person has statutory entitlements under employment law.  Complaints involving au pairs are considered on a case-by-case basis, in the light of the facts of each case. </p></reply>

I am advised that based on evidence elsewhere in this area, an intensive bail supervision scheme for young people should impact on trends for the remand of young people in custody by offering courts a new option &lsquo;bail with supervision&rsquo; (as an alternative to a remand in custody to detention) following an assessment of suitability.  This alternative option should also help a young person to moderate their chaotic circumstances and promote greater stability and pro-social behaviour during the period of bail.</p>  <p>  This proposal is in line with actions outlined in the current Youth Justice Action Plan 2014-2018.  It is envisaged that this scheme will ensure that detention as a last resort is possible and judges will have available to them information on how a young person is progressing on compliance with bail conditions laid down by the court.  The scheme will provide support through the use of intensive therapeutic supports to assist the young person to desist from anti-social behaviour and support families during the period of a remand on bail in the community.</p>  <p>  I have asked my Department to finalise the contract to operate the new scheme as soon as possible this year.  The scheme will operate initially on a pilot basis in the Dublin area.  It will be available at the discretion of the presiding Judge and will have a prescribed reporting system back to the courts through the Probation Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Oberstown Children Detention Campus.  The detailed procedures and responsibilities for each partner agency are currently being developed and this will also involve consultation with the Judiciary.  An Inter-Agency Implementation Team chaired by the Irish Youth Justice Service will monitor the scheme.</p></reply>

Tusla had previously provided funding of &euro;184,000 to the Rape Crisis Network in 2014.</p>  <p>  The funding provided to Rape Crisis Network Ireland by Tusla up to 2014 included provision for the maintenance and development of a database, incorporating data gathered and recorded by rape crisis centres dealing with the survivors of sexual abuse. Tusla was concerned that the database was not representative of all Rape Crisis Centres and because of difficulties experienced by Tusla in accessing data for routine reporting and service planning purposes, funding was not renewed.</p>  <p>  Both the Convention on Preventing and Combatting Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention) and the EU Victim&rsquo;s Directive set out clear obligations on parties/Member States to collect data for reporting purposes. Also, the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence published by Cosc - The National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence (Department of Justice and Equality) - sets out expectations of core data to be collected by all agencies under the strategy. In the context of Tusla&rsquo;s statutory obligations to both adults and children, it is important that the Agency has fully functional information systems that satisfy its evolving needs. </p>  <p>  Tusla, as the statutory body with responsibility for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, made a decision to develop its own comprehensive dataset for these services and Tusla has now commenced work on the development of this dataset. </p>  <p>  As part of revised governance arrangements, funded sexual violence services will provide information directly to Tusla, creating, for the first time, a comprehensive dataset on all such services funded by the Agency. This information and evidence is critically important as Tusla continues to reform services to ensure the best possible response is provided to survivors of domestic, sexual and gender based violence.</p></reply>

However since the Referendum there have been other legislative enactments, in particular the Child and Family Relationships Act 2015, which required the  amendments to the Adoption Act 2010, that are included in the Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2016.

This Bill is intended to facilitate access to adoption information and operates on the basis of a presumption in favour of disclosing information in so far as is legally and constitutionally possible for both domestic and inter-country adoptions. The Bill was always envisaged as a stand-alone piece of legislation, to address the complex issues of retrospective and future adoptions.

No.57 of 2015 was intended to be on mothers and children accommodated in Homes for the purposes of extended ante- and post-natal maternity and infant care services. On that basis it would not have been appropriate to consider the institutions raised by the Deputy as Mother and Baby Homes, as they did not provide the specific range of services referred to above. </p>  <p>  However, in accordance with Article 1(VII) of their Terms of Reference, the Commission is directed to investigate the exit pathways of children from the specified institutions listed in Appendix 1 of the relevant S.I. and to examine the extent to which other institutions were part of the entry or exit pathways for single mothers and children into or out of these Homes. It is certainly open to the Commission to give consideration to the types of institutions raised by the Deputy in this context. It should also be noted that the issues to be examined by the Social History Module described in Article 11 (I) of the Terms of Reference explicitly cite adoption societies in this regard. </p>  <p>  It is also notable that mechanisms within the terms of reference were specifically included to take advantage of the investigative powers, resources and expertise of the Commission to ensure that any additional matters which the Commission may deem to warrant investigation can be brought to the attention of Government. This is not limited to matters within the direct scope of its investigations, but may also include issues which it considers to warrant further investigation in the public interest.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that this independent Commission has sufficient scope to examine a broad range of concerns, and to make a determination on their relevance to the central issues in question, and where appropriate to make any recommendations to me which the Commission deems necessary.</p></reply>

Tusla complaints procedures are set out in Part Nine of the Act. In the first instance, it is sought to resolve complaints locally where, for example, the parent and social worker seek to resolve the issue. Complaints officers investigate complaints as appropriate and reviewers re-examine cases where the service users do not accept the findings of the complaints officers.</p><p>In addition, appeals procedures apply to decisions taken by foster care committees and decisions to place children on the Child Protection Notification System. The current policy and procedure for the management of consumer feedback including complaints is <i>Your Service Your Say</i>and a bespoke complaints policy is in development.</p><p>The Ombudsman for Children can investigate complaints made against Tusla by a child, or on behalf of a child, as well as initiating its own investigations where the Ombudsman considers it appropriate.  Complaints can also be made directly to the Office of the Ombudsman which investigates complaints regarding services delivered by public bodies.</p><p>While HIQA cannot investigate individual complaints, information received by HIQA can trigger an inspection of a service. Information can be sent to HIQA regarding child welfare and protection services, statutory and private fostering services and children's residential services. CORU regulates health and social care professionals and deals with registration and complaints regarding social workers.</p></reply>

I am not aware that there is evidence of any adverse effect on governance and accountability generally.  In the case of Tusla, its interventions are in the common good for the welfare and protection of children.  As with any statutory body, Tusla has been established under legislation that is subject to the provisions of the Constitution and review by the courts.</p>  <p>  Tusla was established under the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013. The establishment legislation includes detailed provisions with regard to the accountability obligations of the Agency. Tusla is also required to operate in accordance with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies. My Department closely monitors compliance by Tusla with these obligations.  It should be noted that most children received into care are there on the basis of a court order under the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991.  This position has not changed with the passing of the Referendum.  The legislation setting up Tusla, together with the Child Care Act, 1991 (as amended), and related child care regulations and standards have children at their centre.  This legislative framework is also respectful of the rights of all citizens as they are framed in the light of the Constitution.  The 31st amendment of the Constitution does not in any way dilute these safeguards.</p></reply>

The subsequent report to the court will advise and give reasons if an application for a care or supervision order is being recommended, as well as an indication of what other services the child may need from Tusla. </p><p>Tusla has advised that the Central Section 20 Office referred to by the Deputy was established in the 1990&rsquo;s under the former Eastern Health Board to provide reports for the court in relation to custody and access cases.  Initially, there were 6 staff assigned to the team and over the years this number reduced due to the non filling of vacancies.  In mid 2015, the decision was made to disband the Section 20 Office.  At that time staffing consisted of 0.6 Social Work Team Leader and 0.8 Social Worker posts.  Tusla does not now have dedicated Section 20 departments or teams.</p><p>I can confirm that all section 20 requests go to the local areas and are allocated according to the principles of caseload management.

ECCE can be delivered through formal childcare settings, but also in some instances, by registered childminders. In Budget 2016, my Department announced a significant expansion to pre-school provision under the ECCE programme.  This expansion will see the number of children benefitting from the Programme  rise from around 67,000 to around 127,000 in a given programme year.</p><p>  My Department funds 30 City and County Childcare Committees (CCC) around the country. The CCC staff support parents to access appropriate childcare and they also support providers to deliver and develop their service.  Pobal also assists my Department and the CCCs to identify any issues with supply and demand.</p><p>  In response to the expansion of ECCE announced in Budget 2016, and to support the development of capacity in the sector, my Department has initiated a number of actions. The  Department made detailed information available to the City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) at the beginning of this year indicating the number of children, by every electoral division across the country, who would be eligible for an ECCE place in September 2016, January 2017 and April 2017. My Department continues to work closely with the City and County Childcare Committees to match this data against reported capacity in the sector to meet the increase in demand.  My Department is working with them on the development of action plans for areas where a shortfall in supply has been identified. Although Tusla, local authorities and other statutory bodies have no specific remit in relation to the supply of ECCE places, my Department will liaise with any bodies who have a role in facilitating the provision of childcare capacity as required.</p><p>  My Department also announced the introduction of an Early Years Capital Programme earlier this year with total funding of &euro;4 million available.  This funding was targeted at early years pre-school providers that are making alterations to their services to accommodate increased numbers of children. The maximum grant available under this programme is &euro;10,000. The closing date for applications was 8 April, 2016 and I hope to announce the successful applicants in the coming weeks.</p><p>  Beyond the ECCE programme, my Department has taken measures to ensure grater access to the Community Childcare Subsidy (CCS) for eligible families. Whilst traditionally this subvention was only available through Community (Not for Profit)  Childcare facilities, it has now been extended so that private childcare facilities can access it and pass the subvention onto eligible families.</p><p>  If the Deputy is aware of capacity issues in a particular area, I would welcome receiving this information from him to pass to my officials.</p></reply>

The Committee has an advisory and consultative role to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in matters to do with youth work, including the coordination of youth work programmes and services. In line with these provisions, a new National Youth Work Advisory Committee was appointed by the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with a term of office of one year with effect from 28 January 2013. The Committee continued to work with my Department and assisted with the development of the new National Youth Strategy, in particular in identifying in what ways the youth work sector can contribute to shared policy objectives for young people.</p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy 2015-2020 was published on 8th October, 2015.

The implementation structures established by my Department under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures, the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People will oversee the roll out of the National Youth Strategy. There is no doubt that the youth work services have a significant contribution to make to realise the goals of the National Youth Strategy as part of a cross sectorial, whole of society approach to supporting young people in their everyday lives.  For this reason, the key youth sector interests are represented on the structures established by my Department to support the implementation of Better Outcomes Brighter Futures. At national level, representatives of the voluntary youth services have been appointed to the Advisory Council. At local level, youth sector representatives participate in the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Services Committees. Key Government departments and agencies that have an interest in children and young people and that had served on the National Youth Work Advisory Committee are represented on the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Consortium and on the Sponsors Group that have been established under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures to drive the effective implementation of the policy framework.</p>  <p>  There have been other significant policy and legislative developments that are relevant to the provision of youth services and the role of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee. These include, the setting up of the North South Education and Training Standards Committee for youth work and the introduction of the Education and Training Boards, Act 2013 which, inter alia, provides for a statutory function for Education and Training Boards in supporting the provision and assessment of youth work services at local level.  At EU level, the Council of Ministers for Youth has adopted an EU Youth Strategy and has taken a number of policy initiatives to promote quality in the provision of youth work services. The National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-making 2015-2020, which was published by my Department in June, 2015 is particularly relevant. I am deeply committed to ensuring that young people are involved in the preparation, planning and implementation of policies that impact on their lives.</p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the youth work sector, the voluntary youth services, the Education and Training Boards, other government departments and agencies and consults with young people themselves in the development and delivery of policies and services for children and young people.</p>  <p>  I intend that the role of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee will be considered in the light of these developments and in relation the implementation arrangements in place to achieve our national strategies' objectives to secure the best possible outcomes for young people.</p></reply>

The Initiative which is funded under the Dormant Accounts scheme will target those young people aged 15 to 24 years who are most at risk of unemployment and who are not in education, employment or training. Under the Initiative, &euro;600,000 will be provided to the voluntary youth services, to support the provision of innovative programmes for these young people to enhance their employability skills and competencies.   My priorities include the further development of this type of initiative, as well as mentoring and other support programmes for vulnerable young people.

In line with a Government decision in the context of the 2000 White Paper and affirmed in the White Paper on Defence published in August 2015, the proceeds from the sale of properties that have been identified as surplus to military requirements are allocated to the Defence capital programme for investment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces. Regarding benefit to the local community, as you may be aware in 2013 part of the original Magee Barracks site was acquired by the Department of Education and has been redeveloped to provide a new school for the community. I also understand that the local development plan for Kildare Town 2012-2018 has made provision for a wide ranging use of the site including substantial community amenities thereby ensuring that the local community will benefit directly from the sale.</p></reply>
