These figures continue to show the positive trend which was seen in November 2015, with improvements across all waiting list categories. This can be seen in Cappagh Hospital where no patient is waiting longer than 15 months for in-patient / day case treatment. This is within the maximum permissible waiting times that I set in January 2015 of  18 months by 30 June 2015 and 15 months by year end 2015. </p>  <p>  In 2015, the HSE was provided with additional funding to maximise capacity across the public and voluntary hospitals or to fund outsourcing activity, so that patients&rsquo; needs could be met within the maximum allowable waiting times. </p>  <p>   An additional allocation of &euro;3.5 million was provided to Cappagh Hospital which enabled it to treat 537 more in-patients and 571 more day case patients in 2015 as compared with 2014. Since the start of 2015 ( with the enhanced 2015 allocation) the Hospital has increased  its theatre use from between 2 and 3 Theatres per day in 2014 to between 3 and 4 Theatres per day in 2015 </p></reply>

Last year additional funding of &euro;18 million was provided to support acute hospitals over the winter period by providing additional bed capacity and other initiatives to improve access to care.  As a result of this an additional 301 beds were commissioned  across various locations and to date 202 of these beds have been opened. Taking into account these beds recently opened, there are 10,705 acute beds available beds in January 2016.  </p><p>In short I have reversed the policy of previous Governments to reduce the number of acute hospital beds.</p><p>The HSE advised that the  occupancy rate to the end of December 2015 for hospitals with an  emergency department is 91.1%which is above the norm of 85%, although there is variation between hospitals and over time.  </p><p>It is not just a case of how many beds you have but the type of beds, how efficiently they are used and the extent to which primary ambulances and community care contributes to reducing the need for acute hospital stays.  The understanding and focus has shifted from an over-reliant on in-patient acute beds to a more comprehensive range of care options as are found in  advanced health systems. The aim is to ensure  the patient or service user has his or her needs  met in the most effective way possible with the majority of care  provided through community based facilities, supported by appropriate technology and specialist expertise. The HSE is continually developing and improving day services and developments which facilitate hospital admission avoidance that include:</p><p>-  Increased provision of Community Intervention Teams delivering services outside of hospitals;</p><p>-  Better access to diagnostics on an ambulatory basis so that people don't have to be admitted just for tests;</p><p>-  The development of infusion clinics in hospitals so that people can have chemotherapy and other therapies without having to stay overnight;</p><p>-  Increased day surgery rates;</p><p>-  Medical Assessment Units and Acute Medical Assessment Units opened at all major hospitals;</p><p>-  Intravenous administration of antibiotics whether organised at outpatients departments, in the community or at home, which can deliver bed-day and cost savings and reduce risk of healthcare associated infections; and</p><p>-  Better use of technology to support patients and primary care professionals in managing illnesses and accessing specialist opinion and support.</p></reply>

Following its publication, the Department of Health initiated a major costing project, involving the ESRI, the Health Insurance Authority and others, to examine the cost implications of a change to the particular UHI model proposed in the White Paper.</p><p>The reports detailing the estimated cost of this UHI model were published on the 18 November 2015. Having considered the findings, I concluded that the high costs associated with the White Paper model of UHI are not acceptable and decided that further research and cost modelling in relation to the best means to achieve universal healthcare are needed. </p><p>The next phase of research will include deeper analysis of the key issue of unmet need and a more detailed comparative analysis of the relative costs and benefits of alternative funding models. This work will be carried out under the auspices of the joint Department of Health/ESRI Three-Year Research Programme on Health Reform. Both the research undertaken to date and that planned in the next phase of the costing exercise will assist in deciding on the best long-term approach to achieving the goal of universal healthcare.  </p><p>I should add that when I assumed the Office of Minister for Health, I concluded that, whilst progress had and was being made in relation to the programme of health reform, the original timeline for implementation of UHI was too ambitious.  However, I also emphasised both my commitment to progressing health reform and my determination to push ahead with four key building blocks: Healthy Ireland and the public health agenda, building sufficient capacity to satisfy unmet demand, the expansion and development of primary and social care and reforming structures, ICT and financial systems with key initiatives such as the phased extension of GP care without fees, the establishment of Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations, the implementation of activity-based funding and the improved management of chronic diseases. These are all major milestones on the road to universal healthcare and have the potential to drive performance improvement and deliver significant benefits in terms of timely access to high quality care. </p><p>Already GP care without fees has been successfully introduced for children under the age of 6 years and all people aged 70 years and over. This has resulted in approximately 800,000 people now being eligible for GP care without fees, without having to undergo a means test. The under 6s service includes age-based preventive checks focused on health and wellbeing and the prevention of disease, including the asthma and diabetes of care.</p><p>In Budget 2016, the Government made financial provision for the extension of GP care without fees to all children aged 6 to 11 years.  It is envisaged that this third phase will bring the total number of those eligible for universal GP care, without having to be assessed by a means test, to approximately 1.2 million people. </p><p>The progress made in recent years in introducing universal health care together with the improvement in public finances provides a very good basis upon which to plan the next phase of improvement in our health services.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-02-02a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016020200049#WRA01800"><p>Last November I received approval from Government to the drafting of a Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. This Bill is now being drafted as a matter of priority. This is a different Bill to the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The latter is effectively a Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) No. 1 Bill, with the other a No. 2 Bill as soon as it is introduced.</p>  <p>  The Health  (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill being drafted  provides for amendments to the Medical Practitioners Act 2007; the Dentists Act 1985; the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005; the Pharmacy Act 2007; the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011; and the Health Acts 1953 and 2004 to provide for:</p>  <p>  -  consequential amendments required by the transposition of Directive 2013/55/EU;</p>  <p>  -  an appeal against minor sanctions;</p>  <p>  -  amendments in relation to a number of issues.</p>  <p>  As the provisions in relation to registration are being amended consequential to the Professional Qualifications Directive, I am taking the opportunity to remove the equivalence of the certificate of experience as a requirement for entry to the Trainee Specialist Division. This would mean that entry to the Trainee Specialist Division for doctors with non-EEA qualifications would be by way of the Pre-Registration Examination System (unless exempted) and the offer of a specialist training post by the HSE in a recognised training programme.  </p></reply>

Prior to reimbursing any medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available to the HSE.</p>  <p>  Decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics. They are not political or ministerial decisions. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics conducts the health technology assessment of pharmaceutical products for the HSE, and can make recommendations on reimbursement to assist the HSE in its decision-making process.  </p>  <p>  Nivolumab is currently being considered by the HSE under the national medicines pricing and reimbursement assessment process. As the assessment process is ongoing, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this process, which is an independent function of the HSE.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-02-02a.30.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016020200049#WRA02200"><p>Over the past few years, the National Ambulance Service (NAS) has undertaken very significant reconfiguration, and modernisation, of its services.  The NAS now operates on a national and regional, rather than a local, basis.  Ambulance resources, including rapid response vehicles with advanced paramedics, are dynamically deployed over an area, from individual stations within, and surrounding, that area.  This helps to ensure that optimum cover is provided, and that the NAS is best placed to respond to incidents as they arise.  In the Connemara area, for example, resources, including a rapid response vehicle, are located strategically at bases in Clifden, Carraroe, Galway, Loughrea, Tuam and Ballinasloe.  </p>  <p>  I understand that the NAS Capacity review has now been completed and will inform how NAS deploys resources across specific areas in the future.  The review involved a comprehensive analysis of overall resource levels and their distribution against demand and activity. It will help NAS identify where resources should be placed to best meet the needs of the service at national and regional level, including from bases outside traditional ambulance stations.  For example, in Connemara, a rapid response vehicle, crewed by an advanced paramedic, may offer a more effective model of pre-hospital emergency care for the needs of the area.  This resource could be used to ensure that a patient receives advanced life support, at the scene, prior to the arrival of an ambulance.    </p>  <p>  I also draw the Deputy's attention to the Emergency Aeromedical Support (EAS) Service which was established on a permanent basis last year.  This very valuable service ensures that seriously ill or injured people, in more remote areas, have timely access to appropriate, high quality clinical care.  The EAS is targeted mainly at western counties, where the road network may not allow for rapid transport to the nearest appropriate hospital.  Helicopter-based transport for these patients allows for greatly reduced transit times, particularly for time-critical transfers such as STEMI heart attacks, stroke or major trauma.  Last year, the EAS received over 800 requests for medical assistance and completed 400 aeromedical missions.  University Hospital Galway received 143 EAS-transferred patients.</p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;7.2m provided in the National Service Plan will provide for further improvements in 2016, and ensure that response times are maintained.  This includes &euro;2m to recruit and train extra staff and expand the Community First Responder (CFR) Scheme.  The CFR Scheme trains and supports local volunteer groups to respond to cardiac emergencies and is, I believe, particularly important in rural areas such as Connemara.  The NAS will continue to work with CFR Ireland to develop CFR schemes within the area to enhance patient care delivery.  They are also engaging with HSE Estates regarding the utilisation of new primary care centres as ambulance deployment points.</p></reply>

In addition, the HSE identified a further 154 closed beds in the system, which it is intended to re-open in order to support hospitals during the winter period.  Currently, 111 of these beds are available.  </p><p>The detailed information sought by the Deputy on the location of the additional beds is set out in the tables below. It should be noted that the numbers identified are the beds available at a particular date in time. The number of beds available can, of course, fluctuate due to short term closures, such as, for example, infection control measures. I understand that, while no additional beds were commissioned in University Hospital Waterford (UHW) directly under the initiative, 48 beds have been made available in the South/South West Hospital Group, of which UHW is a constituent hospital; 30 of these beds have been opened to date.</p><p>Along with other acute hospitals, UHW has prepared a winter capacity plan to help address the expected increase in demand for services. Measures taken have included opening additional beds as required, better managing patient flow, discharging patients appropriately, providing internal surge capacity, both of beds and staff, as well as prioritising diagnostics for in-patients to facilitate their earlier discharge. A new Community Intervention Team is now in place to help manage the clinical needs of some patients within the community, obviating their need for admission or reducing their length of stay in the hospital.</p><p>In addition to UHW&rsquo;s winter planning measures, the HSE has approved further funding to support the opening of an additional 15 beds in UHW.  I am advised that staff recruitment to support these beds is currently being progressed. </p><p>Table 1: Additional capacity to open during winter period.<table><tr><th>Hospital</th><th>Total planned in July 2015</th><th>Total number of beds open at 21 January 2016</th></tr><tr><td>RCSI Hospital Group</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Our Lady of Lourdes Drogheda </td><td>8</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>12</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Connolly</td><td>24</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Ireland East HG</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>St Vincent's University Hospital</td><td>22</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Loughlinstown</td><td>10</td><td>0*</td></tr><tr><td>Navan</td><td>15</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>12</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>10</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Cappagh</td><td>10</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Midlands HG</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Tallaght</td><td>16</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>University Of Limerick HG</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>University Hospital Limerick</td><td>27</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>South/South West HG </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cork University Hospital</td><td>30</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Mercy University Hospital</td><td>18</td><td>0*</td></tr><tr><td>Saolta HG</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Merlin Park</td><td>14</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>30</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Letterkenny</td><td>10</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Portiuncula</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Children's HG</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Temple Street</td><td>14</td><td>0*</td></tr><tr><td>Tallaght </td><td>14</td><td>0*</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>301</td><td>202</td></tr></table></p><p>Table 2: Additional capacity being progressed over and above the 301 beds agreed in July 2016.<table><tr><th>Hospital</th><th>Total planned in July 2015</th><th>Total number of beds open at 21 January 2016</th></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>14</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Naas</td><td>11</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>25</td><td>25</td></tr></table></p><p>Table 3: Closed beds in the process of re-opening.<table><tr><th>Hospital</th><th>Beds closed in October 2015</th><th>Beds open at 21 January 2016</th></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>17</td><td>0*</td></tr><tr><td>Beaumont</td><td>33</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>University of Limerick</td><td>29</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Naas</td><td>15</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>St James's </td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Tullamore</td><td>15</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>St John's </td><td>20</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Cork University Hospital</td><td>20</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>154</td><td>111</td></tr></table></p><p>*No additional beds have been opened yet, pending recruitment of required staff which is ongoing.</p></reply>

A diagnosis is not required under the Nursing Home Support Scheme, so we are not in a position to clarify how many of these have an Acquired Brain Injury. Although most families would prefer to be able to care for their loved ones at home, hospital/nursing home care is at times necessary and it forms part of the continuum of care. The Nursing Home sector is used in developing options to meet the needs of young adults with a disability where no other alternatives are possible. The HSE need to regularly review these individuals to see if through their care plan a more appropriate option might be available. In the longer term the policy is to develop a more tailored service suitable to meet the needs of these service users. </p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive  provides for the health needs of those affected by brain injury through a range of measures. Brain injury health services are provided across a range of settings, by different organisations and by many health professionals and carers.  The HSE Clinical Strategy and Programmes Directorate have a number of clinical programmes that are working in the area of neurology, including Neurology, Epilepsy, Stroke and Rehabilitation Medicine. The clinical programmes are focusing on reducing waiting times/lists, addressing disease specific pathways and models of care with a view to developing a national framework for the management of long-term neurological conditions. The HSE also provide services for those with brain injury through Primary Care Teams with community based therapy services and personal social services. Substantial funding is also provided to a number of organisations such as Acquired Brain Injury Ireland, Headway Ireland, Enable Ireland, Spina Bifida Hydrocephalus Ireland among others, to provide supports and services to people with a neurological condition. </p>  <p>  Last year, the Government, announced an additional &euro;15 million for the redevelopment of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dun Laoghaire. This allocation will enable the National Rehabilitation Hospital and the HSE to proceed with a new 120 bed building on the Dun Laoghaire campus. The redeveloped facility will be purpose built to accommodate integrated therapy services, hydrotherapy and sports facilities. </p>  <p>  The Government recognises that neurological illness or injury has significant implications for the individual and their family and impacts on their health, social, educational, vocational and recreational participation. It is important that the continuum of services and supports required are made available by the health system and by those other State agencies to provide specific services, consistent with their statutory remit.</p></reply>

The plan will be rolled out at a regional and local level and will involve full consultation.</p><p>In terms of housing, the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government are working in collaboration to support the transition of people with a disability from institutions to social housing in the community under the Government's <i>National Housing Strategy for People with Disability 2011 to 2016.</i></p><p>The HSE Social Care Operational Programme 2015 set a target of  moving 150 people from institutions into the community in 2015. I am pleased to note that significant progress has been made in achieving this goal as 137 individuals had moved from congregated settings at the end of December 2015.  I understand that the majority of this number, moved to community placements and others moved to alternative appropriate accommodation, including moving in with family and moving into long term nursing home care, in line with their personal care plans.</p><p>All such moves require careful care planning by service providers in association with clients, families and communities.  The HSE has advised me that there are a number of factors which meant that fewer people than planned moved to the community in 2016. These included:</p><p>-  a shortage of suitable housing</p><p>-  difficulties in accessing Capital Assistance Funding (CAS) from the Department of the Environment</p><p>-  inability of service providers to support individuals with capacity issues to sign tenancy agreements pending the enactment of &lsquo;Capacity Legislation&rsquo;,</p><p>-  inability of some service providers to support transition costs</p><p>-  changes in family and or personal circumstances.</p><p>I am pleased to note that Department of Health officials followed up with the HSE, Department of the Environment and the Housing Agency to resolve problems regarding access for people with disabilities to funding from the Capital Assistance Scheme.  Arising from this process, the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment developed new Guidelines under the Capital Assistance Scheme to enable housing associations/service providers to apply for funding to acquire suitable accommodation for people moving from institutions in 2016.</p><p>I am assured that HSE and local authorities will continue to work together under the structures set up under the Housing Strategy to inform and guide local housing provision for people with disabilities over the next few years.</p></reply>

Funding was allocated in 2015 for additional consultant posts including two consultant orthopaedic surgeons, anaesthetist and support staff at Crumlin. Capital funding was also provided for a new theatre on site to expand theatre capacity further. The 2016 Service Plan specifically provides for support for the new theatre capacity and the continued development of paediatric scoliosis services to address ongoing capacity deficits. </p>  <p>  In order to address waiting times in the interim, patients from Crumlin have been transferred to other hospitals where capacity is available and where that is clinically appropriate.  These include Temple Street, Cappagh, Tallaght and the Blackrock Clinic.  External capacity has also been identified at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital at Stanmore in the UK.  </p>  <p>  As a result of these initiatives, at the end of 2015 no child was waiting longer than 15 months for scoliosis surgery. In addition, I am advised that no child is currently waiting longer than 15 months at Crumlin for an outpatient appointment at the hospital. The Department of Health is continuing to work with the HSE, the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group and the hospitals themselves to ensure that we continue to make strong progress in addressing this issue and to identify all options to further improve access times for surgery.</p></reply>

This difficulty is being experienced by other English speaking countries including the UK, Australia, and Canada. Notwithstanding this, the HSE Census returns for the end of November 2015 show that we have over 880 more nurses employed in the public health services than a year ago. </p>  <p>  Recruitment of additional nurses is the subject of considerable ongoing activity by the HSE and voluntary hospitals. Recruitment campaigns are underway in Ireland and abroad. This includes recent and ongoing national and local interviewing of General Nurses, Mental Health, Intellectual Disability, Registered Children's Nurses and Midwives.</p>  <p>  A number of measures have been put in place to support recruitment of nurses from abroad. In 2015 the HSE  initiated a targeted international recruitment drive. This focused initially on Irish trained nurses who left for the UK during the moratorium and has now been expanded to countries further afield. It also facilitated seven adaptation programmes and made 405 places available to the nursing home sector for overseas nurses. Further adaptation courses are being provided in 2016 for nurses who are required to complete a course prior to registration. The NMBI have approved, on a pilot basis until June 2016, a new aptitude test with the RCSI as an alternative method to assess candidates for registration. Nurses are currently being advised of the availability of this test. The first theory test for 22 people took place on the 5   December 2015 with the practice tests on the 12/13 December and repeats on the 7 January 2016. All candidates were successful between the 2 practical tests. Further tests are planned by RCSI in January, February and March, with 67 prospective nurses having expressed an interest in taking the test. </p>  <p>  In the context of supporting recruitment and retention of nurses, consideration is being given to the pay rates for fourth year student nurses undertaking the 36 week clinical placement and whether the placement should attract incremental credit, as provided for in a Chairman's Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement.</p>  <p>  All of the measures mentioned above will facilitate the recruitment and retention of nursing staff at all grades and disciplines within the Irish health service.  My Department is in regular contact with the HSE on matters concerning the recruitment of nurses and midwives and other key staff.</p></reply>

This provided around <b>1,150</b>additional posts to enhance mental health and suicide prevention services generally.  Of these, approximately <b>950 </b>posts were filled at the end of November last, and the remainder are at various stages of the recruitment process. Around 300  of these posts were approved for the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS). There are continuing challenges in relation to recruitment of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Consultants and we are actively trying to recruit both at home and internationally.</p><p>The HSE National Service Plan 2016 aims to improve placement of children in age appropriate mental health settings.  The 95% target indicated in the Plan allows for some operational flexibility surrounding emergency placements in Adult Units. It is generally accepted that it remains quite challenging for the HSE to meet this ambitious target, relative to progress over recent years and in light of increasing demands generally on CAMHS. Progress on this important issue has nonetheless been significant, underscored by the fact that, while there were 247 such admissions to adult units in 2008, the trend has been declining annually since, to 89 admissions in 2014.  It is a priority for the HSE to keep such admissions to a minimum and this is kept under constant review.</p><p>I have prioritised CAMHS  in the new funding made available by Government, designed to support timely access to appropriate services to address the mental health needs of all children, while emphasising the early intervention and integrated service perspectives. Additional resources and facilities means that we now have 67 CAMHS Teams, and 3 Paediatric Liaison Teams, supported by 66 operational  CAMHS beds across the country.</p><p>The HSE is committed to ensuring that all aspects of CAMHS services are delivered in a consistent and timely fashion, including improved Access to age appropriate units. The Executive introduced, around June last, a new <b>Standard Operating Procedure</b>for both in-patient and community CAMHS services. This has contributed to improving the services overall, including reducing inappropriate admissions of adolescents to adult units. It is designed also to help reduce CAMHS Waiting Lists, particularly for those waiting over 12 months.  </p><p>There were 90 admissions of the type raised by the Deputy over the period January-November 2015. The majority of these were voluntary with parental consent. Approximately 85% of these were 16 -17 year old; a third of these were discharged within 2 days of admission, and two thirds within a week. However, in relation to this latest trend, it should be noted that an extra 8 CAMHS beds recently opened in the new Linn Dara Unit in Dublin, which  should help decrease pressures on CAMHS admissions to adult units. It is intended to open further CAMHS beds in the system, as on-going staffing and recruitment difficulties generally for the mental health area are addressed.</p><p>Bearing in mind all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the HSE is making good progress in relation to the issued raised by the Deputy, including the wishes of each young person and their parents or guardians, taking account the complexities of each case.  In many cases, a multi-disciplinary or inter-agency approach is required. I will continue to closely monitor this issue, in conjunction with the HSE, to ensure that the new funding I secured for mental health overall for 2016, will contribute to improving CAMHS services, and aiming for age appropriate admissions across all regions.</p></reply>

The Health Service Executive (HSE) provides for the health needs of those affected by brain injury through a range of measures.  The HSE Clinical Strategy and Programmes Directorate have a number of clinical programmes working in the area of neurology, including Neurology, Epilepsy, Stroke and Rehabilitation Medicine.  The HSE also provides services for those with brain injury through Primary Care Teams with community based therapy services and personal social services, often funded through partner agencies in the non-statutory sector.  In addition, the HSE provides substantial funding to a number of organisations such as Acquired Brain Injury Ireland, Headway, Enable Ireland, Epilepsy Ireland among others, to provide supports and services to people with a neurological condition.</p>  <p>  In August 2015, my colleague, the Minister for Health, announced an additional &euro;15 million for the redevelopment of the National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH) in Dun Laoghaire.  This allocation will enable the NRH and the HSE to proceed with a new 120 bed building on the Dun Laoghaire campus.  The redeveloped facility will be purpose built to accommodate integrated therapy services, hydrotherapy and sports facilities.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises that neurological illness or injury has significant implications for the individual and their family and impacts on their health, social, educational, vocational and recreational participation.  It is important that the continuum of services and supports required are made available by the health system and by those other State agencies to provide specific services, consistent with their statutory remit.  On the health side, waiting times, access, treatment and quality of care are priorities for reform for this Government, despite budgetary constraints.</p>  <p>  I have also referred the question to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy in relation to funding and numbers.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-02-02a.95.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016020200051#WRC01500"><p>The Government is committed to the provision and development of services for children with special needs, including those with autism, and to improving access by these children to therapy services insofar as possible within available resources. </p>  <p>  Health related therapy supports and interventions for children, such as speech and language therapy, can be accessed through both the Health Service Executive's primary care services and its disability services, depending on the level of need.  It is estimated that up to 95% of people's health and social service needs can be met within a primary care setting and most children with a disability or developmental delay will have their needs met by their local primary care services.  The specialist disability services look after children with more complex needs, including autism.</p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;20m was allocated in 2013 to strengthen primary care services and to support the recruitment of prioritised front-line posts, including over 260 additional posts for Primary Care Teams, of which 52 were speech and language therapy posts.  In addition, the HSE has introduced a number of initiatives specifically in relation to speech and language therapy such as therapists increasing clinic based work instead of domiciliary work and providing family centred interventions in a group as opposed to a one-to-one setting, whenever possible.  This will help address the issue of waiting lists and ensure that services are delivered in as equitable a manner as possible, within available resources.</p>  <p>  The HSE is also currently engaged in a major re-organisation of its existing therapy resources for children with disabilities, including autism, aged up to eighteen years, into geographically based specialist multi-disciplinary teams, as part of its National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years).  The key objective of the Programme is to enhance equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of the individual child's difficulties, with health and education working together to support children to achieve their potential.  The transition to this new model is taking place on a phased basis and includes consultation and engagement with stakeholders, including service users and their families.  The Programme is a key priority for the Executive's Social Care Directorate.  An additional &euro;4 million was specifically allocated in 2014 to drive implementation of the Programme, equating to approximately 80 therapy posts, including 27.5 speech and language therapy posts.  Further investment of &euro;4 million (equating to &euro;6 million in a full year) was provided in 2015 to support ongoing implementation of the Programme.  It is anticipated that this additional investment will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services to all children with disabilities, including those who need speech and language therapy inputs.</p>  <p>  Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services remains a particular priority for the Government.  Within this context, funding is being provided in 2016 to expand the provision of speech and language therapy through primary care services and to support the reorganisation and expansion of speech and language and other therapies under the Progressing Disability Services Programme.  Full implementation of the Progressing Disability Services Programme is expected before the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  The provision of speech and language therapy services to persons with a disability is an operational matter for the HSE and I have arranged for the question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with you.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-02-02a.128.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016020200051#WRC04800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104, 106, 131 and 135 together.</p><p>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is the lead Department for severe weather emergencies and the Office of Public Works (OPW) has responsibility for capital flood relief activities.  However, the Department of Social Protection has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as flooding.</p><p>The Department's humanitarian assistance scheme was approved by Government in November 2009 and the Government authorised the spending of up to &euro;10 million.  Almost &euro;4 million has been paid under the scheme from 2009 to end 2015. </p><p>In early December 2015, the Department activated this scheme, administered by the local Community Welfare Service (CWS), to assist householders affected by the severe weather conditions.  Since early December 2015, support has been provided to some 424 households at a cost of over &euro;498,700 (overall average payment c. &euro;1,176).  A breakdown of these payments by county is provided in the following tabular statement. <i></i>Statistics are not maintained on the number of applications received under the humanitarian assistance scheme.</p><p>In dealing with emergency events of this nature, the Department generally adopts a three stage approach as follows:</p><p>-  Stage 1 is to provide emergency income support payments (food, clothing and personal items) in the immediate aftermath of the event.  A relatively small amount of financial assistance is generally provided initially with payments around the country ranging from &euro;100 to &euro;500 depending on family size.</p><p>-  Stage 2 generally involves the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items.  It is not until the flood water abates and houses dry out that the full extent of the damage to homes will become known.</p><p>-  Stage 3 is to identify what longer term financial support or works are required.  It could take several months before this stage of response commences and this may involve a cross Departmental/Agency response.  Works carried out can include plastering, dry-lining, relaying of floors, electrical re-wiring and painting.</p><p>The scheme is demand led and there is a time lag between the flooding event and actual claims for financial support.  In relation to the case mentioned by Deputy Calleary, the person concerned received assistance under stage 2 of the humanitarian assistance scheme in December 2015.  Department officials advised the person to submit quotes regarding the extent and costs of damage incurred and requested further information in relation to insurance cover.  Once the necessary information is provided to the Department, a decision will be made regarding the provision of supports under stage 3 of the scheme.</p><p>People seeking assistance should contact their local DSP Intreo Centre or CWS office who will be able to offer assistance.  Department contact phone numbers for persons in affected areas are available on the Department's website, as follows:</p><p><i><font color="#0000FF">www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Humanitarian-Assistance-Scheme.aspx</font></i>.</p><p>The purpose of the Department's humanitarian assistance scheme is to provide assistance to households whose homes have been affected by flooding and other severe weather events, but would not include preventative works such as flood barriers.  The OPW is the lead agency for flood risk management.  The OPW's food risk management programme, the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme will publish its Flood Risk Management Plans, this summer, with the feasible flood prevention measures to manage flooding in those areas at significant risk and impact from flooding.  In the context of the CFRAM Programme, the Government recently announced two pilot Individual Property Protection (IPP) projects.  These are community based pilots to inform the mechanism to deliver IPP, as part of a community based approach or scheme and also the potential costs and benefits attached to IPP for areas where a flood defence scheme is not likely to be completed for some time.  I am advised by the OPW that these pilots will, in time, inform any extension of IPP to other areas.</p><p><b>Humanitarian Assistance Payments by County (4</b><b><sup>th</sup></b><b>December 2015 - 29</b><b><sup>th</sup></b><b>January 2016)</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Number of Households </th><th>Amount</th></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>63</td><td>&euro;119,231</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td>143</td><td>&euro;99,396</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td>31</td><td>&euro;74,296</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>38</td><td>&euro;35,169</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>19</td><td>&euro;23,798</td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td>31</td><td>&euro;20,478</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td>13</td><td>&euro;18,318</td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td>6</td><td>&euro;17,469</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>9</td><td>&euro;13,622</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td>9</td><td>&euro;13,224</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>4</td><td>&euro;12,737</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>16</td><td>&euro;10,994</td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td>6</td><td>&euro;10,654</td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td>9</td><td>&euro;8,895</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>10</td><td>&euro;8,194</td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td>5</td><td>&euro;3,910</td></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td>2</td><td>&euro;2,415</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td>4</td><td>&euro;2,400</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>2</td><td>&euro;1,389</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>1</td><td>&euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td>2</td><td>&euro;650</td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td>1</td><td>&euro;500</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>424</td><td>&euro;498,739</td></tr></table></p></reply>

If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160. </p><p>The Labour Market Council is a group comprising of independent industry leaders and labour market policy experts from organisations including the OECD, SIPTU and the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed. The Council has responsibility for driving the implementation of the Pathways to Work strategy and for advising on labour market policy. That is why I have asked the Council to examine the reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for those under 26 years of age. I expect that this report will be available from the Council by the middle of this year.</p><p>The impact of the reduced rates for persons under 26 years of age progressing from the Live Register was considered at the last Labour Market Council meeting on the 18<sup>th</sup>of January and is due to be discussed further at the next Council meeting on the 22<sup>nd</sup>of February. These discussions will be informed in the first instance by information supplied by my Department as well as drawing on the broad and varied range of experience and knowledge among the Labour Market Council members.  It will be a matter for the Council to consider if, and if so what, additional material (including submissions) should be sought to conclude its review.</p></reply>

Properties are being secured under the scheme with over 20,100 rent supplement tenancies awarded during 2015. </p><p>I am fully aware of the difficulties people are experiencing in maintaining affordable rented accommodation in areas of high demand, and also of the contents of the recent Simon Community report &ldquo;Locked out of the Market III &ndash; The Gap between Rent Supplement/HAP Limits and Market Rents &ndash; A Snapshot Study&rdquo; which clearly tracks the reduction of supply in the private rented market over the course of their three reports. </p><p>A review of the rent limits undertaken by the Department found that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to recipients. Recent analysis shows that increasing the current rent limits by 8% would result in a full year cost in excess of &euro;25 million, with a 35% increase costing approximately &euro;124 million. If examined in the context of those counties with the highest number of rent supplement recipients; increasing rent limits by 8% in counties Dublin, Cork, Kildare and Galway would acquire fewer than 30 houses.</p><p>In view of the reduction of supply in the private rented market and increasing rents at this time, the Department has implemented a policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits for both existing customers and new applicants to the rent supplement scheme. The circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents are being increased above prescribed limits, as appropriate. In addition, the Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute, with plans underway to extend this to Galway City. </p><p>This flexible approach has assisted over 6,200 rent supplement households nationwide to retain or acquire rented accommodation through increased rent payments. A county breakdown of this information and a county analysis of rent supplement recipients for the years 2011 to date are provided in the attached tabular statements.

To date, JobBridge has attracted the voluntary participation of over 45,300 interns and encouraged over 18,000 Host Organisations to offer them a wide range of work experience opportunities. There are currently almost 4,400 people on internships. </p>  <p>  There are strict terms and conditions which host organisations must comply with in order to participate in the scheme. Failure to comply with these terms and conditions can result in imposition of sanctions against the organisation &ndash; typically suspension from participation in the scheme for an appropriate duration having regard to the nature of the breach.  </p>  <p>  To date a total of 45 organisations were suspended from participation for a variety of infringements.  This represents a tiny fraction of the over 18,000 organisations who have participated in the scheme.

Unemployment has fallen from a crisis peak of 15.1% to 8.6% in January 2016, and the number of people in employment has increased by over 140,000.  As a result of healthy, sustainable, economic growth, we were able to introduce a range of welfare improvements in Budgets 2015 and 2016, far sooner than most economists had imagined was possible.</p><p>Since coming into office, our priority has been to protect the core rates of weekly welfare payments. However, savings measures were introduced in Budgets 2012 to 2014, inclusive, (see Tables 1 to 3 below) and were required in order to ensure that we would be able to provide for a sustainable welfare system in the years ahead. It should be noted that the cost of reversing the various measures could be higher or lower than the estimates prepared at the time, having regard to trends in recipient numbers, demographic pressures and the positive developments in the labour market and the wider economy. </p><p>The recovery has enabled us to introduce a range of welfare improvements over the last two Budgets (see Tables 4 and 5 below).

The analysers, which are micro Gas Chromatograph analysers, were introduced on a phased basis from last September, and have been deployed throughout the country to test road diesel samples on the basis of risk.</p>  <p>  The analysers are generally used to test road diesel stored or for sale at the premises of oil distributors and forecourts, as well as fuel stored at the premises of businesses involved in road transport, including hauliers and bus companies. They are also deployed occasionally at roadside checks where it is safe to do so. It should be noted that while the detection of the new marker in road fuel by the analysers empowers Revenue to detain or seize suspect fuel, subsequent prosecutions are only initiated following formal testing and certification of the presence of the marker by the State Laboratory.</p>  <p>  In the period September-December 2015, approximately 500 samples were tested using the analysers, resulting in 15 cases where detection of the new marker is being investigated with a view to prosecution.  </p>  <p>  The new marker and the portable analysers are the latest elements in a comprehensive strategy implemented by Revenue to combat fuel fraud. Previous measures introduced include a strengthened licensing regime incorporating a new mineral oil licence for traders retailing marked fuels, and a system for monitoring the supply chain based on the electronic submission of returns by all oil traders of their fuel transactions.</p>  <p>  In addition to introducing the necessary legislative provisions to underpin these important initiatives, I also put in place other measures designed to strengthen Revenue's hand in combatting fuel criminality. The Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that a supplier who is reckless in supplying fuel for a use connected with excise fraud will be liable for duty at the standard rate of tax, which introduced a very significant disincentive to such activity. In the Finance Act 2014, I introduced measures to further strengthen Revenue's ability to refuse or revoke a mineral oil trader's licence where the trader does nor comply with excise law or does not maintain adequate stock management systems and records.</p>  <p>  Revenue's action against fuel fraud has already yielded significant results. In the period since 2011, 31 oil laundries have been detected and closed down, more than 3 million litres of fuel have been seized and 139 filling stations were closed for trading without a licence or for breaches of licence conditions. </p>  <p>  The industry view is that the measures implemented to date have been successful in curtailing fuel laundering in Ireland.  This view is supported by a significant increase in tax revenues from road diesel over the past three years.  An analysis of long term consumption trends for road diesel and marked diesel in Ireland undertaken by Revenue also pointed to a significant change in the pattern of consumption following implementation of the measures referred to above.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue's strategy for tackling fuel laundering has been very successful and I am confident that with the new marker and testing equipment now in place the opportunities for fuel fraud are significantly reduced. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-02-02a.320.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016020200056#WRH02900"><p>Where a couple is cohabiting, rather than married or in a civil partnership, each partner is treated for the purposes of income tax as a separate and unconnected individual. Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, tax credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law.</p><p>The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v</i>. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.  </p><p>To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.</p><p>From a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a tax regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners. Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status. It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting. It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.  </p><p>There would also be legal issues with regard to 'connected persons'. To counter tax avoidance, 'connected persons' are frequently defined throughout the various Tax Acts. The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners. This would be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition. There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits. However, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them.</p><p>The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Ms. Joan Burton TD. However, it is also based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples. This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland <i>v</i>. Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.</p></reply>

The person concerned was in the first tranche of payments.</p>  <p>  My Department expects to make payments in respect of applications processed in the last two weeks in January this week.</p>  <p>  I think it is important to provide the Deputy with some of the background to the introduction of the Fuel Grant.  From 1969 to 2014, the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme provided for the repayment of excise duty on fuel used by beneficiaries of the Scheme.  Following a judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Union of April 2013, the repayment of the excise element of the Scheme was found to be incompatible with the Energy Tax Directive.  Following negotiations with the European Commission it was agreed that the repayment of excise duty should be discontinued as of 31 December 2014.</p>  <p>  As I stated in March 2014, to ensure that no beneficiary of the Scheme lost out as a result of the Court's ruling, I decided to introduce a new fuel grant effective from 1 January 2015.  Section 81 of the Finance Act 2015 provided for the making of regulations to govern the operation of the fuel grant, which I subsequently made through the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Fuel Grant Regulations (S.I. No. 635 of 2015).  The Revenue Commissioners are processing Fuel Grant applications and, as I have indicated, my Department is making the payments to beneficiaries.</p>  <p>  The Fuel Grant is paid at the same rate as the rates for repayment of excise duty on fuel.  Accordingly, I have maintained the rate for petrol at &euro;0.59 per litre, the rate for diesel at &euro;0.48 per litre, and the rate for liquefied petroleum gas at &euro;0.10 per litres.  This Fuel Grant maintains the previous practice of paying the sum 12 months in arrears, so that the Revenue Commissions began processing applications on behalf of my Department from 1 January 2016. </p>  <p>  With the assistance of the Revenue Commissioners, a number of improvements have been made to the administration of the Scheme.  For example, beneficiaries are now able to apply for the fuel grant online on the Revenue website through the 'myAccount' feature, and payments are made directly into beneficiaries' accounts.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-02-02a.352.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016020200057#WRJ01900"><p>I am aware of the difficulties that the absence of flood insurance cover can cause to householders and businesses.  However, the provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks.  In my role as Minister for Finance, I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals. </p>  <p>  Government policy in relation to flooding is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems, with a view to addressing the increased availability of flood insurance.  To achieve this aim, there is a focus on prioritising spending on flood relief measures, development and implementation of plans by the Office of Public Works (OPW) to implement flood relief schemes.  This strategy is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland which provides for the transfer by the OPW of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes to the insurance industry, which should provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in areas where works have been completed.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the area referred to in your question, I am advised by the OPW that they can confirm that plans for the development of a flood relief scheme for the River Poddle are underway.  The river crosses two local authority boundaries, South Dublin County Council (SDCC) and Dublin City Council.  SDCC will take the lead role in the development of the scheme and will take proposals through planning and eventual construction.  The procurement process for consultants to develop the design is expected to be commenced shortly by SDCC.  The OPW has given a commitment in principle to fund the scheme, subject to it being viable from a cost perspective and being an environmentally acceptable scheme.</p>  <p>  OPW also advises that there was a severe flooding event in October 2011, which affected the Poddle, with one of the main causes being blocked culverts.  Some interim works have been carried out by SDCC which includes new debris screens on culverts on the river which are monitored by telemetry.  Any alarms can be responded to quickly so that debris build-up can be removed in good time.  Some improvements upstream have also been undertaken which has resulted in some flow being directed towards the River Dodder which lessens the amount of flood waters passing downstream on the Poddle.</p>  <p>  The current flooding crisis has raised issues in relation to insurance and flooding.  The Taoiseach and some other of my colleagues in Government met the insurance industry on Tuesday 12th January 2016 to discuss the industry's role in providing flood insurance and to obtain the industry's views on flood insurance issues such as those outlined in the correspondence supplied by the Deputy.  The Taoiseach asked the insurance industry to revert back within two weeks following further consideration of their approach to the provision of insurance in areas where demountable defences are in place, along with details on the availability of insurance in areas with flood defences.  The insurance industry did respond on Friday 22nd January and their response is under consideration.</p>  <p>  In addition, my officials are undertaking detailed research on alternative options with the potential to ensure greater availability of flood insurance.  This will be in the form of a comparative analysis of the different approaches to flood insurance in other countries.</p></reply>

The additional levy of 0.15% which I introduced for 2014 and 2015, mainly to help continue to fund Jobs Initiative, also ended last year.</p>  <p>  The position is that the equivalent value of all of the money raised from the stamp duty levy has been used to fund the wide range of measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative to protect existing jobs and to help create new jobs and the Initiative has been a success in this regard.  The measures introduced include expenditure measures such as the JobBridge and Springboard schemes, as well as a number of tax and PRSI incentives such as the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the tourism and hospitality sectors and the halving of the lower employer PRSI rate.  </p>  <p>  While the pension fund levies have ceased as I have already outlined, I have no plans to repay the pension fund levies collected as suggested in the question.  The value of the funds raised by way of the levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State.  Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons responsible for the payment of the levy (the pension scheme trustees, etc.) will benefit from the changes which I began in Budget 2015 and have continued in Budget 2016 to reduce the tax burden on low and middle income earners. </p></reply>

Circular 40/2007 relates to grades represented by IMPACT and the upper limit of seven increments also applies.  Circular F33/02 would only apply to increment credit to officers at Grade III and analogous grades in the Department covered by that circular. </p>  <p>  I would point out that in the context of Action 15 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan, it was decided to review the current policy relating to the starting pay of appointees from elsewhere in the public service, to the Civil Service.

This is based on the premise of export led growth and the additional indirect jobs stimulated by the activities of exporting enterprises in the wider economy.  The ambition is predicated on taking the actions set out in Enterprise 2025 which are focused on supporting the productive sector, enhancing our relative competitiveness, leveraging existing comparative advantage in key sectors, addressing structural issues in the economy, improving productivity and the capacity of enterprises to innovate.  Enterprise 2025 is a whole of enterprise strategy that leverages the potential across all sectors of the economy in manufacturing and services activities, both exporting and domestically oriented.  The Government&rsquo;s efforts will be on achieving a step change in enterprise performance across the whole enterprise base.</p><p>With the economy recovering and employment on the increase, meeting the skills needs of enterprises will be a critical factor to enable companies to expand and grow in both domestic markets and export markets.  We have placed a strong focus on ensuring an adequate supply of skills and talent as part of the whole of Government Action Plan for Jobs process since 2012. </p><p>Aligned and in parallel with the Action Plan for Jobs process, the Government published the new <i>Pathways to Work 2016-2018</i>(PTW) earlier this month.  The new programme has two main objectives: </p><p>-Continue and consolidate the progress made to date with an initial focus on working with unemployed jobseekers, in particular those who are long-term unemployed; and</p><p>-  Extend the approach of labour market activation to other people who, although not classified as unemployed jobseekers, have the potential and the desire to play an active role in the labour force.</p><p>The overall target in relation to long-term unemployed is to move 50,000 long-term unemployed at the start of 2016 into employment by the end of 2020.</p><p>In addition, PTW aims to reduce the persistence rate (the rate at which short term unemployed people become long term unemployed) by 25 percent from 27 percent to 20 percent by the end of 2018 (24 percent by end of 2016).  It also aims to increase the exit rate of people on the Live Register for two years or more by 30 percent (to 52 percent) by the end of 2018 (44 percent by end of 2016), and to fully implement the JobPath programme and refer at least 60,000 long term unemployed people to JobPath in 2016.</p><p>The skills requirements of the economy are identified and met in a number of ways.  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs plays a key role in advising the Government on current and future skills needs of the economy and feeds these findings into the education and training sector.  The Group comprises representatives from relevant Government Departments and agencies, as well as from enterprise, workers and education and training providers.  The Department of Education and Skills has recently launched <i>Ireland&rsquo;s National Skills Strategy 2025</i>.  Amongst the key objectives are to provide skills development opportunities that are relevant to the needs of learners, society and the economy, and to place a specific focus on active inclusion to support participation in education and training and the labour market.</p></reply>

This is based on the premise of export led growth and the additional indirect jobs stimulated by the activities of exporting enterprises in the wider economy.  </p>  <p>Enterprise 2025 sets out a range of sectors where there is potential for employment growth, including in green technologies and renewable energy.  Specifically, the Government is committed to taking policy actions to achieve our EU commitments and to leverage our natural resources by 2030.  Enterprise 2025 sets out actions to grow jobs by building on our many advantages and enhancing our reputation internationally as a sustainable and green economy: through enhancing our RD&amp;I capabilities and stimulating start-ups and growth in green/clean technology enterprises; through stimulating increased focus by enterprises on investing in improving energy efficiencies and minimising waste; ensuring mechanisms to realise the potential from investment in energy sourced from renewables are efficient and effective; and, progressing smart city-region initiatives that leverages ICT capabilities, as set out in the recent Dublin Action Plan for Jobs.</p>  <p>  The energy sector is set for a period of revolution and rapid growth as industry and society moves towards a low carbon economy.  This drive for a low carbon economy poses a series of challenges for industry and society but also provides many economic and social opportunities.  We are adopting a cluster approach to the development and deployment of energy products and services to assist in the transition to a low carbon economy and to grow export and investment opportunities.  The development of Ireland as Europe&rsquo;s Energy Innovation Hub was a Disruptive Reform in the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs and seeks to build on our existing strengths and transformation in energy markets internationally, so that Ireland leads in the development of innovative products and services along the energy value chain and enables the transition to a low carbon economy.  To deliver on this ambition, an Inter-Departmental Committee, co-chaired by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources was established in 2015 and has developed a value proposition for Ireland as Europe&rsquo;s Energy Innovation Hub and a corresponding brochure.  Underpinning this is the creation of a one-stop portal of national assets and infrastructure, energy related enterprises and innovators and research activities.  The portal on Ocean Energy and Smart Grid are now complete with the focus now shifting to energy efficiency and renewable technologies.</p>  <p>  The Government has also published our new Energy White Paper, Ireland&rsquo;s Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future, in December 2015, which sets out a framework to guide policy to deliver a low carbon future between now and 2030.  Improving energy efficiency is a critical element of the transition.  During 2016, we will continue to deliver a range of actions under the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan to enable us to meet our 2020 targets.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland will work with enterprise, the development agencies and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to realise the potential for enterprise and jobs growth identified in its report Ireland&rsquo;s Sustainable Energy Supply Chain Opportunity, by addressing barriers to supply chain growth in the sector, fostering growth by developing local capacity to capture export opportunities, assisting a favourable environment for FDI and to harness the job creation potential of the energy sector towards our target of sustainable full employment. </p></reply>

The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 provides that a fixed-term contract employee shall not be treated less favourably than a comparable permanent employee in respect of conditions of employment including pay and pensions.  In addition, the Act provides that in the case of a fixed-term employee recruited after the enactment of the Act, if he or she is employed by his or her employer or associated employer on two or more continuous fixed-term contracts, the aggregate duration of such contracts shall not exceed four years after which, if the contract is renewed again, it is deemed to be a contract of indefinite duration unless the employer has objective grounds for renewing the contracts again on a fixed-term basis. </p><p>The terms of the 2003 Act are applicable in both the private and the public sectors with the exception, in the case of the public sector, of a small number of categories of employees.  If a fixed-term employee feels that he or she is being treated less favourably as regards conditions of employment, or if he or she is entitled to a contract of indefinite duration and if his or her employer refuses to concede this, it is open to him or her to refer the matter by way of complaint to the Director General of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) for adjudication.  I am satisfied that the protections afforded employees under the terms of the 2003 Act remain relevant.</p><p>The WRC is an independent, statutory body which was established on 1 October 2015 under the Workplace Relations Act 2015 (No. 16 of 2015).  It assumes the roles and functions previously carried out by the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), Equality Tribunal, Labour Relations Commission, Rights Commissioners Service, and the first-instance (Complaints and Referrals) functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  The Workplace Relations Customer Service and Information Unit provides information on employment, equality and industrial relations legislation, and can be contacted at Lo-call 1890 80 80 90 or via its website .

During this round, negotiators discussed all three pillars of the proposed agreement namely market access for EU and US companies, regulatory cooperation and trade rules. </p><p>There was substantial progress on market access for EU and US companies in all three areas, including tariffs, services and public procurement.  A second tariff offer covering trade in goods was exchanged and both sides have now arrived at a level of proposal covering 97% of tariff lines.  This will assist and benefit further the negotiations.  Both sides agreed on a merged text of their initial proposals on horizontal rules and principles governing product-specific rules of origin.  Progress was made on further consolidating the textual proposals and on the general text on trade in goods.  Discussions also took place on texts on agricultural market access.  There was also discussion in relation to public procurement and it is envisaged that there will be an exchange of market access proposals on public procurement at the next formal round.</p><p>All regulatory issues were discussed during this round, including the three horizontal chapters on regulatory cooperation, technical barriers to trade (TBT) and sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS), along with the nine industry specific sectors.  Technical progress was made in most areas, though significant work remains ahead.  The negotiations also provided an opportunity to clarify some of the main principles of regulatory cooperation.  These included the fact that any cooperation is possible only if the level of protection for consumers stays the same or improves and any form of regulatory cooperation will not change or affect the EU regulatory and democratic process.</p><p>The third pillar of the negotiation is dedicated to &ldquo;Rules&rdquo; and addresses shared trade related issues in areas such as competition between private and public firms, sustainable development, intellectual property rights including geographical indicators, SME&rsquo;s, trade in raw materials and energy and investment.  During the 11 round of negotiations discussions took place on all of these topics.  The EU presented its first legal textual proposal for a chapter on Trade and Sustainable Development, including labour and the environment, which covers conservation, sustainable management of resources, wildlife, forestry and fisheries.  The European Commission published this proposal on its website on 6 November 2015.</p><p>On the 12 November 2015, the EU Commission published and formally presented to the US its proposal for a new and more transparent system for resolving disputes between investors and states &ndash; the Investment Court System.  This proposal is the outcome of a lengthy public consultation process with the Member States, the European Parliament, stakeholders and the public.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposal aims at safeguarding Government&rsquo;s right to regulate and creates a new system composed of a first instance tribunal and an appeal mechanism based on clearly defined rules, with qualified judges and transparent proceedings.  </p><p>An EU-US agreement would be the world&rsquo;s largest bilateral trade and investment deal, and a successful conclusion is expected to benefit Ireland more than any other EU Member State.  Owing to our position as a small open economy, Ireland&rsquo;s enterprises are particularly well placed to take up opportunities to trade more easily with the US.  The key findings of the Copenhagen Economics study, published on the 27 March 2015, are very positive for Ireland indicating a potential impact on the Irish economy of 1.1% increase in GDP.  The Irish Economy could grow by 2 billion euros or double the impact on the EU overall.  The report suggests a growth in exports of 3.8%, an increase in real wages of 1.5% and an additional 5,000-10,000 export related jobs could be created.</p><p>During a D&aacute;il debate on the EU-US free trade negotiations on the 21 January 2016, I announced that a Reading Room will open in my Department in Kildare St. and the consolidated texts of the EU-US agreement will be made available to Oireachtas members.  This follows on an agreement on a Protocol between the EU Commission and the US on increasing access to parliamentarians in addition to designated officials</p><p>The next formal round for the EU-US free trade negotiations will take place during the week of the 22&ndash;26 February 2016.</p></reply>

The requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 (No. 10 of 2005) and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations, 2007 to 2016 apply and must be considered with respect to the protection of workers at the place of work.  In addition, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Exposure to Asbestos) Regulations 2006 and 2010, which are enforced by the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), place obligations on employers and employees to ensure that the risk of exposure to asbestos is eliminated or reduced to a minimum and that any remaining residual risk is adequately controlled in accordance with the legislation.  The 2006 and 2010 Asbestos Regulations provide for the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work, the health surveillance of employees where exposure has occurred and for the maintenance of an occupational health register in relevant employments. </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The statutory obligation to organise preventive health care rests with the employer.  Health surveillance is accordingly required where workplace conditions increase the likelihood of employees becoming susceptible to a disease associated with a particular substance in use (e.g. asbestos and cancer), and where it is possible to detect the disease or any adverse change and reduce the risk of further harm.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">Employers must establish and maintain an occupational health register for all employees who undertake asbestos work activities and this register must be maintained for a minimum of forty years following the end of any individual&rsquo;s exposure. </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">In the case of the inquiry made by the Deputy, contact should be made by the individual with his former employer regarding any exposure encountered during the course of his employment that may be recorded in the occupational health register.  The employer is required to make access to the occupational health register available upon reasonable notice to an employee or his/her representative. </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The presence of asbestosis within the wider community is a public health matter, and the issue of injury benefit for people who contracted a prescribed occupational disease (such as asbestosis) falls under the remit of the Minister for Social Protection. </font></p></reply>

Overall there was a net employment increase of 11,833, the highest level of job creation in over a decade.</p><p>Cavan and Monaghan are promoted as part of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s North East Region (along with Louth). There are 33 multinational companies based in the region, employing 4,556 people.  IDA Ireland positions the North East as having strong clusters in international business services and manufacturing.</p><p>Employment data for the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Employment Survey is collected and reported annually. The following tables A and B set out the total number of client companies in Monaghan and Cavan along with the associated employment data on jobs created and lost for the period 2006-2015, as per the 2015 survey.</p><p>It is important to note the strong role played by Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices. In Cavan, companies supported by Enterprise Ireland added 362 net new jobs in 2015 (an 8% increase), while companies in Monaghan supported by Enterprise Ireland added 320 net new jobs (7% increase).</p><p>The Cavan and Monaghan Local Enterprise Offices added 169 net new jobs in 2015. I expect that new data for 2015 will be available shortly.</p><p>In spite of these setbacks, it must be noted that the North East region has seen a very large drop in the number of people on the live register (Table C). In 2013, there were 27,995 people on the live register. By 2015, this had dropped by 5,120 to 22,875, representing an 18% decrease in the numbers signing on in the region. The arrival of large multinationals in Louth, such as eBay and PayPal who between them created 850 new jobs in the region, has stimulated growth in the region as a whole, with many now commuting from Cavan and Monaghan to Louth.</p><p>Since the national Action Plan for Jobs was launched in early 2012 more than 20,000 additional people are at work in the North East/North West region. I believe that more can be done. As part of the Government&rsquo;s &euro;250 m Regional Action Plan for Jobs, I launched the North East/North West Action Plan for Jobs in November 2015, with a target to create 28,000 additional jobs throughout the North East/North West.  The Plan focusses on maximising the strengths and assets of the region to support enterprise growth and job creation and to build on the progress that has already been made.</p><p>Table A</p><p><b><i>Employment developments in IDA companies in Cavan 2006-2015</i></b><table><tr><th><div>IDA - Cavan</div></th><th>2006</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>No of Companies</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Total Jobs</td><td>1,219</td><td>1,249</td><td>1,214</td><td>1,174</td><td>1,195</td><td>1,172</td><td>1,128</td><td>1,135</td><td>1,136</td><td>1,165</td></tr><tr><td>Gross Gain</td><td>19</td><td>49</td><td>14</td><td>30</td><td>92</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>15</td><td>27</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Gross Losses</td><td>-56</td><td>-19</td><td>-49</td><td>-70</td><td>-71</td><td>-28</td><td>-54</td><td>-8</td><td>-26</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Net Change</td><td>-37</td><td>30</td><td>-35</td><td>-40</td><td>21</td><td>-23</td><td>-44</td><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>29</td></tr></table>Table B</p><p><b><i>Employment developments in IDA companies Monaghan 2006-2015</i></b><table><tr><th>IDA - Monaghan</th><th>2006</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>No of Companies </td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Total Jobs</td><td>484</td><td>434</td><td>401</td><td>390</td><td>418</td><td>352</td><td>348</td><td>365</td><td>275</td><td>146</td></tr><tr><td>Gross Gain</td><td>58</td><td>11</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>45</td><td></td><td>7</td><td>29</td><td>13</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>Gross Losses</td><td></td><td>-61</td><td>-40</td><td>-18</td><td>-17</td><td>-66</td><td>-11</td><td>-12</td><td>-103</td><td>-181</td></tr><tr><td>Net Change </td><td>58</td><td>-50</td><td>-33</td><td>-11</td><td>28</td><td>-66</td><td>-4</td><td>17</td><td>-90</td><td>-129</td></tr></table>Table C</p><p><b>Live Register Figure for North East Region 2013-2015</b><table><tr><th>County </th><th>Live Register <br /><br />December 2013</th><th>Live Register<br /><br />December 2014</th><th>Live Register<br /><br />December 2015</th></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>15,376</td><td>14,105</td><td>12,922</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>5,990</td><td>5,339</td><td>4,495</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>6,629</td><td>5,844</td><td>5,458</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>27,995</td><td>25,288</td><td>22,875</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Companies leave the Enterprise Ireland portfolio for a number of reasons and are therefore not captured by their surveys.  Where the Agency has an investment or where there is a grant liability involved, this is followed up as appropriate through any receivership process. Company development advisors are engaged with individual companies and work with them on an ongoing basis to ensure their client companies are maximising the Enterprise Ireland company offering.  </p>  <p>The companies that Enterprise Ireland works with are a vital source of employment, both direct and indirect, in every county in Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland works in close concert with partner development agencies, particularly to respond to incidences with larger companies where a significant number of jobs are at risk. The objective in these circumstances is to identify all opportunities to maximise the number of jobs maintained, for example through support for spin-out start-ups, Management Buy Outs, or commercial partnering. Taskforces comprising relevant personnel from the Development Agencies and other key stakeholders are established in these cases.</p>  <p>  It is also important that in the event that a company in serious financial difficulty downsizes or closes, a range of interventions in other government policy areas can be brought to bear e.g. Workplace Relations Commission, Redundancy Payments Scheme, Labour Activation/Training etc. which seek to ameliorate the impact of job losses on the people concerned.</p></reply>

The person named declared 41.72 hectares of eligible land in 2013 and, in 2015 declared 41.15 hectares therefore he has been allocated 41.15 entitlements. The 2015 value of entitlements is based on a fixed percentage of the total value of entitlements owned by the farmer in 2014 plus the value of any payment received under the Grassland Sheep Scheme in that year. The person named had an entitlement value of &euro;20,012.38 in 2014.</p>  <p>  Under EU Regulations governing the Basic Payment Scheme all entitlements are subject to the process of internal convergence whereby the value of entitlements for some farmers will increase over the period 2015 -2019 while for others the value will decrease so that all farmers will reach at least 60% of the average value of entitlements by 2019. The estimated average value of entitlements in 2019 is &euro;174. As the value of entitlements for the person named is above the estimated national average value of entitlements he is subject to a reduction in the value of his entitlements under the internal convergence process. In 2015 the person named has established 41.15 entitlements with an estimated unit value of &euro;311.08. This gives a total entitlement value including the greening payment of &euro;18,451.58.</p>  <p>  Payment of &euro;12,951.40 including Basic Payment and Greening issued to the person named on the 19 October 2015 and second instalment payment of &euro;4,794.41, issued on 1 December 20 15.

EU Regulations governing the administration of these schemes require that full and comprehensive administrative checks, including in some cases on-farm or remote sensing (i.e. satellite) inspections, be completed before any payments issue.  The application of the person named was selected for a remote sensing inspection and also a Bovine Animal Identification and Registration inspection.  The cross compliance inspection identified breaches in relation to cattle identification and registration requirements resulting in a 3% penalty being recorded against the 2015 payments. The persons named were notified of this decision on 4 June 2015. The remote sensing inspection identified discrepancies between the areas declared and the area found resulting in an over-declaration in area of under 3% and under 2ha. Under the Terms and Conditions of the Basic Payment Scheme this results in payment being based on the area found. Partial payment due on this basis issued to the nominated bank account of the persons named on 14 January 2016. The persons named were notified of this decision on 22 December 2015. The person named was also notified of the right to seek a review of these decisions. To date no request for a review has been received by my Department. In the event that the person named is dissatisfied with the outcome of any such reviews the decision can be appealed to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office, within 3 months.</p><p>Furthermore, the persons named established Entitlement Allocation Rights under the 2015 Basic Payment Scheme.

Members of a farm partnership who own individual sets of entitlements receive a combined payment. It is therefore incumbent that my Department identifies and ensures that entitlements held are licensed for use in the partnership. Consequently, should the partnership dissolve the entitlements return to the relevant owners. M</font>y Department has established a robust procedure to ensure the implementation and integrity of this identification process.</p><p>Processing of this application has recently been finalised, and an additional payment will issue to the nominated bank account of the Farm Partnership concerned shortly.</p></reply>

The person named declared 17.32 hectares of eligible land in 2013 and, in 2015 declared 17.32 hectares therefore he has been allocated 17.32 entitlements. The 2015 value of entitlements is based on a fixed percentage of the total value of entitlements owned by the farmer in 2014 plus the value of any payment received under the Grassland Sheep Scheme in that year. The person named had an entitlement value of &euro;574.44 in 2014.</p>  <p>  Under EU Regulations governing the Basic Payment Scheme all entitlements are subject to the process of internal convergence whereby the value of entitlements for some farmers will increase over the period 2015 -2019 while for others the value will decrease so that all farmers will reach at least 60% of the average value of entitlements by 2019.

Qualifying criteria for the National Reserve is set down under EU Regulation and under objective criteria as defined by the Member State. The process of deciding objective criteria for eligibility under the National Reserve is carried out in consultation with the Direct Payments Advisory Committee which includes members of the main farming bodies and advisory services. After consultation with this Committee it was decided that an off farm income limit of &euro;40,000 would be applicable to all applicants under the 2015 National Reserve. The corresponding off farm income limit under the previous National Reserve was &euro;30,000. Applicants under the 2015 National Reserve also have the flexibility of choosing either the 2013 or 2014 tax year, whichever is more advantageous. Officials from my Department have been in contact with the person named on a number of occasions regarding his off-farm income as submitted in support of his National Reserve application.  The person named submitted documentary evidence setting out details of off-farm income earned in America in 2014. When determining the level of off-farm income earned outside of the jurisdiction the EURO conversion is based on the currency conversion rate on the last date of the tax year in the jurisdiction in which the monies were earned. This is applied consistently across all earnings from other jurisdictions submitted in support of National Reserve applications. A "living wage calculator" is not taken into account in determining EURO equivalents for monies earned in any jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  Applicants must comply with all eligibility criteria including off farm income criteria in order to be deemed eligible to qualify for an allocation of entitlements under the National Reserve. By increasing the off-farm income limit and granting a choice of reference years, I have granted the maximum possible flexibility regarding income limits for the National Reserve.

The SFPA has offered to facilitate a visit by Chinese authorities to examine Ireland&rsquo;s official control systems, laboratories and crab production establishments and is continuing to explore this and other avenues of engagement.  The implementation of food regulations for imports to China is a matter for the Chinese authorities.  Ireland applies stringent European standards and follows procedures which include monitoring the safety of Irish seafood so that consumers can continue to have high confidence in the quality of Irish seafood.  As I have stated before, I acknowledge the concerns that live crab exporters have at this time and I am satisfied that the SFPA, with the support of my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Marine Institute, is making every effort to resolve this issue.</p></reply>

The only State body currently under the aegis of the Department of Defence is the Army Pensions Board.  The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act 1927.  The Act specifies that the Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members.  The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps.  The chairman and the non military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.</p><p>There have been five appointments to the Army Pensions Board since 7 March 2011.  Commandant Adam Lagun was appointed to the position of Army Medical Corps ordinary member of the Board in December 2011.  This position became vacant in October 2014 due to Commandant Lagun being deployed overseas.  On the recommendation of the Chief of Staff, the temporary appointment of Commandant Syed Shah to the Board, from 16 October 2014 to 31 May 2015, was made to cover the Commandant Lagun&rsquo;s absence.  Commandant Lagun resumed as Ordinary member of the Board in June 2015.  The position became vacant again in September 2015 with the deployment overseas of Commandant Lagun.  On the recommendation of the Chief of Staff, Commandant Zdenek Osecky was appointed temporarily, from 10 September 2015 to 30 June 2016, to cover this temporary vacant position.</p><p>As the Army Pensions Act 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps, the positions outlined above were not publicly advertised on either occasion.  Details of these appointments to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;il.</p><p>A civilian doctor, Dr. Loretta Nolan, was appointed as ordinary member of the Army Pensions Board in November 2013.  The civilian doctor vacancy was advertised on the Department of Defence website and the Public Appointments Service website.  A number of expressions of interest in the position were received and an appointment to the Board was made on foot of this public advertisement process.</p><p>There are currently no vacancies on the Army Pensions Board.</p><p>The Civil Defence Board was identified in the Public Service Reform Plan as a body to be abolished.  Against this backdrop, in July 2011, the then Minister for Defence appointed a 14 person interim Board as a temporary measure.  In this context, none of the positions was advertised.  Legislation to dissolve the Board was passed by the Oireachtas in December 2012.  Its functions have now transferred back to the Department of Defence.  The membership of the interim Board appointed in July 2011 is set out in the following table:<table><tr><th>Name </th><th>Nominating Bodies </th></tr><tr><td>Civil Defence Board Chairperson </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Brian Spain <br /><br />Director, Department of Defence </td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Defence </td></tr><tr><td>Civil Defence Board Members </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Cathal Duffy <br /><br />Principal, Department of Defence </td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Defence </td></tr><tr><td>Ms. Clare Tiernan <br /><br />Principal, Department of Defence </td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Defence </td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Robert Mooney <br /><br />Principal, Department of Defence </td><td>Nominated by Minister for Defence </td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Ned Gleeson <br /><br />County Manager, Limerick City Council </td><td>Nominated by County &amp;amp; City Managers&rsquo; Association </td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Keith Leonard <br /><br />Assistant Fire Advisor </td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government </td></tr><tr><td>Dr. Barbara Rafferty </td><td>Nominated by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland </td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Becci Cantrell </td><td>Nominated by the Environmental Protection Agency </td></tr><tr><td>Ms. Veronica Forde <br /><br />Assistant Civil Defence Officer </td><td>Nominated by the Civil Defence Officers&rsquo; Association </td></tr><tr><td>Lt.

The formal wind up of the Company, including voluntary strike off with the Companies Registration Office, was completed in early 2013.</p></reply>

A key element was the implementation of the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP) to replace the International Register on a phased basis.  The first phase was completed in June 2015 and the second iteration of the ILEP was delivered on the targeted date of 20 January 2016.  All appeals were disposed of.  That part of the correspondence enclosed by the Deputy has therefore been overtaken by events.  </p>  <p>  My Department has no role in accrediting English language schools or programmes.  The fact that a provider and courses are listed on the ILEP means that in accordance with Ireland&rsquo;s student immigration policy, attendance at that college in respect of one of their listed full-time courses on the ILEP is an eligible purpose for a non-EEA national coming to Ireland.  That is of course subject to the normal immigration controls and case-by-case consideration of individual immigration applications.  The ILEP does not guarantee the quality of the institution but if a provider is listed on the ILEP in respect of courses they will have met certain criteria including the mandatory provision of learner protection in respect of enrolled non-EEA students.  For the English language sector, a maximum class size of 15 students applies to all ILEP listed providers and they must also have demonstrated that their teaching staff are properly qualified.   </p>  <p>  Part of the process included unannounced inspections of certain providers.  Providers who had no external quality assurance were for obvious reasons among those visited.  A sample of schools with quality assurance were also inspected, with the number of students enrolled being one of the key factors to be taken into account in their selection.  These inspections were carried out in November and December of last year and it is intended that further  inspections, including follow up inspections were necessary, will continue throughout 2016 to ensure ongoing compliance with the new set of rules that came into operation in conjunction with the ILEP .</p></reply>

In all such cases, INIS must be satisfied that there is no alternative open to the applicant before an Irish temporary travel document will issue.

Nine Garda Stations were closed in the Cavan/Monaghan Division, as outlined in the table below.</p><p>The Programme was based on a review of the Garda Station Network by Garda management which concluded in relation to certain stations, many of which were only open part-time and manned by a single Garda, that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if those stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  The Programme supports the provision of a modern 21st century policing service for both urban and rural areas and allows front line Garda&iacute; to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility, and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.  As a result of the Programme, communities have benefited from increased Garda visibility and increased patrolling hours which has enabled  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver an improved policing service to the public. </p><p>It is understood from discussions with the Garda Commissioner that the current consolidation process is largely completed.

Prior to the introduction of the programme there was no requirement for staff working directly with children in pre-school services to hold any education qualification. </p>  <p>  It is a requirement of the ECCE programme that pre-school year leaders in services participating in the programme, and who are receiving the standard capitation, hold a qualification in childcare which is equivalent to Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ).  A higher capitation rate is available to services participating in the ECCE programme in which all of the pre-school leaders hold an appropriate qualification at a minimum of Level 7 and pre-school assistants hold a Level 5 on the NFQ.  </p>  <p>  As part of the Early Years Quality Agenda, new qualification requirements for childcare workers are being introduced.  All staff caring for children in an early years service will be subject to a minimum qualification requirement of Level 5, while pre-school leaders delivering the ECCE programme will require a Level 6 qualification.  It is expected that these requirements will come into effect from the end of this year. </p>  <p>  Following the introduction of the qualification requirement, childcare providers submitted a wide range of qualifications to my Department in support of their applications for the higher rate of capitation or seeking to satisfy the minimum qualifications that the programme set out.  This presented a problem for officials in my Department and for childcare providers as there was no definitive list that could be referenced.  To address this problem a detailed and extensive list of qualifications suitable for the purpose of meeting the minimum qualification requirements and for meeting the contractual requirements of the ECCE programme was prepared and published and is available on the Department website.  I understand that an advisory group established to evaluate qualifications submitted prior to publication of the list did consider and approve four Association Montessori Internationale qualifications for inclusion. </p>  <p>  Where a qualification is not included on the published list and the holder considers it to be an appropriate Major award on the NFQ or equivalent, the holder should apply to my Department to have their qualification assessed. </p></reply>

The education welfare services of Tusla, comprising the statutory Education Welfare Service, the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison scheme are key supports for children who are vulnerable to early school leaving and educational disadvantage including Traveller children. </p>  <p>  Children who do not attend school regularly or who leave school early before age 16 or without completing 3 years of second level education are a priority concern for the Educational Welfare Service.  Where school attendance problems arise for a child, including a Traveller child, Tusla's approach is to concentrate on finding solutions, within a collaborative intervention framework involving children, families, school and other relevant agencies. The work of the Educational Welfare Officer falls into two key categories. It can involve a brief intervention, at an early stage if the problem is identified and capable of being resolved, or, where the problem is more complex, it can involve the Educational Welfare Officer providing more intensive and ongoing support for the child and family. </p>  <p>  The School Completion Programme  operates in 470 primary schools and 224 post-primary schools.  The programme provides targeted supports to children identified to be most at risk of early school leaving or of not reaching their potential in the educational system.  School Completion Programme initiatives include, breakfast clubs; homework clubs; afterschool supports; mentoring programmes; and therapeutic interventions as well as transfer programmes to support young people transitioning from primary to post-primary school.</p>  <p>  Along with the School Completion Programme, the Home School Community Liaison Scheme is a core element of the integrated Educational Welfare Services of Tusla, serving schools identified under the Delivering Equality of opportunity in Schools (DEIS) action plan of the Department of Education and Skills.  The Home School Community Liaison Scheme serves 528 schools. Coordinators work primarily with the salient adults in educationally disadvantaged children&rsquo;s lives, in order to empower them, so that they can better support their children in relation to school attendance, participation and retention. </p>  <p>  Central to both the Home School Community Liaison Scheme and the School Completion Programme, is the identification of needs and the provision of a tailored and proportionate response to those needs, through a range of interventions, which are evidence-based, focused and structured.  Tusla has advised that children and families from the Traveller Community who require additional support or are identified as vulnerable are provided with the full range of supports available through the Home School Community Liaison Scheme and the School Completion Programme.  At a national level, Home School Community Liaison and the School Completion Programme are supported by the Senior Management Team of Tusla Educational Welfare Services.  A senior manager represents the Education Welfare Service of Tusla on the Traveller Education Strategy Advisory and Consultative Forum convened by the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills provides a range of supports to address additional educational needs of children, including Traveller children, in schools.  I am advised that specific supports for Traveller children are part of mainstream provision in line with the Department of Education and Skills policy on inclusive education. </p></reply>

Almost 93% of children in care were in a foster care setting.  Of all children in care, over 93% (5,903) had an allocated social worker. Tusla's policy is that all children coming into care and those in high risk placements have an allocated social worker.  Subsequent gaps may be attributed to a number of factors including maternity leave, vacancies and competing priorities. </p><p>Where a child is awaiting the allocation of a social worker, this is responded to by a social work duty team on a risk management basis.

The following table shows the provisional aftercare statistics collected by the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, to the end of September 2015:</p><p>Table 1: Provisional aftercare data to 30/09/2015<table><tr><th>2015 Aftercare Data to September 2015</th><th>The number of Children in Care turning 18</th><th>No. eligible for an Aftercare service</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin Mid-Leinster</td><td>114</td><td>100 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North East</td><td>88</td><td>87 </td></tr><tr><td>South</td><td>127</td><td>127 </td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>63</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>392</td><td>374</td></tr></table></p><p>*  Please note that the figures listed are approximate, as some returns require validation. </p><p>Provisional data provided by Tusla show that in 2014, approximately 484 young people were discharged from care by reason of turning 18.  Of these, 98% were assessed as needing an aftercare service, and at the time of recording, 90% had been offered a service. </p><p>The cost of developing an aftercare plan has not been determined as every plan is different for each young person and takes account of their individual circumstances.  Tusla has introduced a Standardised National Aftercare Allowance of &euro;300 per week to address the previously inequitable approach of different rates of financial supports being made available for young people leaving care around the country.  The introduction of this aftercare allowance demonstrates Tusla's commitment to an aftercare service that offers consistent supports to ensure that young people leaving care and aftercare reach their potential in adult life. </p></reply>

On this basis, although children in care (fostered and adopted) are represented in the sample, their absolute number is too small to allow them to be analysed as a separate group or to be tracked on a longitudinal basis.  In addition Growing up in Ireland is based on children and young people in private households, it does not include those in residential centres and Special Care. </p><p>A study of the population in care would require a fundamentally different design to that used in Growing Up in Ireland and would need to be based on a dedicated sample of relevant children and young people.

There were a further 6,382 children (open cases) who had been assessed as needing a dedicated social worker and were waiting for one to be allocated. Some of these cases may have had an allocated social worker, but due to a social worker leaving, they are reclassified as awaiting a social worker. This Department continues to monitor the number of cases that are reported as awaiting the allocation of a social worker.</p>  <p>  Tusla has implemented a national caseload management system which allows social work team leaders and principals to monitor caseloads in terms of both number and complexity. It is recognised that, from time to time, individual cases can occupy a disproportionate amount of resources. The caseload management system gives managers a clearer insight into the pressures on staff.</p>  <p>  A reduction in the number of cases awaiting allocation remains a top priority in 2016 for both the Department and Tusla. In Tusla&rsquo;s 2016 Budget submission, a requirement for an increase in overall resources over a three year period (2016-2018) to address unallocated cases was identified. The additional funding of &euro;38 million which has been secured for Tusla in 2016 will provide increased resources to meet identified risks and service demands.  This included specific funding of &euro;6.1 million which will enable a significant reduction in the number of cases awaiting allocation.</p>  <p>  It is also important to recognise that the recruitment of additional social workers will be a key dependency in relation to reducing the number of such cases. However, a whole system approach will be required to address this issue. This includes the recruitment of other members of the multi-disciplinary teams that contribute to the delivery of an effective child protection and welfare service, for example family support workers, social care workers, link workers, access staff and management and administrative support. In 2016, Tusla is aiming to achieve a significant reduction in cases awaiting allocation by year end with a particular focus on cases classified as being high priority.  At present, it is not possible to gauge the exact number of referrals that will be waiting less than three months to be allocated to a social worker but my Department will closely monitor progress made by Tusla throughout the year.</p></reply>

In the main, these emergency situations arise out of hours.</p>  <p>  The out-of-hours service provides access to a Child and Family Agency Social Worker and the placement of children removed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Child Care Act, 1991. The total cost of providing out-of-hours services is approximately &euro;3.147m per annum. This figure will vary from year to year as out-of-hours services are demand led. Out-of-hours services are currently provided in all counties under the following arrangements:</p>  <p>- The Crisis Intervention Service (CIS) provides an out-of-hours emergency social work service to young people aged 0-17 years who are in crisis and reside in Counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow. The total cost of this service in 2015 was &euro;1.546m.</p>  <p>- The Cork Out-of-Hours Service provides an emergency social work service to young people aged 0-17 years in crisis who reside in the Cork North Lee and Cork South Lee areas. The total cost of this service in 2015 was approximately &euro;280,000.</p>  <p>- The new Emergency Out-of-Hours Social Work Service which commenced last November covers areas outside of Counties Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Cork city. This service allows An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to contact a national emergency social work out-of-hours phone service for general advice or consultation. This on call service is staffed by social workers operating from the out-of-hours service in Dublin, supported by on-call social workers in different parts of the country. The social workers providing this service are employed by Tusla. The estimated full year cost of this service is &euro;1.321m.</p>  <p>  The aim of Emergency Out-of-Hours Social Work Services is to ensure that the disruption and upset to which children may be exposed in emergency situations is minimised and the rights of parents and guardians are respected.</p></reply>

Accommodating this increase requires a significant increase in capacity in the pre-school sector; pre-school services need time to consider and implement any needed infrastructural or service changes, and to put in place extra staff resources.

With this in mind, I requested that an Inter-Departmental Group, led by this Department, be established with a brief to bring forward recommendations to address this issue.</p>  <p>  The Group has concluded its work and its recommendations were fully accepted and funded by Government.  I announced, as part of Budget 2016, the necessary funding to implement the new model with costs estimated to be &euro;17.7m in 2016 and with full year cost estimated to be &euro;33m from 2017 onwards.  This Group has identified a practical, workable model for meeting the needs of children with a disability and the allocation of funding is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to supporting vulnerable children.</p>  <p>  When established, the new model will focus on the developmental level of children with disabilities, their functional ability and their needs. It will not focus on diagnosis, recognising that many children may not have a formal diagnosis at the time of presenting to pre-school.</p>  <p>  The model, when fully operational, will deliver seven levels of support to enable the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities in the ECCE Programme. These supports, which move from universal to highly targeted supports based on the needs of the child, include: enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations, increased capitation for children with very complex needs, as well as access to therapeutic intervention.</p>  <p>  Two groups have been established to oversee and implement the new model; a Cross Sectoral Implementation Group will oversee and monitor implementation, and a Project Group, which will implement the model for roll-out by September 2016.  Further details in relation to this measure are expected to be available in June this year. </p>  <p>  Until this new model is introduced, the ECCE programme continues to make special provision for children with a disability to access it. Measures include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification where a child would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  The County Childcare Committees continue to provide information and support for parents, and on some occasions assist in accessing supports locally and providing training for early years providers.</p>  <p>  There is no additional funding available to this Department to support the employment of special needs assistants in pre-school services.  The HSE, on an ad hoc basis, does make some supports available and it is expected that these arrangements will continue until the new model has been established.</p></reply>

With the establishment of the Tusla on 1 January 2014, the FSA and the NEWB ceased to exist and their roles were subsumed into the Agency.</p><p>In line with Government Decisions in 2011 relating to appointments to State Boards and bodies,  the vacancies on the boards of State Bodies and Agencies operating under my Department's aegis were published on my Department's website and expressions of interest from persons interested in being appointed to these boards were invited. My officials acknowledged all expressions of interest received and maintained a database of those expressions.</p><p>In May 2013 the Public Appointments Service (PAS), on behalf of my Department, sought expressions of interest from those interested in being appointed to the Board of the FSA, having regard to both its existing statutory functions and its planned role in facilitating the establishment of Tusla. The members of the FSA Board, in place at end 2013, were subsequently appointed to the Board of Tusla on its establishment on 1 January 2014.</p><p>New arrangements concerning appointments to State Boards were approved by Government in November 2014. Guidelines covering the process to be used were published on 25 November 2014 by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Under these new arrangements, PAS manages the process of  advertising vacancies and the selection of suitable potential appointees to State Boards.</p><p>There is currently one vacancy on the Tusla Board and this position was advertised by PAS. There are also two vacancies on the Board of Management of the Children Detention Schools. The Children (Amendment) Act 2015 creates a legal framework to amalgamate the 3 existing Schools in Oberstown into a single detention school with a new board of management to be appointed by me. I am also arranging for four vacant positions on Gaisce, the President's Award scheme, to be advertised through the State Boards process. Seven members were appointed to the Board of the Adoption Authority of Ireland with effect from 1 November 2015, following the advertisement and selection process by PAS.</p><p>My decisions on appointments to boards are subject to the relevant governing legislation, and take into account the particular responsibilities of the body or agency in question. At all times I seek to ensure that the body or agency is best served by an appropriate mix of skills and experience.</p><p>The tables below set out the appointments to the respective boards since 2011.</p><p><b>Adoption Authority of Ireland</b></p><p>The credentials of the persons appointed were in accordance with Section 98 of the Adoption Act 2010.<table><tr><th>Board Member</th><th>Term </th><th>Credentials </th></tr><tr><td>Dr. Imelda Ryan</td><td>02/02/12 - 02/02/17 (Board term ended 31/10/15)<br /><br />Appointed to new Board 01/11/15- 31/10/20</td><td>Doctor</td></tr><tr><td>Anne O&rsquo;Flaherty</td><td>11/03/13 - 11/09/18 (Board term ended 31/10/15)<br /><br />Appointed to new Board 01/11/15- 31/10/20</td><td>Appropriate training in Psychology</td></tr><tr><td>Dr. Geoffrey Shannon</td><td>01/11/15 - 31/10/20 Chairperson</td><td>Solicitor</td></tr><tr><td>Orlaith Traynor</td><td>01/11/15 - 31/10/20 Deputy Chairperson</td><td>Solicitor</td></tr><tr><td>Paul Harrison</td><td>01/11/15 - 31/10/20</td><td>Social Worker with Adoption Experience</td></tr><tr><td>Dr. Helen Buckley</td><td>01/11/15 - 31/10/20</td><td>Social Worker with Research Experience</td></tr><tr><td>Patrick McMahon</td><td>01/11/15 - 31/10/20</td><td>Retired District Court Judge</td></tr></table><b>Family Support Agency and Tusla (the Child and Family Agency)</b><table><tr><th>Board Member</th><th>Term </th><th>Credentials</th></tr><tr><td>Sharon Foley (Chair)</td><td>30/01/12 - 26/03/13 (Ordinary Board member) &amp;amp; 26/03/12 - 31/05/13 (FSA Chair)</td><td>CEO Irish Hospice Foundation</td></tr><tr><td>Caroline Murphy</td><td>20/10/11 - 31/03/12<br /><br />16/04/12 - 31/05/13</td><td>Organisational Psychologist and Broadcaster</td></tr><tr><td>Dick Hickey</td><td>02/06/11 - 01/12/11<br /><br />02/12/11 - 31/03/12<br /><br />16/04/12 - 31/05/13</td><td>Executive Director, St. Brigid&rsquo;s Family resource Centre</td></tr><tr><td>Dr. John Griffin</td><td>30/04/12 - 31/05/13</td><td>Consultant Psychiatrist</td></tr><tr><td>Marie Fenlon</td><td>01/09/11 - 31/03/12<br /><br />16/04/12 - 31/05/13</td><td>Nominee of the Family Resource Centre National Forum</td></tr><tr><td>Liz Chaloner</td><td>30/01/12 - 31/05/13</td><td>Independent Researcher, Facilitator, Consultant</td></tr><tr><td>Nuala Ryan</td><td>30/01/12 - 31/05/13</td><td>President UCD Women Graduates Association</td></tr><tr><td>Catherine Downey Murphy</td><td>11/07/12 - 31/05/13</td><td>Management positions in Health Service, Southern Health Board</td></tr><tr><td>Catherine Hazlett<br /><br />(Resigned on 16/05/12 due to restructuring of Department) </td><td>26/07/11 - 31/03/12<br /><br />16/04/12 - 16/05/12</td><td>Civil Servant &ndash; Department of Children and Youth Affairs Rep</td></tr><tr><td>Yvette O&rsquo;Malley<br /><br />(Resigned on 10/11/11)</td><td>01/09/11 - 10/11/11</td><td>Family Support Agency Staff Rep, Mediator</td></tr><tr><td>Marie Dullea</td><td>11/07/12 - 31/05/13</td><td>Civil Servant - Department of Children  and Youth Affairs Rep</td></tr><tr><td>Imelda Martin</td><td>28/11/11 - 31/03/12<br /><br />16/04/12 - 31/05/13</td><td>Family Support Agency Staff Rep</td></tr><tr><td>Lorraine Mulligan</td><td>12/12/12 - 31/03/13</td><td>Experienced Researcher, financial analysis, advocacy</td></tr><tr><td>Dr. Nollaig Byrne</td><td>08/02/12 - 31/05/13</td><td>Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist</td></tr><tr><td>Norah Gibbons (Chair)</td><td>01/06/13 - 31/12/13 (FSA) <br /><br />Appointed to Tusla Board 01/01/14</td><td>Former member of Task Force on the establishment of Child and Family Agency</td></tr><tr><td>Sylda Langford</td><td>17/09/13 - 31/12/13 (FSA)<br /><br />Appointed to Tusla Board 01/01/14</td><td>Retired &ndash; former Director General of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</td></tr><tr><td>PJ Fitzpatrick</td><td>17/09/13 - 31/12/13 (FSA)<br /><br />Appointed to Tusla Board 01/01/14</td><td>Former Independent Chair of the Implementation Body for the Public Service Pay and Modernisation (Croke Park) Agreement 2010-2013.

The supply of prescription medicines is controlled in a number of ways. </p>  <p>  Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, it is prohibited for a person to supply a prescription medicine except in accordance with a prescription, and the supply must be made from a registered pharmacy by or under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist.  A person who contravenes these Regulations is guilty of an offence. </p>  <p>  Medicines which have a high potential to be misused are subject to additional and stricter controls under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  These medicines include z-drug zolpidem. The Misuse of Drugs Acts and Regulations impose restrictions on the production, supply, importation and exportation of controlled drugs. A person who has in his possession a prescription medicine containing a controlled drug for the purpose of selling or supplying it in contravention of the Misuse of Drugs legislation, is guilty of an offence under that legislation. </p>  <p>  A Bill to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act so as to allow the Government to declare substances to be controlled and to clarify the provisions under which Ministerial orders and regulations are made is currently being drafted and is listed in the Government Legislative Programme for publication in 2016. This will once again allow regulations to be made and, if necessary and appropriate, bring under the scope of the Act new substances, including certain z-drugs, and allow the introduction of stricter or less strict controls on substances which are already covered under the legislation.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the problem of abuse of z-drugs will not be solved by regulations alone, and that prescribers need to ensure that these substances are only prescribed as appropriate.</p>  <p>  The Health Product Regulatory Authority which is the competent authority in Ireland for human medicines, Revenue&rsquo;s Customs service and an Garda Sioch&aacute;na work closely to prevent the unauthorised flow of illegal medicinal products into and out of the State.  The enforcement of the law relating to the sale of drugs, including prescription drugs, continues to be a priority in the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling the issue of drug misuse in this jurisdiction.  Garda enforcement is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive (HSE), unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.  In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p></reply>

While certain flexibilities had been built in to the Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability the <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>children and young people's policy framework contained a commitment to develop a plan to facilitate the full participation of such children in the ECCE Programme.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has lead responsibility for the implementation of this commitment and has concluded an intensive process of deliberation and consultation on the matter in conjunction with the Departments of Health and Education and Skills and has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.</p><p>As part of Budget 2016, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs announced the necessary funding to implement the new model of ECCE supports for children with a disability.  The new model will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of &euro;15m has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33m from 2017 onwards.  This model of supports was launched on 18 November last by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with my full support and the support of my Government colleague Jan O'Sullivan T.D., Minister for Education and Skills. </p><p>It should be noted that while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such pre-school assistant supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.</p><p>Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the individual case he has raised.  If he has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

Both schemes remain closed.</p><p>However, the Government also decided that monthly payments will continue to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time that the scheme closed, on the basis that this would prevent hardship and, on an interim basis, alleviate stress, anxiety and uncertainty among a vulnerable group in society.</p><p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Department is seeking a solution which would best meet the aim of supporting people with severe disabilities who require additional income to contribute towards the cost of their mobility needs, while remaining within the available budget and satisfying all legal and equality concerns. </p><p>Work is ongoing on the policy proposals to be brought to Government for the drafting of primary legislation for a new scheme.  The proposals seek to ensure that:</p><p>-There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;</p><p>-There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;</p><p>-Resources are targeted at those with the greatest needs; and</p><p>-The Scheme is capable of being costed and it is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.</p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland (Gardasil and Cervarix).  Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme and over 100,000 girls have received this vaccine since its introduction.</p>  <p>  No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use.  The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised.</p>  <p>  As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.</p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.</p>  <p>  I want to make it quite clear that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services.</p>  <p>  In November 2015 the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review, which the HPRA participated in, found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.</p>  <p>  On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information.  This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all member states.</p></reply>

The Scheme involves a community rating levy collected by the Revenue Commissioners from insurers in respect of all policies written and all of the monies collected are paid over to the Risk Equalisation Fund administered by the independent regulator - the Health Insurance Authority.  The Authority then redistributes the fund back to the market through credits payable to insurers in respect of insured lives to offset some of the additional cost of insuring older and less healthy members.

Last year additional funding of &euro;18 million was provided to support acute hospitals over the winter period by providing additional bed capacity and other initiatives to improve access to care.  As a result of this an additional 301 beds were commissioned across various locations and to date 202 of these beds have been opened.

They are of critical importance, particularly for those with higher or more complex care needs and it was, accordingly, essential that these beds be put on a sustainable footing.  For this reason, I was delighted to announce last week an extensive national programme of capital investment in public residential units that will bring them into compliance with relevant National Standards by 2021. This significant investment reflects our determination to maintain the current public nursing home bed stock and will provide an additional 215 beds across the country.</p>  <p>  Given the requirement for additional services to provide for the needs of older persons right around the country there will, in parallel with residential beds, be an ongoing need for the provision of short stay services such as rehabilitation, respite, step up, step down facilities, all with a view of maintaining older people in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  It is important to acknowledge that this is where most people want to be.  Despite continuing pressure on the public finances the level of home and community based services were significantly strengthened last year and this will be maintained in 2016.  This year the HSE will be providing almost 2,000 short stay residential beds, over 300 transitional care beds, about 10.4 million home help hours, and 15,450 Home Care Packages.  In addition, some 130 Intensive Home Care Packages will be provided to support the discharge from acute hospital settings of people with more complex needs.</p></reply>

The Bill, as introduced, makes provision for the preparation of an autism strategy and a national framework for addressing the specific needs of adults with autism.  The broad trust of the Bill was accepted by Government and it was not opposed at Second Stage.  Although the needs of people with autism have received some recognition in recent years, the Bill is seen as contributing to a more enlightened and educated public debate.</p>  <p>  In the context of the Autism Bill, it is important to note that the Government is already committed under the National Disability Strategy (NDS) to ensuring that people with autism are empowered by policy and programmes to participate meaningfully as citizens in Irish society.  The NDS is driven by this basic but fundamentally important objective and is the most effective combination of legislation, policies, institutional arrangements and services to support and reinforce equal participation for all people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  The Cabinet Committee on Social Policy has been examining issues around autism across Government Departments in association with the National Disability Authority (NDA).  This work by the NDA, which has included consultation with families, has been of significant assistance in informing how best to address the needs of people with ASD as part of the National Disability Strategy which covers a wide range of policy areas and Government Departments and agencies, so that we can be sure that they are appropriately reflected and included in policies and actions.  The proposed approach was also discussed with the National Disability Strategy Steering Group. </p>  <p>  I understand from the NDA that a programme of specific measures has now been agreed for delivery by the relevant Government Departments and agencies, including specific actions to be delivered by the NDA.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice &amp;amp; Equality is currently preparing a revised National Disability Inclusion Strategy with a view to having it in place by early 2016 following a wide consultation with interested parties. </p>  <p>  As a particular issue raised by the Deputy is a service matter for the Health Service Executive, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-02-02a.895.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016020200069#WRV02400"><p>The introduction of any screening campaign has to be very carefully considered and the positive and negative impact of screening programme evaluated.  In 2011, the UK National Screening Committee commissioned a full and systematic assessment of the international evidence base for scoliosis screening.  The review concluded that screening for scoliosis was not recommended.</p>  <p>  This comprehensive assessment drew on studies from many countries.  The Irish epidemiology of scoliosis is not known to differ significantly from that in other countries, therefore this finding is also relevant for the Irish population. </p>  <p>  The US Preventive task force and a similar body in Australia which reviewed screening for scoliosis, also came out against screening.  The US task force are in the process of updating this review, which is due to report in 2016, and any changes in that position will be noted.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, there is no evidence to support the re-introduction of scoliosis screening in schools in Ireland at the present time, but as with all potential screening programmes this will be subject to review as new evidence emerges.</p></reply>

I have been clear in my determination that these waiting times are to be addressed as a priority, through additional resources and capacity. </p>  <p>  Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin is the largest provider of scoliosis surgery for children and young people.  Funding was allocated in 2015 for additional consultant posts including two consultant orthopaedic surgeons, anaesthetist and support staff including  at Crumlin  while capital funding was also provided for a new theatre on site to expand theatre capacity further.  The 2016 Service Plan specifically provides for support for the new theatre capacity and the continued development of paediatric scoliosis services to address ongoing capacity deficits. </p>  <p>  In order to address waiting times in the interim, patients from Crumlin have been transferred to other hospitals where capacity is available and where that is clinically appropriate.  These include Temple Street, Cappagh, Tallaght and the Blackrock Clinic.  External capacity has also been identified at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital at Stanmore in the UK.  As a result of this initiative, 94 scoliosis surgeries were carried out in 2015, 42% more than in 2014. The Department of Health is continuing to work with the HSE, the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group and the hospitals themselves to ensure that we continue to make strong progress in addressing this issue and to identify all options to increase capacity to further improve access times for surgery.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific case raised, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly. If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and my officials will follow the matter up.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, as a result it has become necessary for the HSE to suspend certain products from its list of items reimbursable under the GMS and other community drug schemes.  This includes gluten-free products. </p>  <p>  Gluten-free products have become more widely available in supermarkets in recent years and tend to be significantly cheaper than products sold through community pharmacies. Coeliac patients can also claim medical expenses tax relief on expenditure incurred on gluten-free products manufactured specifically for coeliacs. There are no plans to reinstate these products on the list of reimbursable items under the GMS and other community drug schemes.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable. It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place, until after 16-18 years of age, before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need. Patients with the greatest level of need i.e. Grade 5 or Grade 4 are provided with treatment by the HSE. </p><p>Some 16,887 were in active treatment at the end of Quarter 3 of 2015.</p><p>The information on waiting times for assessment and for treatment at the end of Quarter 3 of 2015 is shown in the tables below.  The information is collated by the HSE by region and for the intervals as shown.<table><tr><th>Waiting time for assessment</th><th>1 - 6 months</th><th>7 - 12 months</th><th>13 - 24 months</th><th>Over 24 months</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin Mid-Leinster</td><td>1,461</td><td>40</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>1,511</td></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin North East</td><td>616</td><td>169</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>785</td></tr><tr><td>HSE South</td><td>1,329</td><td>551</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>1,883</td></tr><tr><td>HSE West</td><td>1,392</td><td>395</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1,787</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>4,798</td><td>1,155</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>5,966</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th>Waiting time from assessment to commencement of treatment </th><th>1 - 6 months</th><th>7 - 12 months </th><th>13 - 24 months</th><th>25-48 months</th><th>Over 48 months</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin Mid-Leinster </td><td>729</td><td>974</td><td>1,513</td><td>1,585</td><td>334</td><td>5,135</td></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin North-East</td><td>309</td><td>577</td><td>1,035</td><td>1,515</td><td>726</td><td>4,162</td></tr><tr><td>HSE South</td><td>662</td><td>802</td><td>994</td><td>1,449</td><td>306</td><td>4,213</td></tr><tr><td>HSE West</td><td>450</td><td>793</td><td>2,021</td><td>1,304</td><td>28</td><td>4,596</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>2,150</td><td>3,146</td><td>5,563</td><td>5,853</td><td>1,394</td><td>18,106</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Similar to elsewhere, Galway/Roscommon Mental Health Services are committed to full implementation of AVFC.  Key to modernising services in line with current and future demand, and best international practice, is re-orientation from a hospital and bed-based focus to improved structures and processes for better community-based care.  In the national context, the provision of acute in-patient beds in the Galway/Roscommon region is well within the recommendations set out in <i>A Vision for </i>Change, which states 50 beds per 300,000 population.  This region has around 67 beds in total, for a population of some 315,000, and a further 5 beds will come on-stream in Galway with the opening of the new Acute Unit in early 2017. </p><p>Following the closure of St. Brigid&rsquo;s, approximately &euro;3m has been invested by the HSE  to upgrade the Ballinasloe facility to ensure  improved delivery of community-based services, including mental health care.  The refurbishment was necessary also to meet relevant statutory building standards.  In particular, the building is being used for Psychiatry of Later Life patients, Community Mental Health Teams and Mental Health Intellectual Disability services, as well as various other uses.</p><p>The HSE will continue to develop community based care, including mental health provision, at Ballinasloe while also developing regional acute in-patient care, in line with agreed service priorities and resource availability.  It is not, therefore, intended to undertake the proposal raised by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Bill, as introduced, makes provision for the preparation of an autism strategy and a national framework for addressing the specific needs of adults with autism. The broad thrust of the Bill was accepted by Government and it was not opposed at Second Stage. Although the needs of people with autism have received some recognition in recent years, the Bill is seen as contributing to a more enlightened and educated public debate.</p>  <p>  In the context of the Autism Bill, it is important to note that the Government is already committed under the National Disability Strategy (NDS) to ensuring that people with autism are empowered by policy and programmes to participate meaningfully as citizens in Irish society. The NDS is driven by this basic but fundamentally important objective and is the most effective combination of legislation, policies, institutional arrangements and services to support and reinforce equal participation for all people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  The Cabinet Committee on Social Policy has been examining issues around autism across Government Departments in association with the National Disability Authority (NDA).  This work by the NDA, which has included consultation with families, has been of significant assistance in informing how best to address the needs of people with ASD as part of the National Disability Strategy which covers a wide range of policy areas and Government Departments and agencies, so that we can be sure that they are appropriately reflected and included in policies and actions.  The proposed approach was also discussed with the National Disability Strategy Steering Group. </p>  <p>  I understand from the NDA that a programme of specific measures has now been agreed for delivery by the relevant Government Departments and agencies, including specific actions to be delivered by the NDA.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice and Equality is currently preparing a revised National Disability Inclusion Strategy with a view to having it in place by early 2016 following a wide consultation with interested parties. </p></reply>

I would like to advise the Deputy of the actions taken by the NMBI and the Department in this regard:</p>  <p>  -  the Department has approved the filling of 19 posts;</p>  <p>  -  the NMBI have put a number of contact channels in place for applicants following up on the progress of their application. For example, in October 2015, the NMBI opened a dedicated call centre line for overseas applicants. This call centre is open  Monday through to Friday, 9.00am to 5.30pm. The call centre can provide regular updates to overseas applicants on the current status of their application. To mid January, this call centre has taken over 4,500 calls.</p>  <p>  -  the NMBI is also imminently launching a new website which will have additional features for overseas applicants to include a facility to &ldquo;Track their Application&rdquo; on-line;</p>  <p>  -  new forms to simplify the process of applying have been introduced including a revised information booklet;</p>  <p>  -  further adaptation courses are being provided for nurses who are required to complete a course prior to registration. The NMBI have approved a new aptitude test with RCSI as an alternative method to assess candidates for registration. Nurses are currently being advised of the availability of this test;</p>  <p>  -  the Department of Health has had discussions with the Department of Justice and Equality with a view to resolving certain visa difficulties and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation regarding work permits. It has been confirmed that the current provision of an atypical working visa has been extended to those choosing to undertake the aptitude test.</p>  <p>  -  proposals for significant upgrading of the overall IT systems, particularly the registration system, are being developed by the NMBI;</p>  <p>  -  meetings to review registration and other governance issues are held between the Department of Health and the NMBI monthly with the accompanying reports; and</p>  <p>  -  to address the issues of delays in registration the NMBI has informed the Department that it continues to collaborate closely with key stakeholders including representatives from the HSE, Nursing Homes Ireland, Directors of Nursing/Midwifery and agencies to ensure complete applications received are expedited, particularly for those applicants who have confirmed job offers. This engagement has led to very positive working relationships with these Stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  The central function of the NMBI is protection of the public and we therefore must be satisfied that all documentation required to progress an application to decision stage meets all the necessary requirements.</p></reply>

The Council can take action where it is believed that a doctor has serious failings in his/her practice. The Medical Council acts in the public interest, and can impose restrictions on a doctor&rsquo;s registration, which would restrict or remove their right to practise medicine in Ireland.</p><p>Anyone can make a complaint about a doctor who is registered in Ireland. This includes members of the public, employers and other healthcare professionals. The Medical Council can only take action where complaints are of a serious nature and raise concerns over a doctor's fitness to practise. A complaint can be made to the Medical Council by submitting a complaint form.  This form can be found on the Medical Council website www.medicalcouncil.ie.  </p><p>It is generally best that complaints are dealt with locally when they occur and all efforts made to resolve them with the patient or person who has the complaint.  Most complaints can be dealt with locally at the place where the person receives care.  There are a number of options open to an individual to make a complaint about the health services at present.  Part 9 of the Health Act 2004 states that a person has the right to complain about any action of the Health Service Executive (HSE) or a service provider that they believe was not fair or had an adverse affect on them. The HSE has appointed designated Complaints Officers to ensure the effective management of complaints throughout their relevant areas of responsibility.  </p><p>The HSE actively encourages and promotes consumer feedback and links with customers on a regular basis to ensure that the complaint handling processes are effective, are being communicated and are achieving outcomes that are satisfactory to the consumers. The HSE continues to seek improvements in its complaint handling ability and capacity in order to respond to the needs of patients.  Feedback from service users and their families is welcomed and valued by the HSE, taken seriously and investigated in line with &lsquo;Your Service Your Say&rsquo; as they allow the HSE to continually improve services. </p><p>If an individual is unhappy with the way in which his/her complaint was dealt with the National Advocacy Unit of the HSE will appoint an independent officer to review the complaint.  If an individual is still unhappy with the outcome of this process he/she can request an independent review of the complaint from the Office of the Ombudsman or Ombudsman for Children.  Healthcomplaints.ie is an on-line information service which was developed by the Office of the Ombudsman in cooperation with a number of organisations including the Department of Health and the HSE. This service provides information on how to make a complaint or give feedback about health and social care services in Ireland. This website has been developed for people who use health and social care services in Ireland, as well as for their families, care-givers and advocates.  </p><p>A National Policy on Open Disclosure was developed jointly by the HSE with the State Claims Agency and launched in November 2013. The Heads of the Bill  on legislation to strengthen the provisions under the open disclosure policy by protecting the disclosure from legal proceedings were published on the Department&rsquo;s website in November 2015.  This directly addresses fears that health service providers, doctors and nurses may have that being open can increase the risk of being sued and of that information being used against them in the litigation process. </p></reply>

This was especially so in a small number of cases where the applicants were in nursing homes or small hospitals which had closed down. In such cases, the applicant should inform Judge Clark and send on correspondence indicating efforts to obtain those birth records. Where this happens, members of the Scheme are assisting the applicants to locate their records. Birth registers have been tracked down, Annual Clinical Reports in some cases have been consulted and contact made with FOI officers in relevant institutions. In some cases the symphysiotomy has been established. If reasonable efforts to locate documentary evidence are not successful, then arrangements are made to have such applicants examined by a gynaecologist for the presence of a surgical symphysiotomy scar and by a radiologist to establish the extent of any pubis symphysis widening. </p></reply>

Significant resources continue to be deployed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, both in Cairo and in Dublin, in the provision of comprehensive consular assistance to both this citizen and his family.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, any decision regarding bail or release will be made solely by the relevant Egyptian authorities.  In this case, the Irish Government has lent its formal support to requests for release on bail and release under the Presidential decree/Law 140, and will continue to work in support of these efforts.</p>  <p>  All actions taken in this case are considered in light of the Government's clear objectives. First, to see this citizen released by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland and, second, to provide consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention.  The considered approach and sustained action that has been taken by the Taoiseach, Ministers and by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to date in this case has been to further these objectives, and most importantly to avoid any action that could be counterproductive or detrimental to his best interests.</p>  <p>  In addition to engagement with the Egyptian authorities, the Government also frequently engages with other states who have had citizens in similar situations, with our European and international partners represented in Egypt, and with the European Union.  I have engaged extensively with High Representative Ms. Federica Mogherini, who raised this citizen's case with Foreign Minister Shoukry on her most recent visit to Cairo.  The Taoiseach has also discussed the case at the very highest level with President al-Sisi.  The Egyptian Government is in no doubt about the Irish Government's position and our desire to see this citizen released as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The Government will remain resolute in pursuing its clear objectives in this case and what we firmly believe to be in this citizen&rsquo;s best interests and to be most likely to contribute to a positive outcome for him. </p></reply>

Japan is the third largest economy in the world, and is a significant source of Foreign Direct Investment into Ireland and the largest in Asia; there are more than 50 Japanese companies with a presence in Ireland, 28 of which are IDA assisted, making Japan the 6th largest contributor to FDI by employment (over 3,200) in assisted companies.</p>  <p>  Ireland also has a strong trading relationship with Japan which has been growing in importance in recent years to the extent that Japan was our 11th largest trading partner in 2014.

Embassies were established for the first time in the fast-growing economies of Thailand (Bangkok) and Indonesia (Jakarta).  Consulates General established in the financial and business hubs of Hong Kong (China) and Sao Paulo (Brazil), and in the booming tech hub of Austin, Texas (USA).  Following the accession of Croatia as the 28<sup>th</sup>member state of the European Union, an Embassy was established in Zagreb.  The Government has also re-opened an embassy in Nairobi, Kenya for economic development opportunities and a one-diplomat embassy with a focus on international development was re-established at the Holy See to enable Ireland to engage directly with the leadership of Pope Francis on the issues of poverty eradication, hunger and human rights.</p><p>This expansion of the Embassies and Consulates network commenced in late 2014 and as a result only partial costs were incurred in 2014.  However in 2015 the full year running costs, and the initial establishment costs, of these missions were incurred. </p><p>As part of the same process, the Embassy network underwent some rationalisation and redeployment of staff.  Ireland's Embassy to Lesotho was closed, with Ireland's Embassy in South Africa assuming responsibility for the Kingdom of Lesotho.  The Irish Embassy in Vilnius, Lithuania, was also downsized.  Ireland's existing Irish Aid office in Freetown, Sierra Leone, was upgraded to Embassy status, at no additional cost to the State.</p><p>Secondly, the Euro has been weak against other international currencies, in particular the US Dollar and Sterling, resulting in significant adverse exchange rate fluctuations.  While this has been a significant advantage to our exporters it has added significant operating costs in the vast majority of the international locations in which this Departments operates outside the Euro zone area.</p><p>Thirdly, as world economies recover inflation rates in these markets are rising more rapidly than in Ireland resulting in increased operating costs in the local market.  This increases our costs of operating in these markets.</p><p>The work of our Embassies and Consulates around the world continues to be important in Ireland's economic recovery and the restoration of our international reputation.  Our Embassies and Consulates work in support of Ireland's interests include:</p><p>-  Promoting Ireland as a source of high-quality exports, a destination for investment, research, study and tourism to targeted audiences and contacts;</p><p>-  Supporting trade missions and other trade-focussed high-level visits, record numbers of which have taken place in the last four years;</p><p>-  Directly assisting Irish companies with advice, introductions and working to resolve regulatory or market access issues, in partnership with Enterprise Ireland;</p><p>-  Providing frontline consular and passport services to Irish citizens overseas;</p><p>-  Influencing and negotiating for Ireland on issues that could impact our interests and priorities. </p></reply>

This target is subject to employer demand and economic capacity and will require a strong employer commitment in order for them to be achieved. The 50,000 target will be achieved by a combination of the following:</p><p>-  Increased registrations in existing trades</p><p>-  Apprentices participating in new apprenticeships</p><p>-  Existing Traineeships</p><p>-  New Career Traineeships</p><p>  In 2015 there was an increase in the SOLAS allocation for apprenticeship of &euro;10 million.  As part of budget 2016 there is also a further provision of &euro;10.5 million to expand the apprenticeship programme. This will allow for the development of new apprenticeship programmes and cater for increased registrations in existing trades.  Taking account of the development of new apprenticeships and new career traineeships and overall employer demand, budget allocations to cater for the increased participation in these programmes will be determined on an annual basis.</p></reply>

Extending the brief in this way would breach the procurement threshold as set out under Article 31 of the 2004 Directive and is therefore prohibited. In order to remain compliant with these procurement guidelines, the Department is not in a position to reconsider the request for an extension to the brief of the appointed project consultant.</p>  <p>  Kildare County Council has proposed a broader assessment of flooding in the catchment area in question than was included in our planning application for the site. While we acknowledge that this potentially may be required in order for us to develop the site, the proposals presented to us in this respect go far beyond the identification of the remediation measures required in respect of our site. These proposals also require the assessment of lands in the broader catchment area which are outside the control of the Department and potentially require us to design a flood relief scheme in respect of these areas. We have written to the Council with a view to resolving this issue and we remain fully committed to working with the Council in endeavouring to reach a solution to this matter.</p></reply>

Curriculum choice is important in motivating students to learn and to remain in school to completion of senior cycle.</p>  <p>  Schools across all sectors offer History. History teachers attract students to their subject through their own love and passion for History, and by engaging the natural curiosity of their students in, for example, the lives of people, the origins of the modern world and in objects and documents from the past. History is the 5th most popular subject in the Junior Certificate examination. The Decade of Centenaries is giving added interest to History, especially the 1916- 2106 celebrations this year.</p>  <p>  I have every confidence that through the implementation of the Framework for Junior Cycle the place of history will be retained and given a new impetus across the junior cycle curriculum. Such an impetus should help to improve uptake of History at senior cycle also. In fact, a new specification for Junior Cycle History will shortly be developed by the NCCA. This will involve intensive consultation whereby all interested parties will be able to provide their views. The new specification will be available for implementation in all schools from September 2018.</p></reply>

The previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable of all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011 and required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale.</p>  <p>  Subsequently, following the public service-wide review of allowances and premium payments, the Government decided to withdraw or modify allowances for new beneficiary public servants with effect from 1 February 2012. Under this decision, certain allowances were withdrawn for new beneficiary teachers, including qualification allowances. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. </p>  <p>  These measures were implemented at time of very difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State.</p>  <p>  Alleviation of the salary imbalance between those who entered the public service since 2011 and those who entered before that date began under the Haddington Road Agreement. Improved pay scales for post-1 January 2011 and post-1 February 2012 entrants to teaching were agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement. In addition, allowances payable to post-1 January 2011 entrants and such allowances as remain payable to post-1 February 2012 entrants were restored to pre-2011 levels.</p>  <p>  The Lansdowne Road Agreement will, through salary increases and a reduction in the Pension-Related Deduction, begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years. The issue of equalised pay scales was not one which could be resolved in the discussions which lead to the Agreement. However, the flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement will be proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers. Circular letter 0066/2015 which issued in December 2015 sets out the revisions to the thresholds for the Pension Related Deduction from 2015 and revised salary scales for teachers which take effect from 1 January 2016.</p></reply>

However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. </p><p>Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant ETB or to the Secretary General of my Department. </p><p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which was published in April of last year, provides an over-arching framework to ensure that how schools decide on who is enrolled and who is refused a place in schools is more structured, fair and transparent.</p></reply>

It also acknowledges that the sector must be resourced sufficiently and in a sustainable manner to ensure it can deliver on our national ambitions.</p><p>  In recognition of funding pressures in the Sector, an Expert Group chaired by Peter Cassells has been established to examine funding arrangements for higher education and to identify a range of approaches that, combined, will achieve a sustainable funding base. I understand that the Group is in the final stages of its deliberations and I expect to receive its report soon.</p><p>I would add that the 2016-2021 Capital Plan provides funding of &euro;350m for the Third Level Sector: a direct Exchequer investment of &euro;150m, including &euro;40m already allocated to the Grangegorman project; and &euro;200m worth of funding for PPP projects.  These are hugely important and very welcome investments which will go some way to addressing the capital requirements and, more particularly, the infrastructural deficits that exist in the Sector.  They also make a strong statement about the importance of the Sector to our national strategic objectives.</p></reply>

In such cases these children will receive additional teaching support through the learning support and/or the resource teacher and, where appropriate, will receive access to Special Needs Assistance and assistive technology if required. </p><p>  In respect of children with ASD who cannot be accommodated in mainstream education, they may be enrolled in special classes or special schools where more intensive and supportive interventions are provided.  Progress in developing this network has been significant and in addition to the special school placements there are over 1,000 special classes throughout the country at primary and post-primary level, of which 762 are for children with Autism.  This includes 116 of which are early intervention settings, 452 in primary schools and 194 at post-primary level.  Each special class for autism has a 6:1 pupil teacher ratio at primary level, and 6:1.5 pupil teacher ratio at post-primary level as well as Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 SNAs for a class of 6 children.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is responsible, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support students with special educational needs, including autism.  It is also the role of the NCSE to make appropriate arrangements to establish special classes in schools in various geographical areas as required.  A full list of special classes is available on the NCSEs website www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has recently submitted their Policy Advice on Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.  In developing this policy advice, the NCSE has consulted widely with parents, professionals and other stakeholders and interested parties while also conducting research.  The policy advice is currently under consideration in my Department. </p><p>  My officials will consider and report to me on any recommendations in the report which relate to the issues raised by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The existing post-primary schools, including the new 1,000 student post-primary which opened in 2014, can between them cater for the demand for places in the area.  My Department's priority is to ensure that all schools in an area can between them cater for all students seeking a school place.  This may, however, result in students not being offered a place in the school of their first choice. </p><p>  In relation to the source of the data used in the Department's demographic exercises, my Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for additional school places will arise.  The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection, local authorities and the Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  The outcome of the latest demographic exercises was that on 17 November 2015, I announced that 4 new primary schools and 9 new post-primary schools will open in 2017 and 2018 to cater for increased demographic needs.</p></reply>

Section 22 of the Act makes specific provision for the registration , based on technical assessment, of persons who had been independently performing duties commensurate with those of an architect for a period of 10 or more years in the State prior to the commencement of the Act.  This is in effect what is often colloquially referred to as a &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; provision.</p><p>In general, a construction professional who is not included on any of the three statutory registers for Architects, Building Surveyors or Chartered Engineers is not entitled to use the relevant professional titles of Architect, Building Surveyor or Chartered Engineer and may not sign statutory certificates of compliance for building control purposes.</p><p>In 2013, in response in particular to the lower than anticipated rate of applications for inclusion on the Register of Architects through the technical assessment route, an independent review of the arrangements in place for registration was undertaken by Mr Garret Fennell, Solicitor.  Mr Fennell&rsquo;s report on the matter is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and can be accessed by clicking on the following weblink </p><p>.</p><p>The Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht also examined the matter and published its <i>Report on the Title of Architect (July 2013).</i></p><p>Both reports, which were welcomed by my Department, made a number of recommendations intended to improve and streamline the arrangements for registration.  Implementation of these recommendations, in consultation with the Architects Alliance of Ireland (AAI) and others, has seen a number of reforms being implemented which include the administration of the technical assessment process on a cyclical basis where briefing, guidance and support for candidates can be administered in a structured manner; mentoring and supporting applicants; facilitating assessment based on recent projects; facilitating applicants with reassessment/reapplication (i.e. ensuring that the technical assessment procedure is not seen as a one chance only route to registration); and reviewing and simplifying guidance materials with direct input from practice-trained persons.</p><p>The recent review of the Building Control Regulations afforded the opportunity for further consideration of the matter in the context of broadening the pool of persons who may certify building works for building control purposes.  In this regard, Minister Kelly and I have both reaffirmed our commitment to continuing to work with stakeholders to identify, as an alternative to the existing technical assessment procedure, a special entry route that takes due account of the practice-trained experience and subsequent career circumstances of such candidates for registration.</p><p>In recent weeks, the AAI has updated its own proposals for a special entry route to incorporate the proposed development of a prescribed register admission examination as currently provided for under section 14(2)(f) of the Act.  While the Act would allow me to prescribe such a register admission examination as a route to registration for eligible persons, neither I nor my Department have the remit or the competence to validate or approve the proposed register admission examination.  That aspect of the matter comes within the responsibility of the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland (RIAI) who are designated as the registration body for the purposes of the Act of 2007 and as the competent authority for the purposes of Directive 2005/ 36 /E C (as amended) on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.  For this reason I would advise the AAI in the first instance to discuss their latest proposal with the RIAI as registration body/competent authority for the architectural profession in Ireland.</p><p>As previously stated, m y Department and the RIAI, as registration body, are committed to continuing to work with the AAI a nd all other stakeholders to achieve whatever further reasonable and practical improvements in registration arrangements can be made.</p></reply>

Section 34 of the Act provides that a landlord may not serve a notice of termination on a tenant except in very clearly defined circumstances such as a failure by the tenant to comply with his or her obligations in relation to the tenancy; where the landlord intends to sell the property; or where the landlord requires the dwelling for his or her own occupation or for that of a family member.  Section 56 of the 2004 Act provides that where a landlord terminates a tenancy on the ground that he or she intends to enter into an agreement to sell the dwelling, and does not subsequently do so, a tenant may make a complaint to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) that they have been unjustly deprived of possession of the dwelling by the landlord.  On the hearing of such a complaint, the PRTB may award damages to the tenant, direct that the tenant be permitted to resume possession of the dwelling, or both.  Section 118 of the Act provides for the discretion of the PRTB to refuse a direction for possession where such a direction could cause hardship or injustice to another person in possession of the dwelling.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 introduced strengthened protections applying to tenancy terminations in order to guard against terminations on false grounds.  These measures involve<i>, </i>inter alia, a landlord having to make a statutory declaration as to their intention to sell a property.  These provisions are subject to commencement order and will be commenced shortly.</p></reply>

Section 20 of the Act provides that the rent may not be reviewed more often than once every 24 months and section 22 provides that following a review, a landlord must give their tenant a minimum of 90 days&rsquo; notice of new rent.</p><p>Section 26(1)(b) of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 amends section 22 of the 2004 Act to provide that a landlord must, when notifying a tenant of new rent as required under section 22, <i>inter alia</i>, provide the tenant with information regarding the amount of rent sought for 3 similar dwellings in a comparable area.  In these circumstances, the Act stipulates that the amount of rent sought means the rent of a dwelling specified in an advertisement published within 4 weeks before the date of the notice.  The purpose of this provision is to ensure that tenants are aware of prevailing rents and their rights under the Act in relation to market rent.</p><p>The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB ) Rent Index is compiled by the Economic and Social Research Institute and based on the PRTB&rsquo;s register of tenancies.  The index is updated quarterly and is generally published approximately 2 months after the end of each quarter.  This time lag is due to the 30 day grace period for retrospective registrations and the subsequent data analysis required.  Therefore, to ensure that the most update to date information is available to tenants, landlords are asked to provide tenants with the rents of 3 similar dwellings as specified in an advertisement published within 4 weeks before the date of the notice rather than information from the PRTB Rent Index.</p><p>Where a tenant considers that the new rent set is in excess of the market rent, the tenant may bring a dispute to the PRTB and the rent may not be increased pending the determination of that dispute.  Section 26(1)(b) is subject to a commencement order and will be commenced shortly.</p></reply>

It will not at that time be applied to commercial waste.  However, it is planned to introduce legislation in the second half of 2016 to provide for the application of pay-by-weight to commercial waste.  Consultations will be held with the waste industry, representatives of the business community and other stakeholders in the waste sector in advance of the introduction of pay-by-weight for commercial waste.</p>  <p>  The per kilogram charge for household waste is set to cover the cost of sustainably treating the waste after it is first tipped at a collector&rsquo;s depot or a waste facility.  It covers the cost from there onwards of transporting and treating or disposing of the waste.  Therefore the cost per kilogram of treating each of the waste streams is not related to how it is generated (i.e. by households or commercial entities) and it is not expected that there would be any material difference between commercial and household collections.  Any service charge will be a matter for the waste collector to decide and will be dependent on open market conditions.</p></reply>

In respect of construction projects announced in July 2015, these were all given initial approval-in-principle by my Department to proceed through the design and planning processes.  As we know, the construction of housing takes time as all projects undergo design and planning work and these and other factors can have a direct impact on the timing for the advancement of construction projects.</p>  <p>  While final figures are still being collated, the estimate is that approved housing bodies delivered over 350 units during 2015 under the Capital Assistance Scheme.

The Chairperson was assigned by the National Asset Management Agency on a temporary basis at the request of my Department.</p><p>During the course of its work, the Clearing House Group received 25 proposals for funding social and affordable housing, using both existing mechanisms and new approaches.  The Group reported to me in November 2015, and arising from its work a number of measures are being developed with a view to better facilitating private investment into social housing.</p><p>The Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme operated through my Department currently provides a means whereby properties can be built or bought by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) with the use of private funding and leased through AHB&rsquo;s and Local Authorities, for the provision of social housing.  This scheme is underpinned by a lease and other legal agreements which provide that rental payments are made by the State over an agreed long-term time period, typically 20 years, in return for which the housing unit is made available for social housing.  Changes are now being proposed to this scheme to provide revised arrangements which serve to expand these mechanisms to facilitate larger institutional private investors to come into the social housing market.</p><p>The National Development Finance Agency is acting as financial advisor in respect of this work.  The new arrangements arising from this process will also require to be tested to ensure that there is no negative impact arising from how they are viewed and treated in respect of the State&rsquo;s General Government Balance.</p></reply>

Details of unit delivery across the capital funded programmes broken down by local authority are contained in Table 1 below.</p><p>I assume that the Questions are referring to the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) rather than the Social Inclusion Community Activation Programme (SICAP) or the Sustainable Cultural Heritage through Engagement of Local Communities project, neither of which are related to the provision of social housing.</p><p>Under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP - previously referred to as the Social Housing Leasing Initiative) local authorities can enter into long term leases or rental arrangements and make them available for social housing. In addition, approved housing bodies can purchase, lease or construct housing units and make them available for social housing under the SHCEP. To the end of November 2015, over 6,700 housing units have been delivered under SHCEP since it began in 2009. While the total number of new units delivered and operational using all of the mechanisms available under SHCEP in 2015 is yet to be finalised, I estimate that the final figure will be in the region of 1,450 units.</p><p>At end November 2015, an additional 2,280 units had received full funding approval under SHCEP and an additional 93 were at approval stage. While the focus of the SHCEP in recent years has been on the acquisition and long term leasing of existing housing units, my Department is providing an increasing number of approvals for assistance under SHCEP to approved housing bodies for the construction of new units for social housing use. At end of November 2015 , my Department had provided approval for the construction of 589 new units by approved housing bodies under the Scheme.</p><p>In 2011, a process was established to identify units that could be used for social housing purposes from properties that are part of the security for loans that NAMA has acquired. NAMA sourced units are brought into social housing through existing delivery mechanisms, including SHCEP, and to date more than 2,000 units have been secured for social housing in this way. A special purpose vehicle established by NAMA, the National Asset Residential Property Services Ltd. (NARPS), acquires properties from developers or receivers in NAMA&rsquo;s portfolio and makes them available to local authorities and approved housing bodies by way of a long term lease. My Department, through SHCEP, recoups to local authorities the cost of these units. By end November 2015, 800 units in total had become operational using this mechanism; 389 of which became operational in 2015. The remaining units are due to become operational in 2016/17 and will contribute to the achievement of the 2016-2017 targets for SHCEP under the Social Housing Strategy.</p><p>A detailed breakdown of NAMA &ndash; related delivery is contained in the <i>Social Housing Output in 2015</i>report.</p><p><b><i>Table 1 - Breakdown by Local Authority of delivery under Capital Programmes in 2015</i></b><table><tr><th><div>Local Authority </div></th><th><div>Units </div></th></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Council </td><td><div>49 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan County Council </td><td><div>45 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Clare County Council </td><td><div>160 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork City Council </td><td><div>403 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council </td><td><div>228 </div></td></tr><tr><td>DLR County Council </td><td><div>63 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal County Council </td><td><div>177 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council </td><td><div>1,096 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council </td><td><div>277 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway City Council </td><td><div>49 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway County Council </td><td><div>73 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry County Council </td><td><div>147 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare County Council </td><td><div>97 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council </td><td><div>51 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Laois County Council </td><td><div>50 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim County Council </td><td><div>15 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City and County Co </td><td><div>157 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Longford County Council </td><td><div>27 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council </td><td><div>63 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo County Council </td><td><div>102 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Meath County Council </td><td><div>90 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan County Council </td><td><div>35 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council </td><td><div>66 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon County Council </td><td><div>53 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo County Council </td><td><div>71 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Sth Dublin County Council </td><td><div>62 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary County Council </td><td><div>179 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City and County Council </td><td><div>65 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath County Council </td><td><div>81 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford County Council </td><td><div>50 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow County Council </td><td><div>107 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td><div>4,188 </div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

In the course of 2015, the work streams provided analysis, guidance and recommendations to the Project Board and the Oversight Group on all aspects of social housing delivery and considered, inter alia, the optimum approach to delivering on the Strategy&rsquo;s targets within the current constrained housing market, bearing in mind the possible effects on housing supply.</p><p>A key objective under the Strategy is to increase social housing output in the immediate, medium and longer term. In order to meet this objective it is necessary to avail of a mixture of delivery mechanisms. In the immediate term the acquisition of homes and the refurbishment of local authority dwellings offer quick solutions to house households on the waiting list. Leasing and renting also offer much needed immediate supply. Over the medium to longer term it will be important that local authorities and approved housing bodies deliver on the 5,000 unit build programme which has been approved.</p><p>I recently published the <i>Social Housing Output in 2015</i>report which documents how 13,000 units of social housing were delivered in 2015 and targets the delivery of 17,000 units in 2016 . In the report, the Housing Agency acknowledges its support for the rejuvenation of social housing in Ireland and also commits to monitoring closely the issue of affordability going forward.  The report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:  .</p><p>In terms of the housing sector in Ireland, more generally, increased supply across all markets is required. In order to stimulate the extra supply of houses, in line with the Government&rsquo;s <i>Construction 2020 Strategy</i>, a number of important measures have been taken aimed at improving housing delivery viability and increasing supply. </p><p>The measures include the introduction of a vacant site levy; reductions in development contributions and a targeted development contribution rebate scheme in Dublin and Cork to encourage large scale developments at affordable prices; revised Part V provisions; initiatives to improve financing; implementation of new apartment guidelines; and legislative amendments to introduce greater flexibility and streamlining to the Strategic Development Zone provisions of the Planning and Development Acts. In addition, NAMA is aiming to deliver 20,000 residential units before the end of 2020, with 90% of these units to be in the greater Dublin area.</p><p>The Government strategy to address housing supply is comprehensive in terms of policy, legislation and funding. The focus for the period ahead will be on fully implementing both the <i>Construction 2020 Strategy</i>and the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020.</i></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-02-02a.1341.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016020200080#WRGG01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 529 and 557 together.</p><p>The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, provides the legislative basis for the Non Principal Private Residence (NPPR) Charge. The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence. </p><p>A residential property that was not in use by an owner as his or her sole or main residence is liable for the Charge. This may not necessarily be a second home; a person may have vacated a property and have been living in rented accommodation elsewhere for work or other reasons, for example, and, in such a case, the property that the owner was no longer living in is liable for the Charge, even if it was the only residential property that person owned. It is a matter for an owner, whether resident in Ireland or elsewhere, to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge and any late payment fees applicable.  </p><p>The self-assessed Charge is set at &euro;200 per annum and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties. Section 6 of the 2009 Act, as amended, provides that the owner of a liable property who fails to pay the charge, in addition to him or her being liable to pay the Charge, is liable to pay to the relevant local authority a &euro;20 late payment fee in respect of each month or part of a month in which the Charge, any late payment fee, or any part of such Charge or fee, remains unpaid. </p><p>Part 12 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 also deals with the collection of undischarged liabilities relating to the NPPR Charge. The Act provided for a period from 2 March 2014 to 31 August 2014 during which time no new late penalties were applied to existing liabilities.  If payment was not made in full or if settlement terms were not agreed by the end of that period, an additional late payment fee of &euro;120 per liability date applied on 1 September 2014. As the Charge applied in each of the years from 2009 to 2013, there were five liability dates - 31 July 2009 and 31 March for each of the years 2010 to 2013. In addition to this late payment fee to be applied per liability date, the entire NPPR liability is then increased by a factor of 50% and frozen. </p><p>Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect NPPR charges and late payment fees due to it, and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned. In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p><p>A number of exemptions from the charge are set out in section 4 of the 2009 Act and section 4(6) provides for an exemption from the charge in a situation where a residential property is occupied rent-free as the sole or main residence of a relative of the owner and the sole or main residence of the owner is either on the same property or within two kilometres of it.</p><p>The NPPR Project Board, in conjunction with individual local authorities, undertook a media campaign in 2014 aimed at reminding non-compliant owners that additional late payment penalties applied after 31 August 2014. The extensive radio and print media campaign reminded non-compliant owners of their obligations to come forward to regularise their affairs and to take advantage of this once-off grace period. While it is a necessary principle of law that all citizens are required to be aware of relevant legal obligations and duties in respect of such charges, as is the case in other jurisdictions, it remains my view that reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that property owners have been aware of the Charge and liability dates. </p><p>Under section 77 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014, my Department issued guidance to local authorities concerning matters relating to arrears of the NPPR Charge and late payment fees to ensure that a consistent national approach is adopted. The guidelines, which are available at , encourage local authorities to take a proactive approach to ensure that any outstanding NPPR liabilities are discharged in the most equitable, efficient and economically beneficial manner and include guidance in respect of dealing with hardship cases. It is expected, in the majority of cases, that local authorities will collect the full NPPR Charge liability from owners. In some cases, this may be by means of arrangement by installment.  All non-compliant owners or owners with queries should log on to or, alternatively, contact their local authority to discuss any matters they wish to clarify and to make any outstanding payments.</p></reply>

To the end of November 2015, a total of 1,084 units were delivered under the SHCEP. While the total number of units delivered to end 2015 is yet to be finalised, I estimate that the final figure will be in the region of 1,450 units.</p><p>The <i>Social Housing Strategy</i><i>2020</i>identified a national target of 2,000 additional transfers from rent supplement to the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) for 2015. To end of November 2015, 1,644 households had transferred from Rent Supplement to RAS. My Department estimates that when the December 2015 figures are finalised around 1,823 households will have transferred to RAS in 2015.</p><p>The Housing Assistance Payment is being introduced incrementally on a pilot basis to local authority areas. A total of 5,680 households commenced HAP in 2015, in addition to the 485 supported by the Scheme in 2014. A detailed breakdown on a local authority basis is set out in the Table below. </p><p>While overall supply in the private rented market may have had an effect on the achievement of targets in RAS and SHCEP in 2015, all efforts were made, working with delivery partners in local authorities, approved housing bodies and NAMA, to deliver maximum output under each delivery mechanism, and to put in place the enabling measures for a significant multi-annual construction programme.</p><p>Furthermore, to maximise the availability of social housing to those on the waiting list, I committed to supporting local authorities to remediate the maximum number possible of vacant and lettable units in 2015.  Accordingly, I increased the initial 2015 target of 1,000 such units, to ultimately provide funding for almost 2,700 units to be brought back into use across all local authorities.  Furthermore, I provided funding to local authorities to undertake suitable acquisitions of houses and apartments; over 1,000 such acquisitions were made in 2015 which, along with the return of vacant units, has delivered immediate housing to those on the waiting lists.</p><p><b>Units delivered under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHC</b><b>EP) to end November 2015</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th colspan="2">RAS to end of November 2015</th><th colspan="2">SHCEP to end of November 2015</th></tr><tr><td>Local Authority </td><td>2015 Target</td><td>Delivery to end of November 2015</td><td>2015 Target</td><td>Delivery to end November 2015</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow CC</td><td>40</td><td>40</td><td>65</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan CC</td><td>53</td><td>63</td><td>25</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Clare CC</td><td>57</td><td>41</td><td>75</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City Cl.</td><td>105</td><td>86</td><td>128</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Cork CC</td><td>75</td><td>22</td><td>170</td><td>86</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal CC</td><td>46</td><td>38</td><td>65</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Cl. </td><td>110</td><td>99</td><td>425</td><td>211</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South CC</td><td>165</td><td>165</td><td>200</td><td>125</td></tr><tr><td>Dun-Rathdown CC</td><td>75</td><td>16</td><td>75</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal CC</td><td>110</td><td>71</td><td>200</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>Galway City Cl.</td><td>20</td><td>15</td><td>90</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>Galway Co.

However, having considered the scale of the problem and options for its resolution, the Tyres and Waste Tyres Report was unequivocal in recommending a full compliance scheme. Other models put forward as separate proposals by the two industry associations were considered during the deliberations of the Tyres Working Group but these were rejected on the grounds that neither would deliver a fit for purpose management system for waste tyres. Subject to the consent of the industry associations to their release, I am happy to provide copies of these proposals to the Deputy. </p><p>The new arrangements have been the subject of multiple consultation processes. In June 2012 a public consultation took place seeking the views of stakeholders and the public on the future of the producer responsibility initiative Model in Ireland.  The consultation document put forward an outline of possible policy initiatives for consultation and provided an opportunity, at an early stage, to stakeholders and the public to contribute to shaping Ireland&rsquo;s future policy in the area of producer responsibility.</p><p>Following the publication of the report on Tyres and Waste Tyres in November 2013 a further public consultation period took place. The consultation period closed on 31st January 2014 , at which point my Department hadreceived 16 submissions. The majority of these submissions were in favour of a full PRI for tyres. </p><p>The final draft report on the <i>Review of the producer responsibility initiative Model in</i><i>Ireland</i>was published in July 2014 for a period of consultation which closed on 15th September 2014. On publication of the final report my Department established the tyres working group with membership drawn from across the waste and tyres sectors. Representatives of the two industry associations are also included. The tyres working group has met on seven occasions to assist my Department in the detailed design of the new arrangements. It is also proposed to undertake a further consultation on the draft regulations to give effect to the new compliance scheme arrangements. I expect the consultation process to take place in the second quarter of this year with a view to the regulations being commenced in the third quarter. In addition, work is on-going in my Department on a Regulatory Impact Assessment to supplement the very extensive analysis contained in the PRI review report. This work will be finalised by end of March this year.</p><p>The issue of security of data, particularly data that could be regarded as commercially sensitive, is of fundamental importance to the integrity of the model being developed for the tyre sector. The successful protection of extremely market sensitive data from the electronic and electrical industry will provide a sound basis on which to build the system for the tyre compliance scheme. The WEEE Register Society (WRS) developed the WEEE Black-box (WBB) in 2005 in response to Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE) producers&rsquo; demands for a safe, secure and confidential site where they could report their confidential sales data. At present 1,320 producers report on a monthly basis across 10 categories and 30 sub-categories. The need to maintain confidentiality is so highly respected that the WBB is prohibited by Part II, Regulation 9(3) of the European Union (Waste Electrical &amp;amp; Electronic Equipment) Regulations 2014 from disclosing information to any third parties including WRS. WBB is a web based reporting system and secure precautions are taken to protect the producers&rsquo; data. </p><p>The exact detail of what information will be reported by tyre operators is still under consideration with stakeholders at sub-group level. Once it has been decided by the Tyres Working Group it will be outlined in the new tyre regulations.</p></reply>

The Regulation Office is led by a Regulatory Committee of non-executive members and is independent in its decision making powers.  Co-operative Housing Ireland (formerly NABCO) is among the 212 AHBs who have since signed up for regulation and therefore it comes under the oversight of the current interim AHB Regulator. It is a matter for the interim Regulator to focus on individual AHBs and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on individual regulatory matters.</p>  <p>  In September 2015 the Government approved the drafting of the Housing (Regulation of Approved Housing Bodies) Bill 2015 with a view to establishing an AHB Regulator on a statutory basis.   </p></reply>

In addition, no licence or fee is required for sea angling. This covers the vast majority of angling species in Ireland.The current licensing regime in Ireland contrasts with other countries world-wide where licence fees are payable for all angling activity. Anglers of all ages, therefore, currently have significant opportunity to participate in angling without cost. </p><p>The only two species for which anglers are currently required to hold and pay for a licence are salmon and sea trout. There are a range of licence options available, and the price structure for licences facilitates broad participation in salmon and sea trout angling at economic rates.</p><p>Licence fees (for salmon and sea trout) are set by the Minister of the day, having consulted with the Minister for Public Enterprise and Reform, and any changes in fees normally reflect movement in the Consumer Price Index. In this regard, reflecting the prevailing economic conditions, a reduction in fees for all licence categories was introduced for the 2012 fishing season, and these reduced levels have been maintained by me as Minister. Details and costs for licence categories are available on my Department's website at . </p><p>I would also advise, regarding salmon and sea trout licences, that a fisheries conservation component was applied to all licence fees in 2007, as part of a suite of conservation measures for the management of wild fisheries. This component represents 50% of the licence fee, and income generated from this component is ring-fenced by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) for the rehabilitation of salmon habitats and conservation measures throughout the country. </p><p>All of the proceeds of the salmon and sea trout licence fees income are reinvested, by IFI, in the conservation, protection and development of wild fisheries habitats and stocks directly, or through the Salmon Conservation Fund scheme, with a particular emphasis on prioritised investment in those rivers in most need of rehabilitation.  </p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided. </p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services. These very significant investments represent a step change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>On the 22 December 2015, I formally launched the procurement process for the State Intervention to provide high quality, high speed broadband to all premises in Ireland that may not be served through commercial investment. The formal procurement commenced with the publication of the Project Information Memorandum and the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire. In addition, my Department also published:</p><p>-  the National Intervention Strategy &ndash; updated in December 2015, which takes account of responses to the public consultation which took place in July 2015 and subsequent expert analysis; and</p><p>-  the High Speed Broadband Map 2020 which follows ongoing engagement with industry and public consultation. </p><p>The Intervention strategy sets out a detailed service specification including a requirement that the State-funded network must be capable of delivering high-quality, high speed broadband of at least 30mbps download and 6mbps upload. It must also be capable of catering for higher performance in the future so as to keep pace with consumer demand. </p><p>The 2020 map is available at .  The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER. </p><p>The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services by the end of 2016. The areas marked AMBER represent the target areas for the proposed State intervention and includes the townlands of Cullenhugh, Ballinalack and Ballina, County Westmeath. Members of the public can see whether their individual premise is in the BLUE or AMBER area by inserting their Eircode, and/ or address, or scrolling through the map. </p><p>The Government is determined to ensure that the network in the AMBER area is built out as quickly as possible and engagement with industry stakeholders has indicated that this could be achieved within 3-5 years of the contract award. </p><p>In this context, the NBP proposes that through the combination of commercial investment and State intervention, 85% of addresses in Ireland will have access to high speed services by 2018, with all addresses passed by 2020.</p><p>More generally, I am informed by the commercial operators that next generation broadband services have been rolled out to over 20,000 premises to date in County Westmeath with over 6,000 more expected to be serviced by commercial investment. Almost 17,000 remaining premises in County Westmeath will be covered either by further commercial investment or the proposed State intervention. </p></reply>

It is therefore a matter for bidders to select the technology which will show how they propose to meet these contractual requirements.</p><p>Given the quality of the services we wish to see delivered, and based on the current absence of significant fibre networks in many parts of Ireland, it is likely that fibre will play a major role in any proposed solution. However, the technology platforms that will provide the final connectivity to the premises will be a matter for commercial operators to decide on in line with EU State Aid guidelines.</p><p>The 2020 map is available at .  The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER. </p><p>The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services by the end of 2016 and includes Bridge End, County Donegal.

The underlying principle for the recommendation was that a licence should determine a person's suitability to carry out a function and it should have no monetary value or be traded on the open market.  The measure was provided for in Section 14(1) of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 which was commenced with effect from 6th April 2014.  Special provisions, contained in Section 15 of the 2013 Act, apply in the case of the death of a licence holder, whereby a licence may continue to be operated by a person nominated by the licence holder before his/her death. </p>  <p>  The regulation of the SPSV industry is a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA) under the provisions of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013, including administration of the nomination process under section 15 and the requirements relating to rental of a small public service vehicle to another person.  I have therefore referred your question to the NTA for direct reply to you.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within 10 working days.</p></reply>

Mandatory Alcohol - MAT - checkpoints will henceforth be known as Mandatory Intoxicant - MIT - checkpoints, as Garda&iacute; present will be able to test for drugs as well as for alcohol. </p>  <p>  This is an important new tool for Garda&iacute; in addressing driving under the influence of drugs.  In addition to assisting in identifying drivers who have consumed drugs, I believe the introduction of the new tests will help to raise public awareness of the risks of drug driving, and will act as a deterrent.

Pedal-powered rickshaws come within the definition of 'pedal cycles' and powered rickshaws are classified as 'mechanically propelled vehicles'.  They, like all other road traffic, are obliged to obey road traffic law.  The measures which I introduced in summer of 2015 to allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to issue fixed charge notices to cyclists also apply to pedal powered rickshaws and will provide an important tool for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in enforcing the law.</p>  <p>	  At present there is no legislation in place to regulate the carriage of passengers by rickshaws.  Rickshaws by their nature operate at a local level.  Local authorities regulate many activities at local level through by-laws made under local government regulation.  I understand that, in response to concerns (primarily of a health and safety nature), and following a consultation process with relevant stakeholders, Dublin City Council (DCC), has prepared draft by-laws under the Local Government Act 2001 to regulate the operation of rickshaws.</p>  <p>  As I set out in my reply to Parliamentary Questions No. 481 and 483 of 19th January 2016, it is my understanding that DCC, subject to receipt of certain legal clarifications, intends to bring the draft by-laws, which would provide for a licensing regime for rickshaws, before the Strategic Policy Committee of the Council for its consideration.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, the financial crisis resulted in major cutbacks in funding for regional and local roads and it is going to take some time to build up expenditure again.  The 7 year transport Capital Plan does provide for the gradual build up in capital funding for the road network from the current relatively low base towards the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement works over the period of the plan.</p>  <p>  As the purpose of Exchequer funding is to supplement the own-resources spending of local authorities, I am emphasising to local authorities the importance of prioritising expenditure on roads when allocating own resources, including revenue from Local Property Tax receipts. </p>  <p>  In addition to the State grant allocations already made to local authorities, funding of &euro;106 million is being earmarked to assist in the repair of transport infrastructure damaged in the recent storms and floods and to take preventative measures, where appropriate.  My Department will be liaising closely with local authorities on the work needed to deal with the damage.</p></reply>

It is responsible for managing, maintaining, developing and promoting over 1000km of inland navigable waterways, principally for recreational purposes.</p>  <p>  Since its establishment in 2000, Waterways Ireland has been active in progressing the development of the recreational infrastructure of the waterways and this has resulted in major improvements that include the construction of new harbours, the provision of an additional 13km of public moorings, extended on-shore services and the creation of new waterway destinations.  Registered boat numbers over this time have increased by more than 50% to a total of 14,690 in 2014.</p>  <p>  More than &euro;50m has been invested by Waterways Ireland in reopening the Royal Canal and work continues across the Royal, Grand and Barrow Canals to expand their use as invaluable outdoor recreational corridors through the development of Blueways.  These are recreational trails on or beside water for walking, cycling, fishing, boating and canoeing.  The development of Blueways creates new recreational opportunities for local communities as well as attracting visitors to rural areas where the waterways are an integral part of the community and local businesses.  The first Blueway, which was developed on the North Shannon last year, attracted over 100,000 people in 2015.</p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland is also engaged in works to restore the Ulster Canal from the Shannon-Erne Waterway to the International Scout Centre at Castle Saunderson, near Belturbet in Co. Cavan.  This project has the potential to act as a catalyst for the regeneration of this border area.  It will also provide a wonderful recreational facility for local communities and should act as a significant draw for tourists.</p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland engages in a wide range of marketing and promotional activity for the inland waterways.  For example, early in 2015, in support of the Irish Chartered Boat Rental Association, assistance with targeted marketing support was undertaken in key overseas markets in partnership with F&aacute;ilte &Eacute;ireann and Tourism Ireland.  Waterways Ireland also operates the Lakelands and Inland Waterways marketing programme in partnership with F&aacute;ilte &Eacute;ireann and relevant local authorities.</p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland has an ongoing programme to utilise disused built heritage assets for new recreational purposes. The 27th lock house in Tullamore, for example, is being developed by the local canoe club as a base to support its activities.  New businesses providing recreational activities on the waterways are also supported by licensing the use of Waterways Ireland property to help them become established.  </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Waterways Ireland is intent on continuing to create opportunities to increase the use of these valuable public assets for all kinds of recreational and tourism activities and to this end it will continue to work in partnership with all relevant stakeholders, including  local communities, to maximise the economic, social and recreational potential of the waterways.</p></reply>
