    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-22a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022200049#WRA00700"><p>Strong engagement with the early years sector has been a hallmark of my time as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. I have travelled throughout the country to meet childcare providers within their own services, to meet City and County Childcare Committees and to speak first hand to childcare providers, parents and to children. </p>  <p>  On becoming Minister I established the National Early Years Forum, at which issues arising in the sector can be raised and discussed face to face. This helps better communication and engagement and fosters improved policy and decision making. The Early Years Forum consists of representatives of childcare providers and staff, academic experts in early years care and education and advocacy groups from across the sector. The Forum met before and after Budget 2018 and is due to meet again on March 7th. </p>  <p>  The introduction of measures last September to make childcare more affordable were preceded by a national road show of information sessions. These events were attended by more than 1,000 childcare practitioners and offered information to the sector, as well as providing an opportunity for feedback to my Department. I intend to arrange similar events again in the future. </p>  <p>  Focused working groups, made up of representatives from the early years sector, are a regular feature of my Department's work. Notably, the development of the Affordable Childcare Scheme is being informed by both a Business and Systems Working Group and a Communications Consultative Group. Both groups have met on numerous occasions to discuss aspects of how the scheme will operate when launched and offer the sector an opportunity to shape the scheme's design and its roll-out. </p>  <p>  I have met with representatives of most, if not all, of the national childcare representative bodies in the country to hear first hand the issues they are experiencing and their proposals for improvement. I also established and have met with an Expert Group tasked with reporting on the future of child-minding in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Childcare providers are represented on my Department's Steering Group for the implementation of the Access and Inclusion Model, or AIM as it is known, which supports children with disabilities in the ECCE scheme and the early years service they attend.</p>  <p>  I am delighted that my Departmental childcare team has been strengthened by the secondment of four staff from various childcare organisations around the country to assist us with our work. The expertise and experience of these staff complements the work of officials in considering policy and operational matters.</p>  <p>  A plan to address the communications needs associated with the forthcoming Affordable Childcare Scheme has been finalised and work is underway for similar strategies to be developed for the Early Years Division of my department. This demonstrates my ongoing commitment to engagement and communication with the early years sector. </p></reply>

The group is co-chaired by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Health.  The group is made up of senior officials from both Departments with representatives from Tusla, the Child and Family Agency and the Health Service Executive. </p>  <p>  The key objective of the working group is to examine psychological and mental health services for children and young people with the aim of agreeing a clear continuum of provision and strengthening alignment between providers.  The services must be centered on the needs of children and young people.  The working group have agreed the Terms of Reference and are focusing on assessing work and policies in place with a view to identifying key actions to be progressed and improvements to be made.</p>  <p>  I want to ensure that we have an integrated and comprehensive model of service for children and young people.  At present, Tusla has responsibility for services relating to the psychological welfare of children and their families but the HSE deals with the more acute services.  These include children and young people with complex developmental issues and those with more severe mental health problems.</p>  <p>  The division of responsibility between Tusla and the HSE for different types of psychological and mental health services brings challenges, which both agencies have been trying to address.  Tusla funds the HSE for the provision of some community based psychological services but the availability of services between areas is quite variable.</p>  <p>  Both Tusla and the HSE have been developing proposals to improve the provision and availability of services but we would all accept that there is a good deal more work to do to achieve a well coordinated integrated service that meets the needs of children and young people. </p>  <p>  I have met with the Ministers for Health and relevant Ministers of State with a view to maximising collaboration between Tusla and the HSE, including in the area of mental health. </p>  <p>  I am pleased that the working group has now commenced its work to address these and related matters.  Our aim is that the group would finalise an agreed approach by the middle of this year and commence implementation from Quarter 3 onwards. </p></reply>

The Deputy is referring to a statement in the Report of the finding of that inspection.  This stated that there were three formal reports to Tusla for which no acknowledgements were received. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the reports referred to were sent to Tusla in accordance with procedures in existence at the time. Acknowledgments were not routinely issued to all reports. Prior to the HIQA inspection of Oberstown at which this matter was raised, Oberstown management met with Tusla management to discuss the issue of a protocol setting out how both agencies will work together on a range of issues.  This included the procedures for reporting child protection and welfare concerns to Tusla. I am advised that there are ongoing discussions with management at Oberstown and Tusla  regarding this protocol. </p>  <p>  While the draft protocol includes procedures in relation to reporting child protection and welfare concerns, it is important to note that procedures have changed since December 11th 2017 when I commenced the Children first Act 2015.   It is now the case that mandated reporters are required to make their reports in writing.  They also have a legal entitlement to an acknowledgement.  Tusla has an online portal in place for the receipt of mandated reports.   </p>  <p>  Mandated reporters can register on the Tusla website and are then in a position to submit reports directly to Tusla via the portal.  The portal is an efficient and accessible way of ensuring that reports of child abuse can be generated as efficiently as possible, including all the relevant information, and can be sent without delay to Tusla. </p></reply>

For this reason I have identified some key persons and organisations from the areas of human rights promotion and protection, former residents and their advocacy groups, and academics with professional experience in relevant areas to assist in this process.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the umbrella organisation to which the Association of Mixed Race Irish are associated has been invited to participate in this selection process.</p>  <p>  My Department has made the necessary contacts and I am awaiting confirmation of a response from a number of those approached.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, officials from my Department were in contact with representatives of the Association of Mixed Race Irish last week to clarify the arrangements being made in relation to the Forum. My officials have assured the organisation that its members will be able to seek representation on the Forum in due course. </p>  <p>  My Department will facilitate a comprehensive advertising campaign so that interested parties are made aware of the relevant details. This is an opportunity for former residents to create and drive forward a process that they can support and trust and actively participate in developing actions and solutions to address their concerns.</p>  <p>  I strongly encourage all interested parties to participate in this process. </p></reply>

It has since 2009, used the Report Card to scrutinise progress on the commitments to children in the Programme for Government.  The most recent Report Card explores progress during 2017 against commitments in the  Programme for Government which was published in May 2016.  </p>  <p>  Each year, the CRA evaluates Government's delivery of its promises in six key areas - the right to education, to an adequate standard of living, to health, rights in the family environment and alternative care, rights in early childhood and the right to equality. The grading is carried out by a high-level independent panel, comprising some of Ireland's leading experts in children's rights, child law, education, early years and from the trade union sector.  The Report Card also provides an important resource for politicians, policy makers, service providers and non-governmental organisations and academics.  The recommendations relate to issues across a range of Government Departments, including my Department.</p>  <p>  I note that the Government's overall performance on child-related issues was assessed to have improved over last year, and that five of the six areas had an overall improvement in grade.  My own Department's area of child protection got the single highest grade of the whole report; a B, up from last year's grade C.  The report also gave LGBT+ issues a grade B-, up from C+ last year. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless I recognise that there is much to be done, both within my own Department's areas of responsibility and across Government. </p>  <p>  A considerable number of  the CRA's recommendations are reflected in the commitments contained within Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, with responsibility for implementation again falling to the respective Government Departments.  My Department is responsible for monitoring progress on the implementation of Better Outcomes Brighter Futures and supporting its key implementation structures across Departments and sectors. An annual report on progress towards those commitments to April 2017 was published in September 2017. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that my officials are already focussing on the immediate actions for 2018 that were highlighted by the CRA in relation to these policy areas.</p></reply>

This initiative which is envisaged to run until 2020 aims to ensure the mainstreaming of learning from the original Area-Based Childhood and similar programmes in prevention and early intervention. The QCBI will harness and apply this learning across the relevant services and supports with the aim of achieving wider systems change and service improvements for children and young people.</p><p>It is both an ambitious and significant initiative and one which though consultation with key informants is seen as both necessary and impactful. The QCBI has undergone a significant design and consultation phase. Indeed this was necessary based on its scope and potential impact.</p><p>To date, approximately &euro;232,000 has been drawn down from the Dormant Accounts fund for preparatory work during the design phase of the QCBI. The breakdown of payments made to date are attached.</p><p>Now that the initiative is advancing apace, a significant suite of projects and associated expenditure under the QCBI initiative will be advanced in the coming weeks. These include the development of a Knowledge Exchange Platform, the launch of an Innovation Fund, and the development of a training module on prevention and early intervention.</p><p>These are key measures which will actively and directly support services to ensure that they have benefit from the learning gleaned in terms of service and practice impact. This will ensure that wider structures and supports for children and young people offer the best responses in enhancing their outcomes.<table><tr><th>Date</th><th>QCBI -Spend to date </th><th>Payee</th><th>&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>March 2016</td><td>EU Peer Review on Prevention and Early Intervention to improve outcomes for Children, young people and their families.</td><td>Cleaver East</td><td>3,630</td></tr><tr><td>March &amp;amp; July  2016</td><td>Data Hub Development Research</td><td>Research Matters</td><td>20,830</td></tr><tr><td>March 2016</td><td>Interest on payment</td><td>Research Matters</td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td>March 2016</td><td>ABC Mentoring Workshop</td><td>Clarion Hotel </td><td>5876</td></tr><tr><td>December 2016 &amp;amp; May 2017</td><td>Landscape Analysis for QCBI- was commissioned to map relevant initiatives that were relevant for the development of QCBI with a view to harnessing and building on those initiatives.</td><td>Brian Harvey Social Research</td><td>22,140</td></tr><tr><td>January 2017</td><td>QCBI Professional advice and input </td><td>Tallaght West Childhood Development Initiative</td><td>20,000</td></tr><tr><td>April, September and December 2017</td><td>&lsquo;Outcomes for Children Information and Data Hub Project&rsquo; seeks to develop a resource that presents local data related to children and services provided for them.

For example, under Strands 1 and 4, dedicated to the creation of new childcare places under Early Years and School Age childcare respectively, alteration or refurbishment works undertaken on an existing facility to provide extra places would be an eligible cost; salary costs or general office equipment would not.</p>  <p>  Under Early Years Strand 3, in which the focus is on the creation of a new, natural outdoor play area, eligible costs include reflective pools, natural planting and canvas canopies; whereas rubber matting and permanent construction projects are ineligible. In particular, I would advise that any application under this strand of funding will be appraised in terms of its overall vision, and how it aligns with the natural outdoor play area objective.</p>  <p>  The indicative lists of eligible and ineligible costs, to be found in full in the application guidelines document, should be useful for prospective applicants.  That being said, each project by its very nature is unique and so it is not possible to provide an exhaustive list. I would urge any providers who remain unsure to contact their local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) or Pobal to assist them with any further questions about eligibility or otherwise.</p>  <p>  I can assure you that each application for capital funding will be assessed on its own merits, and that the published guidelines exist in order to maximise the quality of applications received by my Department and Pobal before the application window closes at 3pm on Friday the 9th March 2018.</p>  <p>  I anticipate that this year's Capital programmes will see great demand and competition for funding, and I wish all providers the very best of luck with any applications they might make. Their personal visions for the expansion and improvement of childcare services are an invaluable part of making Ireland's childcare sector into one which is world class, accessible and affordable to all.</p></reply>

I am committed to the provision of childcare options that respect both parental choice and international evidence on how to achieve the best outcomes for children.  Stay at home parents can access a number of schemes operated by my Department. </p>  <p>  From September 2018, the ECCE Programme, or the Free Preschool Scheme as it is known by some, will be available to all children over the age of two years and eight months for two full programme years. 114,000 children are expected to participate in this Programme from September 2018, including children of stay at home parents.  This is an increase in entitlement from 38 weeks when the scheme was introduced initially, to the 61 week average that was provided last year.</p>  <p>  Other schemes provided by my Department address childcare affordability and are available to stay at home parents; for example, the universal subsidy for parents of children under three which was introduced last September.  The Affordable Childcare Scheme when introduced will subsidise the cost of early years care and education and school age childcare.  Parents who are not engaged in employment or study will be able to access subsidised childcare under the scheme for 15 hours per week.  Deputies may be aware that the legislation for this scheme passed second stage in recent weeks.</p>  <p>  Across Government, there have been a number of measures to support stay at home parents.  Additional support has been provided for parents who choose to care for their children at home by increasing the Home Carer Tax Credit to &euro;1,200 per year in Budget 2018.</p>  <p>  State provision for maternity leave, parental leave and the recently introduced paternity leave also demonstrate the Government's commitment to support parents to care for young children.  The Programme for Government commits to extending paid leave for parents in the first year of a child's life, which will be a key financial support enabling parents to care for their children at home in the critical first year. An Inter-Departmental group has been established to progress this commitment which officials from my Department are contributing to.  </p>  <p>  Better Outcomes Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People contains a commitment to produce Ireland&rsquo;s first-ever National Early Years Strategy.  The National Early Years Strategy will focus on the period of early childhood, from birth to age five, and will cover all aspects of children's lives.  Drafting of the strategy is underway and is being directly informed by research, expert advice and consultation inputs, as well as bilateral discussions with government departments.</p>  <p>  The strategy will take a joined-up, cross-government approach to the issue of supporting children and their families during the early years.  Development of the Strategy is a priority for me and for my Department, and I will move to publish the Strategy later this year.</p></reply>

The 2018 report acknowledges progress made and the Government&rsquo;s efforts to improve the lives of children in Ireland.  The report rightly highlights the continuing impact of the homelessness crisis on the lives of children.  I absolutely acknowledge that homelessness is an extremely distressing experience, and that any medium to long-term period living in a hotel or other emergency accommodation seriously impacts on normal family life and is particularly detrimental to children. </p>  <p>  While the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has the ultimate responsibility for managing homelessness, my Department is working closely with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to provide ongoing supports for families in emergency accommodation in order to mitigate the challenges faced by parents and children in this situation. </p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, works together with other statutory and voluntary agencies to provide services and supports to children, young people and families experiencing homelessness.  In my own Department, I have introduced free childcare for the children of families experiencing homelessness.  I am happy to say that the families of an additional 196 children are currently availing of childcare under this scheme, while some families were already eligible under existing schemes.  As part of the scheme a daily meal is provided for each child. </p>  <p>  Actions taken by Tusla include the provision of funding for child support workers and the appointment of a Homelessness Liaison Officer.</p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres, part funded by Tusla, are working with families who are experiencing homelessness and many have developed local responses to the needs of children and families in emergency accommodation.  These include, by way of example, family fun days, homework support, after school programmes, play therapy and transport services. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the difficulties associated with homelessness and school attendance, Tusla&rsquo;s Educational Welfare Service offers a number of supports to children (and families) experiencing homelessness.</p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s joint protocol with the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) covers child welfare and protection matters for children in emergency accommodation.  It is fully operational in the DRHE areas and it is intended to replicate this protocol across the State. A Joint Working Protocol has been signed between Tusla and Galway City Council.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the DRHE is coordinating the development of a comprehensive National Quality Standards Framework for homeless services on behalf of all housing authorities.  Consultation with service users and key stakeholders, including Tusla, has been undertaken and the draft standards have been piloted in selected services.  These standards, including a child safety element which will provide homeless services with a framework for continuous quality improvement, will be implemented nationally. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that Tusla only intervenes in family life in exceptional circumstances. Children who are with their families in emergency accommodation remain in the care of their parents or guardians.  Where Tusla has concerns regarding the welfare and development of any child they will provide family supports to assist that family and child.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, my concern is that we minimise and then eliminate the problem of homelessness. In the meantime, I will continue to support measures to help those affected, to the greatest degree possible within my area of responsibility.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

The LAPRN members are invited to apply for funding for projects which provide:</p>  <p>- New and innovative play and recreation spaces and facilities. New and innovative projects can include new facilities, equipment, designs and / or the utilisation of non-traditional play spaces.</p>  <p>- Refurbishment or upgrading of existing play and recreation spaces and facilities.</p>  <p>  Under the Capital Grant Scheme for Play and Recreation, 25 awards were made in 2017. The largest amount awarded was for &euro;15,000 and the lowest amount was &euro;5,000. </p>  <p>  The LAPRN group was established in 2012 to introduce a more coordinated and interagency approach to achieving the main goals of the play and recreation policies at both national and local level. The members of the group are key Local Authority managers and staff responsible for the local delivery of play and recreation services in communities across the country. The Department is currently working with the LAPRN group to agree priorities for the funding allocation for the current year. </p></reply>

The cost to childcare providers is affected by many factors such as rates, rent, labour costs, and insurance amongst other things.</p><p>In September 2017 this Government introduced a number of measures to make childcare more affordable for families in Ireland.  </p><p>These measures involved:</p><p>- A new, universal (non-means tested) subsidy for all children in Tusla-registered childcare aged between 6 months until they are eligible for the ECCE programme, which amounts to up to &euro;1,040 per year for children in full-time childcare. </p><p>- Significant increases, of up to 50%, in targeted childcare subsidies provided under existing childcare schemes, specifically the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Schemes (subsidies available of up to &euro;145 per week, per child). </p><p>DCYA undertook a comprehensive information campaign to increase parents&rsquo; awareness of the new and increased childcare subsidies available, and to encourage childcare providers to take part in the schemes.</p><p>Currently, the families of over 32,000 children are benefitting from the new universal subsidy, while the families of over 34,000 children are enjoying enhanced targeted subsidies.  </p><p>This means that over 66,700 children, or 96% of the estimated 70,000 expected to avail of the measures, have registered for support, and the door remains open to parents to apply. </p><p>These measures will remain in place in September 2018 to support families until the launch of the Affordable Childcare Scheme. </p><p>In order to recognise the additional administrative demands these measures place on childcare providers, a budget of &euro;3.5m in Programme Support Payments (formerly known as &lsquo;Non-Contact Time Payments&rsquo;) was announced to support providers who sign up to the schemes in recognition of their &lsquo;non-contact time&rsquo; and administrative responsibilities.</p><p>This payment, which was made in late December 2017, was in addition to the &euro;14.5m Programme Support Payment secured in Budget 2017 for &lsquo;non-contact time&rsquo; during the period September 2016-August 2017. A further &euro;18m in Programme Support Payments has been secured for 2018. </p><p>Aside from the above measures, over 89,000 children were approved for the free-preschool scheme in September 2017.  More children joined in January 2018 and more again will join in April 2018. It is expected that in total about 119,000 children will benefit from ECCE again in 2018.  </p><p>From September 2018, the three entry points will stop and all children will be eligible for 2 full academic years (76 weeks) of ECCE once the child meets the minimum age requirement.</p><p>The new measures, from September 2018, will fully benefit those born from 2015 onwards, whilst those born previous to that year will continue to benefit from the expanded programme announced in Budget 2016. (The average entitlement for the last year to ECCE was approximately 61 weeks. When ECCE was first introduced the entitlement was to 38 weeks.)</p><p>A 7% increase in the capitation rate paid to childcare providers for children enrolled on the ECCE Scheme will also come into effect in September 2018. </p><p>In total, there are over 170,000 children currently receiving DCYA childcare subventions and this is expected to grow to approximately 180,000 by April.</p><p>The first ever Independent Review into the Cost of Delivery of Quality Childcare is underway and will inform our future policy decisions in this area. </p></reply>

This section  allows Tusla to receive a child into care without a court order, and with the consent of the child's parents, when this is required for the child&rsquo;s welfare or protection.</p>  <p>  A voluntary care agreement may be appropriate in situations where  a parent requires medical or other treatment, or for other reasons, for a time limited period. Social workers review a child in care's situation at statutory Child In Care Reviews, in consultation with the child's parents and other professionals. It is worth noting that annual figures for admissions and the length of time in care published by Tusla indicate that a significant number of children return home within the year of their being received into care.  All of this serves to illustrate that there are the wide range of reasons and time frames for a child being in care. </p>  <p>  My Department is not currently considering measures to reduce the number of children being received into the care of Tusla with the agreement of their parents, however, Tusla is expected, in line with best practice, to work co-operatively with parents with full cognisance of their rights as well as the best interests of their children. </p>  <p>  Under a commitment given in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the national framework for children and young people in Ireland, my Department has initiated work to review the Child Care Act 1991.  All matters relevant to the situation of children in care, including the usage of voluntary care agreements, will be considered in the context of the Review.</p></reply>

In the last three Budgets (2016, 2017 and 2018) investment in childcare has increased by 80% which reflects the emphasis being placed on improving access to high quality and affordable services . </p>  <p>  This investment includes funding of the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and the After School Childcare (ASCC) schemes. CCS is a childcare programme targeted to support parents on a low income to avail of reduced childcare costs. ASCC is designed to support parents on eligible training courses, as well as certain categories of parents returning to work, by providing subsidised childcare places. Eligible children must be under 15 years of age to avail of these supports. Last September, I increased significantly the subsidy paid under CCS to make it more attractive for low income families. </p>  <p>  An annual survey conducted by Pobal on my Department's behalf suggests that supply of childcare places currently broadly matches demand. My Department is committed to keeping capacity in the sector under review and Pobal will commence this year's survey in the coming months. Staff from thirty City and County Childcare Committees are available across the country to assist parents who may have difficulty in meeting their childcare needs.</p>  <p>  In May 2016 the Programme for a Partnership Government committed my Department to &ldquo;introduce a new system to support and expand quality afterschool care for school-aged children&rdquo; . Section 8 of the Programme for a Partnership Government also committed to &ldquo;utilise our primary school buildings for afterschool care provision for school age children to offer more options and flexibility to parents. We will link additional capitation to the provision of buildings for afterschool care, where demand exists. Community groups and private providers will be invited to tender to use school facilities (outside school hours).&rdquo;</p>  <p>  In Section 10, there is another relevant commitment. &ldquo;Schools buildings must be utilised out of hours if they are to remain at the centre of communities into the future, both throughout the day and throughout the year, including better utilisation of information technology.  Afterschool care, homework clubs and other community activities should be permissible.  Additional capitation funding will be linked to the availability of afterschool care options, where demand exists.&rdquo;   </p>  <p>  My Department chaired a group with the Department of Education and Skills to progress those commitments in a coherent way and to align relevant bodies of work under our respective areas of responsibility. The result of this work, the Action Plan for School Age Childcare, was presented to my Government colleague Minister Bruton and I in March 2017. </p>  <p>  Since the Action Plan was published, much progress has been made  to advance the Programme for Government commitments. My Department established an expert working group on School Age Childcare (SAC) which has been working over the last year  to develop standards and to recommend a quality assurance system for SAC services. The Department of Education and Skills has published guidelines to assist school authorities consider how their premises might be utilised for SAC and other activities where it can be facilitated by the school patron/trustees. My Department has provided capital grants for the development of Early Years and School-Age Childcare services and uptake has been very high. </p>  <p>  Youth Groups might well decide to provide school-age childcare or other services, although to date evidence of this is limited. Youth clubs funded by my Department under the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme must be volunteer-led. While some staff-led targeted youth services are co-located with pre-schools and/or afterschools,  the youth funding is not in any way linked to the operation of these services. </p></reply>

In the case of children and among other requirements, section 14 of the Act requires the Minister to be satisfied on reasonable grounds that appropriate consent for issue of a passport has been provided. In general, consent is required as follows: </p><p>-Where the child has 2 guardians, consent of each guardian</p><p>- Where the child has more than 2 guardians, consent by not fewer than 2 of those guardians. </p><p>A number of other circumstances are also provided for in the Act, including where a court in the State has made an order dispensing with the consent of a guardian; where a court in the State has made an order authorising a person other than a guardian (including the Health Service Executive) to give consent for issue of a passport to a child; as well as separate provision for cases where the child and his/her guardians are ordinarily resident outside the State.  </p><p>Section 14(6) of the Act provides that </p><blockquote>Subject to this Act, the Minister may, on application in that behalf to him or her in accordance with section 6 by a guardian of the child or any other person who has an interest in the welfare of the child, issue a passport to the child without the consent to such issue of the other guardian or, if appropriate, any of the guardians of the child if the Minister is satisfied that&mdash; <blockquote><blockquote>( <i>a</i>) there exist in relation to the child exceptional circumstances involving an immediate and serious risk of harm to his or her life, health or safety requiring him or her to undertake travel for which a passport is required, and <br /><br />( <i>b</i>) for the purpose of securing the welfare of the child, </blockquote></blockquote>a passport should be issued to the child. </blockquote><p>This provision was always intended, and by its explicit terms is, intended for exceptional cases.  Discretion to issue a passport in such cases without the consent of a guardian/guardians is conditional on a high threshold being met, namely cases involving:</p><blockquote>exceptional circumstances; <br /><br />an immediate and serious risk of harm to the child; and <br /><br />the welfare of the child.  </blockquote><p>A range of circumstances can be envisaged in which the section may be relevant.  These might include, for example, situations such as an Irish citizen child unaccompanied overseas in circumstances where his/her guardian(s) have been injured, passed away or disappeared; an Irish citizen child with complex medical needs in a conflict, emergency or otherwise insecure setting where his/her welfare is at risk; and so on.  </p><p>Any decision on whether this section was appropriate for use in any particular case would depend on all the particular facts and circumstances.  If a particular case is at issue, I would urge the Deputy or the persons concerned to make direct contact with the Passport Service (Ms Teresa McHugh) for further guidance.  </p></reply>

These forecasts cover the period to 2021.</p><p>The first relates to the passing of the Water Services Bill 2017 into law. As explained in the Economic and Fiscal Outlook, Chapter 7 'Budgetary Reform', Irish Water&rsquo;s current and capital funding requirements for domestic water services will come from the Vote of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. The Revised Estimates Volume for Public Services 2018 (REV) sets out the impacts in voted expenditure for 2018.</p><p>As these are simply reallocations between expenditure of a general government body and the Exchequer, this has no impact on the general government balance. The general government debt impact has already been included in the calculations.</p><p>Gross voted capital expenditure for 2018 in the National Development Plan (NDP) is consistent with the REV.</p><p>Secondly, the NDP announced four funds which will begin operating from 2019. These are the Rural, Urban, Innovation and Climate Action Funds.  </p><p>The funds will be partly covered by an unallocated capital reserve in the first instance, leaving an additional cost, which will both pre-commit unallocated fiscal space and worsen the EBR. </p><p>The EBR and general government debt developments table will be updated in the draft Stability Programme Update for 2018 to be published in mid-April.</p><p>The net nominal EBR increase resulting from the three funds is set out in the last row of the table below:<table><tr><th>New Funds, &euro; millions</th><th>2019</th><th>2020</th><th>2021</th></tr><tr><td>Rural                     </td><td>55</td><td>80</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Urban</td><td>100</td><td>120</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>Innovation</td><td>20</td><td>30</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>175</td><td>230</td><td>270</td></tr><tr><td>Less Capital Reserve</td><td>-98</td><td>-136</td><td>-94</td></tr><tr><td>Net Increase </td><td>77</td><td>94</td><td>176</td></tr></table></p><p>As the Climate Action Fund, set out in the table below, will be funded from the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) levy, it will have no impact on Voted Expenditure or the EBR.<table><tr><th>&euro; millions</th><th>2019</th><th>2020</th><th>2021</th></tr><tr><td>Climate Action Fund</td><td>20</td><td>30</td><td>40</td></tr></table></p><p>In calculating the impact on net fiscal space under the Expenditure Benchmark, it is assumed that both the Urban and Rural Funds will be recorded as gross fixed capital formation (i.e. subject to &lsquo;capital smoothing&rsquo; over four years) and that the Innovation and Climate Action Funds will be treated as capital grants (i.e. not smoothed). A further assumption is that the funding from the capital reserve will offset the Rural and Urban Funds.</p><p>Should the operation of the funds change these assumptions then the figures below will need to be amended.</p><p>The cost, in fiscal space terms, of the four funds is therefore: <table><tr><th>&euro; millions</th><th>2019</th><th>2020</th><th>2021</th></tr><tr><td>Fiscal Space Used</td><td>54</td><td>36</td><td>54</td></tr></table></p><p>Updated calculations of fiscal space will be published in the Summer Economic Statement 2018 following the publication by the European Commission of the required inputs to the calculation in conjunction with its Spring Economic Forecast.</p></reply>

While inflation picked up elsewhere last year, inflation in Ireland remained close to zero. Overall HICP inflation averaged just 0.3 per cent last year, the fifth consecutive year of inflation below 1 per cent. By contrast, inflation in the euro area as a whole, on a HICP basis, averaged 1.5 per cent last year.</p>  <p>  Inflation is not, therefore, a short-term risk at present. However, over the medium term as temporary exchange rate shocks, which have been a significant contributing factor to low inflation in Ireland over the past couple of years, subside, and the economy approaches full employment, price pressures may emerge. The increased investment announced in the national development plan 2018 &ndash; 2027 (NDP 2018 - 2027) could potentially contribute to this. However, the NDP 2018 &ndash; 2027 recognises the importance of ensuring the affordability and sustainability of capital spending plans to minimise the risk of overheating, and as a consequence, the risk of contributing to price pressures.</p>  <p>  A further mitigating factor is that public investment has an important role to play in boosting the capacity of the economy, which would tend to reduce price pressures. In addition, the NDP 2018 &ndash; 2027 is focused on targeting bottle-necks of particular concern such as in housing. Addressing the housing shortage would alleviate price pressures in the rental market.</p>  <p>  I have emphasised, on a number of occasions the importance of ensuring that Budgetary policy does not contribute to overheating pressures in the economy and the pro-cyclical polices of the past are not repeated and this is reflected in the NDP 2018 &ndash; 2027. My Department will continue to closely monitor price developments as we seek to ensure that the competitiveness gains over the past few years do not unwind. To this end, the Government will continue to manage the public finances in a prudent manner and maintain competiveness-orientated policies.</p></reply>

While unemployment has fallen rapidly to 6.1 per cent in January, from a peak of 16 per cent in 2012, this is still above the level considered to represent full employment in Ireland. Further, price pressures in Ireland remain subdued, with overall annual inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) averaging just 0.3 per cent last year, the fifth consecutive year of inflation below 1 per cent. </p>  <p>  Forecasts published with Budget 2018 envisage the HICP reaching 2 per cent per year by the end of the forecast horizon in 2021, broadly consistent with the ECB&rsquo;s target. The Budget 2018 forecasts do not extend beyond 2021. However, the National Development Plan 2018 &ndash; 2027 (NDP 2018 - 2027) assumed 2 per cent inflation (GNI* deflator) over the period 2018 &ndash; 2027 which is consistent with long term growth forecasts  for the Irish economy produced by international organisations.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the current slack in the economy, with the labour market approaching full employment, stronger than assumed growth could lead to overheating pressures. While increased public investment through the NDP 2018 - 2027 could potentially contribute to this, it is important to recognise that the plan is focused on rectifying the relatively low levels of public capital investment in Ireland following the recent recession. </p>  <p>  In fact, the NDP 2018 - 2027 is targeted at reducing overheating risks by increasing the economy&rsquo;s potential growth rate and alleviating capacity constraints. Notwithstanding this, the NDP 2018 &ndash; 2027 recognises the dangers that increased public investment could contribute to overheating if the pace of implementation was inappropriate for the cyclical position of the economy. However, the NDP 2018 &ndash; 2027 adopts a prudent and measured approach to increasing public capital spending. Under the NDP 2018 &ndash; 2027 it is projected that public capital investment will reach 3.8% of national income (GNI*) in 2021 and 4% by 2024, with sustained investment averaging 4% on an annual basis over the period 2022 to 2027.</p>  <p>  In addition, there are a number of other steps that will be taken to mitigate overheating risks and negate the possible need to defer major capital projects owing to overheating risks:</p>  <p>  - The increase in public capital spending will be consistent with overall fiscal objectives.</p>  <p>  - The growth in public capital spending will be at a planned and moderate rate which does not outstrip the pace of the supply response feasible from the broad construction sector.</p>  <p>  - Increased public capital spending will be aligned with sustainable growth in public expenditure overall by ensuring the continuation of moderate and prudent growth in current spending.</p>  <p>  - There will be a renewed strategic focus on supporting the strengthening of the capacity, capability and degree of competition of the domestic construction sector in Ireland as well as on encouraging and promoting market entry from abroad by confirming and highlighting the planned scale of Ireland&rsquo;s public capital investment plans.</p>  <p>  - As detailed in the National Development Plan, a Construction Sector Working Group will be established to ensure regular and open dialogue between Government and the construction sector.</p>  <p>  The NDP 2018-2027 will be implemented in the context of broader government fiscal policy, which is to maintain a fiscal stance which is appropriate to the cyclical position of the economy, while targeting a continuing reduction in our debt burden. </p>  <p>  I have emphasised on a number of occasions the importance of ensuring that Budgetary policy does not contribute to overheating pressures in the economy and that the pro-cyclical polices of the past are not repeated and this is reflected in the NDP 2018 &ndash; 2027. </p></reply>

Since 1 January 2016, section 43 of the 1997 Act provides that the Central Bank may prescribe investments in which a credit union may invest its funds.</p>  <p>  Following engagement with the credit union sector on proposals for credit unions to provide funding for the provision of social housing, the Central Bank undertook a review of the investment framework for credit unions in 2017. This review resulted in the publication of Consultation Paper 109 (CP109) which consulted on potential changes to the investment framework for credit unions. One of the proposals in CP109 was that credit unions be permitted to provide funding for the provision of social housing to Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). </p>  <p>  Submissions to CP109 were broadly supportive of credit unions providing funding to Tier 3 AHBs with a significant number of those in favour citing the alignment of the social goals of both the credit union movement and the AHB sector as the principal rationale for permitting this type of investment. </p>  <p>  Taking account of the feedback provided to CP109, on 1 February 2018 the Central Bank outlined that it intends to proceed with the addition of investment in Tier 3 AHBs as a permitted investment class for credit unions. Regulations giving effect to this change, will be commenced on 1 March 2018. From this date, credit unions will be permitted to provide funding to Tier 3 AHBs for the provision of social housing. The maximum permitted investment amount per credit union is 50% of regulatory reserves where a credit union has total assets of at least &euro;100 million and 25% of regulatory reserves for all other credit unions. These limits may facilitate a combined sector investment in Tier 3 AHBs of close to &euro;700 million. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank is open to considering further investment proposals. As was the case with proposals around credit unions investing in social housing, where the Central Bank receives detailed proposals which can demonstrate that an investment could fall within the appropriate risk profile for credit union investments, it will consider further amendments to the investment regulations to facilitate such investments in the future. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has committed to undertaking and publishing analysis of credit union sector investments, two years post commencement of the amending investment regulations for credit unions, to assess and analyse the actual impact which the changes to the investment regulations have had.</p></reply>

PTSB&rsquo;s latest published NPL ratio of 28% is one of the highest in the Eurozone.  It is over five times the European average. Therefore, PTSB must deliver a significant reduction in its NPL ratio, and within a timeframe, that meets the expectations of the SSM. </p>  <p>  Given the volume of borrowers who have refused to engage with the bank to date, and the number of cases where treatments have failed, achieving an acceptable NPL ratio will not be possible without loan sales.</p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that the contractual terms of borrowers remain in place post a loan sale.  In addition, all the protection enjoyed by borrowers under the CCMA is unaffected.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Relationship Framework, which is a legally binding agreement between myself, as Minister for Finance and the bank, loan sales do not require my consent. However, the bank is required to consult with me when a loan sale reaches an advanced stage and is of a significant scale.  Although I have been briefed on the matter, the formal consultation has not yet taken place but will do so in due course.</p>  <p>  While loan sales are regrettable, I am also conscious of the need for the bank to continue on its path to recovery such that it can support our citizens through its deposit and lending activity.

Following the IPO of AIB last year all three of our bank investments are now listed on the main markets of the Irish and London stock exchanges, providing improved liquidity and marketability for the State's shares.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department continue to monitor the performance of the banks, their share prices and equity markets more generally to determine the next sensible opportunity to realise value from our investments.  It is important to point out that exiting our investments in a measured way that will optimise value for our citizens, will take a number of years, but I do not propose to set out a rigid timeline for disposal. To do so would potentially impact the value we can achieve.  However as I have said before I believe that over the medium term we will recoup all of the money that we invested in these banks during the financial crisis.</p>  <p>  In order to proceed with another sale of bank shares, I would need to be satisfied that the market was prepared to put a fair and reasonable value on the bank's equity, bearing in mind its current performance, future prospects and the outlook for the economy, and I would do so on the advice of officials in my Department.

The current Governor was also appointed by open competition. </p><p>The legislative background for filling vacancies for the positions of governor, deputy governors and directors of the Central Bank of Ireland is set out below.</p><p><b>(i) Governor</b></p><p>Section 19 of the Central Bank Act 1942 provides that the Governor shall be appointed by the President on the advice of the Government.  </p><p>The current Governor was appointed after an open call for expressions of interest in tandem with the hiring of specialist international Executive Search services, the rationale behind the dual process being to ensure as open a competition as possible. </p><p><b>(ii) Deputy Governor</b></p><p>In a legislative context, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Deputy Governors are referenced as &ldquo;Heads of Function&rdquo; (Section 23 of the Central Bank Act 1942 provides that a reference to the Heads of Function is a reference to the Head of Central Banking and the Head of Financial Regulation). Section 23B of the Central Bank Act 1942 further provides:</p><p>(1) The Commission shall, with the consent of the Minister, appoint suitably qualified persons as Heads of Function.</p><p>(2) Subject to subsection (3), an appointment as a Head of Function shall be made by open competition.</p><p>(3) Subsection (2) does not apply to the appointment of a Head of Function if the Commission, with the consent of the Minister, decides that appointment to the office by open competition would be inappropriate.</p><p>&ldquo;The Commission&rdquo; in this Section 23B refers to the Central Bank Commission while &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; refers to the Minister for Finance.  The Head of Central Banking and the Head of Financial Regulation are known as the Deputy Governor &ndash; Central Banking and the Deputy Governor &ndash; Prudential Regulation respectively.</p><p><b>(iii) Director</b></p><p>The role of director within the Central Bank of Ireland is not a statutory role and has no legislative basis.  A director within the Central Bank does not sit on the Central Bank Commission. Section 6D of the Central Bank Act 1942 addresses the appointment of staff within the Central Bank generally (including directors).  This section provides that an appointment must be made by competition to be conducted in accordance with rules made by the Commission but this provision does not apply in circumstances where the Commission decides that appointment to the position by competition would be inappropriate.</p><p>Based on the foregoing, vacancies at Deputy Governor and Executive Director level are generally filled by open competition advertised for a 2-3 week duration through national and, on occasion, international media.  Applicants are then shortlisted into the selection process which is as follows:</p><p>- 1<sup>st</sup>round interview &ndash; generally a technical and competency based interview;</p><p>- Assessment Centre &ndash; conducted by external occupational psychologists;</p><p>- 2<sup>nd</sup>round interview &amp;amp; presentation &ndash; one relevant non-executive Central Bank Commission member participates at this stage of the process and an external independent panel member may also participate at this stage.  For all Director level vacancies, a combination of any two from the Deputy Governor Central Banking, Deputy Governor Prudential Regulation or Director General Financial Conduct also participate. </p><p>- For Director level roles, the final stage of the process is an interview with the Governor.  </p><p>On occasion, vacancies at Director level, may be filled by a lateral transfer (i.e. by a serving member of staff at the same salary grade as the vacancy).  On such occasions, and where the full selection process as outlined above is not considered necessary, the lateral transfer decision to appoint to the role will be made by the Governor, in consultation with a relevant non-executive Commission member and the relevant members of the Governor&rsquo;s Committee.</p><p>The above process has been approved by the Central Bank&rsquo;s Audit Committee and aligns with Section 3.8 of the 2016 Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies which states that states that non-executive directors should bring an independent judgment to bear on issues of strategy, performance, resources, key appointments, and standards of conduct in State Bodies.  </p><p>The following roles in the Bank are considered as &ldquo;key appointments&rdquo; for the purpose of Section 3.8 of the 2016 Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies:</p><p>- Deputy Governor-Central Banking;</p><p>- Deputy Governor-Prudential Regulation;</p><p>- Director General- Financial Conduct;</p><p>- Chief Operations Officer;</p><p>- All executive Director roles;</p><p>- Head of Internal Audit;</p><p>- Head of Organisational Risk;</p><p>- Head of Financial Control;</p><p>- Registrar of Credit Unions;</p><p>- General Counsel;</p><p>- Secretary of the Central Bank.</p></reply>

The Agency announced in October 2017 that it had redeemed all of its &euro;30.2bn in Senior Debt which was guaranteed by the State. However, notwithstanding the successful achievement of this primary and important objective, three years ahead of schedule, there is still a significant body of work yet to be completed by NAMA. </p><p>Subject to current market conditions prevailing, this includes redemption of NAMA&rsquo;s subordinated debt of &euro;1.6 billion by March 2020 and completion of its Dublin Docklands SDZ and residential funding programmes. The most recent details on NAMA's remaining work are available in the Agency's Annual Statement 2018.  This is available on the NAMA website via: .</p><p>The carrying value of NAMA's loan portfolio at 30 September 2017, net of impairment, was &euro;3.7bn. Much of this portfolio is secured by low-value, granular assets and realisation of its full market value over the next three years will require patient and extensive work on the part of NAMA. It is through the successful completion of its deleveraging, Docklands and residential funding programmes that NAMA currently projects a surplus in the region of &euro;3bn to be returned to the State once it completes it work. As per section 60(2) of the NAMA Act 2009, NAMA may use surplus funds to redeem and cancel its senior and subordinated debt. Surplus funds may only be returned to the Central Fund once NAMA's debt has been redeemed in full.</p><p>Any NAMA surplus paid, while Exchequer positive, will not impact the general government balance, in line with Eurostat rules. It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised within the framework of the fiscal rules.</p><p>NAMA was mandated in late 2009 to deal expeditiously with its acquired loan portfolio and to extract best value from that portfolio. NAMA has been extremely successful in achieving this mandate and has now entered into the final phase of this work which involves completing its remaining deleveraging activity and implementing its residential delivery programme and Dublin Docklands SDZ programme. </p><p>As such I do not intend to extend the current remit of NAMA beyond its expected completion in 2020 and in line with its original approval from the EU Commission I February 2010. However, I refer the Deputy to the announcement in my Budget statement in October 2017 of the establishment of Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI), which is intended to increase the availability of debt funding on market terms to commercially viable residential development projects. It is my intention that HBFI will draw on the expertise and experience in residential development funding that currently resides in NAMA in order to efficiently deliver on its objectives.</p></reply>

Under the 2015 Act, if the firm who bought loans from the original lender is an unregulated firm, then the loans must be serviced by a &lsquo;credit servicing firm&rsquo;<b></b>which is regulated by the Central Bank.  Credit Servicing Firms are typically firms that manage or administer credit agreements such as mortgages or other loans on behalf of unregulated entities. </p><p>Credit servicing firms must act in accordance with the requirements of Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.

They were issued as a means of diversifying the Exchequer&rsquo;s sources of funding.  They were issued at fixed interest rates, similar to standard fixed-rate Irish government bonds.  The weighted average interest rate of 5.8% was in line with Irish government bond yields at that time.</p>  <p>  For example, in March 2009 an Irish government bond maturing in 2020 was issued via auction at a yield of just over 5.8%.  Similarly in September 2010, a bond maturing in 2018 was issued via auction at a yield of just over 6%. This was the last bond auction before Ireland entered the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support in late 2010. </p>  <p>  The first Schuldschein is due to mature in March 2024, and the last in September 2030. Schuldschein are, by their nature, generally held to maturity by the initial investor.  In cases where they are sold, it will be at the full market price reflecting their fixed interest rate to maturity.  This effectively creates a &ldquo;break-cost&rdquo; which would need to be considered if an opportunity for re-financing arose, as the associated costs could offset any potential interest savings.  In this sense, they are very similar to standard fixed-rate Irish government bonds.</p></reply>

This ensures that the projected level of public capital investment over the ten years of the Plan is sustainable and affordable in the context of the projected fiscal capacity of the economy over that period.</p>  <p>  As set out in section 3.2 of the NDP, the growth projections underpinning the Exchequer capital envelope contained in the Plan are based on GNI*.  As the Deputy is aware, the Economic Statistics Review Group has recommended the use of GNI* when measuring the size of the Irish economy.    </p>  <p>  Macroeconomic projections adopted in the Plan for the period 2018-2021 are detailed in Annex 3 of the Economic and Fiscal Outlook for Budget 2018.  As set out in the NDP, a potential or trend growth rate of 2% in volume terms is assumed over the period 2022 to 2027.  This potential growth rate aligns with the most recent long-term growth projection from the European Commission for Ireland for the 2020s while being lower than the OECD long-term projection of almost 3% for that period.  The prudent approach taken to the macro-economic and public capital investment framework in the plan is confirmed in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s historic growth performance averaging about 4&frac12;% over the whole of the period from 1966 &ndash; 2017.  The 2% real growth assumption for 2022 to 2027 is supplemented with the conventional assumption that inflation will average 2% in line with the upper limit of the ECB&rsquo;s inflation target yielding a 4% nominal growth projection over the period.</p></reply>

While my Department did not consult with the IFAC in relation to the National Development Plan, IFAC's broad support for the Government's proposed approach to increased public capital investment, in its November 2017 Fiscal Assessment Report, was noted, as follows: </p><p><i>&quot;Having been scaled back to a low base, public investment levels are expected to ramp up quite rapidly again, rising to levels that are among the highest in the EU under current plans. For instance, by 2021, public investment is planned to rise to 9.8 per cent of primary spending; 8.9 per cent of total revenue; and 3.5 per cent of GNI*. Across all measures, this would be higher than present levels for countries such as France, the Netherlands, Germany and the UK as well as for the EU and Euro Area aggregates. Importantly, this is possible while still complying with the fiscal rules in later years. &quot; </i></p><p><i>&quot;A commitment to stick to a specified level of public investment as a share of GNI* would be a sensible basis for fiscal policy over the medium term.If adhered to, this approach could help to prevent forced cuts to public investment in downturns and excessive expansions in investment during booms the preparation of the National Development Plan.&quot;</i></p><p>My Department consulted with the National Treasury Management Agency in connection with a number of the roles performed by that Agency, including:</p><p>- NewERA, in relation to the commercial State sector element of the National Development Plan;</p><p>- the National Development Finance Agency, as a member of the Expert Group reviewing the potential role for PPPs in helping to deliver elements of the Plan; and</p><p>- the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, in relation to the role that the Fund could play in leveraging additional private investment to complement State-backed investment under the Plan.</p><p>In addition, of course, acting as the National Development Finance Agency, the National Treasury Management Agency is the statutory financial advisor to State authorities in respect of all public investment projects with a capital value over &euro;20 million.  The Agency will therefore continue to be consulted by the relevant Departments and Agencies in relation to all projects of this value that have been included in the National Development Plan, as required in accordance with the Public Spending Code.</p><p>With regard to the question of consultation with the European Commission Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, the position is that the Government engages with that Directorate General on a regular basis, through the framework as established by the European Semester. This engagement has dealt with issues related to capital expenditure on a number of occasions in recent times:</p><p>- In July 2016 the European Commission made the Country Specific Recommendation that Ireland should prioritise government capital expenditure in public infrastructure, in particular transport, water services and housing.</p><p>- In February 2017 the European Commission subsequently commented in the Country Report for Ireland that some progress had been made in prioritising government capital expenditure.</p><p>- In July 2017 the European Commission made the following Country Specific Recommendation:</p><p><i>&quot;Better target government expenditure, by prioritising public investment in transport, water services, and innovation in particular in support of SMEs. Enhance social infrastructure, including social housing and quality childcare; deliver an integrated package of activation policies to increase employment prospects of low-skilled people and to address low work intensity of households.&quot;</i></p><p>The National Development Plan seeks to address these issues by increasing investment levels in Ireland at a sustainable rate to amongst the highest in Europe and, very importantly, by ensuring that our infrastructure investment will be strictly guided by the National Planning Framework and its 10 National Strategic Outcomes. </p></reply>

National rules governing public procurement must comply with the relevant EU, WTO and national legal requirements and obligations.  The aim of European and national rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. </p>  <p>  In this regard, public procurement rules include provisions that allow Member States to require a contractor to comply with EU and National legislation on the protection of labour rights.  As a consequence public procurement procedures require applicants to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts and applicants are required to make declarations in relation to their financial standing, their legal standing and in relation to payment of taxes and social contributions.</p>  <p>  Contracting authorities may also require applicants for public contracts to declare that they have not breached their obligations in the fields of environmental, social and labour law established by Union law, national law, collective agreements or by the international environmental, social and labour law provisions listed in Annex X of 2014/24/EU.</p>  <p>  These requirements are set out in the template documents used in tendering for goods and services which have been developed by the Office of Government Procurement in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office. </p>  <p>  The management of a tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to assess that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.</p>  <p>  Public bodies are required to reject a tender where it can be established that it is abnormally low because it does not meet with the obligations imposed by environmental, social and labour law. </p>  <p>  Once awarded, the conditions of the public works contracts require the contractor to certify compliance with employment law, to maintain records of all those employed on the site, regardless of whether they are employees of the contractor or their subcontractors, and the hours worked by them.  Where requested, the contractor must also provide details of the payments made to those employed on the site. Where the contractor fails to comply with their obligations under the contract or employment law, deductions may be made from payments due under the contract until the situation is rectified.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that employment law and its enforcement, in both public and private contracts, is a matter for the relevant State authorities, including the Workplace Relations Commission and the Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></reply>

In that regard, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to publish new school admissions legislation taking into account current draft proposals. </p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill includes a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school's arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.  I believe this is an important measure which will help ensure transparency from the outset as to how a school will uphold the rights of parents in this regard. </p>  <p>  Furthermore another crucial way of dealing with this issue is to provide additional choice to parents and in this regard the Programme for Government includes a commitment to increasing the rate of provision of multi-denominational schools reaching 400 by 2030.</p>  <p>  This is not to say that schools are currently doing nothing when they receive such requests from parents or that there is no advice for schools available.  The follow-up paper to the Report of the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector which was published in 2014 outlines good practice and options for promoting diversity in all schools.  The paper gives an overview of different types of arrangements that schools have put in place to facilitate those pupils who wish to opt-out of religious education. </p>  <p>  The paper encourages school authorities to consider their policies and practices and to review whether they are taking the steps necessary to welcome all pupils and make them feel included.  I understand that in the case of catholic schools, the Catholic Schools Partnership subsequently published guidelines for catholic schools in relation to the inclusion of all pupils and that this also contains suggestions on how such schools can manage the "opt-out" of religious education. </p>  <p>  These are important steps, which alongside the circular I recently published for state multi-denominational schools, help to inform parents in an open and transparent way how their requests to have their children opt out of religious instruction are handled by schools.</p></reply>

These are companies registered under the Companies Acts, the members of which are the owners of residential units within the development and which are established for the purposes of ownership and management of the common areas.</p><p>The 2011 Act contains provisions relating to such matters as:</p><p>- the transfer of common areas to the OMCs (sections 4 and 5);</p><p>- the voting rights of members of OMCs (sections 14 and 15);</p><p>- the provision of annual reports by OMCs to members (section 17);</p><p>- arrangements for the holding of annual meetings to approve annual service charges (section 18);</p><p>- the establishment of a sinking fund to cover refurbishment outlays (section 19);</p><p>- arrangements for the making of House Rules (section 23); and</p><p>- the establishment of a court-based dispute resolution process (section 24).</p><p>The Act also contains provisions which encourage the resolution of disputes that may arise between parties by means of mediation rather than recourse to court proceedings.</p><p>In relation to annual service charges I should point out that it is a matter for each individual OMC to determine the amount of the service charge on an annual basis.  Section 18 of the Act requires OMCs to establish and maintain a scheme of annual service charges from which they may discharge expenditure incurred on the provision of common or shared services to the owners and occupiers of residential units in the development, including insurance, waste management and security services.  The Act sets out clearly that the service charge must be calculated on a transparent basis, and be equitably apportioned between the residential unit owners.  In order to ensure transparency and accountability, both the annual service charge and the services to be provided must be approved by a general meeting of the members of the OMC.</p></reply>

These inquiries were established by Orders made by my predecessor on 15 May 2017.

In the cases of the two remaining Inquiries, extensions have been granted until 30 June 2018.

This work is also informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement.  Separately, a new preparedness unit in the Commission is considering EU-level responses.  </p>  <p>  All this work provides a baseline scenario for the policies and sectors impacted, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations.  In this regard, it is welcome that the direction of travel is now firmly towards achieving a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition period.  Agreement on a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition will provide certainty to individuals and businesses while also aiming to avoid any cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and a future relationship agreement coming into force.  The period will provide time for businesses and citizenship, as well as Government agencies, to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU based on the outcome of the negotiations on the framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK.  In this respect, the expectation is that the European Council will adopt additional Guidelines at its meeting on 22-23 March 2018 on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.  These guidelines &ndash; as well as further clarity on the UK position, which has been sought by the European Council - will provide a clearer picture of the direction of travel in the negotiations. </p>  <p>  In relation to the question of the border, the Common Travel Area is an important feature of the close relationship between Ireland and the UK with long-established benefits for trade and tourism between our two countries.  Both the Irish and UK Governments have publicly declared their commitment to maintaining the CTA and to ensuring no return to a so-called 'hard border' on the island of Ireland.  The UK&rsquo;s commitment to avoiding a hard border was restated as part of the agreement to move to phase 2 of the Brexit negotiations in December.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to that outcome could not be clearer. </p>  <p>  An extensive programme of engagement has been put in place to support this strategic objective.  The importance of the CTA has been highlighted through political and diplomatic engagement with other Member States.  There is ongoing engagement with EU institutions and there is regular contact with the European Commission negotiating team on the UK exit from the EU, including in relation to the specific question of the Common Travel Area.  </p>  <p>  The practical impact of Brexit on the operation of the CTA is being considered between officials of my Department and the UK Home Office, including at meetings of the Common Travel Area Forum jointly chaired by the Director General of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and his UK counterpart.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is represented at a senior level at these meetings.  There is a shared understanding that the maintenance of the CTA and the avoidance of a hard border is a priority strategic objective for both countries.   </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s contingency planning continues to be firmly grounded in the extensive work and outreach that has already been undertaken by individual Departments and agencies, as well as by stakeholder organisations, academics and others.  This includes ongoing engagement by my Department with the Garda authorities in relation to the implications of UK exit.  I want to emphasise that it is the Government&rsquo;s intention that the same border arrangements as currently apply on the island of Ireland will continue in the future.  There is already a clear consensus that the Common Travel Area would continue so that the movement of people, a matter of primary concern for my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, should not be affected.  As would be the case for any changes in policy or practice across any public policy area, in the event that the final shape of Brexit requires changes in the deployment of policing resources then those changes will be implemented by the appropriate authorities and any budgetary provision made in the context of the Estimates process.</p></reply>

The proposal requested funding for a separate office within GSOC and for 12 new staff.  At that time, GSOC had 10 protected disclosures on hand.  </p>  <p>  My Department liaised with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) in relation to the request. Staff from my Department met with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and provided them with a copy of the GSOC proposal. Subsequent to that meeting the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sought specific information in relation to existing arrangements/staffing ratios, etc., which my Department requested from GSOC.  </p>  <p>  While awaiting this information, my Department sought immediate sanction for 5 staff to get the new unit up and running. In May 2017, sanction was obtained from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the initial approval of 5 staff.  It was clearly communicated to GSOC that the provision of further staff could be considered in the context of the 2018 Budget by which time the impact of the establishment of the unit and the adequacy of the 5 staff could be assessed.  There was a clear commitment on the part of my Department at all times, that GSOC could re-engage on the issue as the situation developed and that the door was open to more resources being made available for the new unit based on further information being provided and experience of the operation of the new unit.  </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, it has taken far longer than my Department envisaged at the time, for the 5 staff to be recruited and as of now, GSOC has not yet succeeded in recruiting all the staff sanctioned in May 2017.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may be interested to know that I met with the Chair of GSOC last September and discussed with her, among other things, the resourcing of GSOC.  I invited her to set out for me her best assessment of the overall resource requirements to provide the level of service that complainants, and all those interested in the effective and efficient investigation of complaints against members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, expect and deserve.  I am pleased to say that I have, this week, received a detailed business case for additional resources from GSOC and I will ensure that it is dealt with expeditiously.  It is in no-one's interest that there is any perception that GSOC cannot fulfil its statutory mandate for want of resources and I will continue to do everything in my power to ensure that GSOC has the resources it requires.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and  sustainable manner. Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decison-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for the localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults. This is the only licensed use for the patch in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010. </p><p>When the plasters were first introduced, the budget impact was low, because of the specific indication for which they are licensed. It was therefore a cause of clinical concern that, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where, as a nation, we were using more plasters than the entire UK National Health Service, with ten times our population. </p><p>When a treatment is intended for a small group of patients, and evidence suggests that it is being  used for many times that number, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review its use. In 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme reviewed the use of the plasters. The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing had been for the licensed indication. </p><p>Following the clinical review, and in the interest of ensuring appropriate patient care, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches from 1 September 2017. This process supports their appropriate use, ensuring that post-shingles patients continue to receive this treatment.</p><p>Under the new arrangements, all patients receiving lidocaine plasters for the licensed indication, shingles, were automatically approved on the HSE system. All of these patients continue to receive the treatment under the community schemes. </p><p>Non-shingles patients were given a three month grace period, in which their GP could move them to other treatments or apply for continued reimbursement.  However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients were no longer automatically reimbursed under the community drugs schemes.</p><p>In order for non-shingles patients to receive the patch through the community schemes, their GP must apply online for continued reimbursement approval.  If an application is refused, the GP may appeal, making a clinical case for the patient.  The HSE advises that the turnaround time for applications is three working days and for appeals it is five days.</p><p>As of 16 February, approximately 1,500 post-shingles patients have been approved, and the plaster is being provided to those patients in the normal manner.  </p><p>Another 4784 non-shingles patients were registered by their GP, and 14% of these patients, 670 people, have been approved.  In addition, 284 online appeals have been made, including patients who were never registered, and over 65% of these patients have been approved. </p><p>Over 2300 patients are now approved for the plaster in the drug schemes, with more than 850, over one third, approved for use other than post-shingles pain, based on the clinical case made by the GP.</p><p>It is clear that this new process supports appropriate use and prescribing and both post-shingles patients and other appropriate cases can continue to be treated with lidocaine plasters. </p><p>The introduction of the new approval system was flagged in August 2017, when details of the proposed changes were circulated by the HSE to prescribers and pharmacies. This advice has been re-issued in the last week, and information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE Medicines Management Programme website. ().</p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.  </p></reply>

In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.  The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis. Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis. Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded. </p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  It should be noted, in certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.</p></reply>

The importance of this is well illustrated by the dramatic expansion in Ireland&rsquo;s pig meat  exports to the Far East, and to China in particular, against the background of the closure of the Russian market in 2014. And of course the uncertainty around  Brexit lends an even greater importance to  trade promotion in international markets.  </p>  <p>  In June 2017 I visited Mexico, now the fourth largest global importer of chilled and frozen pork. With Mexican demand for pork continuing to grow I have made  gaining access to that market a priority. I also travelled to Japan and South Korea last autumn where I promoted the development of further opportunities for Irish producers in these jurisdictions as I want to continue to diversify the range of markets to which Ireland has access.  Exports to Japan more than doubled to &euro;22m in 2017 putting it in second place in international markets. The new free trade agreement with Japan (JEEPA) should further enhance trade opportunities. </p>  <p>  Growth in the Philippines was also strong: up 54 % making it the third largest international market for Irish pigmeat exports.</p>  <p>  With Irish production up almost 1% in 2017 and export value increasing some 14% to an estimated &euro;712m, I intend to continue to work with the sector and, by focusing on insight-led growth strategies, continue to take advantage of opportunities for Irish pig meat on international markets.</p></reply>

An EIA is mandatory for initial afforestation involving an area of 50 hectares or more, and for forest road works involving a length of 2,000 metres or more.  Applications for such projects must be accompanied by an environmental impact statement (EIS), to enable my Department to undertake the EIA.  An EIS is an environmental impact assessment report satisfying the requirements of Article 5.1 of the EU Directive and prepared by competent experts.  The information to be contained in an EIS is set out in Schedule 4 of the Regulations.</p><p>In addition, the Forestry Regulations 2017 provide that all proposed afforestation and forest road works below the mandatory thresholds must be screened for EIA, to consider whether or not significant effects on the environment are likely.  This consideration must take into account criteria involving the characteristic of the project, its location, and the type and characteristics of the potential impact, as set out in Schedule 3 of the Regulations.  Where it is considered that a proposed sub-threshold development is likely to have significant effects on the environment and should therefore be subject to an EIA, my Department requires the applicant to submit an EIS to enable the EIA to be undertaken. </p><p>EIA screening is an assessment undertaken by my Department as part of the normal procedure for evaluating the silvicultural and environmental suitability of a proposed development.  The District Forestry Inspector undertakes EIA screening by responding to questions under the various headings: project description; existing land use; cumulative effect and extent of the project; water; soil; protection of Freshwater Pearl Mussel; archaeology; landscape; designated habitats; non-designated habitats; social; accidents; trans-frontier; public participation and NGO participation.  This is supported by spatial analysis concerning the area of forest within various hinterlands of the proposed development.  In undertaking the EIA screening, the Inspector uses information gained from their scrutiny of aerial photographs and various Geographic Information System (GIS) layers available in the IFORIS mapping system, combined with their knowledge gained through (<i>inter alia</i>) field inspection (if required) and a review of referral responses (if any) received from consulted bodies, and submissions from third parties. </p><p>My Department has various options to address individual environmental concerns that arise in relation to a proposed forest development.  For example, specific conditions, such as increased setbacks or exclusions, can be added to the licence, to avoid any impact.  My Department may also seek further information in the form of an expert report in relation to, e.g. archaeology; potential Annex 1 habitats; concerns regarding groundwater; and address any potential impacts identified thorough licence conditions.  Furthermore, my Department has incorporated several protocols into the assessment process, designed to avoid impact concerning particular sensitivities, e.g. surface water acidification; Hen Harrier; Curlew; Freshwater Pearl Mussel; and Small White Orchid. </p><p>Therefore, while the EIA screening process may identify potential environmental impacts, these can often be addressed on an individual basis and do not culminate in a significant environmental impact, which would otherwise trigger an EIA.  </p><p>Since the introduction in 2015 of the Forestry Programme 2014-2020, to the end of December 2017, my Department has received 5,097 applications received under the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme, none of which was greater than 50 hectares.  All of these applications underwent a sub-threshold EIA screening as a matter of course, and while various environmental issues were identified (and later resolved, as above), none of these represented a significant environmental impact. Therefore, no EIAs were triggered during this period.  It should be noted that although 5,097 applications were received from 2015 to 2017, only 2,878 approved applications went forward to complete planting. </p><p>Regarding applications for which appropriate assessments were carried out the following are the identification numbers requested : CN75337, CN73964, CN73727, CN73105, CN73321 and CN77603.</p><p>Planting of broadleaf and coniferous species for 2015 and 2016, the last year in which such data is available, is indicated in the table below.<table><tr><th></th><th>Broadleaf</th><th>Conifer</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>1,263.04</td><td>5,029.77</td><td>6,292.81</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>1,270.30</td><td>5,229.50</td><td>6,499.80</td></tr></table></p><p>With regard to the re-afforestation of coniferous species, my Department prepares the National Forest Inventory (NFI) every five years.

My Department ensures compliance on the part of SWS applicants by way of on-farm inspections and administrative control checks.  The rate of on-farm inspection under the Sheep Welfare Scheme is 5%. These checks are undertaken to confirm that the requisite number of breeding ewes have been retained and to verify that the two scheme actions have been completed.  </p>  <p>  Every effort is made by Department officials to minimise disruption as much as possible to both the farmer and livestock on the holding in both the timing and undertaking of inspections.  Insofar as possible inspections are integrated, to this effect over two-thirds of the SWS on-farm inspections are carried out in conjunction with Ovine Identification &amp;amp; Registration (IDR) inspections under Cross Compliance requirements, which normally take place between the months of April and December.  In these circumstances a second farm visit is required towards the end of the scheme year in order to verify that the scheme actions have been satisfactorily completed.  The inspecting officer checks that the Scheme Action Record Book has been completed and checks any supporting documentation provided by the applicant.  As the ewe count has been previously completed it is not necessary for the inspecting officer to pen and count the ewes again. </p>  <p>  The remaining one-third of SWS inspections take place towards the end of the SWS scheme year.  The breeding ewe count and the verification of the two scheme actions are completed in one farm visit. Department officials, who are very conscious of all of the animal welfare considerations, endeavour to minimise and avoid stress to livestock on the holding when conducting sheep inspections.  When carrying out inspections during the lambing season Department officials adhere to previously agreed protocols, between the Department and the Farming Organisations, aimed at minimising animal stress and preventing the mis-mothering/smothering or injuring of lambs.  </p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that I and officials in my Department are very aware of the concerns being expressed.  The Deputy will appreciate, however, that I must ensure that the EU regulatory requirements on inspections are complied with in order to protect payments under the various schemes and to avoid substantial EU disallowances.</p></reply>

Farming is an essential part of the social, cultural and economic fabric of the country and it is also part of a wider EU dispensation that values a Common Agriculture Policy built on family farming, food security, high standards of food safety and environmental sustainability. These are values that we hold dear, and so it is critically important when we consider the impact of Brexit that the positive contribution of agriculture to the rural and national economy, and to society in Ireland, and indeed elsewhere in the European Union, is to the forefront in our deliberations. </p>  <p>  I and my Department have been very focused over the last 18 months on mitigating the short-term impacts arising from Brexit through practical actions aimed in particular at reducing costs for beef and other farmers. </p>  <p>  In addition to the &euro;150 million low-cost loan scheme I introduced under Budget 2017, I announced a further series of dedicated measures, amounting to over &euro;50 million in total, in Budget 2018. I am also working with my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, on the introduction of the new &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme, in respect of which food businesses will have access to 40 per cent of the funding.</p>  <p>  Market diversification is another key component of the Government response to the challenges posed by Brexit, as we seek to reduce our exposure to the UK market and develop alternative markets for our exports. So, for example, market prioritisation research commissioned by my Department and carried out by Bord Bia is informing the selection of Trade Mission destinations as well as my Department&rsquo;s input to the Government&rsquo;s Global Footprint Initiative.</p>  <p>  Indeed, I will be leaving this weekend on a trade mission to the US and Canada, and will undertake further missions over the remainder of 2018, with a focus in particular on emerging markets that provide opportunities for further growth in agri-food exports.</p>  <p>  Referring specifically to the beef sector, I fully acknowledge the contribution that Irish beef farmers are making to the agri economy, with beef accounting for &euro;2.4bn, or almost 18%, of our agri food exports in 2017. The fact that it is founded on a predominantly pasture-based production system gives us a unique marketing advantage throughout the world in opening up new markets for Irish beef. </p>  <p>  In addition to increasing markets for processed beef, I have, since I took office, made it a priority to increase the levels of live exports. The results of these efforts are being seen in an increase of 45,000 head, or 30%,in the number of live animals exported in 2017 compared to 2016. Two key elements of this increase were further additional exports of suckler bred animals to Turkey, and an increase in the export of dairy male calves which will have a positive consequence for the market for slaughtered cattle in 2018 and 2019. I see a vibrant live export trade as an important source of income for suckler farmers especially,and will continue my efforts in this area in 2018. </p>  <p>  My Department and our agencies will continue to work with the sector to help mitigate the impacts of Brexit, particularly those affecting beef and other farmers, and we will continue to seek a negotiated outcome that will ensure that the trading relationship between the EU and the UK in its entirety post-Brexit will remain as close as possible to the current arrangements.</p></reply>

The Scheme is programmed under Measure 14 of the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014 - 2020 and it complements the range of other RDP supports available to sheep farmers under schemes such as GLAS, TAMS, Knowledge Transfer and the Areas of Natural Constraint scheme.  </p><p>The 2<sup>nd</sup>amendment to the RDP introduced the Sheep Welfare Scheme. The financial allocation for the scheme was provided for in the RDP by way of additional national financing. </p><p>In order to underpin the delivery of value for money from the investment in the RDP, extensive preparatory analyses form the basis of all the schemes and measures in the RDP.  In relation to the sheep scheme, these analyses highlighted particular viability issues within the sheep sector as well as pointing to a strong economic rationale for investing in animal health and welfare.  The sheep sector supports 35,000 farm families directly, as well as several thousand other jobs directly and indirectly in the rural economy.  In 2017 exports from the sector were worth &euro;274 million, an increase of 12% compared to 2016.  </p><p>The actions chosen for targeted support under the scheme were those identified as making a meaningful positive contribution to sheep welfare having regard to the systems of production in Ireland and the environment in which Irish sheep production is carried out.  This in turn will have a positive impact on the overall sheep sector. </p><p>The scheme will also allow for the collection and generation of valuable data on welfare statistics and practices in sheep farming in Ireland. The data generated by this scheme has the potential to make a significant contribution to the Irish sheep industry beyond the lifetime of the scheme in terms of its ability to provide large scale data on welfare in Irish flocks.</p></reply>

It is important that before we deploy further public money we validate the demand and projected cost in an Irish context.</p>  <p>  The proposed pilot scheme which I announced at the recent Renewable Energy Summit will commence this summer and will target solar PV and self-consumption amongst domestic customers. The data gathered during this scheme and throughout the behavioural and attitudes study will inform future phases of support for micro generation in Ireland, as we align with the ambition of the recast Renewable Energy Directive which recognises the rights, entitlements and obligations of renewable self-consumers and deliver on ambitions and commitments made in the Energy White Paper and the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  Further details of the pilot scheme for domestic rooftop solar PV self-consumption will be made available when I have received the study being undertaken  by the SEAI and have had an opportunity to consider its analysis. I intend that the final decision will be made in sufficient time to allow the scheme to commence this summer.</p>  <p>  As set out in the National Mitigation Plan, a very significant increase in effort is required to realise the potential of the residential sector to contribute to the low carbon transition. Already, solar PV is supported under the Better Energy  Communities Scheme and the Deep Retrofit Pilot. </p>  <p>  Additionally, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government currently supports local authorities in an ambitious plan to improve the energy efficiency and comfort levels in local authority homes, benefitting those at risk of fuel poverty and contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions reduction and energy efficiency targets for 2020. Funding of some &euro;115.7 million has been provided from 2013 to the end 2017 to improve energy efficiency and comfort levels in almost 64,000 local authority homes. Under this Programme, tenants do not apply for a grant to undertake works, rather the Council identifies the units to be retrofitted and undertakes the works with funding provided by the Department.</p></reply>

The National Broadband Plan (NBP) is included in the National Development Plan as one of those priorities.  The NBP aims to ensure high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector.  Today, almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. Since this Government came into office almost 400,000 additional premises have access to high speed broadband.  This will increase to nearly 8 out of 10 premises by the end of this year and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention. </p>  <p>  My Department is in a formal procurement process to engage a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area.  That procurement process is now in its final stages. </p>  <p>  When the procurement process reaches a satisfactory conclusion and a subsidy level has been approved by Government, a contract will be awarded and the network rollout will commence. Current estimates for rollout indicate the majority of premises in the State intervention area will have access to a high speed broadband connection within 3 years of the beginning of rollout.</p>  <p>  In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p>  <p>  Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

Specifically in the areas the deputy is enquiring about, I recently opened a Biomethane Stakeholders Group at which the research team from University College Cork presented. The stakeholder group is part of on-going stakeholder consultation on the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat which aims to meet our European Targets for renewable heat. It is intended that biomethane injection into the gas grid will form part of the next phase of the support scheme.</p><p>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) SEAI 2018 Research, Development &amp;amp; Demonstration Funding Programme, which is fully funded by my department, includes research in the area of bioenergy and biomethane. During 2017, this SEAI Programme funded projects in the broad bioenergy/bioemethane/biofuel areas, including research with the following organisations: the University of Limerick; the Technology Centre for Biobased Resources; the Irish Bioenenergy Association; Premier Green Energy; Dundalk Institute of Technology; Dowmann Ltd.; BMS Technologies; and the Cr&eacute; Composting and Anaerobic Digestion Association of Ireland.</p><p>Last year SEAI published the <i>Assessment of Cost and Benefi­ts of Biogas and Biomethane in Ireland</i>. This study looked at the contribution that biogas and biomethane could make to renewable energy production, through electricity and heat generation and the replacement of natural gas. </p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the SEAI, both of whom are funded by my department, provide funding to academic researchers and industry in the areas of environmental protection (EPA) and sustainable energy (SEAI).</p><p>SEAI funds Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the International Energy Agency Bioenergy Task 37 - Energy from Biogas. Task 37 is an international working group which covers the anaerobic digestion (AD) of biomass feedstocks including agricultural residues, energy crops, organic-rich waste waters, and domestic and industrial organic wastes. Anaerobic digestion is a process to treat biodegradable waste to reduce landfill emissions and is also a source of renewable energy.</p><p>I am aware of recent developments in the possibilities for hydrogen to play a role in our energy systems and will be launching a position paper on this subject at NUI Galway on 20<sup>th</sup>March.</p><p>Gas Networks Ireland are managing the &lsquo;Causeway project&rsquo;, co-funded by the European Union, which represents a signification step in delivering a sustainable alternative fuel for Irish transport.  The project will see the formation of a national Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) refuelling network, the first renewable gas injection facility in Ireland from a biogas plant in Kildare, and the deployment of a fleet of CNG vehicles. Projects such as these will increase the penetration of alternative lower carbon fuels in Ireland and help to reduce greenhouse gas and air pollutants from traditional transport fuels such as diesel.</p><p>Green CO2 recovery is an option for Biogas plants where the biogas needs to be cleaned prior to injection into the natural gas grid.  Officials from my department attended the recent Green Gas Certification project which aims to provide a verifiable and sustainable certification process for green gas projects to help meet our climate and energy targets. The potential for Green CO2 from biogas plants was also raised at this forum.</p><p>It is hoped that the research being funded by the Government, aligned with the new support schemes being developed by my Department, will encourage and increase the amount of low carbon sources used in our energy mix.  </p></reply>

The project requires the use of the crosswind runway, R16/34 at night for that 18-month period.</p>  <p>  These works can only be carried out at night between the hours of 9pm and 5am when the airport is least busy as it requires the full closure of the main runway.  While the night time works are ongoing, the airport has no alternative but to use its secondary runway, R16/34 to facilitate landings and take-offs during this time.</p>  <p>  The daa began highlighting the necessity for this project in 2015 and took steps to communicate with local communities in respect of the time and scope of the works.  Due to the concerns of residents living under the southerly flight path to runway 16/34, which is the most populated flight path to this runway daa have committed to using the northerly flight path for the duration of this project where at all possible other than when weather conditions dictate. </p>  <p>  Following the completion of the works on the main runway, daa advise that R16/34 will only be used in exceptional circumstances i.e. where wind/safety reasons dictate.  Therefore, no increased noise disruption beyond the duration of the overlay works is anticipated.   </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that in compliance with an EU Regulation (598/2014) concerning Noise Related Operating Restrictions at EU Airports, I recently announced plans for the establishment of an independent body to regulate airport noise at Dublin Airport in accordance with prescribed procedures for assessing and, where appropriate, ensuring the adoption of measures to mitigate noise impacts. With the support of Government, I intend to appoint Fingal County Council as the Competent Authority. The necessary statutory arrangements are a priority objective for my Department in 2018.  </p>  <p>  It is my view that provisions of the Regulation, including the appointment of an independent regulator, represent a huge improvement on current arrangements for noise management at the Airport and that full implementation is in the broad national interest and in the best interests of local residents.</p></reply>

The agencies and state bodies under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport were also key contributors and their support was invaluable. In fact some key officials have been working on the National Planning Framework in consultation with colleagues in other Government Departments for a number of years.</p>  <p>  On the day of the launch itself, three Departmental officials were also present at the launch of Project Ireland 2040 in County Sligo. A number of briefing sessions were planned for the day and as some of those happened concurrent with the Government meeting it was appropriate to have representatives of the Department on hand to help with queries.  As is normal in such circumstances, costs associated with official travel are eligible to be paid in line with standard Civil Service rates; however, no costs have yet been paid. It is the practice in my Department that travel costs are claimed soon after they are incurred and I am sure that this will be the case in this instance too.  </p>  <p>  Much of the promotional material used was produced centrally with our input but at no direct cost to my Department. Therefore direct expenses incurred by this Department relating to the launch are likely to fall with a range of between &euro;1,000 and &euro;2,000.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the ratification of the Istanbul Convention falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  The Istanbul Convention is a significant legal instrument in tackling violence against women and domestic violence.  Many of the actions required by provisions in the Istanbul Convention are being implemented on a daily basis under current legislation and administrative practice.  The actions necessary to ratify the Istanbul Convention are contained in the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021, published in January, 2016.  </p>  <p>  The implementation of most of these actions is underway including public sector training/education by a range of State agencies, the development of a Risk Assessment Matrix by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, commissioning of national helpline services to respond to issues of domestic and sexual violence and support for child witnesses.  </p>  <p>  The remaining outstanding actions are legislative and require delivery of two pieces of legislation:</p>  <p>  - The Domestic Violence Bill, which was published on 3rd February, 2017. The Bill has passed all stages in the Seanad and Second Stage in the D&aacute;il. Committee stage is expected to commence shortly in the D&aacute;il. It is hoped that this Bill will be enacted early this year. The enactment of this legislation is key to advancing the ratification of the Istanbul Convention as its enactment will deliver four of the actions required under the Istanbul Convention.</p>  <p>  - The one remaining legislative action is the enactment of legislation for extraterritorial jurisdiction. Work on this action is underway and it is anticipated that this legislation will be published in the first half of 2018.  </p>  <p>  - When the required legislative actions are implemented, Ireland will be in a position to ratify the  Istanbul Convention. </p>  <p>  - Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has statutory responsibility for the provision of care and protection to victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence (DSGBV).</p>  <p>  - In 2017, additional funding of &euro;1.5m was allocated to Tusla to support the development of services. I was pleased to secure a further increase of &euro;1.7m for 2018, bringing the total level of funding for DSGBV services to &euro;23.8m. This includes funding for some 60 services throughout the country, including emergency refuge and support services. </p>  <p>  The provision of domestic violence refuge spaces nationally in 2017 was 155 family units, comprising 147 emergency refuge family units and 8 emergency non-refuge family units. Guidance from the Council of Europe in relation to the provision of family places in a refuge indicates that &ldquo;In member states where shelters form part of a community strategy with intervention projects, there should be one family place per 10,000 women&rdquo;. Using the methodology set out by the Council of Europe, based on average family size and overall bed capacity, where a "family place should cater for a woman and the number of children based on the average family size for the country", current provision in Ireland is one family place per 7,765 adult women thus exceeding the recommendation for minimum refuge provision.  </p>  <p>  However, given the variations in configurations of unit size and type, the emergency basis of provision and geographical distribution of demand, it is impossible to ensure a direct match between available units and family size and there have been geographical disparities in provision across the country. Tusla recognises the need to assure that the complement of emergency refuge services nationally matches as best as possible within available resources, demands for services and the needs of service users. </p>  <p>  Services for victims of domestic abuse in the North East region, namely counties Louth, Meath, Cavan, and Monaghan, received approximately &euro;1.4m in funding from Tusla in 2017. Services to victims of domestic violence in counties Cavan and Monaghan are provided by Tearmann Domestic Violence Services, which received funding of approximately &euro;192,000 from Tusla in 2017 for the provision of support and advocacy services to victims. Individuals based in West Cavan can avail of the services of the Domestic Violence Advocacy Service for Sligo, Leitrim and West Cavan, which also provides support and advocacy services. This service received approximately &euro;317,000 in funding in 2017. Subject to the availability of spaces, women from counties Cavan and Monaghan may also avail of refuge services in Dublin or other parts of the country in line with availability of spaces and safety needs. </p>  <p>  Tusla has no immediate plans to provide a refuge in the Cavan/Monaghan area. There are three refuges situated in Drogheda, Co. Louth; Dundalk, Co. Louth; and Navan, Co. Meath, which provide emergency domestic violence accommodation to women based in the North East region. This includes 21 family units of emergency refuge accommodation.  </p>  <p>  As part of its commissioning approach to developing services, Tusla carried out a number of needs analyses projects in 2017 to identify gaps in service provision and to prioritise service developments. All future service developments, whether based in the North East region or elsewhere, will be informed by Tusla&rsquo;s commissioning approach. In 2017, Tearmann Domestic Violence Services completed a Strategic Plan as a means of improving and developing services in counties Cavan and Monaghan. Tusla will meet Tearmann Domestic Violence Services and other partners shortly with a view to supporting these developments.</p></reply>

In the case of a young LGBTI+ person this  may be occurring at a time when the family is coming to an understanding of their changed identity, and the challenges that may create for members of the family.   </p>  <p>  In the first instance, and in consultation with the child, Tusla social workers will see if it is possible for the child to be re-integrated into the care of their family or extended family. This will only occur where it is in the child's best interest and where there is a plan to address the issues that led to the child leaving, or being told to leave, the family home. If this is not a suitable or safe option the child will be received into care and placed with a foster family or residential centre.   In a small number of cases they may provide accommodation and support to a 17 year old.  </p>  <p>  An assessment is carried out as to the reasons for a child coming into care,  their current and future needs and how these are to be met  are set out in their Care Plan.  While there is no specific plan for LGBTI+ children received into care, the reasons for their presentation as homeless forms an integral part of their assessment and care plan, through which appropriate services and supports will be identified.   </p>  <p>  Their social worker, foster carer or residential staff will need to ensure they have the information and understanding necessary to help the young person.  When they leave care at 18 years of age, their after care plan should address ongoing supports for them as an LGBTI+ young people as well as  income and health supports, accommodation and help with their educational ambitions. While the provision of housing is a function of the housing or local authorities, Tusla co-operates with the housing authorities as part of aftercare planning.   </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to develop a National LGBT Youth Strategy.  This is a key commitment for my Department. It also contributes to the Government&rsquo;s broader commitment to continuing to strive for full inclusion of LGBTI+ people in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Strategy will be the first of its kind in the world and will  identify the additional measures that are required to ensure that young people identifying as LGBTI+ can achieve the same outcomes as all children and young people. The actions which the Strategy will recommend are still under consideration, with expected publication in Summer 2018. </p>  <p>  Research into the scale of the problem of homeless LGBTI young people,  has been raised during the development of the strategy process. I am aware that Focus Ireland are now undertaking research in this area and  I will ask  that my officials  to meet with Focus Ireland and Tusla to discuss the project.</p></reply>

These provide for the welfare of the child, including their health, education, assessment of need, care planning, supervision of placement, contact with family, general care practices, care records, and safety precautions.  Children, depending on their identified needs, may be placed by in foster care either with relatives or general foster carers, in residential care, high support or special care or other placement types.  The majority of children are placed in long term stable placements and currently over 92% of children are placed in foster care.  A key part of the social worker role is to ensure the quality and safety of the child's placement, and to meet with the child on a one to one basis on all visits.  There are safeguards surrounding each child care placement, whether foster or residential care and all placements are supervised by a professionally qualified social worker.</p>  <p>  All foster care services and statutory residential centres are subject to inspection by the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA).

The reports also provide statistical evidence of improvements to child welfare and protection services and highlights challenges and areas where further improvement is required, such as the recruitment of additional social workers.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department meet Tusla management on a regular basis to review the level of service provision, including areas in need of improvement. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should also be aware that children in care have access to independent advocacy supports, such as the organisation Empowering People in Care (EPIC).  Children in care also have access to the complaints mechanism in Tulsa, and may make complaints, or be assisted to make complaints, about their care to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children. </p>  <p>  In the context of the Child Care Act 1991, my Department has policy responsibility for children under 18 years of age who present as &ldquo;out of home&rdquo; without their parent or guardian.  Children under the age of 16 who present as homeless without their parent or guardian are taken into care. Children aged 16 and 17 may be taken into care or provided with a service under section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991 which deals with accommodation for homeless children.  Children who are homeless and in emergency accommodation are in the care of their parent or guardian.  Where there are no welfare or protection concerns, Tusla&rsquo;s role is to provide family support, where this is required. </p></reply>

This is part of the whole-of-Government response to the problem of homelessness. </p>  <p>  Where children are homeless as part of a family experiencing homelessness, my Department is working closely with Tusla to provide supports to mitigate the challenges faced by these parents and children. </p>  <p>  Tusla works together with other statutory and voluntary agencies to provide services and supports to children, young people and families experiencing homelessness.</p>  <p>  These include the introduction of free childcare for the children of families experiencing homelessness.  As part of the scheme a daily meal is provided for each child, the cost of which is included in the subvention rate.  The scheme is also designed to help those transitioning from homelessness to permanent accommodation.</p>  <p>  Actions taken by Tusla include the provision of funding for child support workers and the appointment of a Homelessness Liaison Officer.</p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres, part funded by Tusla, are working with people who are experiencing homelessness and many have developed local responses to the needs of families in emergency accommodation.  These include, by way of example, family fun days, homework support, after school programmes, play therapy and transport services. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the difficulties associated with homelessness and school attendance, Tusla&rsquo;s Educational Welfare Service offers a number of supports to children (and families) experiencing homelessness.</p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s joint protocol with the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) covers child welfare and protection matters for children in emergency accommodation.  It is fully operational in the DRHE areas and it is intended to replicate this protocol across the State. A Joint Working Protocol has been signed between Tusla and Galway City Council. </p>  <p>  Finally, the DRHE is coordinating the development of a comprehensive National Quality Standards Framework for homeless services on behalf of all housing authorities.  Consultation with service users and key stakeholders, including Tusla, has been undertaken and the draft standards have been piloted in selected services.  These standards, including a child safety element which will provide homeless services with a framework for continuous quality improvement, will be implemented nationally. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that Tusla only intervenes in family life in exceptional circumstances.  Children who are with their families in emergency accommodation remain in the care of their parents or guardians.  Where Tusla has concerns regarding the welfare and development of any child they will provide family supports to assist that family and child.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, my concern is that we minimise and then eliminate the problem of homelessness.  In the meantime, I will continue to support measures to help those affected, to the greatest degree possible within my area of responsibility.</p></reply>

However, the Child Care Act, 1991, applies to all children resident in the State irrespective of their immigration status.  Under the Child Care Act, 1991 and the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has a duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care or protection.  Tusla provides support  for these children for as long as their welfare requires it.</p>  <p>  Children First National Guidance (2011) gives advice for notifying Tusla of situations where abuse is suspected.  A range of professionals including teachers, nurses, early years educators, Garda&iacute; and other health professionals, who see children regularly, are in a </p>  <p>  good position to identify children at risk.  Where someone has reasonable grounds for suspecting a child is being, or has been, abused, they are expected to immediately contact Tusla.</p>  <p>  The Children First Act, 2015 places a statutory obligation on key professionals (mandated persons) to report concerns of harm above a defined threshold to Tusla without delay.  These provisions were commenced on December 11th, last year. </p>  <p>  When a child who is undocumented, and is living with his or her parent or guardian, is taken into care, their needs are given priority.  A social worker is assigned to the child and prepares a care plan, in consultation with the child.  The plan should be dynamic and </p>  <p>  formally reviewed regularly.  Intrinsic to this process is ensuring that the voice and best interest of the child are central.  When outlined in the care plan, Tusla will  assist the child with the process of establishing residency.</p>  <p>  Unaccompanied asylum seeking children who seek the assistance of the State are placed in the statutory care of Tusla.  Their needs are assessed by an allocated a social worker from a specialist team who work exclusively with unaccompanied minors.  They receive appropriate educational, social,  medical counselling support.  In the course of 2017 140 unaccompanied children were received into Tusla care.  Additionally, in the course of 2017 and January 2018, 36 children were received under the Calais Special Project. </p>  <p>  Before travelling to Ireland, the Calais children were screened by the Garda&iacute; and Department of Justice and Equality officials, and their residency status was approved.</p>  <p>  Children who, with their parents, live in Direct Provision, are provided with welfare supports as required.  Tusla have seconded an experienced social work team leader to the Department of Justice and Equality to liaise directly between Direct Provision and Tusla services.</p></reply>

Tusla provides funding to voluntary organisations offering a range of counselling and support services to children and families including:</p>  <p>  - Marriage and relationship counselling,</p>  <p>  - Child counselling,</p>  <p>  - Rainbows Peer Support Programme for children,</p>  <p>  - Bereavement counselling and support on the death of a family member.</p>  <p>  In 2017, Tusla provided funding of approximately &euro;5.9 million to support organisations providing counselling services, the majority of which are voluntary.  The organisations that are funded vary enormously in size and approach; some are dedicated counselling bodies, others provide counselling as part of a wider range of social and family services.  These services provide support to families, children and young people.  The funding provided by Tusla focuses on the development of support services in the community for families to enhance stability in family life and to assist children and families and their members in dealing with difficult periods in their lives.  </p>  <p>  Tusla's priority is to ensure that counselling services provide support and promote the development, welfare and protection of children and the effective functioning of families.  Counselling services funded by Tusla are specifically targeted at children who have been affected by parental separation or who have suffered family bereavement.  Tusla&rsquo;s marriage and relationship counselling funding is instrumental in assisting parents to deal with difficulties they experience in their personal relationships.</p>  <p>  Mental health policy is under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Health, and Tusla works closely with other care providers including the Health Service Executive (HSE), in respect of access to child and adolescent mental health services. </p>  <p>  Tusla will continue to work closely with service providers to support children and young people at risk and the effective functioning of families.</p></reply>

Customer feedback is that they should be allowed to volunteer the card to non-specified bodies if it suits them to do so, for the purposes of ID verification such as when signing up to a utility company contract or opening an account with a financial institution.  Customers often report that private companies insist on a State-issued photographic ID such as a Passport or Driver&rsquo;s License which they might not have and which are costly.  In contrast, the PSC is free of charge.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, the legislative proposal is that non-specified bodies that accept a PSC that is offered to them voluntarily by the holder should not be prosecuted or be at risk of prosecution.  At the same time, such non-specified organisations should not be able to request or force a person to use their PSC - that would remain an offence.  In other words, the volunteering of the card is the critical issue.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, and for the sake of absolute clarity, this proposal in no way allows a private sector body to access the customer data on the card chip or on any government database - it would simply allow them to view/accept the card as a form of identity and to stop it being an offence for them to accept it.</p>  <p>  This measure will be beneficial to holders of the PSC, most especially those who do not hold a driving licence or a passport.  It is their identity and, as such, the holder should be allowed to volunteer it if they so choose, even in a commercial situation.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.  On the 6th   December 2017 my colleague the Minister of Communications, Climate Action and Environment announced that the ban on the sale of smoky coal in the existing zones, which has been in place in larger towns for some time, will be extended countrywide from autumn of 2018. </p>  <p>  When the initial ban on smoky coal was introduced in larger towns my Department introduced a smog/smokeless allowance for the anticipated higher cost of smokeless fuel.  However this was discontinued in 2011 as the price differential between smoky and smokeless coal has dropped considerably over the years.  Smokeless fuel is also more energy efficient than conventional coal, more than offsetting any increase in cost.  Research indicates that the efficiency gain can be up to 50%.  </p>  <p>  Taking this into account I have no plans at this time to increase fuel allowance to offset the higher cost of smokeless fuel. Any decision to do so would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources and this may include exceptional heating costs.  </p>  <p>  The best way to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling.  My Department works closely with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to help identify people in energy poverty who are living with chronic respiratory conditions so they can avail of the Warmth and Wellbeing Scheme which aims to make homes warmer and healthier to live in.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Accordingly, <i>Project Ireland 2040</i>proposes the establishment of a National Regeneration and Development Agency to enhance overall management of the development potential of State lands to support implementation of the <i>National Planning Framework</i>.  It is expected that the Agency will work with local authorities, public bodies and the business community, harnessing public lands as catalysts to stimulate regeneration and wider investment and to achieve compact, sustainable growth. </p><p>The primary focus of the Agency will therefore be about capacity building, creating a national centre of expertise to support local authorities and agencies in working with wider community and business stakeholders and aiding the coordination of complex regeneration projects.</p><p>The detailed arrangements in relation to the establishment, location of headquarters, staff costs and powers of the Agency have yet to be fully determined.  However, at this point it is envisaged that the organisation would be a tightly focused one which would seek to work through the statutory powers of the stakeholders it is being established to assist, such as the local authorities who already have extensive powers to acquire, compulsorily if necessary, lands for development.</p><p>Under <i>Project Ireland 2040</i>, my Department has been allocated responsibility for developing the &euro;2 billion Urban Regeneration Fund which will support delivery of the NPF&rsquo;s growth enablers for cities and other large urban centres of 10,000+ population and complementing the &euro;1 billion Rural Regeneration Fund being targeted at smaller towns and villages below this population threshold. </p><p>While specific projects and activities under this Fund have not yet been identified, my Department will be engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and other relevant Departments in the short term in drawing up the outline of and criteria for calls for competitive bids for seed funding that will leverage other public and private investment, based on proposals that meet some or all of the criteria as set out in the NPF. </p><p>Twelve officials of my Department, including Advisors, attended the launch in Sligo for briefing and administrative/organisational purposes.  Costs associated with their attendance, which have yet to be finalised given the recent timing of the event, will be determined in accordance with Travel and Subsistence rules as set out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p></reply>

The review involved discussions with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, the representative body of the group water sector.  Discussions concluded in December, when I approved revised subsidy levels.  The new subsidy arrangements, endorsed by a special delegate conference of the Federation on 13 December 2017, came into effect on 1 January 2018.</p>  <p>  The changes implement the recommendation contained in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services (JOCFFDWS), endorsed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in April 2017, that there be equity of treatment and equivalent financial support between households using public water services and those availing of private water services.  </p>  <p>  The revised subsidy levels are as follows:</p>  <p>  1) For the annual subsidy towards the operation and maintenance costs of group water schemes providing a supply of water for domestic purposes (knows as &lsquo;Subsidy A&rsquo;): </p>  <p>  The maximum subsidy per house in private group water schemes has increased from &euro;140 per household to &euro;231.  An increased maximum subsidy of &euro;281 per household is available for small schemes of less than 100 houses that are willing, in the interests of providing in the long-term a more sustainable water supply to their members, to progress towards rationalisation or amalgamation with other schemes.</p>  <p>  The maximum subsidy per house for public group water schemes has increased from &euro;70 per household to &euro;115.  These are schemes that supply their members with water that is provided by Irish Water.</p>  <p>  The portion of costs than can be recouped by group water schemes has also increased.  Typically up to 60% of costs have been covered by the subsidy payments.  This has increased to 85%.  There are also changes and simplifications to how these costs are assessed.</p>  <p>  2) For the additional subsidy that is paid towards the costs of group water schemes that have long-term Operation and Maintenance Contracts (for example, as part of a Design Build Operate project) for the delivery of water (known as &lsquo;Subsidy B)&rsquo;: </p>  <p>  There has been an increase in the level of volumetric costs incurred by group water schemes operating under these contracts that is recoupable, from 60% to 85%.  This will allow for a greater portion of costs to be included within the subsidy payment.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above, my Department is currently finalising proposals to increase the level of grant support for users of private wells, details of which I will be announcing shortly. </p>  <p>  Separate to the initial review of group water scheme subsidy levels and also in fulfillment of the JOCFFDWS recommendations, I will shortly be establishing a working group to conduct a wider review of investment needs and rural water services.  The review will focus on issues such as governance, supervision and monitoring of the sector, and capital investment requirements.  It is anticipated that this group would engage with relevant stakeholders and will aim to complete its work by mid-2018.</p>  <p>  Cognisance will be taken in this regard of any required measures to support the implementation of the finalised River Basin Management Plan 2018-2021, which I plan to finalise and publish early this year.</p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in Rebuilding Ireland, a review of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken. The review has incorporated analysis of comprehensive data received from local authorities regarding the operation of the scheme during 2016 and a wide-ranging public consultation process which took place in 2017 and saw submissions received from individuals, elected representatives and organisations.</p>  <p>  The review is now complete and a full report setting out findings and recommendations has been prepared. This required some further consultation with other Government Departments and for consideration to be given to possible implementation arrangements.  These issues are close to being finalised and  I expect to be in a position to publish the outcome of the review shortly.</p></reply>

However, I have set out below the expenditure incurred under the National Regeneration Programme which operates under my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Capital Investment Programme.</p><p>My Department currently supports a programme of large-scale regeneration projects in Dublin, Cork and Limerick and smaller projects in Tralee, Sligo and Dundalk under this National Regeneration Programme.  These projects seek to address the causes of disadvantage in these communities through a holistic programme of physical, social and economic regeneration.  Projects being funded under the Programme target the country&rsquo;s most disadvantaged communities, including those defined by the most extreme social exclusion, unemployment and anti-social behaviour.  &euro;61 million in Exchequer funding is being provided under this programme in 2018.</p><p>The expenditure on the National Regeneration Programme over the period 2011-2017 is set out in the table below</p><p><table><tr><th><b>2011 - &euro;m</b></th><th><b>2012  - &euro;m</b></th><th><b>2013  - &euro;m</b></th><th><b>2014  - &euro;m</b></th><th><b>2015 - &euro;m</b></th><th><b>2016  - &euro;m</b></th><th><b>2017  - &euro;m</b></th></tr><tr><td>118.19</td><td>100.62</td><td>69.43</td><td>46.88</td><td>48.80</td><td>50.05</td><td>65.19</td></tr></table></p><p>In terms of urban regeneration specifically, and as announced in Budget 2018, a programme of &euro;50 million in Exchequer funding, supplemented by an additional minimum 50% contribution from local authorities, is being introduced to support projects and initiatives to regenerate and revitalise depopulated urban areas and facilitate more compact urban growth.  An initial &euro;10 million is being made available in 2018 to get the programme underway.  A key aim will be to maximise linkages with other programmes designed to bring vacant properties back into use.</p><p>In terms of the wider context, expenditure on urban regeneration was traditionally made through the Regional Operational Programmes, with the Urban and Village Renewal Measures involving a total planned EU and Exchequer co-financed expenditure of &euro;154 million from 2000-2006. Budgetary constraints arising from the downturn in the economy caused the subsequent programme (2007-2013) to be deferred.</p><p>In the current programme covering the period 2014-2020, a Designated Urban Centre Grant Scheme is providing for investments in sustainable urban development, co-funded by the EU Regional Development Fund (with a contribution of &euro;40 million) and the local authorities, in the order of &euro;128 million over the 7-year period.  This programme is supporting the delivery of 24 sustainable urban capital works projects around Ireland, which are expected to be completed by 2019, for the lasting benefit of local communities and improved quality of urban living.</p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department has been allocated responsibility for developing the &euro;2 billion urban regeneration fund which will support delivery of the National Planning Framework's (NPF) growth enablers for cities and other large urban centres.  Specific projects/activities under the fund have not yet been identified, and Departments and local authorities will be invited to make joint competitive bids for seed funding that will leverage other public and private investment, based on proposals that meet some or all of the criteria as set out in the NPF.</p></reply>

It is anticipated that the review group will engage with relevant stakeholders and will aim to complete its work by mid 2018.  The process will inform preparations for a new multi-annual programme for the period 2019-2021. </p></reply>

My Department may recoup housing authorities up to 90% of payments reasonably made.  Under funding arrangements that are in place between my Department and housing authorities, exchequer funding is provided on a regional basis, whereby payments are made to a designated lead-authority which is responsible for the disbursement of this exchequer funding, within the region.  Housing authorities are currently in the process of submitting estimated 2018 expenditure programmes, which my Department will consider before notifying lead-authorities of delegated regional allocations.  </p>  <p>  As in previous years, the 2018 delegated regional funding allocations will be made primarily in respect of scheduled services, i.e. those where a service level agreement is in place between the authority and the service provider.  Given the demand-led nature of homelessness and the increased rates of homeless presentation in recent times, it is recognised that it is not possible for authorities to be fully accurate in relation to forecast expenditure and additional expenditure may also arise outside of the provisions of the delegated funding allocations.  Accordingly, this year, as in previous years, my Department has provided reassurance that all expenditure reasonably incurred will be considered for recoupment. </p></reply>
