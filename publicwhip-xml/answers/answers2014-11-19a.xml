The Department of Justice and Equality has primary responsibility in the area of asylum and immigration.<br/><br/>The Deputy may be aware that a report &lsquo;<i>Review of the operation of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002&rsquo;,</i>was submitted by the Ombudsman for Children, Ms. Emily Logan to the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in March 2012. One of the recommendations contained in that report was that <i>&quot;&hellip; section 11(1)(e) should be amended to clarify that the exclusion regarding the administration of law in the area of asylum, immigration, naturalisation or citizenship relates solely to decisions taken by the relevant authorities in accordance with statutory procedures for determining whether  a person is entitled to a particular status.&rdquo;</i><br/><br/>My Department engaged with the Department of Justice and Equality on this recommendation, among others. The then Minister for Justice and Equality considered that no legislative change was required and this position has been reaffirmed by that Department.<br/><br/>In a reply to a question by Deputy Brendan Griffin  (Reference No. 31092/14 on 15th July 2014), the Minister for Justice and Equality addressed, among other issues, the question of the Ombudsman for Children being given jurisdiction in the direct provision system and for the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA) to be allowed inspect direct provision hostels. In replying, the Minister made reference to provisions in both the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 and Ombudsman Act 1980 which excludes either Ombudsman from investigating any action taken by or on behalf of a person in the administration of law relating to, inter alia, asylum. If I may quote from Minister Fitzgerald's response, she said &quot;<i>Whilst there are no plans to change those legislative provisions, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) including RIA, has administrative arrangements in place with both Offices to assist and provide information on matters brought to its attention by them</i>&quot;.<br/><br/>The Department of Justice has established a working group to review a range of issues pertaining to asylum seekers and direct provision. The first meeting of the Working Group on the Protection Process was held on the 10th November 2014, chaired by Dr Bryan McMahon. The Working Group consists of children's rights advocates, organisations engaged with asylum groups and representatives from a range of relevant government departments, including a representative from my own Department. I look forward to learning of the findings and recommendations of the working group in the Spring of 2015.</p></reply>

The Youth Service Grant Scheme provides funding some 30 national and major regional youth organisations which support the provision of programmes and services for the personal and social education of young people between the ages of 10 to 24. Other schemes support youth projects which focus on preventative responses for young people who are disadvantaged, in particular young people who are homeless, at risk of alcohol and drugs misuse, are out of school or Traveller children. </p><p>  In 2014, funding of &euro;49.78m has been provided to my Department for these schemes. I am pleased to advise that Budget 2015 has confirmed that funding of &euro;49.78m will again be provided to my Department in 2015 to support the provision of youth services. There will be no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015 which was a key priority for youth organisations. </p><p>  The initiatives mentioned by the Deputy have not received funding from my Department and their activities do not come within the scope of the main funding programmes available to my Department at this time.</p><p>  I am aware of the valuable work carried out at local level by computer coding clubs such as CoderDojo and TechSpace. Computer coding initiatives have much to contribute to helping young people in making the most of digital technology and in particular, in positioning Ireland to take advantage of the opportunities of digital in line with the objectives of the National Digital Strategy led by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p><p>  I would like to advise the Deputy that local volunteer-led youth clubs are eligible to apply for funding under my Department's Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and other related schemes operated in Dublin and Waterford Cities. In 2014, &euro;1.035m was made available under this Scheme to local youth clubs and groups, for 1,900 volunteer-led youth clubs with almost 100,000 young members. These annual grants are important source of funding for local youth clubs and groups. The Scheme is administered by 16 Education and Training Boards on behalf of my Department.  Further information on this is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.dcya.gov.ie, or from regional Education and Training Boards. </p><p>  Details of the 2015 Scheme will be announced in the first quarter of 2015.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-19a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014111900065#WRA01500"><p>I am aware of and concerned by sustainability issues for early years services.  Annual funding in the region of &euro;260 million is provided to the childcare sector to support a number of childcare programmes that are implemented by this Department. These programmes include the Community Childcare Subvention programme, the Early Childhood Care and Education programme and a number of labour activation initiatives under the Training and Employment Childcare programmes.  These programmes, and in particular the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, provide a guaranteed source of income to participating services and given that many parents would otherwise not be able to avail of pre-school care and education for their children, the funding has ensured that many childcare services, both commercial and community, have the resources to continue to operate.  </p><p>  Despite the budgetary situation that prevailed in recent years the Government has maintained the funding necessary to support the childcare programmes and has introduced new initiatives to meet the changing circumstances, particularly in regard to the improved employment opportunities in the economy.  As funding becomes available, I would hope that the capitation rates for all programmes could be increased to provide further support.  </p><p>  Following concerns expressed by childcare providers throughout the country, the issue of commercial rates on pre-school services was raised with the previous Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the concerns of childcare providers in relation to commercial rates were brought to the attention of officials in the Department of  Public Expenditure and Reform.  Officials from my Department recently met with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of the Valuation Bill currently going through the Houses of the Oireachtas and discussed the issue of commercial rates on pre-school services. The Government has recently approved an amendment to the Bill to exempt not-for-profit childcare providers from rates.</p></reply>

A range of income supports are available to parents, both those who are unemployed and those on low incomes. The Department of Social Protection also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.<br/><br/><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014 - 2020 (BOBF),</i>which was published and launched by Government in 2014, provides the overarching framework for the development and implementation of policy and services for children and young people. As provided for in the framework, the Department of Social Protection  is the lead department on child poverty and has the lead responsibility for a specific commitment to a national child-specific social target to lift over 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level.<br/><br/>My Department is working on a number of initiatives which are relevant in addressing issues related to children poverty.  For example, it is leading the implementation of the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2016).  The ABC Programme is being co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The ABC Programme draws on best international practice to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched, and improve the outcomes for children and young people and existing services.<br/><br/>In terms of other provision, my Department is spending &euro;260 million annually on childcare support programmes which provide childcare to 100,000 children. A number of these programmes are targeted at those on lowest incomes. The CCS programme provides subvention support to parents on low incomes and parents in receipt of certain social welfare payments, whose children are enrolled in community childcare facilities. Additionally, the 3 Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) programmes - the Childcare Education and Training Programme, the Community Employment Childcare programme and the Afterschool Childcare Programme - provide childcare supports to eligible parents returning to work or to education.  <br/><br/>My Department also provides funding for targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people through three youth schemes.  The three programmes are Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund and Local Drugs Task Force Projects. In addition, national and regional youth work organisations are supported under my Department's Youth Service Grant Scheme. In 2014, current funding of &euro;49.78 million has been provided to my Department for these schemes. I am pleased to advise that Budget 2015 has confirmed that funding of &euro;49.78m will again be provided to my Department in 2015 to support the provision of youth services. There will be no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015 which is a key priorty for youth organisations.<br/><br/>With regard to the child welfare, the Child and Family Agency has a range of services from family support to child protection which aim to support children and families, and enable the Agency to fulfil its statutory responsibility regarding children&rsquo;s welfare and protection. Neglect can be associated with, but is not necessarily caused by poverty is a common reason for referral to child protection and welfare services.  All referrals to child protection and welfare services are reviewed in order to determine the most appropriate service response so that children and families achieve the best possible outcome.</p></reply>

It brought together child welfare and protection responsibilities formerly under the Health Service Executive, the functions of the Family Support Agency, and the functions of the National Educational Welfare Board.</p><p>  The Agency has a staff of 4,000 and its budget is just over &euro;600 million in the current year. Accordingly, in terms of the range of services provided directly by the Agency, a considerable amount of activity has been in consolidating, organisational changes to support the better delivery of service with a view to better outcomes for children.</p><p>  The Agency has statutory responsibility for the provision of psychology services to children and families.</p><p>  Psychology and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) for children are currently being provided by the HSE.</p><p>  The Agency and the HSE have in place both a Memorandum of Understanding and a Joint Protocol for inter-agency collaboration which underpins the provision of these services for children.</p><p>  The purpose of the Memorandum of Understanding is to set out the partnership agreement between the HSE and the Agency to continue pre-establishment levels of service across both organisations in accordance with the Health Service National Service Plan 2014, the Child and Family Agency Service Plan 2014 and Operational Plans 2014.  </p><p>  The objective of the Joint Protocol is to specify a pathway and associated responsibilities for children and families whose needs cross between Health Service Divisions and the Agency. </p><p>  Both the Memorandum of Understanding and the Joint Protocol are subject to regular monitoring and review to ensure that they are working effectively in the best interests of children and families.  Additionally, the Agency and the HSE are working to finalise a service level agreement to underpin the provision of psychological services by the HSE. The service level agreement with the HSE will determine the quantum of service needed to meet the Agency's requirements and will be an interim arrangement pending the Agency providing the service directly.</p><p>  The Task Force on the Child and Family Support Agency made recommendations regarding direct provision by the new agency of a range of other services relevant to children and families, which included child and adolescent mental health services.  </p><p>  The practical implications of the scale of on-going organisational change are such as to require that consideration of the Task Force's wider recommendations and their possible implementation would take place according to a less immediate timescale.  This will allow for more careful review and considerations in conjunction with relevant Departments, principally the Department of Health.</p></reply>

The new  programme required that pre-school leaders in childcare services delivering the free pre-school provision hold a Level 5 qualification or equivalent on the National Framework of Qualifications.</p><p>  Reforms across the childcare sector are being introduced by my Department under the Early Years Quality Agenda.  These reforms include the requirement that by September 2015 all staff working directly with children in the 0 to 6 years age category in early years services must hold a relevant Level 5 qualification or equivalent.</p><p>  In addition to the general requirement for a Level 5 qualification, pre-school leaders delivering the free pre-school provision under the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, who are currently required to hold a Level 5 qualification, will have to have a  Level 6 qualification, or equivalent, by September 2015. </p><p>  Last March, my Department introduced a Learner Fund to assist existing staff working  in the childcare sector to meet the new requirements.  This fund has a total allocation of &euro;3 million for the years 2014 and 2015 and is designed to subsidise the cost for childcare staff who are required to undertake accredited Level 5 and Level 6 courses. </p><p>  Ireland, like other European countries, does not provide for mandatory Continuing Professional Development for early years practitioners.  I would like to be in a position to provide for mandatory CPD and, while there is an emphasis on encouraging services to employ staff with higher qualifications, and the ECCE programme does provide for this by providing higher capitation payments to services with staff who hold Level 7 or higher qualifications, the immediate priority is to ensure that all childcare services meet the minimum qualification requirements. This will help to ensure higher standards and consistency of quality across the childcare sector.</p></reply>

These include services provided through Government Departments, other state agencies and an extensive network of non governmental organisations.  In the area of child welfare and protection services we now have, with the establishment this year of the Child and Family Agency, the necessary structure to ensure the provision of a more responsive and integrated service to children and young people at risk.  The Agency, in discharging its functions, is placing a strong emphasis on prevention, early intervention, family support, therapeutic and care interventions, all of which are key to the provision of integrated, multi-disciplinary services for vulnerable children and families. </p><p>  Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services services are currently being provided by arrangement with the Health Service Executive.  </p><p>  The Child and Family Agency and the HSE have in place both a Memorandum of Understanding and a Joint Protocol to underpin the provision of these services for children. The purpose of the Memorandum of Understanding and the Joint Protocol is to set out arrangements for collaborative working by the Agencies in order to ensure the provision of efficient, effective and proportionate services for children and families across the full range of health and social care services.  The arrangements also specify a pathway and associated responsibilities for children and families where their care needs cross the Child and Family Agency and the HSE. </p><p>  Both agreements are subject to regular monitoring and review to ensure that they are working effectively in the best interests of children and families. Additionally, the Agency and the HSE are working to finalise a service level agreement to underpin the provision of psychology services by the HSE.  This will determine the quantum of service needed to meet the Agency&rsquo;s requirements in this area, and will operate as an interim arrangement pending the Agency providing the service directly.   </p><p>  Separately, my Department chairs an Inter Departmental Group on the implementation of Children First.  This group works to ensure that all bodies working with children, including those with particular vulnerabilities, are aware of their responsibilities with regard to the welfare and protection of children and are provided with the necessary training and guidance to support them in this work.</p><p>  My Department has a range of systems in place to ensure it is informed of risk to children and the measures put in place to minimise these risks.  Monthly, quarterly and annual reports are received from the Child and Family Agency in respect of its functions, including detailed reporting on key performance indicators. Officials frequently meet with the Agency to review areas in need of improvement. There are also protocols in place for the Agency to inform the Minister and the Department of specific issues where risk is identified and to ensure that a robust management response is put in place.</p></reply>

In this context I believe the introduction of a second year would benefit children&rsquo;s educational and developmental outcomes.<br/><br/>The introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding, broadly in line with the cost of the current one-year provision, which is &euro;175 million per annum.  This additional funding is not currently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is operating.  In addition, all of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the pre-school provision is key to good outcomes for children.  The implementation of the actions contained in the Early Years Quality Agenda, which involves a range of actions in key areas aimed at improving quality within early years services and enhancing the regulatory regime, is a key building block for any further extension of universal childcare provision.<br/><br/><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures,</i>the national policy framework for children and young people 2014-2020, recognises the value of early childhood care and education in supporting children's early cognitive, social and emotional development, and the Government is committed to the introduction of a second free pre-school year within the lifetime of the framework once the required quality standards are achieved and subject to the availability of resources.

In the main, these emergency situations arise out of hours. </p><p>  At present, out of hours emergency services for children at risk in the greater Dublin area (Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow) are provided by the Child and Family Agency through the Crisis Intervention Service. The remit of the service is to respond to crisis situations in which a child or young person requires immediate placement either due to child protection or welfare concerns. This service is delivered by the Child and Family Agency social work service. </p><p>  Outside the greater Dublin area, an Emergency Place of Safety Service (EPSS) is provided for the Agency under a commercial arrangement with Five Rivers Ireland.  Under Section 12 of the Child Care Act, 1991, a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may remove a child to a place of safety where they have reasonable grounds for believing that there is an immediate risk to the welfare or safety of a child.  The child is placed in a family setting until the following working day, when the local social work service assumes responsibility for the case.  The objective is to build on the existing arrangements by ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can consult with a social worker out of hours. The service will be known as the Emergency Out of Hours Service.</p><p>  Provision for the development of this service was included in the Child and Family Agency Business Plan for 2014.

These issues include numbers and location of social workers, waiting lists, early intervention and family support, and statistical information.</p><p>  These issues, which are at the heart of the delivery of an efficient and effective child welfare and protection service, are the subject of on-going and regular contact between my officials and officials of the Child and Family Agency, both in the context of the development of that Agency&rsquo;s corporate and business plans, and in regular performance monitoring meetings.  The specific issues raised by Dr. Buckley will be considered in this context and in the broader context of cross government work, including her recommendation in relation to the provision of social work services to children and families in the sites where their difficulties emerge, such as schools and health services.  </p><p>  I note that Dr. Buckley commends developments in relation to community based prevention and partnership initiatives being established by the Child and Family Agency.  </p><p>  Dr. Buckley&rsquo;s submission also references the Children First Interdepartmental Group, and suggests that it should be established on a permanent basis.  The provisions of Part 4 of the Children First Bill 2014, published in April 2014, relate to the Children First Inter Departmental  Implementation Group.  Section 17 of the Bill provides for the establishment of the Group on a statutory basis and section 18 provides that all Government Departments will be represented on the Group.  The Group currently operates on an administrative basis, and Dr. Buckley&rsquo;s suggestions in relation to the establishment of child protection units in the HSE and in the education sector will be raised with that Group. </p><p>  Finally, I fully agree with Dr. Buckley in relation to her assessment of the significance of relevant adult services such as domestic violence, addiction and mental health services in the context of child welfare and protection, and the Children First Bill 2014 defines certain persons working in these services as mandated persons with an obligation to report abuse and to assist the Agency if requested to do so.</p></reply>

The Programme is a targeted intervention aimed at those school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. </p><p>  It involves 124 locally managed projects and related initiatives which operate across 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools. It provides targeted supports to some 36,000 children and young people. The Programme&rsquo;s design gives local communities the autonomy to devise innovative approaches to address the needs of young people most at risk of early school leaving. Typically, projects offer homework clubs; breakfast clubs; mentoring programmes; learning support; social and personal development programmes; out of school supports including music, art and sports and a range of activities during holiday periods.</p><p>  Since 1 January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to projects within the programme. In 2014, an allocation of &euro;24.756 million has been provided for the School Completion Programme.</p><p>  The estimate for the Agency for 2015 is &euro;635 million, a 4.3% increase on its 2014 allocation. My Department will issue a Performance Statement under Section 45 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013 in December. This will include my priorities for consideration in the development of the 2015 Business Plan. The Business Plan will set out the proposed activities, programmes and priorities for the Agency for 2015 in light of the monies available. </p><p>  A review of the School Completion Programme has commenced. It is an important initiative in relation to identifying the reforms necessary and planning for the future development of this Programme which is a key support to young people&rsquo;s participation in education. The review is being carried out by the ESRI following a procurement process managed by the Agency. The review will, inter alia, examine the School Completion Programme structures, and their fitness for purpose to support an integrated approach to address early school leaving. It will analyse the interventions provided and make recommendations for evidence informed supports designed to secure the best educational outcomes for young people. The programme has been in operation since 2002 and I believe that it is timely that a review be carried out.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed during the 2014/2015 academic year.</p></reply>

The schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme under which funding is made available on an annual basis to 31 national and major regional youth organisations. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drugs Task Force Projects and certain other programmes including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres. The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2014, funding of &euro;49.78m has been provided to my Department for these schemes. I am pleased to advise that Budget 2015 has confirmed that funding of &euro;49.78m will again be provided to my Department in 2015 to support the provision of youth services. There will be no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015 which was a key priority for youth organisations. My Department has commenced work on the detailed 2015 allocations for local projects and services and every effort will be made to notify youth organisations and youth projects of their 2015 allocations as soon as possible. </p><p>  In addition, I recently announced a capital funding scheme to provide grants towards the cost of refurbishments for youth projects, funded by my Department, in disadvantaged communities. This year, &euro;0.5m is available under the scheme. Further details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website &ndash; www.dcya.gov.ie.</p><p>  My Department has completed a Value for Money and Policy Review of the youth funding schemes that target disadvantaged young people. The review makes recommendations for the future operation of youth programmes that will shape their development in the years ahead to ensure quality, effective, value-for-money services that are evidence based and secure the best outcomes for young people. I intend that the recommendations of the review will be progressed in the context of the new National Youth Strategy that is being developed by my Department for the end of 2014. The Strategy will be a universal strategy for all young people, aged between 10 and 24 years, while having particular regard to those young people who are experiencing or at risk of experiencing the poorest outcomes and, therefore, in most need of support.   </p><p>  I, and officials of my Department have met, and continue to meet regularly, with youth organisations and groups, including those from disadvantaged areas throughout the country. My aim is to see how we can work together to bring about the best possible outcomes for young people, having regard to resources available to us and to ensure that the programmes and services being provided are relevant and responsive to young people&rsquo;s needs.</p></reply>

This is comprised of &euro;602 million in current funding and &euro;7 million in capital funding.  The overall level of funding available to the Agency, which is significant by any measurement, is designed to ensure that the Agency can provide a comprehensive and integrated service to children and families who require support. In Budget 2014, an additional sum of &euro;6.7 million was made available to support the Agency's reform of the child welfare and protection services. The level of expenditure to date by the Agency amounts to &euro;544m. </p><p>  Notwithstanding the additional resources provided and the prioritisation of these services by the Government, it is acknowledged that delivering the range of service required of the Agency, within this budget, is challenging as a result of demographic and social factors. This has been reflected most recently in a report prepared by the Agency, titled 'Measuring the Pressure' which shows, inter alia, that there has been a strong rise in demand for foster care and private residential care over the period.  Operational reforms are ongoing to achieve the most effective utilisation of existing resources. In addition, the Agency has been working to bring added controls in the area of legal services and continues to develop its approach to commissioning. My officials continue to review data on activity levels and performance on an ongoing basis as part of the performance management function of the Department. Specifically, my officials closely monitor the cash position of the Agency and are working with the Agency to determine an evidence based full year cash requirement. </p><p>  The matter of whether supplementary funding is required to meet the running costs of the Agency in 2014 is currently been discussed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as part of the ongoing budgetary discussions.  The initial figures do show cost overruns in a number of areas including private residential and fostercare which will be somewhat offset by savings in other areas.  As has already been referenced the Agency is in its first year of operation and is charged with managing its allocation of funding.  As discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform conclude a more informed position will emerge.</p></reply>

The Health Information and Quality Authority which was established under the Health Act 2007, is under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Health.  As the Deputy may also be aware, there is a recommendation in the Ryan Commission report that those sections of the Health Act 2007 which would extend the remit of HIQA in this way, should be commenced.  A Government decision in 2010 prioritised the inspection regime for child welfare and protection services and indicated that the timeline to extend HIQA's remit was to be the set out by the Minister for Health, in consultation with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.   </p><p>  I would be generally in favour of extending the remit of HIQA, subject to the satisfactory completion of these necessary steps for support its implementation.  There are a number of issues, including the drafting of regulations and HIQA national standards, that will require careful planning to ensure that the relevant functions and resources are transferred from the Agency to HIQA.  Ideally this would seek to achieve both efficiencies and a structure that underpins a robust inspection regime.  In the meantime, I have asked that the Agency take steps to improve the overall quality assurance of the registration, monitoring and inspection process of private residential child care centres, with a view to national consistency and to the publication of their inspection/registration reports.</p></reply>

Considerable progress has been achieved since this date, including the publication of the Inter-Departmental Group&rsquo;s Report, the announcement that Judge Yvonne Murphy will chair the Commission and an inclusive consultation process with stakeholders. </p><p>  The establishment of any statutory investigation is a significant undertaking. As I have advised the Deputy previouisly, the scale and sensitivity of the specific concerns relating to Mother and Baby Homes, as evident from the Inter-Departmental Report and submissions received from interested parties, simply demand that I take the necessary time for detailed consideration of these complex matters.  </p><p>  Although the necessity to provide the Commission with appropriate terms of reference may be generally accepted, the task of achieving the required precision should not be underestimated. Our collective desire to finalise these arrangements quickly must be balanced against the clear obligation to the mothers and children who were in these institutions to get this process right from the start.  Due care and attention at this formative stage should not be interpreted as anything else. </p><p>  I am confident that we are now approaching the conclusion of this deliberative process. My priority remains to establish a Commission which can deliver on public expectations in a realistic manner by establishing a full account of what happened in these Homes. Following discussions with colleagues across Government the work of developing the terms of reference is now well advanced. In addition, my Department is working with Judge Murphy to advance the operational arrangements and determine the resources required to support the Commission&rsquo;s work.  </p><p>  In parallel with this work I am consulting with a number of key stakeholders in order to update them on the emerging issues and to seek their further views. As I advised the Joint Oireachtas Committee last week, at least some of the issues being raised extend beyond the central focus on Mother and Baby Homes as debated in this House. However, I am confident that this inclusive approach will greatly assist to establish an effective inquiry which has the support of those most centrally involved.</p><p>  Following the finalisation of the terms of reference in the coming weeks it is my intention to bring the matter to Government as soon as possible thereafter.</p></reply>

These arose from proceedings taken by Mark McCrystal against the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, The Government of Ireland and the Attorney General.<br/><br/>The Court granted a declaration to the Plaintiff that the Respondents had acted wrongfully in expending or arranging to expend public moneys on a website, booklet and advertisements in relation to the Referendum, in a manner which was not fair, equal or impartial.<br/><br/>Arising from the Supreme Court ruling, my predecessor as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Frances Fitzgerald, issued a press statement in which she explained that in providing public information the Government had at all times acted in good faith.  The Minister stated that she fully respected the decision of the Supreme Court in relation to the expenditure on the public information provided by the Government in advance of the Referendum.  She made clear that the Government was now fully compliant with the Court's ruling.<br/><br/>A press statement was issued by the Government in connection with the subsequent Supreme Court judgment.  This noted that the Court had found that the Government at all times acted in a <i>bona fide</i>manner.  It stated the Government's commitment to working within the parameters of the judgment delivered by the Court in the conduct of future referendums.<br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that there are ongoing proceedings before the Supreme Court in relation to the provisional referendum certificate issued in connection with the referendum on the thirty-first amendment of the Constitution in respect of which a hearing is scheduled for early next month, with the judgment of the Court to follow in due course.<br/><br/>I do not support the Deputy's call.</p></reply>

They have received money to which they were not entitled.  Effective debt recovery is seen as an important measure to safeguard public expenditure.  Where someone has been overpaid social welfare, it is important that this money is recouped. </p><p>  I introduced legislation in 2012 in relation to the recovery of social welfare overpayments by way of weekly deductions from a person&rsquo;s ongoing social welfare entitlements.  This allows for a deduction of an amount up to 15% of the weekly personal rate payable to a customer for the purposes of the recovery of an overpayment without the customer&rsquo;s consent.</p><p>  The deduction of 15% applies to the person&rsquo;s personal rate only and does not affect payment of any adult or child dependent allowances, or any other allowances that are in payment.  It allows the person to retain 85% of their personal rate of payment.  In the circumstances where the person has been in receipt of money to which they were not entitled, this is considered to be reasonable.</p><p>  When deductions are being implemented from ongoing social welfare entitlements, the person is provided with the opportunity to put forward any circumstances that they feel may be relevant to the rate of recovery proposed.</p><p>  The introduction of this legislation means that the Department is now in a position to ensure that all debt-holders in receipt of a social welfare payment are repaying their debt.  </p><p>  In addition, the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 provided for the introduction of Notice of Attachment for the recovery of overpayments directly from earnings or monies held in financial institutions.  This significantly enhances my Department&rsquo;s ability to pursue overpayments from persons who are no longer in receipt of social welfare and who are not making reasonable efforts to repay their debt.</p></reply>

I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or in relation to the mortgage interest rates charged.  It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.  It is not appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on or become involved in the details of the accounts of mortgage holders.</p><p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations.  The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. </p><p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.  This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors, including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding. </p><p>  However, as part of the Central Bank's work on mortgage arrears, lenders were asked to consider all avenues to help customers in arrears, including interest rate reductions. </p><p>  My officials are in regular contact with the Central Bank on a range of prudential, regulatory and consumer related issues in the normal course of my Department's interaction with the Central Bank of Ireland.</p></reply>

Accordingly, it is not possible to forecast what the capital acquisitions tax yield is likely to be from the proposed changes. In any event, the changes being proposed to section 82 in Finance Bill 2014 are not for the purpose of raising tax revenue but to counter abuse of the provision.<br/><br/>In relation to the second question I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that information in relation to the number of persons who paid capital acquisitions tax each year is not directly available. However, the number of persons who filed capital acquisitions tax returns in the years 2011-2013 and to date in 2014 and who had a liability to capital acquisitions tax is as shown in the table.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>11,129</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>11,520</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>11,595</td></tr><tr><td>2014 (To-date) </td><td>11,776 (Provisional)</td></tr></table><br/><br/><br/><br/>It is not possible to provide a breakdown of capital acquisitions tax by asset class as the capital acquisitions tax returns do not require a breakdown of the tax due by asset type and there is, therefore, no reliable basis for compiling this information.<br/><br/>The total capital acquisitions tax paid on inheritances in each of the four years is as follows: <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>&euro; Million</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>213.5</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>254.3</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>257.5</td></tr><tr><td>2014 (To end October)</td><td>146.8 (Provisional)</td></tr></table><br/><br/>As regards the third question, there are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.<br/><br/><b>The Group A tax free threshold of &euro;225,000, </b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.<br/><br/><b>The Group B tax free threshold of &euro;30,150, </b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.<br/><br/><b>The Group C tax free threshold &euro;15,075, </b>applies in all other cases.<br/><br/>Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold. These thresholds have been reduced in recent years in order to maintain the yield from capital taxes,  as part of the effort to restore the public finances, as taxes on capital are less harmful from an economic perspective than taxes on employment.<br/><br/>The property market continues to improve with positive developments which had been restricted to the Dublin area now manifesting in other areas of the country though not to the same extent in terms of price rises. I recognize, of course, that there are supply issues in certain areas of the Dublin property market. <br/><br/>The Group tax-free thresholds are kept under review, in the same way as other relevant tax provisions, and in this regard I will bear the Deputy's comments in mind for the future.<br/><br/>In relation to the fourth question, CAT exemption for payments made by parents for the support or maintenance of dependent relatives (including children who are incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity) are dealt with separately under section 82 CATCA 2003 and this exemption applies provided the income of the dependent relative does not exceed approximately &euro;13,800 per annum.  However, to ensure that all children, regardless of age and income level, who are permanently incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity are exempt from tax under Section 82, I have tabled a Committee Stage amendment to the Finance Bill to provide specifically that payments for support, maintenance or education in relation to such incapacitated children will not be subject to an age restriction.<br/><br/>In relation to the final question, it would not be appropriate for me to instruct the Revenue Commissioners in relation to what information they should publish, as they are independent in the exercise of their functions. However, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they will publish a detailed statement on the application of Section 82 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003, once the Finance Bill is enacted.</p></reply>

This means that where both cohabitants pay tax at the higher rate, an additional &euro;2,000 of a cohabiting couple's income will be subject to income tax at 20% rather than at 40%, resulting in a potential increase in net take home pay of &euro;400 per annum.</p><p>  In relation to your specific query, a married one earner couple with two children, earning &euro;1,261.28 per fortnight, who is availing of the Homer Carers Tax Credit will pay &euro;136.58 per fortnight in income tax, USC and PRSI in 2015. In contrast, a cohabiting couple with a single income of the same amount, who also have two children, will pay &euro;231.19 per fortnight next year.  These calculations are based on the assumption that the married couple are jointly assessed for income tax purposes.</p></reply>

The EU Commission negotiates on behalf of the EU on matters falling within the common commercial policy on the basis of specific mandates from the EU Council of Ministers.  The mandate to negotiate with the United States on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) was adopted by the EU Council of Ministers on 14 June, 2013.  The text of the mandate is available on the EU Council&rsquo;s website: .  <br/><br/>Under the terms of the mandate and in accordance with Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the EU Commission is required to conduct the negotiations in consultation with the Council and to regularly report to the Council.  The EU Commission consults the member states through the EU Trade Policy Committee on all aspects of the negotiations. Officials from my Department represent Ireland on the relevant committees.  To this end, my Department co-ordinates the views of all the relevant Departments, in line with the usual inter-departmental co-ordination procedure in developing the Irish position on other EU matters.  I welcome all opportunities to discuss TTIP and to receive views of stakeholders.  Furthermore, I was very pleased to have been invited within the last year to have exchanges with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs Enterprise and Innovation and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs from which I received a written political contribution. <br/><br/>The purpose of the study commissioned by my Department is to examine the economic and other impacts of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and related potential opportunities for Ireland.  The focus of this study is to identify key areas and sectors of the economy that will be impacted by TTIP. <br/><br/>As well as helping to inform our input to the European Union&rsquo;s negotiating position, the study will help to inform the appropriate policy responses to be deployed to maximise the potential of this agreement and provide an assessment of the longer term implications for enterprise policy.<br/><br/>The Conference on TTIP that I hosted in Dublin Castle on 20 June, to which Oireachtas members from relevant Joint Committees were invited, heard some preliminary findings from Copenhagen Economics that indicate a comprehensive trade and investment deal between the EU and the US could lead to a 1.1% increase in Irish GDP. Other preliminary findings included benefits for Ireland including increased exports (2.7%), increased real wages (1.4%) and increased investment (1.6%). <br/><br/>I expect that Copenhagen Economics will complete its work in the next few months.  The budgeted cost of the study is &euro;215,000 (excluding VAT).</p></reply>

The costs detailed below cover the salary and related remuneration costs paid to Ministers&rsquo; Drivers (inclusive of Employers PRSI, Public Holiday Pay and Extra Attendance Payments) and the mileage and subsistence costs of Ministers and their drivers. <br/><br/>For the Deputy's information, my predecessor was provided with a Ministerial car and a Garda driver. The cost of the previous Ministerial transport scheme of Garda drivers and state cars were paid by the Department of Justice.<br/><br/>I would point out that it was estimated in 2011 that the saving to be achieved in not supplying State cars to Cabinet Ministers was of the order of &euro;4m per annum.  These estimates were based on the average cost of each State car including the cost of Garda drivers at &euro;280,000 per annum. In the case of Ministers using their own cars, including the cost of 2 civilian drivers, it was calculated that the cost was in the region of &euro;120,000 per annum per Minister. Following a review in 2012 it was found that the cost of the new system was lower than calculated and is in the order of an average of &euro;100,000 per annum. This represents a saving of 65% on the previous transport system in place prior to May 2011 and supports the view that in value for money terms, the new transport arrangements are more cost effective than the previous system.<br/><br/><b>Mr Batt O&rsquo; Keeffe</b><b>T.D.

The SMS has operated in Ireland since 1982 with the objective of promoting and encouraging the consumption of milk among school children. Its management is primarily through the National Dairy Council (NDC) in conjunction with the co-ops, but take-up is quite limited on a geographical level.  The Scheme provides for the payment of aid for milk products to school pupils and is co-financed by the EU and the MS, with my Department being the responsible Department in Ireland. The aid rates were reduced by approximately 7% per annum from 2004 to 2007 in line with the general reductions in support prices brought about by the 2003 Mid Term Review of the CAP. However, the Exchequer has made up for this reduction in the EU contribution, and the overall aid rates have been maintained at &euro;27.89/100kg. Since 2007 the EU contribution is &euro;18.15/100kg, with the balance of &euro;9.74/100kg made up by the Exchequer.<br/><br/>In terms of some of the figures requested by the Deputy, the table below sets out some of the key aggregates.

However I have on-going contact with Minister Noonan to ensure that tax policy reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture. Currently young farmers can avail of an enhanced income tax relief measure for 100% stock relief and a stamp duty relief on land transfers if they meet certain criteria, which include minimum agricultural qualifications levels. The recent Agri-taxation Review recommended that selected other tax measures should also be linked to qualifications. I am working closely with the Minister for Finance to ensure that this is reflected in the measures being introduced in the Finance Bill currently before the Oireachtas.</p><p>  The eligible qualifications are published as part of the relevant legislation that provides for these measures and only include qualifications awarded within the State. However, while Northern Ireland agricultural qualifications are not specifically included in the relevant tax legislation, this does not preclude farmers with those qualifications from qualifying for these tax reliefs. Provided that Teagasc certify that a qualification is equivalent to those published, those famers can avail of the tax measure.</p><p>  The new investment schemes under the Rural Development Programme 2014 &ndash; 2020 will provide for higher grant rates for certain qualified young farmers. The new direct payment scheme (the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015) will include a 25% top-up grant for qualified young farmers. Again, provided that Teagasc certify that a qualification is deemed equivalent to those eligible for the higher rates, those farmers can avail of these higher payments.</p></reply>

Following consultation with the EU Commission, as part of the normal Accounting process, my Department was requested to undertake a complete review of the LPIS database. This on-going review is of major significance as the Commission is seeking to disallow &euro;181m of funding to Ireland relating to payments over the past 5 years; this is currently the subject of an Irish appeal to the EU Conciliation Body. The Department was first made aware of this on 14 May 2014 in a written communication from the EU Commission.</p><p>  The European Commission has an obligation to ensure that Member States manage and use the EU funding granted to them in accordance with the very restrictive provisions governing the Direct Aid Schemes and general financial provisions. All of the lands, including commonages, declared by farmers must be eligible if these lands benefit from payment under one of more or these Schemes. The threatened disallowance relates to all payments in respect of ineligible areas and not just to payments on ineligible commonage areas.</p><p>  Under the Terms and Conditions of the Direct Aid Schemes, which includes the Single Payment Scheme, farmers are obliged to declare only eligible land when making their applications, and to exclude ineligible features such as roads, buildings, farmyards, dense scrub, etc. Furthermore, farmers are reminded that they should not declare for payment purposes land, which they are no longer farming. It is not sufficient to simply exclude the ineligible features from the declarations submitted; this is because land, which is no longer being farmed and/or is abandoned should also be excluded.   </p><p>  To ensure the eligibility of lands declared, farmers must maintain lands through normal farming practices such as cropping, cutting hay/silage or grazing by animals with an appropriate stocking rate to control invasive species. In the case of commonage lands farmers must therefore ensure that lands are kept adequately grazed in order to ensure that the commonage retains the area eligible for payment. </p><p>  Commonage lands form a significant area of the lands declared annually by some 14,936 farmers in Ireland for the purposes of claiming under the Direct Aid Schemes, with approximately 7% of the lands declared nationally being commonage lands.  </p><p>  However, due to reasons such as previous destocking requirements and the age profile of farmers on commonage lands, there is a growing risk of land abandonment on commonages as under-grazing becomes more of a problem.  It is, therefore, the case that the increasing ineligibility of these lands under the Single Payment Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes poses a significant risk to the State in view of the risk of financial corrections being imposed by the European Commission.</p><p>  In 2015, all farmers will be strongly urged to ensure that all of the land that they declare is eligible and is farmed by them. The entitlements established under the Basic Payment Scheme will be based on the eligible hectares declared in 2015. In order to protect their payments in the subsequent years, farmers should exclude all ineligible areas from their declarations. In that case, the newly established entitlements will be supported by land which is eligible for payment in order to draw down their full payment entitlement in 2015 and subsequent years.  This would also reduce the risk of further financial corrections in the future.</p></reply>

I have now agreed to a request to extend the deadline for receipt of submissions to 31 January, 2105. The consultation process gives individuals and groups an opportunity to contribute to the development of firearms policy and legislation and will enable consideration to be given to the future direction of such legislation.<br/><br/>The Garda Commissioner has made a decision, with Ministerial consent, to issue new Garda Guidelines on the Firearms Acts which exclude the former Annex F of the guidelines.  The interpretation of the previous Annex F had caused serious difficulties and confusion in regard to applications for firearm certificates for .22 calibre handguns and has resulted in over 30 Judicial Review applications to date. The Commissioner made this decision to issue new Guidelines, without Annex F, on foot of consultations with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office (AGO) and Counsel for the State regarding Judicial Review applications on the licensing of .22 calibre handguns. There have been no changes to either primary or secondary legislation as a result of amending these guidelines.  A more general revision of the Garda Guidelines will be carried out in light of the outcomes of the public consultation on the review of firearms licensing.<br/><br/>The amendment of the Guidelines has no implications in relation to the consultation process which I undertook to have in relation to the Review. I will not be making any final decisions until I have had a chance to consider all submissions which have been made.</p></reply>

One of the consequences of that decision was that the transport arrangements in place for Ministers of State became applicable to Government Ministers, subject to very limited exceptions on security grounds.  In addition, it was decided that former Presidents and Taoisigh would only be supplied with official transport for important State occasions. The revised transport arrangements came into operation for Government Ministers on 1st May 2011 and for former Office Holders on 16th June 2011.<br/><br/>Office Holder cars are currently placed at the disposal of the President, An Taoiseach, An T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Chief Justice and the Director of Public Prosecutions.<br/><br/>The Garda Commissioner is the Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote.  In that context, I am informed by the Garda authorities that records in relation to Office Holder transport have not been maintained in respect of individual Office Holders.  However, the Garda authorities have indicated that total expenditure on the provision of Office Holder transport in 2010, 2011, 2012 and  2013 was as outlined in the following table: <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Expenditure</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>&euro;7.503 million</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;4.595 million</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;2.201 million</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;2.160 million</td></tr></table><br/><br/><br/><br/>With regard to the table, some of the costs arising in 2011 included costs associated with the service prior to and after the new transport arrangements had been fully introduced.<br/><br/>No transport costs for Ministers of State have been paid by my Department in the period March 2011 to the end of 2013. Details in relation to transport costs for Ministers of State for the period 2010 to March 2011 are not readily to hand. I will contact the Deputy directly when this information is available.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-19a.254.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014111900069#WRE01500"><p>The Child Care Law Reporting Project (CCLRP) is an independent project established under Section 3 of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2007, in accordance with the Regulations made under that Act, with the support of the One Foundation, Atlantic Philanthropies and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. </p><p>  The aims and objectives of the project are to:</p><p>  - Provide information to the public on child care proceedings in the courts;</p><p>  - Conduct research on these proceedings in order to promote debate and inform policy-makers;</p><p>  - Make recommendations to address any short-comings in the child care system identified by the research;</p><p>  - Assist in the implementation of these recommendations;</p><p>  - Promote confidence in the child care system.</p><p>  The project will provide a measure of the effectiveness of current systems and policies in the area of child protection and that of court administration. Ultimately it will assist the Department in gaining a greater depth of knowledge and understanding of child care cases and it will increase the evidence base on which future policy formulation is based.</p><p>  The project pursues its aims and objectives by attending the courts where child care cases are heard in order to report on those proceedings while protecting the anonymity of the children and their families. The CCLRP publishes reports of child care cases for the public and all relevant stake-holders, collects and analyses data from the proceedings, publishes reports on the nature and outcomes of the child care proceedings and seeks to promote a public debate on the issues raised through seminars and conferences.</p><p>  Child care cases, heard mainly in the District Courts, involve applications by the Child and Family Agency for orders to protect children, including supervision orders, emergency and interim care orders and full care orders. Under supervision orders, families receive help and supervision from the Agency; under care orders, the child is placed on either an interim or more permanent basis in care. The cases are heard in camera in order to protect the privacy of the children and their families. There are rarely written judgments in the District Court.</p><p>  In the second interim report, published last month, it was noted that the project team record the main reason given in support of each application. Often more than one problem is present e.g. the parent may suffer from a disability and abuse alcohol or drugs or both, and the child may suffer both neglect and abuse but only one main reason is recorded. The highest single category, as recorded by the reporters, is parental disability (15%). While physical, mental and intellectual disabilities are not distinguished, the reporting team has observed that most of these parents had an intellectual disability or mental health difficulty and sometimes both.</p><p>  The second interim report also found that in over 70% of cases the parent, normally the mother, was parenting alone, either because she was single, following the breakdown of a relationship, or because the child&rsquo;s other parent was dead, in prison or missing. Drug or alcohol abuse or neglect were much more common reasons for seeking a care order in cases involving single parents than cases involving married parents. </p><p>  While the majority of the respondents in child care cases are Irish (70.4% in the second interim report), this is substantially less than the proportion of Irish-born people in the population as a whole. 7% of the respondents are European, the vast majority of whom come from Eastern Europe. The next largest category is &ldquo;mixed&rdquo;, meaning that at least one parent is not Irish. This category includes two or more non-Irish parents from different backgrounds as well as Irish and non-Irish parents. Almost 4% of the respondents are recorded as Irish Travellers.</p><p>  Overall, one in four child protection cases involve families where at least one parent is a member of an ethnic minority. However the author notes that this represents a very heterogeneous group and the issues that bring them to the child care courts vary widely and so there is no single approach that could reduce this proportion. This raises issues of the need for early involvement of appropriately trained family support workers with immigrant families and community leaders.</p><p>  The fact that such a high proportion of at-risk children come from ethnic minority communities highlights the need for cultural sensitivity, focused integration policies and cultural mediation services. The Child and Family Agency has introduced a training component for staff on cultural competence so that they may better understand the needs and diversity of the families concerned.</p><p>  The Child and Family Agency has advised that it brings cases to court solely on the basis of the evidence it has regarding the welfare and protection of children. All of the variations in child care applications and outcomes &ndash; regional, ethnic and in family status &ndash; that have been identified throughout the course of the project to date require further research to determine the reasons for the variations and to see how more targeted interventions can, where possible, ensure that the level of intervention is the most appropriate.</p></reply>

The collection and collation of data for this report is a matter specific to the research design adopted by Unicef with specific regard to the response to this multi-faceted issue.  I would like to outline the following:<br/><br/>Support for families who require income support to meet basic needs is provided through the social welfare system which is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Social Protection. A range of income supports are available to parents, both those who are unemployed and those on low incomes. The Department of Social Protection also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.<br/><br/><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014 - 2020,</i>which was published and launched by Government in 2014, provides the overarching framework for the development and implementation of policy and services for children and young people. As provided for in Better Outcomes, the Department of Social Protection which is the lead department on child poverty has the lead responsibility for a specific commitment to a national child-specific social target to lift over 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level.<br/><br/>My Department is working on a number of initiatives which are relevant in addressing issues related to children poverty. It is, for example, leading the implementation of the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2016).  The ABC Programme is being co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The ABC Programme draws on best international practice to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched, and improve the outcomes for children and young people and existing services.<br/><br/>In terms of other provision, my Department is spending &euro;260 million annually on childcare support programmes which provide childcare to 100,000 children. A number of these programmes are targeted at those on lowest incomes. The CCS programme provides subvention support to parents on low incomes and parents in receipt of certain social welfare payments, whose children are enrolled in community childcare facilities. Additionally, the 3 Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) programmes - the Childcare Education and Training Programme, the Community Employment Childcare programme and the Afterschool Childcare Programme - provide childcare supports to eligible parents returning to work or to education.  <br/><br/>My Department also provides funding for targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people through three schemes.  The three programmes are Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund and Local Drugs Task Force Projects. In addition, national and regional youth work organisations are supported under my Department's Youth Service Grant Scheme. In 2014, current funding of &euro;49.78 million has been provided to my Department for these schemes. I am pleased to advise that Budget 2015 has confirmed that funding of &euro;49.78m will again be provided to my Department in 2015 to support the provision of youth services. There will be no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015 which is a key priority for youth organisations.</p></reply>

These include services provided through Government Departments, other state agencies and an extensive network of non governmental organisations.  In the area of child welfare and protection services we now have, with the establishment this year of the Child and Family Agency, the necessary structure to ensure the provision of a more responsive and integrated service to children and young people at risk.  The Agency, in discharging its functions, is placing a strong emphasis on prevention, early intervention, family support, therapeutic and care interventions, all of which are key to the provision of integrated, multi-disciplinary services for vulnerable children and families. </p><p>  Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services services are currently being provided by arrangement with the Health Service Executive.  </p><p>  The Child and Family Agency and the HSE have in place both a Memorandum of Understanding and a Joint Protocol to underpin the provision of these services for children. The purpose of the Memorandum of Understanding and the Joint Protocol is to set out arrangements for collaborative working by the Agencies in order to ensure the provision of efficient, effective and proportionate services for children and families across the full range of health and social care services.  The arrangements also specify a pathway and associated responsibilities for children and families where their care needs cross the Child and Family Agency and the HSE. </p><p>  Both agreements are subject to regular monitoring and review to ensure that they are working effectively in the best interests of children and families. Additionally, the Agency and the HSE are working to finalise a service level agreement to underpin the provision of psychology services by the HSE.  This will determine the quantum of service needed to meet the Agency&rsquo;s requirements in this area, and will operate as an interim arrangement pending the Agency providing the service directly.   </p><p>  Separately, my Department chairs an Inter Departmental Group on the implementation of Children First.  This group works to ensure that all bodies working with children, including those with particular vulnerabilities, are aware of their responsibilities with regard to the welfare and protection of children and are provided with the necessary training and guidance to support them in this work.</p><p>  My Department has a range of systems in place to ensure it  is informed of risk to children and the measures put in place to minimise these risks.  Monthly, quarterly and annual reports are received from the Child and Family Agency in respect of its functions, including detailed reporting on key performance indicators. Officials frequently meet with the Agency to review areas in need of improvement. There are also protocols in place for the Agency to inform the Minister and the Department of specific issues where risk is identified and to ensure that a robust management response is put in place.  </p></reply>

It puts the everyday lives of children and young people at its centre and requires Government Departments and State agencies to work together in an integrated way along with non-government organisations to achieve better outcomes for children and young people.<br/><br/>Towards achieving this aim, we are working to address disadvantage, which can damage a child or young person&rsquo;s capacity to learn, grow, and have a healthy life and productive relationships. For the children and young people that need additional support, we need to identify them and intervene early. This requires good quality universal systems open to all, like our schools and primary healthcare services, backed up by additional targeted services and income supports to give &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; or vulnerable children and young people the extra help they need to keep up with their peers and lift more children out of poverty, aiming to break the cycle of intergenerational disadvantage.<br/><br/>While my Department has overall responsibility for the framework, individual Departments will continue to take lead roles on matters within their remit; for example, the Department of Education and Skills have lead responsibility for issues concerning educational disadvantage, the Department of Social Protection has lead responsibility for addressing child poverty. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has lead responsibility for a range of funding schemes which target disadvantage across the areas of services and supports for children and young people.<br/><br/><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures </i>recognises that disadvantage impacts on children and young people in both rural and urban areas. This can result in difficulties in accessing services, as well as a risk of isolation and lack of economic opportunity.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve, approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country. In 2014, funding of &euro;49.78m has been provided to my Department for these schemes.</p><p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that Budget 2015 has confirmed that funding of &euro;49.78m will again be provided to my Department in 2015 to support the provision of youth services. There will be no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015 which was a key priority for youth organisations. My Department has commenced work on the detailed allocations for youth services and projects in 2015. Every effort will be made to notify youth organisations and projects of their 2015 allocations in respect of their youth services as soon as possible. </p><p>  Ongoing engagement and dialogue with the youth sector organisations and with young people themselves are priorities in the formulation of policies and provision of services to support young people&rsquo;s development and learning. </p><p>  The youth sector is engaged in the development, by my Department, of the new National Youth Strategy 2014- 2020.  The strategy will be a universal strategy for all young people, aged 10 to 24 years, while having particular regard to those young people who are experiencing or at risk of experiencing the poorest outcomes and, therefore, in most need of support.  In consultation with the National Youth York Advisory Committee, my Department has set up  a National Youth Strategy Task Group to oversee the development of the new strategy.  The Task Group, which meets regularly, is chaired by the Director of the National Youth Council of Ireland and comprises representatives from the youth sector, Government departments, Education and Training Boards, the Centre for Effective Services and the business community.  It is anticipated that the new National Youth Strategy will be completed by my Department for the end of 2014.</p><p>   I, and officials of my Department have met, and continue to meet regularly, with youth organisations and groups.  I met with the representatives of some 30 national and major regional youth organisations over 2 days in September. My aim is to see how we can work together to bring about the best possible outcomes for young people, having regard to resources available to us and to ensure that the programmes and services being provided are relevant and responsive to young people&rsquo;s needs.</p></reply>

The Agency operates a number of services including family support, foster care and residential care services.  These services are primarily demand led so there is no fixed capacity in terms of the places available to care for children.  As of 31 August 2014 there were 6,489 children in care and some 93% of these children are in family based foster care placements.  The guidelines in Children First set out a clear pathway for concerned persons to inform the Agency of care and welfare issues involving a child and their family.  This reporting role is a general responsibility and a report can be made by the parents, guardians, schools, Garda&iacute; or any person with information on a child needing care.  An initial assessment is carried out in each case that is reported to determine if the child requires the services of the Agency and, where appropriate, engage with the parents and wider family and close family friends.  The Agency also provides an aftercare service for those in care on their 18th birthday and there are a number of supports for those leaving care, particularly where they are in full time education.  My Department is working with the Agency to progress and develop the range and quality of service provision with a view to improving consistency of provision across the country of child protection and welfare services, including aftercare.  </p><p>  The Agency publishes a range of reports on performance indicators on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis which is used to monitor activity, for example data on referrals and assessment processes, at national level, broken down by administrative regions and local areas.  An annual review of the data provides additional information on age, social deprivation and ethnicity.  The annual service planning process is informed by the monitoring and performance data from each administrative area.</p></reply>

The framework gives appropriate priority to the importance of physical and mental wellbeing with a single national outcome focussed on &quot;Active and Healthy&quot;. The key Departmental Sponsor for this Outcome area is the Department of Health. Under this outcome, 15 key commitments are listed, each with a lead Department responsible for implementation. These commitments aim to reduce the risk factors and improve the resilience factors associated with the health and wellbeing of children and young people. My Department works closely with the Department of Health, the HSE and other relevant departments and agencies to progress these issues. My Department has both sponsored studies in this area and collated relevant evidence from other studies to learn more about the issues most likely to impact on the health and wellbeing of children.<br/><br/>The responsibility for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) lies with the HSE and policy for these is outlined in the Department of Health&rsquo;s, &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy.<br/><br/>The Child and Family Agency has a key role including in relation to supporting some of the most vulnerable children and young people in State care. My Department has introduced reforms aimed at enhancing management and service provision for therapeutic services for children in detention and residential care. These include the establishment of the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service, a new integrated clinical team known as the ACTS team, that will liaise closely with CAMHS and other relevant services.<br/><br/>One of the main challenges in the area of physical well being is childhood obesity. In the latter part of 2013, in my role then as the Minister of Health, I jointly launched with my predecessor, Minister Fitzgerald, a three year media and social media campaign aimed at giving practical tips to parents on managing their children&rsquo;s weight.<br/><br/>As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I have responsibility for Play and Recreation Policy which have been set out in the policy documents, &lsquo;<font color="#2F2F2F">READY, STEADY, PLAY! A National Play Policy&rsquo; and  the &lsquo;Teenspace, National Recreation Policy for Young People&rsquo;. The Local Authority Play and Recreation Network (LAPRN)</font><font color="#2F2F2F">was established to introduce a more coordinated and interagency approach to achieving the main goals of the play and recreation policies at both national and local level. Targeted grants are provided to Local Authorities by my Department to encourage participation across the Local Authority network. Other initiatives being developed at local community level are designed to encourage awareness of the importance of play and recreation throughout the whole of life from early childhood to adulthood and through to later life. </font><br/><br/>Additionally, my Department administers funding schemes and programmes to support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people which involves approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  I am pleased that Budget 2015 has confirmed that funding of &euro;49.78m will again be provided to my Department in 2015 to support the provision of youth services. Many of the youth services operate with young people&rsquo;s physical and mental well-being as the central pillar of their services and programmes. The Youth Work Sector has particular expertise in working with young people and provides non-formal and informal learning opportunities to support their physical and mental well-being. The National Youth Health Programme is a partnership operated by the National Youth Council of Ireland with the Youth Affairs Unit of my Department and the Health Promotion Unit of the HSE respectively. The Programme aims to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion/education support and training service including making healthy choices in relation to alcohol, to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in the non-formal education setting.</p></reply>

Dublin.  </p><p>  As prescribed under Section 158 of the Children Act 2001, as amended, the principal object of the children detention schools is to provide appropriate education, training and other programmes and facilities for children referred to them by the courts.  The delivery of children detention services is focused on education and rehabilitation of those young people detained in order to address offending behaviour and support their early re-integration into the community.  The development project which is currently nearing completion on the Oberstown campus to increase capacity and enable the extension of the child care model of detention to all children under the age of 18 also includes the provision of new education and recreation facilities as well as dedicated visiting facilities and a medical facility.  Along with the existing services already being provided these new facilities will ensure sufficient age and ability appropriate facilities to support the delivery, by the Dublin and Dun Laoghaire Education and Training Board (DDLETB), of the necessary and vital education services to young people in detention.  </p><p>  An individual management plan is put in place for each child on admission to the children detention schools which includes an assessment using a mental health screening tool to determine the need for more specialist assessment or intervention from specialists within the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS).  This is a national service provided by the Child and Family Agency that provides clinical services to children in detention and in special care, as well as short term interventions when the child returns to the community.  </p><p>  The Deputy should note that earlier community based interventions to divert young people from offending behaviour, such as the Garda Youth Diversion Projects and the Garda Diversion Programme, which aim to engage young people in a process of learning and development that enables them to make positive lifestyle choices are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

There are now 61 CAMHS teams in place, compared to 54 in 2008.  The additional funding in 2012-14 is being used, in part to expand and enhance the skill mix of these teams.  Around 230 new posts were allocated to CAMHS over 2012-13 and recruitment is well advanced.  All Community Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) teams screen referrals received and those deemed to be urgent are seen as a priority, while those deemed routine are placed on a waiting list.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable. It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need. Patients with the greatest level of need, i.e. Grade 5 or Grade 4 are provided with treatment by the HSE. <br/><br/>Information on waiting times is collated by the HSE by region and for the intervals as shown below only.

According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, methadone is the most commonly prescribed substitution treatment for problem opiate use in Europe.  In conjunction with other services and supports such as counselling, after-care and training, methadone maintenance treatment provides a pathway to recovery for the individual affected by problem substance use.  </p><p>  An Expert Group, set up by my Department in 2006, examined the regulatory framework required to facilitate the prescribing, dispensing and supply of buprenorphine/naloxone and buprenorphine-only products as alternatives to methadone.  In 2011, this Group concluded that methadone is the drug of first choice in the treatment of opioid dependency, but that buprenorphine/naloxone may be more appropriate for particular cohorts of clients.   </p><p>  The HSE has established an Opioid Substitution Implementation Group to develop a plan for facilitating the wider availability of buprenorphine/naloxone and buprenorphine-only products as alternatives to methadone.  The Group comprises representations from the HSE and my Department, including medical professionals with specific interest in addiction.  I understand that the HSE is currently in discussions with the supplier company in relation to the pricing structure relating to the product.  The outcome of these discussions will inform the recommendations of the Group.</p></reply>

Government has agreed that the Scheme will also include payments for the small number of women who have had a pubiotomy. The Scheme is designed to be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial, and aims to minimise the stress for the women concerned. Many are elderly and may not want to experience the delay, publicity and financial risks that sometimes come with a court case.  I  met all three support groups representing the women last September and their views have helped to shape the Scheme. The Scheme is supported by two of the three groups representing the women.</p><p>  Judge Maureen Harding Clark, retired High Court Judge has been appointed as independent Assessor to the Scheme. Judge Clark, from her previous work on the Lourdes Hospital Redress Scheme, brings valuable experience to the role of determining the appropriate level of award for each individual.   </p><p>  The Symphysiotomy Scheme is open to women who are still living and who underwent a surgical symphysiotomy or pubiotomy in the State between the years 1940 and 1990. Awards of &euro;50,000, &euro;100,000 and &euro;150,000 will be offered. Women who have had a surgical symphysiotomy may accept an award of &euro;50,000.  For women who have had a symphysiotomy and have suffered significant disability a higher award of &euro;100,000 will be offered.  Where a woman has had a symphysiotomy immediately following caesarean section an award of &euro;100,000 will be offered and where she has suffered significant disability following these procedures &euro;150,000 will be offered. For a woman who underwent a pubiotomy an award of &euro;100,000 will be offered and for women who have suffered significant disability following this procedure, &euro;150,000 will be offered. Details of the Terms of the Scheme and how to access application forms have been widely advertised.</p><p>  Awards will be exempt from tax and legislation is being put in place as a matter of urgency to ensure they are also exempt from being taken into consideration for means tested welfare schemes. The Judge expects to make payments to some women before Christmas.</p><p>  It is not a requirement for a woman to retain a Solicitor to make an application.  However, the Scheme makes provision for applicants to have legal and other advice available to them in preparing to submit an application if they wish.  Judge Clark has assured me that if women have questions on any aspect of the Scheme, her staff will be available to assist in any way possible.</p><p>  Applications must be made within 20 working days of the Commencement Date, which was 10 November, 2014.  The Closing Date for receipt of applications is therefore Friday 5 December 2014.  In exceptional circumstances, Judge Clark has discretion to extend the time for receipt of applications by an additional 20 working days, that is, to Wednesday, 14 January 2015.  It is important to note that in the event of a delay arising in the compilation of an applicant's supporting documentation due to difficulty in obtaining medical records, the application should be submitted within the time period set out in the Scheme with a written explanation of the reasons for the absence of the documentation. The details of this provision are set out in the terms and conditions of the Scheme. </p><p>  The Scheme is voluntary and I would like to emphasise that women will not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a precondition to participating in the Scheme. Women may opt out of the Scheme at any stage in the process, up to the time of accepting their award.  It is only on accepting the offer of an award that a woman must agree to discontinue her legal proceedings against any party arising out of a symphysiotomy or pubiotomy.</p><p>  In agreeing to this Scheme, the Government has demonstrated its commitment to trying to bring a resolution for the women concerned. The Government has acknowledged the pain and suffering which the procedure caused to many of the women and is also aware of the uphill battle many of them will face in the courts with uncertainty about the outcome of that process.  I hope the implementation of this Scheme will be of benefit to the women concerned and their families.</p></reply>

Where children have significant care needs whereby they may need additional support to be able to attend school, the NCSE may make an allocation of SNA support to the school to assist that child.</p><p>  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014, which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.</p><p>  All schools were asked to apply to the NCSE for SNA support for the 2014/15 school year by 26 March 2014. The NCSE published details of their allocations for SNA support for the 2014/15 school year in June 2014. The NCSE has recently completed a second round allocations for SNA provision for the 2014/15 school year, details of which are available on the NCSE website, www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>  Should a school wish to make an application for additional SNA support for a child who was not previously considered for SNA support, or who is due to enrol to a school, they may do so to the NCSE. Schools who wish to appeal the level of SNA allocation which has been made to them may do so via the appeals process which is set out at www.ncse.ie. </p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

In this way principals have discretion to balance guidance needs with the pressures to provide subject choice. My Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations. All 195 second-level school in DEIS have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools (23:1 in fee-charging schools).</p><p>  Guidance and counselling are a whole-school responsibility, with guidance counsellors playing their part within an overall team approach. The representative organisations for school principals and school management have developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation. Wherever possible, group work and class-based activity should be used to maximise the amount of time available for those pupils who are most in need of one-to-one support.</p><p>  In February my Department published a guide to developing student support teams in post-primary schools. This is an important resource for schools in promoting and protecting students' well-being and an aid to establishing a team or reviewing an existing team.</p><p>  Guidance counsellors have two distinct functions. The first is general career guidance and guidance on the educational opportunities a child or young person might pursue, while the second involves support for students' well-being. The principal and leadership of a school have the best knowledge and experience to determine how exactly guidance resources and teaching resources should be allocated.</p></reply>

These posts continue to be replaced in the normal manner. The impact of the moratorium was therefore limited to the Assistant Principal and Special Duties posts of responsibility.</p><p>  The alleviation arrangements are set out in Circular 0004/2014 which provide a floor by which schools acutely affected at AP level by the impact of the moratorium can fill their AP vacancies as they arise to the level of the thresholds set out in that circular. It continues to be a matter for each individual school authority to re-organise and prioritise the appropriate duties for post of responsibility holders in the context of implementing the moratorium.</p><p>  School leaders have a key role to play in determining the shape of our schools and student outcomes. Leading on curricular change and change management are key challenges for every school leader. The challenge for schools and the Department is therefore to build a leadership partnership that is fit for 21st century Ireland and school context.</p><p>  Economic constraints and the moratorium on recruitment, albeit alleviated to some extent for schools, have presented challenges within the education sector. They also provide an opportunity to review the role of the principal so that our principals are leaders of learning, and to reconfigure the middle management structure to support principals in their role, ensuring ownership of responsibility rather than tasks, thereby building expertise and supporting a career path within the profession.</p><p>  The Department, in consultation with the representative bodies, the IPPN and NAPD has commenced an exploration of the opportunities to support and thereby advance our understanding of the needs of school leaders and how they might be addressed.</p></reply>

This report, entitled <i>Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields</i>, which considered issues such as digital signals, microwaves and mobile phone masts, is available for download on my Department&rsquo;s website at:.<br/><br/>The Expert Group reported that the majority scientific opinion was that no adverse short- or long-term effects have been demonstrated from exposure to electromagnetic fields at levels below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). Extensive international research on the issue continues to be co-ordinated through bodies such as the World Health Organisation.<br/><br/>A substantial volume of research on this issue is being carried out internationally by bodies with responsibilities for monitoring the health effects of electromagnetic fields, including the European Commission&rsquo;s Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR).  This Committee recently published a <i>Preliminary Opinion on Potential Health Effects of Exposure to Electromagnetic Fields</i>, updating its previous opinions from 2009 and taking account of the many studies undertaken in the intervening years.  The Report can be found at the following weblink: ().<br/><br/>The findings of this research are being monitored by the WHO&rsquo;s EMF Project; it is expected that a report will issue from the WHO in 2015. My Department, via its Air Quality &amp;amp; Environmental Radiation Policy Section, continue to monitor this and other scientific evidence as it is made available and will consider any policy implications in this context.<br/><br/>My Department recently commissioned a study on international developments in non-ionising radiation (NIR) and electromagnetic fields (EMF) research since publication of the 2007 Report. The study is also examining how the issue of NIR/EMF is dealt with in other jurisdictions and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. The results of this study will be used by a Steering Committee, convened and chaired by my Department, to consider and make specific proposals relating to the future management of these matters including, <i>inter alia</i>, any consequent legislative amendments and provisions.</p></reply>

I understand that Irish Water is committed to reusing previously installed meter boxes where possible. Irish Water&rsquo;s contractors examine each case of a pre-existing meter box to establish if existing meter boxes can be reused. To date, in excess of 50,000 meter boxes have been reused nationwide.  However, in this instance it was not possible to reuse the pre-existing boxes as they were flooded with water and therefore were unsuitable to have a meter installed.</p><p>  Since assuming responsibility for the public water and waste water infrastructure Irish Water require that all meter boxes installed on the network be sealed to prevent this issue from arising.</p><p>  The occurrence of pre-existing domestic water meters is rare as domestic water users have not been metered or billed for their usage outside of Group Water Schemes and some mixed use premises. The domestic meters being installed by Irish Water have to be compatible with the meter reading and billing systems technology of Irish Water. However, in the case being stated here, this issue of the removal of water meters did not arise as there were no meters installed in the pre-existing meter boxes.</p></reply>

Firstly, each participating local authority will provide a list of all estates in its functional area where developer-provided water services infrastructure is present, along with more detailed information regarding the particular development and the water or wastewater treatment systems serving the development.  The second element of the project will involve selecting a sample number of the developments listed for more detailed technical investigation. This will provide valuable information regarding the nature and condition of the water or waste water infrastructure present and will make recommendations as to how best to engineer solutions.</p><p>  The information regarding a representative sample of developments will ultimately inform the evolution of a national policy regarding the taking-in-charge by local authorities of developments with developer provided water services infrastructure present and, where appropriate, the connection of the infrastructure to Irish Water.  The issues of funding and of establishing a timeframe for the remediation of the problems which exist across the country will be addressed based on the outputs from the project.</p></reply>

There is no separate allocation for the LIS.  Instead, local authorities may use up to 15% (up from 7% in 2013) of their initial Discretionary Grant towards local improvement schemes should they wish to do so. The local contribution for these schemes remains at 20% of the total cost of the project.</p><p>  Details of the 2014 regional and local roads grants were communicated to local authorities on 24 January this year. Furthermore, it is open to local authorities to supplement the percentage of their Discretionary Grant that they can use for the LIS with their own resources.</p><p>  The above position is likely to extend into 2015. Some local authorities want a ring-fenced LIS allocation for private roads while others prefer to put the funding into public roads. I think this decision is best made at a local level.</p></reply>

There are over 14,000 registered boat owners on the seven waterways managed by Waterways Ireland. These waterways make a vital contribution to tourism, attracting visitors from Ireland and abroad.<br/><br/>The proposed new bye-laws are intended to enhance the ability of Waterways Ireland to manage the Royal and Grand Canals and the Barrow Navigation for the benefit of all canal users. Investment by Waterways Ireland in these waterways has made them more attractive for boat owners and is helping to develop them as a vibrant recreational and tourist amenity. Against that background, it is now necessary to update the bye-laws to ensure that the rules governing the use of the waterways are fit for purpose and can best meet the needs of all waterway users.<br/><br/>I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding aspects of the proposed bye-laws. Waterways Ireland undertook a public consultation process in relation to the proposed bye-laws earlier this year. I am advised that the main stakeholders, including the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland, the Heritage Boat Association, the Royal Canal Amenity Group and the Irish Boat Rental Association, were contacted individually and invited to meet with the Chief Executive and the senior management team of Waterways Ireland prior to submitting their views. The current permit holders on the three waterways concerned, including traditional canal users and canal dwellers, received individual written notices and were given the opportunity to make their views and requirements known.<br/><br/>I understand that over 2,000 submissions were made in the course of the public consultation process. I have been advised that analysis of this process has been completed by Waterways Ireland and is available on the Waterways Ireland website at , together with the submissions received. Waterways Ireland has submitted a revised set of draft bye-laws to my Department, which is currently being reviewed. When that process has been concluded, the matter will be referred to me, as Minister, with recommendations for consideration and final decision. In line with a commitment given during a debate in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 26 February 2014, I will provide interested Deputies and Senators with an opportunity to discuss the proposals with me prior to making a final decision on the draft bye-laws.</p></reply>
