    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-12a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061200046#WRA00600"><p>The EU has set a goal of reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions by 80-95% below 1990 levels by 2050. Under the Government&rsquo;s planned Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill, which was recently published, those sectors of the economy with significant carbon emissions are required to produce plans to lower these emissions. The Bill and the associated National Policy Position, which were recently published, envisage Ireland aiming to achieve at least an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions in aggregate across the electricity generation, transport and built environment sectors by 2050. A National Low Carbon Roadmap for how these reductions will be achieved will be approved by Government and published in 2014. Achieving such a reduction in CO2 emissions will be very difficult. The Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s most recent report on greenhouse gas emissions projections shows that there is significant risk, even under the best case scenario, that Ireland will not meet its 2020 targets and that we face considerable challenges to becoming a low carbon economy.   Late last year I published a scoping report on a low carbon roadmap for the electricity generation sector and undertook a public consultation on the matter. Over the coming months my Department will continue to work on evaluating options that can lower emissions from electricity generation while maintaining economic competitiveness and ensuring that everyone can afford to heat and power their homes.</p><p>  The first milestone towards achieving a low carbon economy by 2050 is the delivery of the 2020 targets set by the EU and the corresponding national targets. Ireland has a requirement to achieve a binding target of 16% of energy demand coming from renewable sources. Currently, over 7% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy now comes from renewables and this includes 20% of electricity demand. </p><p>  Ireland has also set a challenging target of delivering 20% energy efficiency savings by 2020, with a 33% target for the public sector. This will reduce our CO2 emissions by approximately 5.7 million tonnes, saving some &euro;1.6 billion per annum in avoided energy costs. The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan sets out in detail the actions that will be taken to achieve this goal.</p><p>  Negotiations are now getting underway on the Climate and Energy Framework 2030 published by the European Commission in January of this year. The current EU proposals foresee a reduction of 40% Greenhouse Gas emissions and an increase in renewable energy to 27% across the EU. While Ireland is supportive of a high level of ambition, our contribution must be based on an approach that is equitable, cost efficient and technically feasible.   </p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s position at the Atlantic edge of Europe provides an unparalleled offshore energy resource, with suitable conditions available for the development of the full range of current offshore renewable energy technologies. The offshore renewable energy sector has been consistently identified in recent years as a potential source of sustainable employment and economic growth, especially in those coastal communities where job creation is particularly challenging. The Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP), which I published earlier this year, identified export as the optimal path to market for offshore wind projects. Such export would require an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA). However, the economic, policy and regulatory complexities involved, and some key decisions required to be taken by the UK to facilitate any IGA, mean that post-2020 delivery is more realistic given project lead times.    By way of context to this longer time horizon, earlier this year the European Commission published proposals for a 2030 Climate and Energy Framework. As we now look towards 2030, and consider Europe's trajectory for achieving a low carbon economy by 2050, opportunities to develop renewable energy technologies &ndash; such as offshore wind &ndash; and greater cross border trade in renewable energy, are likely to present over the coming years. </p><p>  In addition, the Communication on Blue Energy, recently published by the European Commission, estimates the ocean energy sector could create tens of thousands of jobs over the medium to longer term. The Communication also identified the Atlantic seaboard as the area of highest potential for the development of ocean energy in the EU. </p><p>  Finally, it should be noted that the progression of an individual project is, in the first instance, a matter between the project developer and the relevant planning authority having regard to the overarching policy and regulatory framework, including the findings of the Strategic Environmental Assessment which underpins the OREDP. Given that I have no planning function in this matter, I have not received any report or communication concerning the specific project mentioned by the Deputy.   </p></reply>

My Department, working closely with IFI, is completing a comprehensive review of the current legislation dating back to 1959 to consolidate, update and amend existing legislation which governs the conservation, protection, management and development of the inland fisheries and sea angling resources. </p><p>  This review presents a unique opportunity to create a new and better way to manage the resource. My aim is to obtain a wide and meaningful engagement with all stakeholders in an open and transparent process and I have organised and attended a series of public information and consultation meetings in this regard. It is my intention that further comprehensive stakeholder consultation will also take place prior to any finalisation of the proposed Inland Fisheries Bill. </p></reply>

Set against the backdrop of the three energy pillars of ensuring security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness, and the further need to stimulate economic growth, the Paper focuses on a number of key themes. The six priority themes are: empowering energy citizens; markets, regulation and prices; planning and implementing essential energy infrastructure; ensuring a balanced and secure energy mix; putting the energy system on a sustainable pathway; and driving economic opportunity.The process includes a full public consultation and a targeted stakeholder consultation on the priority areas. The public consultation runs to 31 July and I would urge all stakeholders, including members of the public, to engage with the consultation. In analysing options for increased use of renewable energy as we approach 2020 and look to 2030 and beyond, we need to ensure our ambition is both sustainable, and economically and technically feasible. Analysis is being undertaken by my Department, the SEAI, EirGrid and the CER to further assess the costs and benefits associated with achieving 40% renewable electricity generation in 2020, compared to a scenario where renewable electricity remains at 2013 levels. This ongoing analysis will inform a report to be published shortly, and builds on existing work in this area. For example, the recently published SEAI report on <i>Quantifying Ireland&rsquo;s Fuel and CO2 Emissions Savings from Renewable Electricity in 2012 </i>found that the value of the fossil fuels not consumed in the Republic of Ireland in 2012 as a result of renewable electricity generation is estimated at &euro;245 million, with the value of avoided CO2 emissions being a further &euro;15 million. </p><p>Separately, work is also ongoing within my Department to prepare a policy and development framework for renewable electricity. The scoping for the associated Strategic Environmental Assessment which will underpin the framework is currently being prepared, taking into account the Stage 1 consultation responses and will be published as part of the Stage 2 consultation in the near future. The policy and development framework will focus on potential projects of significant scale, and its preparation will involve three phases of public consultation in total.</p></reply>

In January 2014, the European Commission decided to refer the transposition of Directive 2009/28/EC on Renewable Energy to the European Court of Justice, proposing a daily fine of &euro;25,447, to be effective from the date of the judgement of the Court. Ireland has transposed the bulk of this Directive and is committed to having the remaining provisions fully transposed as early as possible in 2014 and to have this fully completed well in advance of any hearing in the European Court, which should fully resolve the matter.   In May 2014 the European Commission commenced proceedings relating to the transposition of Directive 2009/72/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity, and proposed a daily of &euro;20,358 and costs. In view of the complexity of the Directive, and the detailed correspondence engaged in to date, my Department has sought legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General and will await such a legal examination of the case stated, before deciding the next steps.</p><p>  Directive 2009/31/EC provides for the regulation of the storage of carbon dioxide in geological structures and provides under Article 4.1 that any Member State may exercise the right not to allow the geological storage of CO2 in its territory. Ireland, and a number of EU member States exercised this option, but the Commission considered this as only partially satisfying the requirements of the directive. My Department, the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office have prepared a further Statutory Instrument addressing the two outstanding articles and this is currently in the process of being signed off by both Ministers. This will ensure full transposition of the Directive.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-12a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061200046#WRA01900"><p>The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan and the Programme for Government include a commitment to roll out a Better Energy Financing energy retrofit scheme (formerly known as Pay-As-You-Save) for domestic buildings. The key benefit to homeowners of the Better Energy Financing (BEF) mechanism is that it will allow them to secure upfront financing for energy efficiency upgrades to their homes. In designing the new mechanism, my Department worked with SEAI under the direction of a Project Board representing State and industry stakeholders. As well as accessing expert technical, legal and financial advice, detailed analysis of similar schemes in other jurisdictions was undertaken and a public consultation was also carried out. The SEAI will now be tasked with drawing up a detailed implementation plan for the design, development and execution of the Better Energy Financing scheme, which I anticipate will lead to a number of elements of the scheme being piloted later this year.    There are a number of reasons for the revision of the Pay-As-You-Save model principally that homeowners are reluctant to take on new loan products when deleveraging is the common practice. This is in keeping with the international experience as is the additional difficulty in attracting applicants beyond the cohort of early adopters. Experience has also shown that the Pay-As-You-Save Model would not deliver savings adequate to meet the cost of Retrofit as originally anticipated. For these reasons government has maintained the grants-based incentive scheme that has seen over 261,000 homes retrofitted to date. I have already advised government that, in parallel with the new Better Energy Finance initiative, I intend to maintain the grants-based incentives for 2015.</p><p>  My Department has responded to the decline in applications for domestic Retrofit by re-channelling funding to meet the surge in applications under the Better Energy Areas and Communities Scheme which provide grant funding for community based projects. The government has committed 57 million in Exchequer Capital Funding for the Better Energy Programme this year. </p><p>  In keeping with government policy to target, where possible, exchequer moneys to upgrade homes most in need my colleague the Minister for Housing is overseeing the investment of a further &euro;50m in upgrading the energy efficiency of Local Authority homes.The non-domestic sector is equally important in stimulating economic activity and realising energy savings. Last year I published the National Energy Services Framework which, when combined with the &euro;70m National Energy Efficiency Fund, is equivalent to a Pay-As-You-Save methodology for the commercial and public sectors. </p><p>An analysis carried out by the SEAI for my Department of the potential of micro-generation technologies is informing consideration of a market support specifically for micro-generation.   </p></reply>

The Government recognises that spectrum is a valuable natural national resource, which needs to be used as effectively and efficiently as possible for the good of the state - both economic and social &ndash; and the good of all its citizens. Policy in this area therefore aims to ensure that mobile communications contribute to sustainable economic growth, jobs, competitiveness and social inclusion. While I have overall responsibility for spectrum policy, the day-to-day management of radio spectrum and the application of terms and conditions attached to mobile licences is a statutory function of the Commission for Communications Regulation under the Communications Regulation Act, 2002 as amended.    The National Broadband Plan, which was published in 2012 following extensive consultation with interested parties on topics including radio spectrum, contains specific proposals to review national policy on spectrum. The review is to be carried out on a consultative basis which I intend to initiate over the coming months. This review will deal with a broad range of issues relating to policy in the use of spectrum while respecting the role of ComReg as independent Regulator with responsibility for the management of spectrum on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>In terms of the mobile communications market, ComReg's 2012 multiband spectrum auction has released additional radio spectrum previously unavailable for mobile operators. This is expected to further improved the coverage and quality of mobile service throughout the country. Since the auction, three mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile broadband services and rollout is continuing. There has also been continued investment by all operators in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements. These significant investments mark a clear indication of investor confidence in the mobile telecommunications market.   </p></reply>

Ireland is currently heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels to meet our energy needs. While it is acknowledged that fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix for some time to come, progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy in our generation portfolio. The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020, to be achieved through 40% renewables in electricity, 12% in heat and 10% in transport. In 2012, renewable energy in electricity was 19.6%, in heat it was 5.2%, and in transport it was 3.8%. Analysis of options for increased use of renewable energy as we approach 2020 and beyond is ongoing, with a view to ensuring that our ambition is both sustainable, and economically and technically feasible. For example, analysis is being undertaken by my Department, the SEAI, EirGrid and the CER to further assess the costs and benefits associated with achieving 40% renewable electricity generation in 2020, compared to a scenario where renewable electricity remains at 2013 levels. This ongoing analysis will inform a report to be published shortly, and builds on existing work in this area such as the recently published SEAI report on <i>Quantifying Ireland&rsquo;s Fuel and CO2 Emissions Savings from Renewable Electricity in 2012</i>, which found that the value of the fossil fuels not consumed in the Republic of Ireland in 2012 as a result of renewable electricity generation is estimated at &euro;245 million, with the value of avoided CO2 emissions being a further &euro;15 million.    In terms renewable electricity generating options raised by the Deputy, to date wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. Provisional figures for 2013 indicate that 16.4% of electricity demand was met by wind generation. At the end of 2013, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was 2,300 MW. It is estimated that a total of around 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target. Currently, over 3,000 MW of renewable generation has taken up connection offers under the Gate 3 grid connection programme.</p><p>Our electricity system must be planned and developed so that it is adequate to meet future demand. Furthermore, energy infrastructure projects typically have long lead in times. Therefore, forecasts of economic growth are a critical factor in determining the on-going process of network planning and development carried out by EirGrid. EirGrid also uses this information to monitor the outlook for generation adequacy on a rolling ten year basis. In addition, the National Renewable Energy Action Plan, in which Ireland had to set out its trajectory for meeting its EU 2020 target, set out initial forecasts of demand for the years to 2020 to illustrate the amount of renewable generation that would be required to meet our EU target. In light of the economic downturn those figures have been revised in the second NREAP progress report produced by my Department earlier this year. </p><p>Looking out to the period beyond 2020, it is clear that there is potential to increase the diversity of our renewable generation portfolio. To this end, the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP), which I published in February, identifies the sustainable economic opportunity for Ireland in the period to 2030 of realising the potential of our indigenous offshore wind, wave and tidal energy resources. The Strategic Environmental Assessment carried out for the OREDP found that 4,500 MW of offshore wind and 1,500 MW of wave and tidal generation could be sustainably developed in Irish waters.   </p></reply>

The Government<font color="#1F497D">&rsquo;s </font>affordab<font color="#1F497D">le energy </font>strategy &ldquo;Warmer Homes&rdquo; identified three key interlinking factors which determine whether a person falls into energy poverty namely energy costs, incomes and thermal efficiency. Our dependence upon imported fossil fuels limits our ability to control energy costs except through the promotion and development of real and active competition in the energy market. Customers now have a choice<font color="#1F497D"> of energy supplier</font>and can shop around to seek a deal that best suits their needs and circumstances. The Government will continue to ensur<font color="#1F497D">e</font>that those on low incomes are supported and treated with dignity through the household benefits package and specifically through the fuel allowance.</p><p>The the most meaningful measure that can be taken is to continue to improve the thermal efficiency of people&rsquo;s homes and thus insulate them from the effects of rising energy costs. The Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to low income households who meet defined eligibility criteria and who are vulnerable to energy poverty. The scheme is managed by the SEAI and delivered through a range of Community Based Organisations, augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage. Recipients of the scheme do not receive grants but have measures installed free of charge. Since the commencement of the scheme in 2000, over 105,000 homes around the country have received energy efficiency measures under the Warmer Homes scheme, with a total spend of over &euro;116 million. The Warmer Homes scheme is expected to upgrade another 12,000 households in energy poverty in 2014.</p><p>In addition, late last year I established a taskforce to examine the specific issue of consumer disconnections in the electricity and gas market. I am happy to say that this taskforce has developed a number of new measures that will have a significant impact in this area. The CER has published a consultation paper on debt management and has provided guidance that allows suppliers to make more Pay As You Go Meters available to customers. The Network companies are running a number of pilot programmes which should ensure more customers get the opportunity to avoid a disconnection and energy suppliers for their part, have launched a new code of practice, &quot;The Energy Engage Code&quot;, which guarantees that no customer engaging with them will be cut off. The CER will be monitoring and reporting on disconnection statistics on a monthly basis.</p><p>On the launch of the Energy Green Paper I stated that I would hold a number of workshops on the paper. One of these workshops will be on empowering energy citizens and energy affordability will be an integral part of this workshop. </p><p>Finally, the Government intends to review the affordable energy strategy and I anticipate releasing a consultation paper this autumn to commence the process.   </p></reply>

This will be achieved by providing:-</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and</p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. </p><p>As a result of this accelerated investment the addressable area required by the State-led intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While these commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. Consequently, the speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. </p><p>On 25 April last, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment, as part of the State-led intervention under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way.   </p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department which will identify those areas that will require a State intervention. I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This list is available on my Department's website . Currently a total of 78 areas in County Donegal, 84 areas in County Galway and 48 areas in Co Limerick have been identified as requiring an intervention. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the mapping exercise. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. I expect that this mapping exercise will be concluded in the autumn. </p><p>I would point out that the EU Commission's guidelines on State aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude Member States from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out infrastructure within the following three years. </p><p>In tandem with the completion of the mapping exercise, intensive design and planning work is ongoing in my Department with a view to producing a detailed end to end implementation strategy for the State led intervention. It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed implementation strategy. EU State aid clearance will also be required for the intervention once finalised. This will be followed by a detailed procurement process with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in identified areas as quickly as possible. </p><p>Government is determined to ensure that all citizens and businesses have access to quality and reliable broadband, as well as the skills to maximise the benefits such access brings. The proposed State led intervention acknowledges that broadband is the key infrastructure of the 21<sup>st</sup>century and its implementation will allow the full potential of a digitally enabled economy and society to be realised.</p></reply>

Each river contains a genetically unique stock, which migrates to sea as juveniles and returns to the same river in adulthood to spawn.    The conservation imperative means that exploitation of salmon of each river is only permitted where the independent Standing Scientific Committee for salmon determine that the stock in that river is above its conservation limit. This Committee comprises Scientists from the Marine Institute, Inland Fisheries Ireland, ESB, the Loughs Agency, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Bio-Sciences Institute (AFBI) Northern Ireland and Universities.</p><p>  In accordance with the Inland Fisheries Act, 2010 and based on the independent advice of the Scientific Committee as regards the status of each individual river stock,and and management advice from IFI, a statutory 30 day public consultation process is conducted for the draft Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme Regulations each year in advance of the forthcoming season. </p><p>  This consultation process commences mid-November and ends in mid-December each year. The draft regulations are open for public inspection and are accessible on my Department&rsquo;s website. Submissions and observations on proposals within the draft regulations may be made at any time during the consultation period to my Department. Each submission is examined and considered as part of the process. A comprehensive response is issued to each party when the public consultation period ends.</p><p>  For those rivers deemed by the Independent Scientific Committee to be above their conservation limit and therefore to have an exploitable surplus of stock, consultation within District Committees, including representatives of the angling sector and commercial fishermen, inputs into how that surplus is to be divided among the various stakeholders. </p><p>  In addition to the statutory public consultation, Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) conducts public consultations on a regular basis when proposing to implement bye-laws on a regional basis. These consultations are advertised on IFI&rsquo;s website and submissions from all interested parties are invited. </p><p>  IFI, my Department and I, as Minister, also frequently meet with stakeholders countrywide to discuss issues raised by representative stakeholders including matters of sustainability and conservation of fish stocks.</p></reply>

However, as also highlighted in the OREDP, a route to market is critical for the development of each of the technologies in this sector.    It has been established that Ireland has sufficient onshore renewable energy resources to allow us to meet our 2020 target of meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable generation. Therefore, the route to market identified for offshore wind is that of export. Intensive discussions took place over the last year with the UK to establish if it would be possible to export renewable energy, both onshore and offshore, in order to allow the UK meet its 2020 target. While this work established that, with the appropriate policy and regulatory framework, renewable energy trading could deliver benefits to both Ireland and the UK, the complexities involved and the decisions yet to be taken by the UK, make post 2020 delivery more realistic given project lead times. Nevertheless, given the move towards an Internal Market for Energy, I am of the view that trade in renewable electricity is virtually inevitable post 2020. </p><p>  In common with the state of play internationally, the ocean energy sector in Ireland is at the pre-commercial stage. To support developers in bringing their devices from prototype to full scale commercial viability, requires a range of policies. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) provides support to developers in a number of ways from its ocean energy development budget of &euro;6.5 million for 2014. Initial device development and testing is supported through the Prototype Fund. Developers must satisfy a range of technical criteria to indicate potential viability in order to receive funding. Funding has also been allocated to SEAI for the development of the Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site (AMETS) off County Mayo. From 2016, this facility will provide a grid connected test site with some of the most demanding conditions for wave energy in the world. Currently SEAI and the Marine Institute provide quarter size test facilities off the Galway coast. </p><p>  The Irish Maritime and Energy Research Centre (IMERC) provides initial device testing facilities and critical research and development capacity. My Department is contributing &euro;3 million in co-funding between 2013 and 2016. In total, my Department has allocated at total of &euro;26.3 million for ocean energy in the period 2013 to 2016. This funding, which will benefit from increased cross government coordination through the implementation of the OREDP, is vital if the ocean energy sector is to reach the array demonstration stage envisaged by projects such as Westwave.

I conveyed this view to my British counterpart in April. There is ongoing contact between my Department and the Department of Energy and Climate Change on a range of energy issues, including in the context of the British Irish Council. These contacts will afford both parties to explore longer term trading opportunities that will arise post 2020 in the context of a European Internal Energy Market and the need for greater energy integration.  In terms of supporting interconnection, it is EU policy is to encourage greater integration and interconnectivity between Member States. Enhanced security of supply, increased competitiveness, and the ability to integrate greater quantities of variable renewable generation resources are some of the potential benefits of further interconnection between the transmission grids of Ireland, Great Britain and mainland Europe. Eirgrid is the Transmission System Operator (TSO) for the electricity transmission system in Ireland. The functions of the TSO include the operation of a safe, secure, reliable, economical and efficient electricity transmission system, and to explore and develop opportunities for interconnection of its system with other systems, with a view to ensuring that all reasonable demands for electricity are met and having due regard for the environment. I understand from EirGrid that a number of studies are exploring different aspects of the feasibility of additional interconnection and these will feed into any decisions on future interconnection investment.  </p></reply>

Under the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs, provision is made for &euro;57 million in Exchequer supports to further stimulate energy-saving activity in the residential sector. This is estimated to sustain approximately 3,500 jobs. A further &euro;35 million is being invested in the creation of an Energy Efficiency Fund to invest in appropriate projects in the commercial and public sectors.  SEAI estimates   that the renewable and sustainable energy sector could create at least 30,000 jobs by 2020. As I have stated previously, all relevant State agencies, particularly in the enterprise area, will have to co-ordinate their activities to ensure Ireland maximises this job creation potential. This opportunity has already been identified by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland in their clean technology growth strategies. SEAI is currently working with Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and Forf&aacute;s to examine what sectors and sub-sectors in the supply chains of energy efficiency and renewable energy offer the most opportunities for Irish firms in order to inform strategies to maximise job creation. Ireland is well positioned to leverage employment opportunities in the sector with our strong capabilities in key areas such as engineering and ICT; our research, development and demonstration base; our favourable corporate tax rate, and a well-educated, adaptable workforce.</p><p>  In addition, our onshore and offshore renewable resources are significantly greater than the national energy requirement. In the context of a European Internal Market and greater integration, these resources represent an important energy trading opportunity in the post 2020 period. </p><p>I expect a full discussion on these matters as part of the current public consultation process on the Green Paper.   </p></reply>

The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is, in the first instance, a matter for commercial services providers. These service providers operate in a competitive commercial market reporting to the independent market regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  ComReg publishes data on customer access to high speed broadband at the national level only. This data shows that between 2011 and the end of 2013 the proportion of broadband customers accessing marketed speeds of 30 Mbps or more increased from 3% to 35%. It also indicates that the proportion of customers contracted at speeds of 2 Mbps or less reduced from 11% to 5%. ComReg does not publish any similar material by a county or regional basis.    The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and</p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. </p><p>As a result of this accelerated investment the addressable area required by the State-led intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. Consequently, the speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. </p><p>On 25 April last, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment, as part of the State led intervention under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way. </p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department which will identify those areas that will require a State intervention. I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This list is available on my Department's website . Currently, a total of 108 areas in County Cork have been identified as requiring an intervention. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the mapping exercise. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. I expect that this mapping exercise will be concluded in the autumn. </p><p>I would point out that the EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on State aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude Member States from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. In this regard, I understand that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 103 fibre-based broadband networks in County Cork by July 2016.</p><p>In tandem with the completion of the mapping exercise, intensive design and planning work is ongoing in my Department with a view to producing a detailed end to end implementation strategy for the State led intervention. It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed implementation strategy. EU State aid clearance will also be required for the intervention once finalised. This will be followed by a detailed procurement process with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in identified areas as quickly as possible</p><p>With regard to the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), I am pleased to advise that of the four MANs in West Cork, Bantry, Dunmanway and Skibbereen are in operation and are being used by a number of telecommunications operators, providing services to businesses in those areas. The fourth MAN, Kinsale, was recently completed and is expected to be in operation in the next few weeks.</p><p>I fully share the concerns of local representatives about the quality of broadband in rural areas. It is my intention to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by delivering an end-to end market intervention with fibre as a core component. In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, Government is determined to ensure that all citizens and businesses in the State have access to quality and reliable broadband.</p></reply>

Mr. Kutesa is the sole candidate this year for nomination to the post. The anti-homosexuality law clearly conflicts with Uganda&rsquo;s binding international obligations to uphold human rights. It is a threat to Uganda&rsquo;s gay community and an affront to all those who value tolerance, respect and dignity of all people. Ireland and our partners in the European Union, as well as many other States, have made our strong opposition to the Ugandan Government&rsquo;s policy clear in contacts with the Ugandan government. Indeed, the Minister of State for Trade and Development met with representatives of human rights groups working on LGBTI issues in Uganda in December 2013 and assured them of Ireland&rsquo;s continued support for their human rights.    The role of the President of the UN General Assembly is simply to preside over the sessions of the General Assembly and manage its business.  He/she has no competence in relation to individual policy issues and does not influence the work of the UN or its agencies in day to day operations.  Furthermore, the President of the General Assembly does not chair any Committee of the General Assembly, for example the Third Committee which handles human rights issues. This responsibility rests with individual member States. If any effort were made to advance an unacceptable human rights agenda, this would be vigorously contested by Ireland and most other UN member States.</p><p>  Ireland remains committed to ensuring that the people of Uganda do not suffer violence or discrimination on the grounds of their sexual orientation.

I also had the opportunity to congratulate the new Lord Mayor of Belfast, Nichola Mallon, on her appointment.</p><p>  In my meetings with each of the Party Leaders, I stressed the importance of delivering an agreement on the outstanding issues. I underlined that the people of Northern Ireland expect politics to deliver.  I remain committed to doing everything possible in the time ahead to ensure that real progress is achieved.</p><p>  I had the opportunity to meet with key representatives of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s business community. We discussed the wider benefits that a successful conclusion to the Party Leaders&rsquo; Talks will bring to the economy of Northern Ireland.  It was clear that business leaders were concerned at the broader economic and social consequences of the slowness in political progress in recent months. </p><p>  My discussion with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villiers included ongoing developments in Northern Ireland Political Party Leaders&rsquo; talks and our shared concern that the forthcoming marching season pass peacefully. On the Party Leaders&rsquo; Talks, we both expressed the hope that the renewed sense of momentum in the talks will translate into a comprehensive and fair solution to outstanding issues on flags, parades and dealing with the past. </p><p>  I also addressed a reception attended by key community, business and political leaders, where I launched the Department&rsquo;s Reconciliation Fund Strategy for the period 2014 to 2017.  The new strategy for the Reconciliation Fund has at its heart a commitment to the full implementation of the Agreements.  Support for projects will be grouped around two thematic pillars: repairing and building.  Under the first pillar, the Fund will support projects tackling issues that lead to division, conflict and barriers to a deeply reconciled and peaceful society.  The second pillar will see support for projects that contribute to building a strong civil society that encompasses all communities, through the continued implementation of the Agreements and the promotion of a rights-based society, political stability and respect for all.  The strategy places a strong emphasis on innovative approaches, maximising effectiveness and value-for-money.  I look forward to the strategy supporting the work of the Government in delivering reconciliation on this island.</p></reply>

The Department aims to respond each year to as many of the requests as possible issued by these organisations.  Full details of the election observation missions served by Irish election observers in 2013 and to date in 2014, and the individual costs associated with each observer, whether as Long or Short Term Observers, are set out in the tables.       The European Commission covers all costs associated with EU election observation missions.  For OSCE missions, the Department covers all costs incurred by the individual Irish election observers.  This includes a daily allowance, based on OSCE guidance, to cover the cost of food, accommodation and local transport incurred in country.  A return air fare is also provided.  </p><p>In addition, all Irish election observers receive a once-off grant annually of &euro;600 from the Department to cover pre-departure expenses.   Insurance cover is also provided by the Department for all observers.  </p><p>Observers selected for participation in election observation missions are drawn from Ireland&rsquo;s election observation roster.   This roster was established, following a review of the existing roster, in May 2013.   On occasion, officials from the Department who work on geographic desks relating to the specific country may partake in election observation missions.   This participation is to facilitate the knowledge development and learning of the officials in question.   The costs incurred by these officials are paid on the same basis as other election observation roster members, though no pre-departure grant is provided.   In 2013, five officials participated in election observation missions.  Two officials have taken part in missions to date in 2014.</p><p><b>Election Observation Missions

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains and administers a roster of observers for such missions.   The aim is to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for both elections and constitutional referendums.   The Department carried out a comprehensive review of the election observation roster in 2013.   A public call for applications to the roster was issued, with all applications being required to submit a detailed application form, setting out their relevant qualifications, knowledge and experience in a number of areas.  These areas included: experience of election processes and election observation; knowledge of human rights and / or governance issues; experience of living in challenging environments and language and computer skills.  Applicants were asked to indicate their proficiency or experience and to provide concrete written examples, where appropriate.  An independent appraisal, based only on the information contained in the application form, was subsequently undertaken.  Arising from this, the 200 individuals who achieved the highest scores were selected to serve on the new election observation roster.  This new roster came into effect on 15 May 2013.  Due to the high quality of applications received, a reserve panel of the next 10 highest scoring individuals was also established.   The reserve panelists were assessed on the same basis as the 200 other election observation members, with no additional information, being requested as part of this process.  Full details of the criteria against which all election observation applicants were assessed were set out in the Information Note, which was published with the election observation application form, on the Department&rsquo;s website.  </p></reply>

In situations where the renewal of a passport is necessitated from loss or theft, the statement of loss section on the application form must be completed by the applicant and duly witnessed by a member of An Garda Sioch&aacute;na. In this case the person in question was issued a passport in 2007 which was valid for five years.  However, this was not submitted with her recent renewal application. Moreover, she did not complete the statement of loss to explain the absence of the previous passport from her application.   In these circumstances the Department considers that the application is incomplete and as such is not compliant with the Passports Act, 2008.  Accordingly, the Department wrote to the applicant on two occasions to inform her of this problem.  In the latest letter, dated 29 May, 2014, the applicant was requested to complete the required statement of loss.

Each application received by the Passport Service must, therefore, contain relevant evidence that clearly demonstrates that person&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship before a passport can issue to him/her. The child in question was born in the State in 2010.  His entitlement to Irish citizenship is, therefore, subject to the terms of section 6A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended (the Act).<font color="#004080">  </font>This provides that a person, born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person&rsquo;s birth, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding that<font color="#004080"> </font>person&rsquo;s birth.   In line with guidelines provided by the Department of Justice, Equality and Defence, which is responsible for immigration and citizenship, the proofs of lawful residence of a non-EU parent, which are accepted and considered by this Department for the purposes of passport applications are immigration stamps in passports or the registration cards/books, which are given to persons registering with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  In some cases, letters from GNIB which provide details of issued immigration stamps, are also accepted.  These are official documents which can be objectively verified by the Department.  </p><p>A passport application for this child was received by the Department on 11 April 2014.  However, it could not be finalized for passport issue because the amount of his mother&rsquo;s lawful residence, which was calculated from the submitted evidence, was insufficient to demonstrate his entitlement to Irish citizenship. </p><p>It should be noted that the evidence of the mother&rsquo;s lawful residence, which was taken into account by the Department, was stamps in her passport, her registration card and a letter, dated 8 October, 2013, from GNIB.  (The latter detailed the stamps which were issued to her.)   </p><p>The Department wrote to the applicant&rsquo;s mother on 2 May, 2014 to inform her of this problem and to give her notice of the proposed decision to refuse a passport to the applicant under the Passports Act, 2008 on the grounds that he is not an Irish citizen.  This letter set a deadline of 30 May for the receipt of representations and/or information that may be relevant to the proposed decision.  No reply has been received to this letter.</p><p>In terms of additional information/evidence that may be relevant to this case, the following should be noted: </p><p>(i) no evidence has been presented in the submitted application that shows that the applicant&rsquo;s mother was an Irish citizen at the time of the applicant&rsquo;s birth.  If such evidence exists, it would prove that the applicant is an Irish citizen and that his entitlement is not subject to section 6A of the Act; and</p><p>(ii) in a recent ruling of the Supreme Court, letters from the Department of Justice, Equality and Defence, which sanctioned a parent&rsquo;s residence in the State, could be accepted as evidence of lawful residence from the date of the letter.

(GMCE).  Following the failure of GMCE to complete the transaction within the agreed timeframe post consideration of all bids, KCF advised that it could not recommend its offer to NAMA due to the requisite funding not being in place.  NAMA requested that the Administrator extend the period of time afforded to GMCE to enable it to raise the funding necessary to complete the transaction following assurances from GMCE that it expected to be in a position to complete the purchase within a reasonable timeframe.  However, and notwithstanding repeated assurances from it, GMCE has to date, more than two years later, failed to complete the transaction. NAMA advises that the property in question secures a loan which is part of the Northern Ireland Project Eagle portfolio disposal transaction.  If the sale of that portfolio proceeds, the issue will be for the new owners of the portfolio to determine.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, NAMA is not in a position to gift assets to potential purchasers as it is obliged to set the realised value of assets against the indebtedness of its debtors. </p></reply>

These macroeconomic forecasts have been endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.</p><p>  There is no simple answer with regard to the impact of different headline growth rates on the deficit as the exact impact would depend on the composition of growth. For example, growth driven by exports does not have as significant an impact on the public finances as domestically driven growth.  A rule of thumb estimate is that for every extra percentage point of GDP growth, the deficit improves by between &frac14; and &frac12; percentage points depending on the composition of growth. </p><p>  Finally, I would like to reiterate that there remains a lot of moving parts, and the most up to date economic and fiscal information will be used in deciding the adjustment package necessary to deliver on our EDP obligations closer to Budget time.</p></reply>

On that basis, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2014 incomes, of the introduction of such a rate, would be of the order of &euro;380 million. However, given the current band structures, major issues would need to be resolved as to how, in practice, such a new rate could be integrated into the current system and how this would affect the relative position of different types of income earners.</p><p>  In relation to reducing the Universal Social Charge (USC) from 10% to 7% for self-employed persons with income in excess of &euro;100,000 per annum, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year cost, estimated by reference to 2014 incomes, would be of the order of &euro;123 million.</p><p>  In relation to increasing the threshold for the application of the lower rate of USC from &euro;10,036 to &euro;15,000, with subsequent pro-rata increases, as suggested by the Deputy, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the cost, estimated by reference to 2014 incomes, would be of the order of &euro;652 million.</p><p>  All estimates above are derived from the Revenue tax forecasting model using actual data for the year 2011, adjusted as necessary for income, employment and self-employment trends in the interim. Estimates are therefore provisional and may be revised.</p></reply>

However, I am further advised by the Commissioners that these estimates are based on the assumption of no change in behaviour by smokers following increase in prices and this is unlikely to be the case.<table><tr><th>Duty Increase</th><th>Potential Yield *</th></tr><tr><td>10c</td><td>&euro;16m</td></tr><tr><td>20c</td><td>&euro;31m</td></tr><tr><td>50c</td><td>&euro;77m</td></tr><tr><td>60c</td><td>&euro;92m</td></tr></table>*Assuming no behavioural change by smokers.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioners that economic research conducted by Revenue has shown that (further) cigarette price rises, particularly at the higher end of the range, are unlikely to increase Excise receipts from the sale of cigarettes (the largest source of Excise Duty on tobacco) and this is supported by experience in recent years. In economic terms, the demand for Irish duty paid cigarettes has moved to become much more elastic in nature, this implies an increase in price will lead to a proportionately larger decrease in consumption of Irish duty paid cigarettes resulting in an overall decrease in cigarette Excise receipts. </p><p>The likely reduction in consumption of Irish duty paid cigarettes (and fall in receipts) from higher duty on tobacco will arise from a combination of factors.  Some people will reduce their smoking levels; others will simply substitute their consumption to non-Irish duty paid cigarettes.  These can be either illicit or legally brought into the country.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the extent of the illicit cigarette market in Ireland is estimated through annual surveys.  These surveys are undertaken for Revenue and the National Tobacco Control Office of the Health Services Executive by Ipsos MRBI.  The analysis of the results of the survey for 2013 are not yet fully finalised but preliminary analysis indicates that 11% of cigarettes consumed in Ireland in 2013 were illicit and a further 5% of cigarettes were non Irish duty paid which were legally brought into the country.  The comparable figures for 2012 and 2011 were 13% and 14% respectively with the legally imported non Irish Duty paid cigarettes at 6% and 7%.</p><p>In relation to the second Question, the Revenue Commissioners advise that the annual increases in the retail price of the most popular price category (MPPC) of 20 filter tipped cigarettes since 2001 to end 2013 (the most recent period for which accurate information exists), together with the requested breakdown by tax and trade contents, are shown in the table.  A full list of specific dates for trade content changes are not available to the Commissioners but the table shows the increase in each year.</p><p><b>TOBACCO (20 CIGARETTES)</b></p><p><b>Budget

The basic LPT rate can be increased or decreased by up to 15%. This is referred to as the "local adjustment factor" (LAF) and the earliest year that this can apply is 2015. The formal resolution should specify the percentage by which the basic LPT rate is to be varied and the year(s) that this variation will apply.</p><p>  In determining the LAF, local authorities are required to take account of their income and expenditure projections for the coming year, their current financial position and the effect of the variation on the economy and taxpayers in their functional area. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has the power to make regulations with respect to the setting of the LAF and it is my understanding that he intends to do so.</p><p>  Where the elected members of a local authority pass a formal resolution to vary the basic LPT rate for 2015, the local authority is required under section 21 of the 2012 Act to notify Revenue on or before 30 September 2014 of the LAF that will apply to the basic LPT rate for 2015 (that is, the percentage by which the basic LPT rate is to be varied). This statutory deadline is to ensure that all the necessary administrative arrangements can be put in place for the payment of LPT at the appropriate rate in 2015 and most importantly, that property owners are given adequate notice of their LPT liability for 2015 to enable them to select their preferred payment method in good time for the filing date.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, as part of their customer service and information campaign in relation to the LAF, they wrote to each City and County Manager at the end of March 2014 to remind all Managers of the deadline by which Revenue must be notified if their particular local authority intends to vary the LPT rate for next year.  A copy of the letter in question will be sent directly to the Deputy.</p><p>  I am also advised that the Commissioners will be writing to all City and County Managers again in advance of the September 2014 deadline specifying the details, which the Commissioners expect will be straightforward, that they require from local authorities in connection with the LAF.</p><p>  Any adjustments in the rate of tax will be reflected in the usual communication which Revenue will issue in advance of the next filing date in respect of properties which, according to their records, are in the relevant local authority area.</p></reply>

The Deputy will also appreciate that the contents of the confidential correspondence with the Commission may, in the event of an unfavourable decision at a future date by the Commission on foot of the State Aid investigation announced yesterday, become the subject of litigation between Ireland and the Commission.</p><p>  The Commission has been advised that Revenue advance opinions are non-binding and seek to clarify the tax treatment of proposed transactions or business activities under the applicable legislation, so that companies can file a correct tax return and comply fully with their tax obligations.</p><p>  It is normal Revenue practice to provide an advance opinion on the application of tax legislation in circumstances where there might otherwise be uncertainty and the taxpayer requires clarification of the matter. As stated above, Revenue opinions are designed to provide clarity in relation to the applicable tax rules so that taxpayers can file a correct tax return and comply fully with their tax obligations. Advance opinions set out the correct application of the law as applied to specific transactions or activities. They do not provide any 'special deal' or special treatment. </p><p>  As I have outlined on numerous occasions, Ireland does not do deals with multinational companies on corporate tax. Ireland's corporation tax system is statute-based and Revenue has no authority to do deals, to which the Deputy refers, with multinationals or any other taxpayers. In providing advance opinions as outlined above, Revenue has not done any deals or granted any special or favourable treatments.</p><p>  The European Commission announced yesterday that it will open formal State Aid investigations in a number of Member States as part of its on-going wider enquiries in relation to tax rulings and patent box regimes in a number of member states. In the case of Ireland, our understanding of the particulars of this case is that the Commission is focussing on advance opinions, provided a number of years ago in respect of the Irish operations of one company, which address the calculation of the taxable base of profits for those Irish operations. I am confident that there is no state aid rule breach in this case and we will defend all aspects vigorously.  However, we understand that the European Commission has a responsibility to investigate potential breaches of state aid rules and, accordingly, we will continue to do everything we can to ensure that they have the full information they require.</p><p>  At present the Commission is not saying that there is state aid, merely that they are formally examining this case. Their examination is not about Ireland's corporation tax rate or the Irish corporate tax system. The enquiry relates to the application of the rules in one particular case.</p><p>  When it completes its investigation, the Commission will publicly announce its decision. In the event of an unfavourable decision, it will be open to Ireland to launch a legal challenge in the European courts.</p><p>  I am very confident that we will successfully defend our position. Ireland does not have a statutorily-binding tax ruling system.  As stated above, advance opinions do no more than set out the correct application of the law as applied to specific transactions or activities. Advance opinions do not provide special treatment. There was no special deal in this or any other case. As there was no special treatment, we do not believe that there was any state aid. We will be providing a detailed, technical legal rebuttal of the Commission's concerns and, if necessary, will defend our position in the European Courts.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-12a.162.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061200048#WRC01900"><p> I am advised by Revenue that it has collected over &euro;291m to date in 2014 in respect of Local Property Tax (LPT) and Household Charge (HHC). This figure is approximately 8% ahead of target up to 31 May 2014.</p><p>  In regard to HHC, Revenue has collected over &euro;20m in respect of more than 122,000 properties since it assumed responsibility for securing the outstanding liabilities. Approximately &euro;18m of this amount, in respect of almost 112,000 properties, has been collected since Revenue launched its compliance campaign earlier this year. Revenue has also largely dealt with 70,000 items of HHC related correspondence which was received since the compliance campaign started.  On that basis, Revenue is in a position this week to move on to debt collection/enforcement action against those who have still not complied, as previously advised to property owners.</p><p>  In regard to LPT compliance, the Deputy will be aware that Revenue has to date achieved a compliance rate of 94% in respect of 2013 and a 91% rate in respect of 2014 and will, in tandem with HHC compliance action, move on to debt collection/enforcement action against LPT non-compliers over the coming weeks.</p><p>  The actions to be deployed against HHC/LPT non-compliers will include deduction from employment income for PAYE workers or from occupational pensions or certain Government payments where appropriate. The actions to be deployed against self-assessed taxpayers, some of which have already been used, will include withholding of Tax Clearance Certification, surcharges on Income Tax, Corporation Tax and Capital Gains Tax returns and withholding/offset of any other tax refunds. The actions will also include referral to a Sheriff or Solicitor or the use of Attachment where it is appropriate to do so. Interest on late payment at a rate of 0.0219% per day, may also be included in any enforcement action, which will be calculated from the relevant due date up to the date of payment.  The Deputy will agree that these actions have been well flagged by Revenue.</p><p>  Revenue has advised me that approximately 50,000 letters will issue this week to property owners who are taxed under the PAYE system informing them that notifications are issuing to their employers instructing them (the employers) to deduct the &euro;200 HHC liability from salary over the remaining pay periods in 2014. These amounts will be in addition to any deductions that may already be in place in respect of LPT. Following the issue of the letters to the property owners, Revenue will then issue the instruction to their employer or occupational pension provider to deduct the amount due over the rest of the year. Revenue has advised me that the production schedule for the employer instruction takes a seven day turnaround from the issue of the letter to the property owner and if the property owner pays (or makes payment arrangements) or can show Revenue that they are not liable within 5 days of the date of the letter, Revenue will be able to stop the issue of the instruction. If the owner pays (or makes payment arrangements) or can show Revenue that they are not liable after the instruction is issued, Revenue will cancel the instruction immediately, depending on the employer's payroll cycle.  If deductions have started credit will be given for any payment taken. These arrangements are set out in the letters to property owners.</p><p>  A further 20,000 letters will issue towards the end of this week to property owners who have not paid the HHC and whose only source of income is from the Department of Social Protection. The letters will advise the owners that they are likely to be eligible for a deferral of the &euro;200 charge which will be granted automatically unless they contact Revenue to pay the amount due (or make payment arrangements) or advise why they may not be liable. The deferral will be liable to the reduced interest charge of 4% per annum (compared to c. 8% in non compliant cases).</p><p>  Further tranches of letters will issue to non-compliant property owners taxed through the PAYE system in respect of combinations of HHC, 2013 LPT and 2014 LPT liabilities (as relevant) over the remaining weeks of June and the first week of July. These letters will again confirm that notices are issuing to employers/pension providers to start deductions at source as soon as possible within the payment cycle.</p><p>  Revenue has also advised me that payment demand letters in respect of combinations of outstanding HHC, 2013 LPT and 2014 LPT liabilities will issue to all property owners taxed under self-assessment system during June and early July. The demand letters will confirm that the outstanding liabilities will be referred to Sheriffs or Solicitors for collection or will be the subject of Attachment orders unless payment is immediately received. It is important to realise that once a debt is referred to a Sheriff or Solicitor the property owner must deal with that body rather than Revenue in regard to issues such as phased payments, etc. In addition the property owner will be liable to pay the Sheriff's costs which will increase the overall liability by something in the region of 10% of the amount due.</p><p>  In total Revenue anticipates that in excess of 200,000 compliance letters will have issued by early July, though this number will most likely reduce as property owners decide to pay their outstanding liabilities to avoid the additional expense and embarrassment that comes with Revenue debt collection/enforcement activity.</p><p>  Finally, I want to commend Revenue for the job it has done to date in achieving such high collection and compliance rates in respect of both LPT and the arrears of HHC. This is particularly the case in regard to HHC, where the liability doubled from &euro;100 to &euro;200 if not paid by 1 July 2013, which obviously increased the collection/compliance challenge. I have no doubt that the increased liability has also placed a strain on property owners that could have been avoided if the original charge had been paid on time. I am concerned that this unnecessary increased liability and stress of dealing with Revenue arose, in some instances, on foot of poor advice to citizens by some commentators.  While I fully support political debate in the design and development of our laws, I would urge all those advising citizens to bear in mind that the consequences, for example in the case of the Household Charge, is an increased liability.  I strongly recommend anyone who receives one of these letters from Revenue to act now and pay or make arrangements to pay any outstanding liability by following the instructions included on the letter.</p></reply>

The contents of the report will be considered as part of deliberations for Budget 2015.</p><p>  To address the specific points raised in the details supplied by the Deputy;-</p><p>  1. The figures quoted by TASC regarding the achievement of a net increase in pay for employees at certain income levels relates to the step effect in the PRSI system which brings all income into charge once the relevant threshold is reached. While such an effect is never ideal, it is necessary to achieve the desired yield, which in itself contributes to keeping workers on incomes lower than the threshold to remain outside the charge to employee PRSI entirely.</p><p>  2. A single person on income of &euro;40,000, while subject to a marginal rate of income tax of 41%, may pay an effective rate of income tax of 10%, when tax credits, bands and reliefs are taken into account. Effective tax rates are calculated by dividing the amount of income tax paid (excluding PRSI and USC) by the total income of an individual, and would usually take account of any tax reliefs, incentives or deductions claimed. This differs from the marginal tax rate paid on the last euro of income. The availability of tax credits, standard rate bands and other tax reliefs means that the effective rate of income tax paid by an individual will always be lower than the marginal rate payable. For example, tax credits for single employees ensure that the first &euro;16,500 of income is not liable to income tax at all.</p><p>  3. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they estimate that just over 17% of income earners were liable to Income Tax at the 41% rate in 2013. These figures are provisional. It is incorrect to state that the remainder of taxpayers would not benefit from rate or band changes. A reduction in the lower (20%) tax rate would benefit some of these taxpayers, while an increase in the standard rate band could ensure that those workers that are on the brink of paying the higher rate of income tax currently, could benefit from a pay increase, without becoming subject to the higher rate of income tax going forward.</p><p>  4. I can confirm to the Deputy that Ireland does indeed have the lowest tax wedge of all EU members, for those on average wages, as calculated by the OECD. The Tax Wedge is defined as the sum of personal income tax plus employee and employer social security contributions together with any payroll taxes less cash transfers, expressed as a percentage of labour costs. It is the difference between what an employer has to pay in terms of gross wages plus taxes to hire an employee and the net revenue received by that employee after deduction of all taxes on their wages. These figures also take into account social insurance payments made by employers. A competitive tax wedge is considered vital in encouraging employment growth across all income categories and to incentivise individuals to remain in or return to the labour market.</p></reply>

Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption. </p><p>There is no specific concession available under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) for pensioners who are in receipt of the household benefits package. However such persons may be entitled to an exemption on other grounds or may qualify for a deferral subject to meeting the qualifying conditions. </p><p>The provision of waivers or deferrals for households unable to pay the tax or where a payment requirement would cause hardship was considered. As a general principle, eligibility for deferral should be based on gross income. The system of deferrals in place is targeted at cases of need, where there is an inability to pay the LPT under specific conditions.  </p><p>The property must be the sole or main residence of the liable person and his or her gross income must be below certain thresholds.  The thresholds are &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a married couple, civil partners or cohabiting couple.  Deferral in respect of half of the local property tax payable is possible, where the gross income is above the threshold but less than &euro;25,000 in the case of a single person and &euro;35,000 in the case of a couple.   </p><p>The full and partial deferral thresholds may be increased in the case of properties occupied as a sole residence and subject to a mortgage. In such cases, the gross income thresholds may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments. The deferral option in such qualifying cases will apply until the end of 2017.</p><p>The LPT legislation also provides for the possibility of a deferral for liable persons who cannot without excessive hardship pay local property tax when it becomes payable as a consequence of a significant and unexpected financial loss or expense. Further information on this deferral option, including Revenue Guidelines, is available from: </p><p>Deferred Local Property Tax and interest will have to be discharged on the sale/transfer of the property.   </p><p>While I have no plans to introduce specific concessions for pensioners who are in receipt of the household benefits package, owner/occupiers whose sole source of income is a state pension should qualify for a deferral.</p></reply>

It is the aim of the Council that teachers are competent to teach in the different teaching environments and are prepared to be lifelong learners continually adapting to enable them to support their students in achieving their full potential. Graduates from primary ITE Bachelor of Education courses are recognised to teach in all primary schools.</p><p>In addition my Department funds the Postgraduate Diplomas in Special Education Needs provided by seven universities/colleges of education around the country. Substitution is provided by my Department to facilitate teachers' absence from school to participate in the programmes. Section 39 of the Teaching Council Act provides authority for the Council to review and accredit programmes of Continuing Professional Development for teachers. It is intended that Section 39 will be commenced after Part 5 (Fitness to Teach) has been commenced. In addition the Special Education Support Service provides continuing professional development for teachers to enhance the quality of learning and teaching of students with special educational needs.</p></reply>

In general, children who were eligible for school transport prior to the introduction of the above change, will retain their transport eligibility for the duration of their post primary education cycle provided there is no change to their current circumstances.  Siblings of these children and other children who are not eligible for school transport, may apply for school transport on a concessionary basis only subject to a number of conditions including the availability of spare seats and payment of the annual charge. Tickets for these children will be allocated during the week commencing 11th August 2014 after tickets for children who are eligible for school transport have been assigned.

The staffing arrangements for the 2014/15 school year (Circular 0007/2014) were published on 24 January, 2014.  My Department introduced reforms to the teacher allocation process for resource hours in recent years which included the allocation of a network of permanent posts in base schools to cater for NCSE approved resource hours for individual pupils in schools.  This network of base posts is designed to make the system work more smoothly at school level. 84% of all NCSE approved resource teaching hours in the 2013/14 school year were allocated to schools that had permanent resource base posts. There will be no changes to the location of permanent resource base posts for the 2014/15 school year.</p><p>Schools with a resource base post are required to co-operate with their neighbouring schools to ensure that any surplus capacity in the (25 hour) resource post(s) is made available to neighbouring schools to meet their NCSE approved resource hour requirements. </p><p>Schools that do not have a resource base post are required to check for available surplus capacity in base posts in neighbouring schools before making an application to the Department's Primary Teacher Allocations Section. Where a school that does not have a base post has been approved for 25 or more NCSE approved hours, a temporary post will be sanctioned for the 2014/15 school year. Where a school has less than 25 hours that cannot be met from other schools, sanction will be given for part time hours. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-12a.261.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061200052#WRG01700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 to 103, inclusive, together. </p><p>It is important to note that there is no legal definition of an au pair in Irish legislation.  However Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment, on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees.  For example; the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000 requires any persons under a contract of employment to be paid the statutory National Minimum Wage.  For the purposes of this Act, this means a contract of service or apprenticeship, or any other contract whereby an individual agrees with another person to do or perform personally any work or service for that person.</p><p>Au pair is a cultural term used to describe a student or young adult who travels to a foreign country to live with a family, learn the local language and culture.  The use of this term to define a relationship between a host family and an individual does not in itself mean that an employee/employer relationship does not exist; this will be decided based on employment law and the individual characteristics of the relationship.  Non-EEA nationals who wish to take up a role as an au pair in Ireland require a visa from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), which comes within the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality.  With regard to student visas issued by INIS, I would point out that non-EEA nationals attending designated full-time courses of study are normally allowed under the terms of the visa to take up casual employment of up to 20 hours part-time work per week during academic terms or up to 40 hours per week during normal college vacation periods.  </p><p>Where the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), which comes within the remit of my Department, receives a complaint involving somebody described as an au pair, NERA will investigate with a view to establishing the person&rsquo;s statutory entitlements under employment law (including whether the term &ldquo;au pair&rdquo; is being used to avoid statutory obligations).  NERA has encountered individuals, described by their employers as au pairs, who have been found to be domestic employees.  In such cases NERA will seek to vindicate the rights of all workers in accordance with its mandate and powers under employment legislation. </p><p>As part of the ongoing NERA campaign on the rights of domestic workers, NERA will shortly be launching an information leaflet to raise awareness of the rights of domestic workers and of employers&rsquo; obligations in this area. As part of that process the issue of working hours and wages of domestic workers will be highlighted, as will avenues for redress where workers feel they are not getting their rights.</p><p>Given that Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, I have no plans to make changes to the existing body of employment rights legislation in this context.  An opinion regarding the question as to whether a person is an employee or not is formed by NERA and/or the relevant employment rights dispute settlement body within the provisions of existing employment legislation and established contract law based on the facts of each case and not based on whether the term au pair is used or not.</p><p>Where a person has concerns that employees may be exploited or are receiving less than their statutory entitlement, the matter can be reported to NERA for investigation.  Cases for redress on matters relating to employment rights legislation can be made on the workplace relations complaint form available from NERA or online at .  NERA has a dedicated information service, Workplace Relations Customer Service, which provides information on all aspects of employment rights.  This service operates from 9.30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays and can be contacted on Lo-Call 1890 808090.  Workplace Relations Customer Service also provides extensive information on employment rights on its website www.workplacerelations.ie.   </p><p>I would urge the Deputy, if he is aware of any case where an employee is being exploited in this context, to report the specifics to NERA for investigation.</p></reply>

Hence, as I have previously outlined in relation to this matter in the Oireachtas, the new amalgamated Competition and Consumer Protection Commission will be the independent body assigned responsibility for overseeing and enforcing these regulations which I will make under this Act.  This new body will be given the powers to enforce the regulations and will build on the considerable enforcement and investigative powers that the two current bodies have built-up over the last few years rather than start afresh with a new body.  Contravention of the regulations will be an offence as will failure to comply with any contravention notice issued by the new Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  That body will also have the power to publically list all undertakings that have contravened either the regulations or failed to comply with the contravention notices: this will inform consumers on which undertakings are not abiding by the regulations.  It will also be able to act on its own initiative or on the basis of information supplied to it.  However, it must be pointed out that in enforcing any regulations, the basic tenets of fair procedure and natural and constitutional justice must be upheld.  Of course, if there are no suspect practices being carried out, there will be no issue for any contracting party to such relationships.</p></reply>

This programme of work, which is known as the Standard Authentication Framework Environment or SAFE for short, also provided for the introduction of a Public Services Card (PSC) to enable individuals to gain access to public services more efficiently and with a minimum of duplication of effort, while at the same time preserving their privacy to the maximum extent possible. </p><p>  The PSC is designed to replace other cards within the public sector such as the free travel pass and the social services card of the Department and to make it easy for providers of public services to verify the identity of customers.  The PSC contains advanced security features including the holder&rsquo;s photograph thus preventing usage by an ineligible person.</p><p>  The Personal Public Service Number (PPSN) is the individual&rsquo;s unique reference number for all dealings with Government Departments and public bodies.  The PPSN of the cardholder is provided on the PSC to supporting effective and efficient service delivery by Government Departments and agencies.</p><p>  Last December, the Department began issuing a new Free Travel variant of the PSC and over 180,000 such cards have been produced to date.   </p><p>  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) has been extensively consulted on all aspects of the PSC programme, including the inclusion of the PPSN of the face of the card.  The Department will continue to work very closely with the ODPC to ensure that the card is used in an appropriate manner and does not give rise to any data protection or identity theft concerns.</p></reply>

This comprehensive report encompasses the totality of the pension system in Ireland covering the State pension, private, occupational and public sector pensions.  The issues of sustainability; adequacy; modernity; and equity were central to this review.     </p><p>  Whilst endorsing pension policy reforms undertaken to date, the report makes a number of recommendations for future reform.  The OECD&rsquo;s key recommendation is to improve the adequacy of pensions by increasing coverage in the funded part of the pensions system through a universal mandatory or quasi-mandatory employment based pension system.    </p><p>  I have previously highlighted that a soft-mandatory approach such as that envisaged by an auto-enrolment scheme, using scale to achieve greater cost efficiencies for the member, is a very proactive way in which we can increase supplementary pension coverage, though it is recognised that introduction of such an initiative would be best supported by a more favourable economic environment than is currently the case.  </p><p>  To ensure the optimum solution for scheme members, the development of any universal pension scheme aimed at increasing pension coverage would involve the close consideration of all potential pension models including collective defined contribution. </p></reply>

For example, they cannot be engaged in employment, self-employment, training or education courses outside the home for more than 15 hours a week as this would impact on their caring responsibilities.

As Minister with responsibility for co-ordinating the Decade of Centenaries, I have been following the historical timeline closely, marking key stages in the progress of the 3<sup>rd</sup>Home Rule Bill through the parliament at Westminster. To mark the centenary of the introduction of the Bill, an exhibition was prepared that was hosted at Westminster in London, at the Houses of the Oireachtas and the National Library of Ireland in Dublin, and at Stormont in Belfast. This exhibition set the 3<sup>rd</sup>Home Rule Bill in its historical context and provided an insight into the political forces that drove, and restricted, the progress of the Bill. As the Bill was introduced in April 1912, I arranged, on its centenary in April 2012, the 'Redmond Memorial Lectures' in Waterford delivered by Frank Callinan SC and Dermot Meleady (see for further information). </p><p>My Department also supported the production of a supplement to the Irish Times <i>&quot;Home Rule and Ulster's Resistance&quot;</i>that was distributed free of charge to schools.  The provision of information, resources and primary source material has been a cornerstone of my strategy to commemorate important events and I am pleased to note that this week the RT&Eacute;/<i>Century Ireland</i>project, supported by my Department, is publishing details of John Redmond's moves to forge close links between the Irish Parliamentary Party and the Irish Volunteers in June 1914.</p><p>I have attended a number of events in Westminster highlighting the historical importance and the enduring significance of the Home Rule campaign and legislation. In January 2013, in partnership with NIO Minister Penning and Lord Bew, we arranged for a special presentation to mark the centenary of the second passing of the Bill. </p><p>Indeed, I am pleased to say that on 1 July next, I will be attending again at Westminster for a commemorative event arranged by the Speaker of the Commons, John Bercow, MP.  With contributions from John Bruton, Baroness Shirley Williams, Lord Paul Bew and Professor Michael Laffan, the event will attended by over 100 invited guests from parliament, media and academic life.  I hope to arrange that the proceedings will subsequently be available online.</p><p>While I am keen to ensure that the life and work of John Redmond is given appropriate recognition in the Decade of Centenaries, the role of other distinguished members of the Irish Parliamentary party should also be reflected. Initiatives rooted in the areas and communities from which they were elected would be particularly welcome. The specific arrangements for the anniversary of the legislation on 18 September and the address by John Redmond at Woodenbridge on 20 September 2014 remain under consideration and will include publication of historical resource material.</p><p>As indicated in the recent announcement of capital expenditure on commemorative projects, I consider it appropriate that provision is being made to restore the burial vault of John Redmond.</p></reply>

My Department assists local authorities in carrying out their role as competent authorities under waste legislation, which is to take the necessary measures, on behalf of the State, to ensure that any waste generated and left abandoned by the diesel launderers is disposed of ,   without endangering human health and without harming the environment. </p><p>Approximately 900 incidents of diesel laundering waste dumping have been dealt with by local authorities to date and my Department has up to now reimbursed the costs associated with such disposal on a case by case basis.

These discussions are on-going.   </p><p>I believe that a complete solution to this problem must necessarily involve effective and co-ordinated enforcement of the law from both a revenue and waste management perspective.   In that context, my Department continues to liaise with representatives of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the local authorities concerned and the EPA&rsquo;s Office of Environmental Enforcement to seek to identify more effective enforcement solutions and these engagements will continue.   </p></reply>

The remaining 20% of LPT collected will then be applied to equalise the impact of this level of local retention between local authorities.  </p><p>  This year, the establishment of Irish Water presents local government with significant organisational and financial challenges. Service provision responsibilities are moving from the local authorities to Irish Water, infrastructure is being transferred, financing arrangements have altered and local authorities are operating on behalf of Irish Water under Service Level Agreements. These changes must be managed and, in this context, it was necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority for 2014.</p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and, therefore, a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates. A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.</p><p>  In 2015, in addition to the changes in water services funding, local authorities will be required to implement changes to their budget process arising from EU obligations, which will require them to prepare draft budget strategies by the end of September 2014 and will also have the power to vary Local Property Tax rates by up to 15%. Together, these are further significant changes to the current local government funding model and it is essential that the impacts are fully assessed and that the effect on overall Exchequer funding is managed appropriately. </p><p>  My Department is currently considering the local government sector funding model for 2015, including the legislative implications, if any, in consultation with all relevant Government Departments. We will continue to work with local authorities to ensure that they have an appropriate level of information in a timely manner that facilitates their budget process for next year.  </p></reply>

My Department's role is to ensure that there is an adequate legislative and financial system in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation. </p><p>Accommodation for Travellers is provided across a range of options including standard local authority housing and Traveller-specific accommodation such as group housing and halting sites for bays funded under my Department's housing programme, private housing assisted by local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies, private rented accommodation and through their own resources.  It is open to Travellers to opt for any form of accommodation, including, where relevant, culturally appropriate Traveller-specific accommodation and local authority Traveller Accommodation Programmes are intended to reflect these preferences.  Local authorities have recently adopted a new round of Traveller Accommodation Programmes which will run from 2014 to 2018.  These programmes set out local authority investment priorities for Traveller accommodation for the next five years and identify the accommodation needs of Travellers and how these needs are to be met, using all of the housing supply options available to the local authority, including Traveller-specific accommodation. </p><p>The legislation places a strong emphasis on consultation with all relevant interests in the preparation of these multi-annual programmes.  The programmes are prepared in consultation with Travellers as well as with other public authorities, community and other relevant bodies and the public in general.  Submissions in relation to the programmes are sought by public advertisement.  In particular, local authorities are required to consult with the Local Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committees which are comprised of members and officials of the local authority and representatives of local Travellers and Traveller bodies.  These consultative arrangements ensure that the interests of all parties concerned with, or affected by, proposals for Traveller accommodation are considered and facilitate a planned and comprehensive response by local authorities to the accommodation needs of Travellers. </p><p>Details of the capital allocations to local authorities over the past five years for Traveller-specific accommodation are set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Allocation (&euro;)</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>35,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>15,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>6,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>4,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>3,000,000</td></tr></table></p></reply>

If it does, an owner must take steps to remedy the situation and may otherwise be liable for prosecution by the relevant local authority.   </p><p>  In relation to the specific concern regarding overlapping joints, I refer to the reply given to Question No. 567 of 27 May 2014 which sets out the statutory framework in place for ensuring structural safety in the design and construction of buildings in accordance with the requirements of the Building Regulations made pursuant to the Building Control Act 1990.  Any advice in relation to the compliance or otherwise of a specific building is a matter in the first instance for an appropriately qualified structural engineer.   </p><p>  In relation to the specific concerns regarding fire safety, the position is that Part B of the Building Regulations, and the accompanying Technical Guidance Document B, addresses fire safety.    In addition, Section 18 of the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003 places a duty on persons having control over premises, such as apartment complexes, to take all reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire and to ensure the safety of persons on the premises in the event of an outbreak of fire.  Furthermore, Section 22 of the Acts empowers fire authorities to inspect any land or building, including apartment complexes, for the purposes of the Acts.   </p><p>  Any concerns about the well-being and safety of members of the public in or near a particular building should be brought to the attention of the local authority in whose functional area the building concerned is situated.  Local authorities have considerable powers of inspection and enforcement under the various Acts referred to enabling them to take whatever action is reasonable and appropriate in all such cases.</p></reply>

I am happy to inform the Deputy that a total of &euro;4.45 million has been approved for works at Dunmore East Fishery Harbour Centre under the 2014 Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme.  The projects are as follows:<table><tr><th><div>Project</div></th><th><div>Approved Funding</div></th></tr><tr><td>Safety &amp;amp; Maintenance</td><td><div>&euro;225,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Disability Access</td><td><div>&euro;10,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Harbour Dredging</td><td><div>&euro;4,000,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Construction of Harbour Building Extension</td><td><div>&euro;220,000</div></td></tr></table></p><p>A major part of the funding approved relates to dredging works at the Fishery Harbour Centre. This maintenance dredging operation will cover the harbour area itself and the short incoming channel.  The works will not include dredging the channel towards Waterford as this area is not within the boundaries of the Fishery Harbour Centre.   The necessity for these works has been noted for some time to support and develop the fishing industry as well as assist other harbour users. I am happy that I was in a position to make the necessary funds available this year to complete this essential harbour development. </p><p>No cost benefit analysis has been carried out on the project. Siltation of the harbour is a major problem in Dunmore East, and has been occurring continuously over the years. I have sanctioned this dredging operation having had regard to the following considerations.</p><p>- The FHC hasn&rsquo;t been dredged for many years and recent siltation has seriously limited the available draught at the harbour entrance and throughout.</p><p>- Fishing vessels have also increased in size in recent years and this combined with the siltation seriously impedes their manoeuvrability.</p><p>- Vessels rest on the bed at low tide reducing their available time for fishing and a number of vessels have grounded in the middle of the harbour.</p><p>- The syncrolift is no longer usable due to siltation in this area.</p><p>- The lifeboat is restricted at low water.</p><p>The Request for Tender for the dredging project was published on the 26<sup>th</sup>May with a closure date 23<sup>rd</sup>June<b>. </b>It is expected that the contract will commence in early August.</p><p>There is regular consultation between local fishing groups and individuals and the Harbour Master, in addition there is also a regular Harbour Users Forum meeting attended by local fishing interests, other harbour users and officials from my Department.  The last meeting was held on the 2nd of Oct 2013 in Dunmore East. These interactions inform decisions on new developments at the Harbour.</p><p>The development and upkeep of Dunmore East as a state of the art Fishery Harbour Centre, supporting a broad range of marine related activities is and will remain an ongoing process. The dredging of the harbour together with the funding of the other developments outlined is part of a long term strategy to deliver on the potential of Dunmore East for job creation and as a tourist destination.</p></reply>

On marginal land a minimum level of activity will be required. </p><p>  In addition, a farmer must be eligible to receive an allocation of entitlements.  Any farmer who was entitled to receive a direct payment in 2013 (Single Payment, Grassland Sheep Scheme, Burren Life Scheme, Beef Data Scheme) is automatically eligible to receive an allocation of new entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015.  Farmers who have stud farms or other equine farms and who were entitled to receive a direct payment in 2013 are eligible to receive an allocation of new Basic Payment Scheme entitlements. </p><p>  The number of entitlements allocated will be based on the number of hectares of eligible land declared by the farmer in 2013 or in 2015, whichever is the lesser.  The value of entitlements will be a percentage of the value of the Single Payment entitlements owned by the farmer in 2014, together with the value of the Grassland Sheep payment, if any. </p><p>  A farmer who is not automatically eligible to receive an allocation of new entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, but who was actively farming in 2013, may qualify for an allocation under the &quot;Scottish Derogation&quot;.  The so-called Scottish Derogation provides for an allocation of entitlements under the new Basic Payment Scheme in 2015 to persons who never held entitlements, either owned or leased, under the current Single Payment Scheme.  In addition such persons must provide verifiable evidence that they produced an agricultural product in the beef, dairying, sheep or arable sectors in 2013.  Stud farms and other equine farms who were not also engaged in the named sectors would therefore not be eligible for an allocation of Basic Payment Scheme entitlements under this category.  </p><p>  The statistics you have requested in respect of the number of applications received from stud farms or other equine farms for the allocation or purchase of Single Payment entitlements are not recorded by the Single Payment Division of my Department. </p></reply>

Since my appointment as Minister for Justice and Equality, I have been considering the many and varied issues that have arisen, and continue to arise, in relation to this key area of statutory reform.  Quite clearly significant legislative reform is required in this area - not least because of evolving jurisprudence and developments elsewhere.  Moreover, some of the reform measures required are patently more urgent than others.  For example, legislating to provide the means for a single procedure and related issues to deal with all protection claims is of priority in that it will provide the legislative framework for removing the structural delays which are a feature of our existing protection system.  I am particularly anxious, therefore, to ensure that legislation to deal at least with the more urgent issues is brought forward this year.  In that respect work by my officials on legislative reform in this area continues including in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of the Parliamentary Counsel. <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

These functions are provided from the Burgh Quay offices in respect of the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  The offices also provides a range of other immigration related services with in the region of 130,000 per annum attending.</p><p>  The nature of the services provided is such that it is demand led and accordingly, there are peaks and valleys in the numbers of callers at different times of the year.  The Burgh Quay offices are open for registrations from 8am to 9pm Monday &ndash; Thursday and 8am &ndash; 6pm on Fridays.  Whilst this requires significant staff resources, the long opening hours are aimed at catering for applicants who may be studying or working and find it more convenient to come to the office outside of office hours.  Specific times are set aside for certain categories of persons such as students.</p><p>  In common with the operation of immigration functions in other States, immigrants are required to present in person at our offices.  This is necessary and unavoidable for establishment of identity and as an anti-fraud measure and is the practice of immigration services worldwide.  My Department&rsquo;s customer service charter encompasses INIS and the organisation is continually seeking to improve the quality of services provided to customers.  A major overhaul of the public reception facilities in Burgh Quay with expanded, dedicated areas for dealing with the public has recently been completed.  In addition, the immigration service is planning to introduce an on-line booking system for appointments which is part of a wider plan to transfer the registration function from the Garda National Immigration Bureau to INIS.  The aim of the booking system is to give certainty to customers that they will be dealt with within a stated time window and at the same time enabling the immigration service to match its staff resources to meet demand at any particular time.  The new reception facilities have been designed to cater for such a system.</p><p>  Finally, I might add that this office is probably one of the busiest Public Offices with some of the longest opening times in the State.  As I indicated earlier, around 130,000 persons attend the Burgh Quay office each year, which I am sure the Deputy will appreciate presents ongoing logistical challenges.  While I am advised that over the past 18 months there has been no unmanageable issues with queues taking into account the scale of the operation involved, I nevertheless and anxious that queuing be reduced to the absolute minimum at the earliest possible opportunity.  I am confident that the measures outlined above will further improve the services provided to its customers calling to this office.</p></reply>

The European Network on Statelessness is a voluntary civil society coalition that campaigns on this issue and it has called for "All European states without a functioning statelessness determination procedure to make a clear commitment during 2014 to take necessary steps to introduce one by the end 2016".</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, based on looking at the situation in other jurisdictions, Ireland is not unusual in so far as it does not have a specific procedure for determining statelessness claims.  Of the nearly eighty countries to have ratified the 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons only a small fraction (including only four EU countries - Spain, Latvia, Hungary and UK) have put in place specific determination procedures for non-protection statelessness claims.</p><p>  While the position adopted by other jurisdictions clearly does not determine the actions that Ireland might take in this area, some caution is nonetheless necessary to avoid a situation where Ireland, as a small country, could become a destination for stateless persons seeking access to a determination process.  I have no immediate plans to introduce a formal determination procedure but will keep the matter under review, having regard also to developments in other jurisdictions and the nature of their determination procedures.</p></reply>

In particular, section 5 of the 1994 Act provides for the offence of disorderly conduct in public place and section 10 of the 1997 Act provides for the offence of harassment.</p><p>  If a person is being subjected to disorderly conduct or harassment, he or she should, of course, report it to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who can take the appropriate action to address such behaviour.  Consideration can also be given to consulting one's solicitor to explore whether appropriate civil remedies, including, perhaps, injunctive reliefs, might be appropriate in the circumstances of a given case.</p><p>  Moreover, since the activity referred to does not appear to fall within the &lsquo;household&rsquo; exemption under the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, i.e. the provision whereby personal data kept by an individual and concerned only with the management of his or her personal, family or household affairs or kept only for recreational purposes are exempt from the Acts, the recording of such personal data appears to come within the scope of data protection law.  This means that the person responsible for such recording is a &lsquo;data controller&rsquo; for the purposes of the Acts and any individual who is filmed may invoke the remedies provided under the Acts, including a right to establish the existence of personal data, a right of access to the data and a right to its erasure.  Enforcement of data protection law in this jurisdiction is a matter for the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.

That communication advised the person concerned of the requirement that they 'register' at their local Immigration Registration Office, in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 (2) (a) of the Immigration Act 2004.</p><p>Section 9 (2) (a) of the Immigration Act 2004 states the following<blockquote>&quot;.... a non-national shall comply with the following requirements as to registration:he or she shall, as soon as may be, furnish to the registration officer.......... and, unless he or she gives a satisfactory explanation of the circumstances which prevent his or her doing so, produce to the registration officer a valid passport or other equivalent document, issued by or on behalf of an authority recognised by the Government, which establishes his or her identity and nationality.&quot;</blockquote>Responsibility for the registration process referred to is vested in the Garda National Immigration Bureau, a dedicated Unit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with responsibility for immigration and border control matters.  As a result, in the event that the person concerned cannot, in spite of their best efforts, obtain a national passport, they will need to present to their local Immigration Registration Office documentary evidence of the formal efforts they have made to obtain such a document. This, however, is a matter which must ultimately be resolved between the person concerned and their local Immigration Registration Office.</p><p>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Under the Medical Practitioners Act, all medical degree courses and specialist training programmes in Ireland are required to be accredited by the Council. As of May 2011, doctors are legally obliged to maintain their professional competence by enrolling in approved professional competence schemes and following requirements set by the Medical Council.  In this context, the Council has established a range of professional competence schemes through formal arrangements with the recognised postgraduate training bodies.  Schemes are operated by the postgraduate training bodies and have been developed to drive good professional practice, which is centred on patient safety and quality of patient care.</p><p>  While there is no national screening of pregnant women for sickle cell disease, testing for the disease is carried out on a targeted basis in maternity hospitals.</p></reply>

However, I understand that the manufacturer of Fampyra supplied the drug free of charge to some patients who were prescribed the drug by their clinician. The manufacturer has recently decided to stop supplying the drug free of charge and, as a consequence, these patients are now faced with financing the drug themselves if they wish to continue with this drug treatment.   </p><p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) is responsible for the administration of the primary care schemes. The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine (Fampyra&reg;) in the GMS and community drugs schemes. </p><p>The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) for the assessment of new medicines. </p><p>In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website (). </p><p>The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. In these circumstances, the HSE has not approved the reimbursement of Fampridine under the GMS or other community drug schemes.</p><p>However, I am aware that studies are ongoing to assess the wider impact of Fampridine on both walking and quality of life for persons diagnosed with MS. The results of these studies will contribute to the evidence base demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of the product which can be used to support future applications for its inclusion on the lists of reimbursable items supplied under the GMS and other community drugs scheme.</p><p>In this context, I understand the manufacturer has indicated to the HSE that it intends to submit a revised application for Fampridine. The HSE will then re-consider the application in line with the agreed procedures and timescales for the assessment of new medicines.</p></reply>

This include the airport charges applied and the services that are operated from those airports. Policy in relation to the future of Cork Airport was decided by Government in November, 2012. This was at the time of the decision to separate Shannon Airport from the DAA. The Government decided that given the level of debt associated with the building of a new terminal at Cork Airport, the existing ownership model would be maintained for the present.</p><p>  That decision is consistent with the 2011 Booz and Co. Report on the future ownership and operation of Cork and Shannon Airports. As the Deputy will be aware that report found that Cork airport performs well under DAA ownership and management and operates to a sustainable business model.  In the circumstances, the DAA has established a Development Council for Cork Airport. This Council will provide for strong engagement and alignment among key stakeholders in the Cork region. It will serve to foster a common understanding, particularly at local level, of issues of concern, potential opportunities for growth and the operating performance of the airport. I hope the Council will be successful in its work as a vibrant Cork Airport will ultimately benefit both Cork and wider region.</p></reply>

The Government has made a very significant commitment in maintaining the pre-school year on a universal and free basis despite the current budgetary situation.   </p><p>  The free pre-school provision represents an annual investment in the region of &euro;175 million.  Almost every pre-school service (more than 4,300) in the State is participating in the programme with approximately 68,000 children availing of free pre-school provision each year.  The standard capitation currently provided is &euro;62.50 per week for each eligible child enrolled with a capitation of &euro;73 per week provided where services have staff who hold higher qualifications.  An increase in the standard capitation rate of &euro;10 per week for each eligible child would result in an additional cost of over &euro;25 million each year. </p><p>  More than &euro;260 million is allocated each year to support the childcare programmes implemented by my Department. These programmes support in the region of 100,000 children and the challenge is to maintain these programme in the current budgetary climate.   There is no further funding currently available to my Department that would allow me to increase the capitation payments to services participating in the ECCE programme.</p></reply>

Where a person has reasonable grounds for concern that a child is being or at risk of being abused or neglected or where a child has a complaint that he/she has been harmed, this should be referred to the local social work department of the  Agency. Such referrals can either relate to a child's welfare or where there is a concern of child abuse,  that is, physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse or neglect. Where a referral indicates that there is an immediate risk to the safety of a child, it is the practice of the Agency to respond immediately.</p><p>  The Agency has advised that all referrals receive an initial assessment to determine what further action is required in accordance with Children First Guidance (2011).  Any immediate protective action which may be required is taken in accordance with the Agency's statutory duty under the Child Care Act 1991.  Intervention is provided as appropriate ensuring at all times that it is proportionate and in accordance with an assessment of the child's needs.  Where it is not possible to deal immediately with a referral of abuse, those which are assessed as highest priority are dealt with in the first instance by social work teams.  All referrals received are reviewed and responses monitored. </p></reply>
