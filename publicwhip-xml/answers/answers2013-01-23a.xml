    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-23a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013012300062#WRB00700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 13, 29, 37 and 40 together.</p><p>  The Government website www.etenders.gov.ie is a fully managed electronic tendering system that meets Ireland&#8217;s requirements in relation to the European Union&#8217;s requirements to meet the EU target for achievement of 100% capability for electronic tendering.</p><p>  This website is the official Government website for public tenders for goods, services and works. It serves as a repository for notices above EU thresholds and which must be advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union. In accordance with policy guidelines from my Department contracting authorities are also obliged to publish all tender notices for goods and services with a value greater than &#8364;25,000 on the eTender website. In 2012, there were 6,439 notices published on this site. </p><p>  It was necessary in 2011 to go to the market for a replacement for the old eTendering system as the contract with the original service provider was coming to an end. </p><p>  The tender for the new service followed an in depth market analysis by a cross-agency steering group, including representatives from the HSE and Departments of Finance and Justice. Research for the specification also included presentations of systems by some of the leading service providers in the market place.</p><p>  The new site, as well as publishing contract notices has a wide range of additional functionality that in effect will allow other aspects of the procurement process to be completed electronically, including assessment, awarding and contract management. This additional functionality is improving and generating efficiencies for both the public and private sectors. </p><p>Following an EU wide tendering process, during which no Irish company submitted a tender, the contract to provide the service was awarded to a new service provider, a Swedish company EU Supply Holding AB, Arbetargatan 33, 112 45 Stockholm,Sweden.<font color="#FF0000"> </font>   The cost of the new system is &#8364;677,459 over the five-year life of the contract. This works out at &#8364;33,873 per quarter over the lifetime of the contract, which is a considerable saving on the &#8364;57,690, which was paid to the previous service provider - for the previous service - in the last quarter of 2012.  </p><p>  Prior to launching the new site on the 12 of November 2012, apart from detailed user guides and briefing of their representative bodies, registered Suppliers were also informed about the proposed change of system at various Meet the Buyer events and other seminars. Training on the system was offered to all public sector Buyers before the new system went live and over 1,200 buyers availed of these opportunities. These training opportunities are ongoing. The service provider also provides personal support to the approximate 80,000 registered users of this site through a Helpdesk facility.</p><p>  The new system went live on the 12 of November 2012. Even allowing for the trebling of the server capacity for the initial days following the launch, the volume of users accessing the system (10,000 users signed in that day where there would normally be a maximum daily average of 500 users) caused a delay in the server response times. Some incorrect server settings were also detected that day. These access and response issues were resolved that day and have not arisen since. </p><p>Separately users to the national portal informed the NPS during the week of 12 November of claims that they had received unsolicited marketing emails from the previous operator of the service, marketing a new service. This caused widespread confusion among public sector Buyers and Suppliers and resulted in a large number of calls of complaint to the Helpdesk. The NPS is in discussions with the Office of the Data Protection Commission and is aware that the previous operator has issued an apology to some users of the old eTenders website for using their contact details for this purpose.</p><p>  Most of the complaints since the launch of the new site relate to the confusion caused by the previous service provider who had issued user names and password for their new Mytenders system. Many users tried to access eTenders using these usernames and passwords, but obviously could not gain access, leading to a lot of angry calls to the Helpdesk. By the end of the second week after going live, and after the confusion caused by Mytenders had been resolved, Helpdesk calls were down to less than 250 routine calls per day. </p><p>  Data migration issues from the previous operator to the new operator of the eTender website also created problems for Suppliers to receive alerts within their area of business about new tenders published from Monday 12 November. </p><p>  In relation to live tenders that transferred from the old system to the new system, over the weekend of 10 November, some data migration issues arose and were resolved within a few days.</p><p>  The National Procurement Service communicated with all registered Suppliers and Buyers, in the days following the launch of the new site, advising them of the solutions to the issues that arose, apologised for the early problems and acknowledged the inconvenience arising.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-23a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013012300062#WRB00900"><p>For each of the nine quarters since the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support commenced in late 2010, the Government has successfully met all of the targets.  In the expenditure area, discussions with Troika officials have been proceeding satisfactorily with a focus upon the continued attainment of spending targets and the steps necessary to address particular areas of pressure.  It may be helpful to present a summary overview of the type of issues and considerations that are relevant in this overall area at present.</p><p>  The end-year underlying Departmental expenditure position, adjusting for PRSI receipts, has been kept on target, with only a 0.4% deviation from target.  The majority of Departments were broadly on profile by end-December.  There were net overspends in the areas of Social Protection and Health.  The Social Protection overspend was mainly due to lower than expected PRSI receipts in 2012 and increased expenditure on unemployment related schemes.  These pressures arise from a weaker than anticipated economic environment which has been factored into the latest forecasts underpinning Budget 2013.</p><p>  As regards health, the key factors contributing to the 2012 expenditure overrun include: hospital activity levels in excess of service plan targets, lower than projected income from private health insurance companies, and medical card and drug scheme expenditures increased at a higher rate than previously anticipated.  The Department of Public Expenditure &amp; Reform will continue to work with the Department of Health in ensuring that health spending is managed within the agreed ceiling for 2013.  </p><p>  This Government's approach to addressing the management of expenditure over the medium-term has been clearly set out in the <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014</i>   (CER) published by the Minister for Public Expenditure &amp; Reform on 5 December 2011.  The CER introduced fixed multi-annual expenditure ceilings for all Departments in line with commitments made under the Troika programme of support.  The intention of this reform measure is to improve the focus on medium-term, structural and strategic planning of expenditure within each area and to prevent spending overruns where possible.  Under this measure, multi-annual current expenditure ceilings are fixed for each Department in order to make clear, in advance, the resources available for each area and the level of savings required.  </p><p>The ceilings were set out on an administrative basis in 2012 and the <i>Expenditure Report 2013</i>   published by the Minister on 5 December 2012 accounted for minor technical adjustments to these ceilings due to a number of social and economic developments over the past year.  The ceilings will be put on a statutory footing in the coming months.  This will ensure that the reform becomes a permanent structural feature of Ireland&#8217;s budgetary framework.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-23a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013012300062#WRB01100"><p>I presume the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the position pertaining under Freedom of Information legislation.  Section 27 of the Freedom of Information Act sets out categories of information which are classed as commercially sensitive and are on that basis exempt from release under the Act.  The basis to commercial sensitivity includes trade secrets, financial, commercial, scientific, technical or other information whose disclosure could reasonably be expected to result in a material financial loss or gain to the person to whom the information relates or prejudice the competitive position of that person in the conduct of his or her business or the conduct of contractual negotiations.  The consultation procedures laid down in section 29 of the Act must be followed before making a final decision on disclosure of such records.  In addition, commercially sensitive information may be released, for example, if the information, or similar information is already in the public domain or if the provider of the information was informed before providing the information that such information could be made available to the public.  It is also very important to note that if in the opinion of the head concerned, the public interest would, on balance, be better served by granting than by refusing to grant the request, the issue of possible commercial sensitivity can be set aside and the relevant records released. </p><p>  In view of the diversity of situations in which information which is potentially releasable under FOI can give rise to issues of commercial sensitivity careful examination is required of the individual circumstances applying in each case.  Detailed guidelines are available from the FOI Central Policy Unit&rsquo;s website www.foi.gov.ie on the interpretation and implementation of  section 27 requirements relating to commercially sensitive information including from relevant custom and practice and case law in this area.  In addition, the Office of the Information Commission publishes decisions on reviews on her website and special reports which provide extensive guidance to public bodies on how the Information Commissioner assesses decisions of public bodies in relation to FOI requests which would include records classed as commercially sensitive.  The steps that may be necessary to strengthen and enhance current guidance to FOI for decision-makers more generally relating to the operation of the Act will be considered as part of the forthcoming operational and management review of FOI which is expected to commence shortly. </p><p>  I do not currently propose to make any changes to section 27 of the FOI Act in relation to the exemption available for commercially sensitive information.  In my recent discussion with the Oireachtas Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform Committee on my proposals for the reform and extension of FOI, I made clear however that in the context of the pre-legislative scrutiny process being carried out on the FOI legislation, I am open to any case that may be made relating to any matter encompassed by the proposed legislation.</p></reply>

It is supported in its work by implementation groups established in each sector.  Under the terms of the Agreement, sectorial managements submit Action Plans to the Body which set out the range of measures and reforms which are to be implemented.  The Body monitors implementation of these measures and maintains contact with sectorial managements as part of this process.  </p><p>  The Body formally reports on its assessment of progress under the Agreement to the Government on an annual basis.  The Body has conducted two annual reviews to date and has published two comprehensive Annual Reports outlining the progress made on delivering savings and reform under the Agreement.</p><p>  The Implementation Body&rsquo;s third annual review of the Public Service Agreement will get underway in the coming weeks and as with other reviews, it will assess the sustainable savings that have been facilitated under the framework of the Agreement in its third year (1 April 2012 to 31 December 2012).  As before, it will also scrutinise the level of progress being made on implementing the reform measures set out in the Action Plans in each sector.  I look forward to the outcome of that review which I expect will be published in March.</p><p>  As Deputies are aware, discussions have commenced with public service trade unions on extending the Public Service Agreement and, it would not be appropriate to comment on possible future implementation arrangements whilst those discussions are ongoing.</p></reply>

It is envisaged that the competition will take place later this year.  It is the Minister's intention to safeguard the rates of commission paid to retailers under the terms of the next licence.  </p><p>  I acknowledge the concerns of retailers and the importance to them of income from National Lottery sales, particularly in the current economic climate.  I am also aware of the central role which retailers have played in the great success of the National Lottery since its inception.  It is envisaged that retailers will continue to be central to the operation of the National Lottery over the 20 year term of the next licence.  I am confident that there will be strong growth in National Lottery sales under the next licence with an alignment of interests between the next licence holder, retailers and the State, reaping benefits for all concerned.</p></reply>

To meet this commitment the Medium Term Fiscal Statement indicated that, in addition to the overall consolidation of &euro;3.5 billion required for 2013, an additional &euro;3.1 billion  in savings and revenue raising measures must be identified for 2014 and &euro;2 billion in 2015. If the public service pay and pensions bill at 36% of spending  is to make a proportionate contribution to the necessary additional expenditure reduction currently identified as necessary for the next 3 years based on current economic forecasts, it will require a further reduction of some &euro;1 billion in the cost of the pay and pensions bill.</p><p>  Model simulations conducted using the ESRI&rsquo;s HERMES suggest that a &euro;1 billion reduction in the public service wage bill would reduce the level of economic activity by somewhere in the region of &frac14; to &frac12; a percentage point in the short-run. The exact impact would, of course, depend on how the reduction was achieved.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-23a.34.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013012300062#WRB02200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 35 together.</p><p>  The matter of social clauses in public contracts is something that I have been examining closely recently. </p><p>  Social clauses can be used in public procurement in cases where they are targeted at factoring into the procurement process consideration of social issues such as employment opportunities, equal opportunities and social inclusion.  In order to be compatible with EU law, they must be made known to all interested parties and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States.</p><p>  The European Commission issued guidance in 2010 that identified a range of social considerations that could be relevant for procurement including promoting employment opportunities for young unemployed or long-term unemployed and promoting compliance with core labour standards. This guidance stressed that when incorporating social considerations into the procurement process one of the key challenges is ensuring compliance with the EU Treaty Principles and the Procurement Directives. The EU procurement directive primarily envisages that social considerations may be included as contract performance conditions, provided they are not discriminatory and are included in the contract notice or in the contract documents and relate to the performance of the contract. For example, the EU Directive states that contract performance conditions may be intended to favour on-site vocational training, the employment of people experiencing particular difficulty in achieving integration, the fight against unemployment or the protection of the environment. </p><p>  Challenges arise from the need to ensure that: value for money is not adversely affected; additional costs are not placed on domestic suppliers relative to other potential suppliers; and the targeted benefit is capable of being measured and monitored during execution of the contract.</p><p>  The inclusion of social clauses in the procurement process would appear to be most suited to situations where the social benefit could be considered a core requirement and can be directly linked to the contracting authority&rsquo;s policy or strategic plan. Experience in other Member States, would also indicate that social clauses will tend to be used for services and works contracts rather than supply contracts.  A further consideration is the ability of contracting authorities to effectively monitor compliance with the social clause; this may be more difficult where some of the work is to be performed in another Member State. </p><p>  The Government has a wide range of measures that it is deploying to facilitate job creation and support labour activation, with particular emphasis on assisting the long term unemployed people.  Obviously, the main purpose of the public procurement process is to ensure that goods, services and works are purchased by the State in a manner that is legal, transparent and of high probity, and our key requirement is the achievement of value for money.  Within this context, I have been looking with the Department and the National Procurement Service to see whether the use of social clauses as an additional means of supporting activation and we are seeking to identify the scope for the use of social clauses in parts of the capital area in particular.</p></reply>

These guidelines set out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote SME involvement in a manner that is consistent with the principles and rules of the existing public procurement regulatory regime. The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.  The key provisions of the guidance include: supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &#8364;25,000 or more to be advertised on the <i><font color="#0000FF">www.etenders.gov.ie</font></i> website; less use of &#8220;restrictive&#8221; tendering procedures and greater use of &#8220;open&#8221; tendering; ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract; and sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical.</p><p>  Circular 10/10 has been in place for just over two years. It is clear that there is a need to ensure greater consistency in relation to the implementation of this circular. In this regard, the National Procurement Service (NPS) established its 'Working Group to assist Small and Medium Enterprises' in February 2012 to facilitate open discussion on the issue of public service procurement. The Working Group consists of representatives from the NPS, the Health Service Executive, the Irish Business and Employers Federation, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, Chambers Ireland, and the Small Firms Association. The Group has met on a number of occasions and has raised many issues relating to procurement and particularly how these issues impact on SMEs.  Resulting from these discussions the NPS  has issued two circulars to all buyers in, and suppliers to, the public service with the aim of improving practice in the procurement arena.</p></reply>

The stated purpose of the measure was to achieve a medium term structural reduction in the pay bill cost of the public service, and as a contribution towards improving Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness. The measure also had regard to the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 (Croke Park Agreement) which provides for no further reduction to the rate of pay of serving public servants.</p><p>  The application of reduced scales contributes to the necessary sustainable reduction in the public service pay bill required in a period where pressure on the public purse and the need for cost reduction and containment measures is unprecedented. While recruitment to the public service is limited, the available evidence from recent recruitment campaigns indicates that employment in the public service continues generally to attract large numbers of well qualified applicants while there have been no reported difficulties in intra staff relations or service delivery.</p><p>  Discussions are currently underway between public service employers and the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in relation to an extension of the Public Service Agreement with the stated intention to reach agreement on securing overall savings of an additional &euro;1 billion from the public service pay bill by 2015. Pay rates for all employees including those subject to the 10% reduction will form part of those discussions.</p></reply>

Continued reductions in public service numbers in line with Government policy will go a considerable way towards achieving this saving. Significant progress has already been made in this regard.</p><p>  End 2012 preliminary returns show that serving numbers in the Public Service were some 290,300, some 30,000 below the 2008 levels.  I wish to point out to the Deputy that there is no blanket moratorium on recruitment in the public sector. There are always certain limited exceptions for example in relation to some frontline posts, or statutory positions, etc. where a sufficiently strong business case is made.  When any vacancy arises the first issue to be considered must always be if the post still needs to be filled, or if the work can be discharged in any other way.</p><p>  In the Health and Education sectors in particular special arrangements are in place for exemptions to the moratorium on recruitment for specified grades or positions. However, it is part of the day to day function of the Boards and Management of all public bodies to assess, budget and plan for current and ongoing staffing requirements within existing resources.</p><p>  The operation of the moratorium is under constant review by my Department and where it is considered prudent it may be adapted. However, if the general moratorium on recruitment and promotion was lifted and numbers were allowed to return to their former levels the paybill would also increase over time and accordingly a substantial part of the current, hard won savings would be lost.  For instance if Public Service Numbers were allowed to return to 2010 levels the increase in the paybill would be in the region of &euro;500m.</p></reply>

Roscommon.  Under the scheme local authorities are responsible for the planning, procurement, detailed financial management and day-to-day implementation of the works. </p><p>  I am advised that, before undertaking works, the Council engaged a firm of Consulting Engineers to study and assess the catchment of the River Suck in the vicinity of Athleague and to recommend flood alleviation measures. </p><p>  The following works were undertaken by the Council:</p><p>  - Site investigation works,</p><p>  - The clearance of existing drainage channels within the village, particularly to the north of the main street,</p><p>  - The reinstatement of a drainage channel between the Creamery and old Church (now a craft centre) just west of the Suck River 	bridge,</p><p>  - The clearance of two existing large diameter pipes, just to the east of the Suck River bridge,</p><p>  - Accommodation works connected with the reconstruction of the Silver Stream under existing walls, and tree cutting and removal.</p><p>  I am advised that the Council did not proceed with the construction of a diversion weir and channel upstream of Castlestrange bridge as the report it commissioned prior to works commencing concluded that this would not provide an appropriate level of flood protection to Athleague.  The flood level of the River Suck within Athleague is significantly influenced by the backwater effect from capacity restrictions within the existing channel of the river and the proposed works upstream of Athleague would not have alleviated this. </p><p>  Regarding insurance, I am aware of the difficulties some people are experiencing in securing insurance cover for flood risk at affordable prices or at all.  It must be acknowledged that the provision of new flood cover or the renewal of existing flood cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies based on their assessment of the risks they are accepting.  These are generally considered on a case-by-case basis and an insurance company cannot be compelled to accept a particular insurance risk.  The Irish Insurance Federation say that insurers try to provide flood cover wherever possible but that flood insurance is sometimes not economically viable. </p><p>  In March 2012, I had a very constructive engagement with the insurance industry about the scope and scale of the work undertaken by the OPW on flood risk management, on the alleviation schemes being undertaken in many of our large cities and towns and, in particular, on the mapping of areas subject to flood risk nationally which will emerge from the CFRAM programme. </p><p>  I indicated then that I wished to see an agreement reached as quickly as possible between the OPW and the IIF on a sustainable system of information sharing particularly for locations vulnerable to flooding and for identifying flood alleviation schemes and works completed and where the standard of protection afforded by these works could be verified.</p><p>  A working group has been established between OPW, the IIF and representatives of several insurance companies to progress the work in this area in order that the insurance industry can be better informed as to the extent of the OPW's investment in flood protection measures over the last decades and to ensure that that investment is taken into account in assessing flood risk for insurance purposes.</p></reply>

Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year.  Obviously, this affects the phasing and profiling of capital expenditure.  In addition, public financial rules require that payments are only made on foot of matured liabilities, so payments made in the later parts of the year are made on foot of work that has already been satisfactorily completed.  The trend is therefore that the bulk of capital expenditure takes place in the final quarter of the year.</p><p>  All Departments are required to report to my Department on a monthly basis on their actual expenditure (both capital and current) compared with their published profiles and to explain variances where they arise.  My officials liaise with Departments to ensure that any issues are addressed promptly in order that there are no expenditure overruns and, in relation to capital expenditure, that projects and programmes are progressed in a timely manner.  I am happy that the arrangements for monitoring capital expenditure which are presently in place are effective and robust.</p></reply>

I expect that progress will be further intensified in relation to a number of key reform priorities in the course of 2013. </p><p>  The Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Bill 2012 is currently at an advanced stage of drafting by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and is due to be published in the spring Oireachtas session.  This legislation will provide a comprehensive statutory framework for inquiries carried out by the House(s) of the Oireachtas consistent with the current constitutional framework.</p><p>  Drafting of the Public Interest Disclosure Bill is also at an advanced stage which will provide comprehensive protections for whistleblowers in the workplace.  The Bill is included in the Government&rsquo;s programme of legislative priorities for the current Oireachtas session.  The pre-legislative scrutiny of the Government&rsquo;s proposals for the reform and extension of FOI by the Oireachtas, Finance, Pubic Expenditure and Reform committee has commenced and drafting of the Bill is also underway in parallel, with the objective of publishing the Bill by the end of this quarter.  This legislation will also deal with the issues of confidential communication with public representatives.</p><p>  Following the publication of the Final Report of the Mahon Tribunal in March 2012, I committed to examining how the existing legislative framework for ethics could be reformed. Substantial preparatory work has been carried out by my Department in relation to this significant legislative project to date.  I propose to advise Government of the proposed legislative approach in the coming months and expect to initiate a wider consultative process at that time.</p><p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists and rules governing the conduct of lobbying.  The Final Report of the Mahon Tribunal also recommended the introduction of lobbying regulation and a code of practice governing the conduct of lobbying.  My Department has engaged in extensive consultation on these matters over the past 12 months with stakeholders.  I published a policy paper last July setting out my broad policy proposals and the General Scheme of a Bill was circulated to Government Departments at the end of last year for their observations.  It is my intention to bring the final proposal to Government shortly for approval to commence drafting of the Bill.</p><p>  The Government Reform Unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is currently preparing a policy paper on civil service accountability which will examine the current legislative framework underpinning civil service accountability, as well as the current administrative accountability arrangements in place.  To inform this policy development, a consultation process is being undertaken, initially including academics, civil servants and international commentators.  Following publication of the policy paper, this consultation process will be expanded to include a broad spectrum of stakeholders and other experts. </p><p>  As part of the reform of the political expenses regime, in the context of the Expenditure Estimates for 2013, I announced further changes to the system of allowances and expenses payable to members of the Oireachtas.  There has been a 10% reduction - 25% in the case of Dublin members - in travel and accommodation expenses and the public representational allowance will be vouched and the vouched amounts reduced.  It also intended to reduce by 50% the number of pre-paid envelopes available to members and the unvouched elements of the secretarial scheme.</p><p>  The Government has also decided that a 10% reduction will be applied to the Party Leaders&rsquo; Allowance rates payable to qualifying leaders of political parties and to qualifying independent members.  In addition, I announced my intention to amend the legislation to improve the transparency of the allowance by providing for auditing provisions to apply to independent members in receipt of such payments.  </p><p>  The 10% reduction will be applied to the rates of the Party Leader&rsquo;s Allowance in parallel with the other changes announced to the Party Leaders Allowance in my address to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the Expenditure Estimates for 2013, and my Department has already commenced preparations on the changes to primary legislation necessary to effect these changes.  In addition, as I announced in the Expenditure Estimates, severance payments to Ministers and other Officeholders will be abolished.  </p><p>  I do not intend at this time to bring forward my proposals on constitutional reform in so far as my own area of responsibilities are concerned. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-23a.87.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013012300064#WRD02200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 101, 102, 106 to 109, inclusive, and 112 together. </p><p>  The Government is making good progress on achieving all of our targets and priorities, as articulated in the Government programme.  We are bringing public expenditure back to a sustainable level and driving forward the public service reform agenda to ensure that efficiencies and reformed work practices play a full part in contributing to the overall budgetary consolidation effort.</p><p>  The Government began the process of medium-term expenditure management with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE) exercise in 2011, which was carried out by all Departments to identify ways of reducing expenditure, in line with commitments under the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland, while minimising the impact on service delivery.</p><p>  Ministerial expenditure ceilings for 2012 - 2014 were introduced on an administrative basis in the <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report</i>, published in December 2011.  The CRE exercise forms the foundation of these ceilings and is the basis for all subsequent decisions on expenditure.  The precise composition of the 2013 budgetary consolidation was set out in the Expenditure Report 2013, published on 5 December, 2012.</p><p>  As regards discussions with the Troika, there has been a series of meetings held with the Troika to appraise all the elements of the programme covering fiscal developments, the macroeconomic outlook, progress on commitments regarding restructuring of the financial sector and structural reform.</p><p>  In keeping with an EU/IMF Programme commitment, the expenditure ceilings are to be put on a statutory footing, which will ensure that this reform measure becomes a permanent structural feature of Ireland&#8217;s budgetary framework.  The necessary legislative change to introduce the Medium Term Expenditure Framework is included in the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2012<i>,</i> which was published on 28 September.  In essence, the Bill provides for the power of the Government to set out an overall ceiling for aggregate current expenditure for each of the following three years and for the aggregate ceilings to be apportioned into Ministerial expenditure ceilings.  The annual Estimates of Expenditure must, in turn, not exceed the overall limits set out by the Government.</p><p>  With reference to reform delivery, the Government&#8217;s ambitious Public Service Reform Plan was published in November, 2011 and sets out the basis for the comprehensive and strategic reform of the Irish Public Service.  Effective structures to drive and monitor the implementation of the reform plan have been put in place.  The Cabinet Committee on Public Service Reform is driving the reform agenda at political level. </p><p>  Last September, a statement on the progress on the implementation of the reform plan was published.  The Reform and Delivery Office is working closely with organisations across the Public Service and good progress continues to be made in the implementation of the reform plan.  For example:</p><p>  - The new approach to public procurement will involve integrating procurement policy, strategy and operations in one office; strengthening spend analytics and data management; much greater aggregation of purchasing across public bodies to achieve better value for money; evaluating demand levels to assess how demand (volume) can be reduced; and strengthening vendor and category management. </p><p>- Government approved the establishment of a HR Shared Service Centre for the Civil Service called PeoplePoint  .  The centre will provide routine high volume HR and Pensions Administration for 40 public bodies on one HR Management System.  Pensions shared service will be integrated with the HR shared service.  Following a baselining study on Civil Service payroll arrangements, a business case for the development of a Civil Service payroll is at an advance stage.  Baselining of finance management and banking arrangements across the Civil Service is also underway. </p><p>  -Following a Government decision last year, all proposed new services across the public service will be first tested for external service delivery before any approval to provide the service internally will be granted.  A shortlist of potential major projects for priority implementation is being prepared and the main sectors are also developing their own external service delivery plans.</p><p>  - The Croke Park agreement will continue to be an essential element in enabling the comprehensive reforms that are taking place across the system.  The agreement is supporting a significant and sustainable reduction in payroll costs in the public service as well as supporting the implementation of measures aimed at reducing operating costs and generating greater administrative efficiencies.  The implementation body has reported total savings in the order of &#8364;1.5 billion over the first two years of the agreement, which comprises of approximately &#8364;810m and &#8364;680m in pay and non-pay savings, respectively.  This is happening in a climate of industrial peace in the public service, the value of which is often overlooked.  </p><p>  While good progress has been made on delivering savings and implementing change, it remains a matter for each Minister and their Departments to ensure that the Vote-level allocations are adhered to and at the same time ensure that they continue to provide essential frontline services and respond to increasing demands.</p></reply>

It is estimated that with the establishment of <b><i>PeoplePoint</i></b>   and post 2014, when all 40 Departments and Offices have transitioned and the shared service is stabilised that the annual cost of HR services for the civil service will be reduced significantly by &#8364;12.5m per annum.</p><p> - Payroll services administered by the Civil Service have been baselined and a business case to drive greater efficiencies and improved payroll services through Payroll Shared Services is well advanced. </p><p> - A project to gather data to baseline current Civil Service Finance Management and Banking activities has commenced.</p><p> - The Shared Services Transformation Unit in my Department is working with nominated senior officials to ensure that robust Share Services plans are developed and implemented in the other key sectors of Health, Education, Justice, Defence and Local Government.</p><p>  Shared Services aims to achieve effective, cost-efficient internal non-core services, that delivers high-quality services and value for money.  </p><p>  Global studies on implementing Shared Services in the public and private sectors highlights that shared services projects are complex especially where there are multiple stakeholders and multiple ICT solutions in place.</p><p>  The UK National Audit Office Report (2012) blamed poor co-ordination, costly IT systems, weak sanctions and demands for tailored services for the spiralling costs.  The report recommended that strong governance, baselining, standardisation of processes, robust service management, benefits realisation tracking, change management and continuous improvement be implemented for all future projects.</p><p>  In the Civil Service, we are seeking to implement the lessons learned from this report in the following ways: </p><p><b>1. Strong Programme Management and Governance: </b>We are building capability in programme management and project management. A strong governance model is being developed to ensure transparent accountability and to ensure a compliant harmonious service oriented organisation.  </p><p><b>2. Baselining:</b> Our Shared Service methodology involves managing each Shared Services programme at a controlled speed.  A business case is prepared for each Shared Service project. The financial and non-financial value of all possible options is considered to evaluate value for money to the taxpayer and to monitor the realisation of benefits.</p><p><b>3. Standardisation of processes: </b>Learning from others our risk mitigation for lack of standardisation of processes is to design common standard efficient processes for implementation with minimal customisations.  Processes are being designed in collaboration with Customer Departments and Public Service Bodies to ensure that their needs are understood and represented in any future design. </p><p><b>4. Service Management:</b> The approach being taken to Service management includes  the documentation of services to be provided by the Shared Services Centre; that there is a clear segregation of duties between the Shared Service Centre and the retained organisation; that all standards and measures of performance are documented within a Service Delivery Guide. </p><p><b>5. Change Management and Continuous Improvement: </b>Shared Services requires the redesign and transformation of the remaining organisation and making staff changes after transactional work transfers to the Shared Services Centre.  The change management activities are being led by an organisation design team as an integral part of each Shared Services programme. </p><p>  Overall, I am satisfied with the progress being made.  A robust transformation plan is being implemented for the Civil Service. The government&#8217;s reform programme is delivering results.  The public service is changing.  The introduction of <b><i>PeoplePoint</i></b>   at the end of March will represent a very significant step in making Shared Services a reality across the public service. </p></reply>

This will be retained in the reform legislation. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister detailed the Government&rsquo;s proposals in the area of the reform and extension of FOI at my recent meeting with the Oireachtas Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform Committee to discuss the General Scheme of the FOI reform legislation the drafting of which is currently underway.  Some of the main features of the reform of FOI are: -</p><p> - the significant additional restrictions in access to Government records introduced in 2003 are proposed for repeal in full;</p><p> - the mandatory &lsquo;blanket&rsquo; class exemption for records relating to security, defence, international relations and Northern Ireland is also being removed; </p><p> - the scope for certifying the existence of a deliberative process by Secretaries General is also proposed for repeal and the original public interest test applying in such circumstances is being reinstated.</p><p>  While repealing the exemption relating to the costing of a public body of a proposal by a political party, my proposals maintain the exemption for records provided to Ministers for the conduct of parliamentary business.  The retention reflects the Government&rsquo;s strong view that the potential for the release of all such records, could significantly undermine the direct and explicit constitutional accountability of Ministers to the Oireachtas, secured through ministerial statements in the Houses and to Oireachtas committees and through replies to parliamentary questions.</p><p>  Despite the very substantial restrictions and limitations to FOI introduced in 2003, the introduction of &quot;up-front&quot; FOI fees for non-personal requests is often presented in public debate as the most significant curtailment to FOI made at that time, notwithstanding that such fees apply to about three in ten of all FOI requests and the practice by those making frequent non-personal FOI requests has often been to make multiple requests within a single application while paying one application fee.</p><p>  Consequently, in assessing priorities for reform on fee levels overall, I concluded that the introduction of prohibitive fees for internal review and appeal cases to the Information Commissioner (i.e. &euro;75 and &euro;150 respectively) represented the most serious impediment to ensuring the effective operation of the FOI system overall.</p><p>  The evidence is that the introduction of high fee levels in these areas has acted as a very strong disincentive to applications for both internal reviews and appeals by requesters who are dissatisfied with the decision-making of public bodies. </p><p>  The consequent diminution in oversight and scrutiny by the Information Commissioner of the implementation of the legislation by public bodies is unlikely to have a positive effect on the quality of decision-making or the extent to which decision-makers would apply key balancing tests, in particular relating to the public interest favouring release.</p><p>  The sharp reduction in the level of these fees to &euro;30 and &euro;50 (in the case of internal review and appeal fees respectively) is therefore, a core element of the overall package of FOI reforms.</p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that in my meeting with the Oireachtas Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform Committee I made clear that in the context of the pre-legislative scrutiny process being carried out on the FOI reform legislation I was open to any case that may be made relating to any matter encompassed by the proposed legislation.</p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the Information Commissioner already has the power, in effect, to publically reprimand a public body for the performance of its responsibilities under the Act.  In addition to the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s conclusions on the handling of FOI requests by public bodies under the Act arising from the publication of her Decisions and the content of her Annual Report under section 40 of the Act, if the Information Commissioner considers it appropriate to do so in the public interest, she may publish a report in relation to any investigation or review carried out by her including into the practices and procedures adopted by public bodies in facilitating requestors in exercising their rights under the Act.   I expect that the Information Commissioner would not hesitate to avail of this power - and others allowing her to report to the responsible Minister - in the highly unlikely circumstances that any public body essentially ignored its legal obligations under the Act which would also be likely to give rise to a criminal offence under the legislation.  </p><p>  I do not favour the introduction of a system of administrative sanctions such as fines for the Information Commissioner.  In addition to the significant and complex legal issues that arise in relation to any such scheme, I would be concerned that such an approach has the potential to erode the positive and constructive relationship between the Information Commissioner and public bodies overall in relation to the operation of the Act and the processing of appeal cases.  The Deputy will acknowledge that decision making on the release of particular records can often reflect finely balanced and carefully considered judgements. I do not believe it would be prudent or appropriate to provide a power to the Information Commissioner in such circumstances nor has the Information Commissioner sought such a power. </p></reply>

A tender which might be regarded as abnormally low or below cost may not be rejected without investigation and consideration of the relevant elements that gave rise to a particularly low bid.  Such elements might include an innovative technical solution or exceptionally favourable conditions available to the tenderer.  The tenderer should be given the opportunity to explain the basis of the tender.  Under Article 55 of 2004/18/EC; the EU Directive governing public procurement, contracting authorities are obliged to consider the constituent elements of a tender before it may reject a tender on the basis that it is abnormally low.  Having carried out an investigation on the constituent elements of the tender, should it consider the tender to be abnormally low, the contracting authority may reject the tender but is not obliged to.</p><p>  There is an acknowledgement that the construction industry has seen the greatest decline in activity and with it the highest rise in unemployment of all sectors in the economy.  The collapse in construction output from the high and unsustainable level of almost 25% of GNP (&euro;39 billion) in 2006 to just 7% of GNP in 2011 (&euro;8.7 billion) has been accompanied by intense competition resulting in a reduction of tender prices across the construction sector.  When investigating what may appear to be an abnormally low tender for a public works contract, contracting authorities must take into consideration the possibility that a contractor may be obtaining more favourable terms from suppliers and subcontractors than rival tenderers.  There is little scope for manoeuvre on labour costs since, under the public works contracts, contractors are required to pay workers covered by the Registered Employment Agreements the rates and additional costs set out in those agreements.  However, more efficient methods of working to reduce labour costs cannot be ruled out in assessing a tender.  Notwithstanding this, there is nothing to prevent firms from performing a contract at a loss, providing the contracting authority has satisfied itself that the contractor has the financial capacity to absorb that loss.</p></reply>

To this end, we agreed on 2 October 2012 to accelerate the reduction in Public Service numbers in order to achieve the previous end 2015 target of 282,500 by end 2014 instead. </p><p>  Greater efficiencies in the way the Public Service is going about its business means that some posts have been identified by Departments as surplus.  Where surplus staff cannot be redeployed, Voluntary Redundancy can now be used.  </p><p>  Initially Voluntary Redundancy will be rolled out in three areas &#8211; the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and specific parts of the Health and Education Sectors.  These Departments estimate that there will be scope to effect about 2,000 exits from these areas over time, mainly from back office and support areas and management and administrative grades. The availability of Voluntary Redundancy for these areas will be useful in supporting the achievement of organisational reforms and restructuring. Obviously, as Voluntary Redundancy is being targeted at areas with identified staff surpluses, there will not be replacement of the departing staff. </p><p>  It is proposed to proceed with these schemes as soon as possible. Each of the relevant Departments is liaising with my Department to ensure roll out of Voluntary Redundancy as soon as the necessary plans have been have been finalised and arrangements made. The Scheme may be rolled out to other areas of the Public Service if deemed appropriate.</p><p>  I would stress that there will be no automatic right to redundancy and all applications will be subject to ongoing business needs and service provision priorities.</p><p>  The terms of the Scheme will be as agreed between my Department and the Public Services Committee of ICTU which came into effect on 1 June last year.  A copy of the Collective Agreement is set out below.<div><b>Collective Agreement: Redundancy Payments to Public Servants</b></div>  Under the Public Service Agreement 2010 &#8211; 2014 the parties have agreed that Public Service numbers will be reduced in accordance with Government policy on public service numbers, as implemented through Employment Control Frameworks.  To that end, the Agreement states (paragraph 1.5) that, where the circumstances require it, the Government may offer voluntary mechanisms to exit the public service, whether generally or in specific sectors, bodies, locations or services. </p><p>  The Agreement includes a commitment (paragraph 1.6) by public service management that compulsory redundancy will not apply within the Public Service; however this is subject to some key qualifications, namely that it is subject to compliance with the terms of the Agreement, in particular on flexibility on redeployment.  There is a saver for circumstances &#8220;where existing exit mechanisms apply&#8221;.  There are established practices for making public servants redundant in appropriate circumstances, on the expiry of employment contracts or where redundancy terms have been agreed or generally applied<sup>1</sup>. </p><p>  It has been agreed on behalf of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Services Committee of ICTU that the following will apply, with effect from 1 June 2012, on the redundancy of a public servant as defined under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009 &#8211; 2011<sup>2</sup> or group or class of public servants<sup>3</sup>:  <blockquote>- Any <i>ex gratia</i> payment will amount to no more than 3 weeks pay per year of service, subject to the total statutory redundancy and <i>ex gratia</i>   payment not exceeding either 2 years&#8217; pay or one half of the salary payable to preserved pension age, whichever is less;<br /><br />- In accordance with the provisions in the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 - 2007, public servants in employment for less than 2 years [104 weeks] are not eligible for a severance payment (statutory or <i>ex gratia</i>);<br /><br />- Public servants will be advised in writing prior to acceptance of the <i>ex gratia</i>   payment that s/he will not be eligible for re-employment in the public service by any public service body (as defined by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009 &#8211; 2011) for a period of two years from termination of the employment.  Thereafter the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be required prior to re-employment. This declaration will also include an authorisation that their information (PPS number and details) can be used by their employer or any other public service body for the purposes of monitoring compliance with this provision. </blockquote><sup>1</sup>  The implementation Body established under the Agreement has noted [17 February 2012] that it was not intended that these practices would be superseded by the Agreement.</p><p><sup>2</sup>  Including public servants employed for a fixed term, meeting the criteria for redundancy under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967-2007 and to whom a redundancy payment is required to be paid in accordance with the Protection of Employees (Fixed Term Work Act) 2003.</p><p><sup>3</sup>  A public service employer may seek the sanction of its parent Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to make a collective agreement with a body representing relevant employees that varies some or all of the terms of this agreement.  The redundancy arrangements specified under DES Circular 0058/2006 are unaffected by this agreement.</p><p> This collective agreement will be reviewed from time to time in light of the prevailing economic and fiscal conditions.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-23a.130.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013012300067#WRJ01300"><p>The Valuation (Amendment) (No.2) Bill, 2012 had its second stage reading in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 11th October, 2012 and in the interim a number of organisations and bodies, including organisations representing various commercial ratepayers, have made detailed submissions to me on various aspects of the Bill. My officials have held consultations with the representatives of these organisations and this process is still underway. I am willing to meet other interested parties who express an interest in the provisions of the Bill as was pointed out in the course of the debate in the Seanad.</p><p>  As regards the definition of &#8220;material change of circumstances&#8221; (MCC), the position is that the valuations of individual properties are revised to reflect <i>physical </i>  changes that have occurred such  as new buildings, extensions, sub-divisions, exemptions, etc. This is a consequence of the statutory provisions expressly set out in Part 6 of the Valuation Act 2001 rather than any restrictive interpretation adopted by the Valuation Office. Individual properties the subject of applications for revision, are valued by reference to the values on the valuation list of other properties in the same rating authority area. The values are based on the actual physical characteristics of the property at the time of valuation.  </p><p>  On the other hand, the general revaluation provisions in Part 5 of the Valuation Act 2001 takes account of the economic changes that take place in the property market over time. A revaluation is where all properties in a rating authority area are valued by reference to market conditions prevailing at a specific valuation date and these valuations become effective for rating purposes at the same time across the entire rating authority area. Economic conditions prevailing at the date of revaluation are effectively frozen until the next revaluation takes place which, under the provisions of the 2001 Act, must take place every 5-10 years. As the property market is dynamic, it would not be possible to reflect ongoing economic changes in the valuation list and at the same time maintain stability between values on the list and equity and fairness between ratepayers. If revision of individual property values was to have regard to economic factors then a ratepayer whose property was being revised would be advantaged or disadvantaged vis-a-vis other ratepayers depending on the relative strength or weakness of the property market at that point in time. It is for that reason that a change in the MCC provisions has not been included in the Bill now before the Oireachtas.</p><p>  However, the restrictive nature of the MCC provisions means that in certain circumstances where it may be appropriate to amend a valuation, e.g. where an error occurred in relation to a valuation, it is currently not possible to do so. It is proposed therefore, to amend the Valuation Act, 2001, so that following a decision not to amend a valuation because no material change in the circumstances had occurred, the ratepayer may within 40 days make representations to the Commissioner of Valuation who can then amend the valuation so that it is comparable to the valuations of similar properties on the same valuation list.</p></reply>

By their nature PPP sector-specific contract provisions can be generic. For instance, contract provisions can be broadly similar for education, health, justice accommodation type projects, with certain individual differences or commercial arrangements. The model contract template for use in PPPs in Ireland is available on my Departments website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.ppp.gov.ie</font></i>  . </p><p>  However signed contracts are &#8216;commercially sensitive&#8217; reflecting the negotiated commercial positions consistent with the above template parameters and I am not convinced that publishing market sensitive information ensures value for money, and in fact can have the opposite effect.</p><p>  In accordance with our Public Financial Procedures (PFP) the Comptroller and Auditor General has for audit purposes unlimited access to the files of the NDFA and the NRA in relation to procedures adopted in procuring PPPs.  </p><p>  In addition throughout the contract period (both construction and operation) the contracting authority will:<blockquote>- monitor private partner performance (assisted by its own process monitor);<br /><br />- monitor the financial accounts of the PPP Co (monthly, semi-annual, annual); <br /><br />- inspect the site as appropriate;<br /><br />- review correspondence with the private consortium funders etc. on a needs be basis. </blockquote>  From the above, the contracting authority has visibility as to whether or not the private sector partner is performing its obligations, providing services in line with its contract and paying its debt obligations throughout the contract. </p><p>  Again, the Comptroller and Auditor General has access to all such information in the course of auditing these bodies.</p></reply>

The most important contribution capital investment can now make is in providing the capacity for the economy to grow, which will in turn create employment. </p><p>  The stimulus package included 1.4 billion euro to fund the proposed new Public Private Partnerships (PPP) programme.  This investment is directed towards projects that meet key infrastructural needs and are in line with the priorities in the Government's Investment Framework.  These projects will form the first phase of a new programme of PPPs designed to stimulate economic growth and create employment.  As the Phase 1 projects are progressed and as funding permits, projects that could be delivered as part of further phases will be considered.</p><p>  Job creation is a critical priority for Government.  Investment in the projects included in the Stimulus package is expected to generate significant numbers of jobs spread out across the country.  Analysis of each sector indicates that the investment may generate around 13,000 direct jobs and many more indirect jobs.  It will also create much needed social and economic infrastructure and aid economic recovery. </p><p>  The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) are working closely with Departments to progress projects and to accelerate delivery of this much needed activity. The preparatory work for the projects is well underway in the various Departments and Agencies.  At this early stage in the process most of the employment impact to date has been in the technical and advisory areas.  Further employment benefits will be evident as the projects progress through the tendering phase and the construction gets underway. </p><p>  The indicative timetable for the projects shows that the most advanced ones will be proceeding to tender from quarter 2 of this year and construction is expected to commence by end of 2014.  </p><p>  My Department together with the NDFA and the Sponsoring Authorities are also looking at how to maximise job creation as part of each tender competition that is in line with procurement regulations.  With the NDFA, we are also examining ways to encourage SME participation by facilitating access to the programme and the NDFA is working with Enterprise Ireland to organise awareness raising events for SMEs.</p></reply>

Mali has also been discussed during a number of bilateral exchanges at official and political levels between Ireland and France, including following the French military intervention at the request of the Malian authorities on 11 January.   The situation was discussed in detail at an extraordinary meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council, in Brussels on 17 January.  The Council was addressed by the French Foreign Minister, as well as by the Malian Foreign Minister. The Council had a comprehensive discussion on the crisis and made important decisions on the EU&rsquo;s collective response in the period ahead. </p><p>  This latest phase in the crisis began during the week of 11 January when militants based in the north pushed southwards towards Mali&rsquo;s capital, Bamako. The previous day, the UN Security Council stated that the deterioration in the situation threatened the stability and integrity of Mali &quot;and constitutes a direct threat to international peace and security&quot;. The Malian army, with support from France, launched operations to repel the advance.</p><p>  Following a meeting of the UN Security Council on 14 January, the Secretary General welcomed the response by bilateral partners to the call for assistance by the Government of Mali. The situation in Mali is very complex and volatile. I welcome the decision taken to accelerate the deployment of African regional forces to assist the Malian authorities. This effort is being led by the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS. The European Union will support the African-led mission. Furthermore, an EU training mission is being established to help strengthen the capacities of the Malian army.</p><p>  Military action alone will not secure lasting peace and stability.  EU Foreign Ministers have consistently pressed the Malian parties to adopt and implement a roadmap for a transition to democratic elections. When this is in place, the EU will be in a position to resume bilateral development cooperation and economic engagement with Mali.  It is also essential to have an inclusive process of reconciliation and peace building in Mali that respects the territorial integrity of the country and addresses ethnic divisions.</p><p>  We are seriously concerned about the impact of this crisis on the civilian population. Over the past year, Ireland has provided over &euro;9 million in emergency assistance for the Sahel region, including &euro;1.35 million for Mali and Malian refugees in neighbouring countries. We will provide further support in 2013.</p></reply>

I initially wrote to the correspondent in August last year, the first of a series of replies.  In this letter, I acknowledged his particular interest in the important work of strengthening access to ICT infrastructure in the immediate aftermath of natural disasters.  The individual specifically sought support from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for a contribution to attend a disaster response learning exercise in California. This correspondence was passed to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and while noting our interest in this area of work, I also explained to the correspondent that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is unfortunately not in a position at the present time to allocate financial support to the initiative.  </p><p>  In the same correspondence, I outlined some of the Department&rsquo;s existing engagement with this area of work.  In particular, I underlined that Irish Aid&rsquo;s Rapid Response Initiative already works closely with the United Nations agencies through the Standby-Partnership Programme (SBPP) and Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) to support the UN in providing information management and communications systems in disaster settlings. I also explained that ICT specialists have been deployed to a number of humanitarian crises, including those in Haiti, the Philippines, Sudan, Cameroon, Kenya and Mali since the establishment of the Rapid Response Initiative in 2007. </p><p>  In response to additional correspondence received late last year and referred to by the Deputy, I requested my officials to meet with the individual concerned to discuss his proposed activities in more detail as well as to explore ways in which the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade could facilitate contact with key humanitarian partners. I expect this meeting to take place at a time convenient for the correspondent.  </p><p>In the latest correspondence received, the individual is seeking financial support to attend a round table discussion on innovation organised by the US Federal Emergency Management Agency in the White House in February 6th 2013.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is unfortunately not in a position at the present time to allocate financial support to requests for travel expenses and capacity building support.  </p></reply>

This is on the basis that he or she has the right to immediate possession of the property or is entitled to receive the rent if the property is rented rather than occupied by the owner.  It is also on condition that no other significant long-term interest in the property has been created, such as a leasehold interest for at least 20 years, or a life tenancy.  In such circumstances it is the lessee or the life tenant who is the liable person and not the owner.   In most cases the role of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) is that of a secured lender; it is not the owner or operator of properties.  Properties remain under the control of NAMA&rsquo;s debtors and appointed receivers/administrators.  Where these properties are subject to the Local Property Tax it will be the responsibility of the debtor or receiver to ensure compliance.  However, there are occasions where NAMA takes residential properties directly onto its balance sheet.</p><p>  Thus, where NAMA or a bank has such possession or right to receive rents in relation to a residential property they will be the liable person.  Neither NAMA has nor the banks have any specific exemption from the Local Property Tax.	</p></reply>

Properties which have been adapted by parents to provide for the care of their disabled child are not exempt from the charge to Local Property Tax (LPT).   The Deputy will be aware that the State provides supports in other targeted ways, including the Housing Adaptation Grant, where changes need to be made to a home to make it suitable for a person with a physical, sensory or intellectual disability or mental health difficulty to live in.  The impact of such adaptations on a property, as the Deputy suggests, can be to decrease the value which may in turn affect the LPT liability.</p><p>  In cases where there is an inability to pay the LPT, Part 12 of the Act outlines cases where the tax can be deferred.  Where the residential property is the sole or main residence of a liable person and their estimated gross income from all sources does not exceed &euro;15,000 for a single person or &euro;25,000 for a couple during the year covered by the return, they will be eligible to apply for full deferral of the LPT charge.  Moreover, owner-occupiers may be eligible to apply for partial deferral where the gross income from all sources is less than &euro;25,000 in the case of a single person and &euro;35,000 in the case of a couple.  In these cases the owner-occupier will qualify for deferrals of 50% of the LPT liability and the balance of 50% of the tax must be paid.  Where the property was purchased with a mortgage, these thresholds are increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payment. </p></reply>

As the proceeds of all borrowing, including borrowing under the EU-IMF Programme, as well as revenues including tax and non-tax, are lodged to the Exchequer account to fund general expenditure, it is not possible to disaggregate the balance on that account by source or derive a single robust cost figure in relation to the balances maintained.</p><p>Funds in the Exchequer are used for the ongoing payments necessary for running the State. <i>Budget 2013</i>   estimated that the cumulative Exchequer deficit over the years 2013-2015 would be close to &#8364;35 billion. In addition to these day-to-day costs, there are large debt redemptions that are scheduled from early 2013, including a &#8364;5.1 billion bond repayment in April 2013 and a &#8364;7.6 billion bond repayment in January 2014. The continuing budget deficits and debt redemptions must be adequately and prudently funded.</p><p>  Decisions on the level of cash reserves, which are a matter for the NTMA, take account of various factors in addition to the cost of maintaining such reserves. These factors include considering the potential cost of not maintaining an adequate and prudent cash balance. This includes the risk that the Exchequer would be unable to meet its obligations and that market interest rates would possibly be higher than would otherwise be the case due to the perception that the State had a precarious liquidity position.</p><p>Exchequer cash reserves are an important component in bolstering investor confidence in Ireland as it continues on the path to full independent market access at sustainable interest rates. The EU/IMF Programme ends this year making such market access of critical importance. With regard to the drawdown of remaining funding from the EU/IMF Programme, I will continue be regularly advised by the NTMA, who manage the country&#8217;s debt, as well as my officials on Irelands debt strategy. However, it is fair to highlight that given the projected cost and duration of funding available under the Programme of external assistance, we would expect to fully draw down the remaining scheduled funds, in line with that provided for in <i>Budget 2013</i>  .</p></reply>

That is an appropriate and correct focus for Revenue and one that I fully endorse. Delays in the collection of tax revenues properly due, adds to the level of Government borrowing and public debt interest and confers an unfair competitive advantage on non-compliant businesses.  I know that Revenue is conscious of the difficult economic and financial climate that prevails and how this can pose challenges for businesses and individuals in being timely compliant.  Revenue has responded to the difficult environment by encouraging businesses experiencing particular payment difficulties to work proactively with them when such difficulties start to arise in order to find an agreed way through those difficulties and quickly restore voluntary timely compliance.</p><p>  It must be remembered that the granting of an instalment arrangement is not something to which a taxpayer is entitled as a matter of right, and accordingly, it is very important that those businesses that have agreed an instalment plan with Revenue organise their financial affairs in such a fashion as to ensure that the terms of the agreement are honoured as agreed.  However, in circumstances where a business or taxpayer finds the terms of the original phased payment agreement unsustainable due to an unexpected reduction in turnover then the business or taxpayer should make immediate contact with Revenue and outline alternative proposals.  Provided that the underlying viability of the business is confirmed, which includes in particular capacity to pay current taxes, and where there is open and honest engagement by the business including a clear commitment to restore timely payment compliance within realistic timeframes, then Revenue may agree to restructure the original phased payment arrangement.</p><p>  I commend Revenue for the work that it has done in that regard and in the practical support and assistance it is providing to viable businesses.  I am aware that tax practitioners and representative bodies have recognised Revenue&rsquo;s efforts in this regard also.  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, I would advise the person or business to contact Revenue immediately.</p></reply>

The tobacco freefone operates on a twenty-four hour, seven-day basis and is monitored by an intelligence unit in the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; Investigations &amp; Prosecutions Division.

A range of measures are being advanced in this area including personal insolvency reform, the implementation of the &ldquo;mortgage to rent&rdquo; initiative, engagement with mortgage lenders on the development and implementation by them of mortgage arrears resolution strategies and the provision of a mortgage advisory function.</p><p>  The inter-Departmental Group chaired by Dr Don Thornhill on the design of a property tax (the &ldquo;Thornhill Group&rdquo;) had due regard to issues such as ability to pay.  It recommended a system of deferrals for low-income households, and those facing high mortgage payments, and this was accepted by the Government.</p><p>  Part 12 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act provides for deferral of payment of Local Property Tax (LPT) in specified circumstances.  Where the residential property is the sole or main residence of a liable person and their estimated gross income from all sources does not exceed &euro;15,000 for a single person or &euro;25,000 for a couple during the year covered by the return, they will be eligible to apply for full deferral of the LPT charge.  </p><p>  In addition, for income stressed owner-occupiers who have an outstanding mortgage, an adjusted gross income limit will apply.  In these cases, the income thresholds of &euro;15,000 or &euro;25,000 may be increased by 80% of the annual mortgage interest payments.  This type of deferral is available until the end of 2017.</p><p>  Moreover, owner-occupiers may be eligible to apply for partial deferral where the gross income from all sources is less than &euro;25,000 in the case of a single person and &euro;35,000 in the case of a couple.  For income stressed owner-occupiers who have an outstanding mortgage, these thresholds may also be increased by 80% of the annual mortgage interest payments.  In these cases the owner-occupier will qualify for deferrals of 50% of the LPT liability and the balance of 50% of the tax must be paid.</p></reply>

The documents are updated and augmented where appropriate to respond to new developments in the industry and changes in the regulatory environment. </p><p>  The assessment of a tenderer&#8217;s financial and economic standing is a key part of any procurement process because the contracting authority needs to be reasonably assured that a contractor will have the necessary capacity to carry out a contract if the contractor is awarded the contract. Establishing the appropriate suitability criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is, of course, a matter for the contracting authority concerned. This is because the contracting authority is in the best position to gauge the appropriate levels of financial capacity that are appropriate to the needs of that specific contract. My Department has developed specific national guidelines for contracting authorities in relation to minimum standards for suitability criteria for construction contractors interested in tendering for public works projects, published as part of the Capital Works Management Framework. In this regard, it is important to point out that there are no centrally imposed requirements for a minimum turnover. Such requirements would logically be developed on a case by case basis with reference to the specific needs of the contract.</p><p>  The Government recognises that the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector is very important to the economy and that public procurement can be a source of business for SMEs. In this regard, my Department has issued public procurement guidelines (Circular 10/10) to public bodies which are aimed at facilitating greater participation of SMEs in public procurement opportunities. In relation to suitability criteria, the guidelines stress that public bodies must ensure that any criteria/turnover levels set by them must be both justifiable and proportionate to the needs of the contract.</p></reply>

A sample of data was provided to the IIF in July 2012.  The IIF circulated this information to its member companies and a response was received by the OPW in November 2012.  The feedback received from the insurance companies was positive and indicated that the sample information provided was usable subject to some relatively minor technical queries. A working group has now been established between, OPW, the IIF and representatives of several insurance companies to progress the work further.  I am confident that good progress can be made on the exchange of information in order that the insurance industry can be better informed as to the extent and standard of investment by the OPW in flood protection measures and that that investment is taken fully into account in assessing flood risk for insurance purposes.  </p><p>  The first meeting of the working group took place on 17 January 2013 and the group will continue to meet regularly over the coming months in order to progress its work in this matter as expeditiously as possible.</p></reply>

Following discussions with the Council, the OPW agreed to undertake construction of the works with its direct labour force with, Dublin City Council managing the design and construction of the project. The works commenced in September 2007 at Ringsend Bridge moving upstream to New Bridge. The works have been undertaken on a phased basis by the OPW. While some works up to the Railway Bridge have yet to be finished, the flood defence aspect is in place, so the tidally affected area is now protected from flooding to the accepted 1 in 200 year standard for tidal flooding.</p><p>  The OPW has expended approximately &euro;13.1million on the works since 2007. The works have mainly involved the construction of new walls and embankments, installation of new flood gates, quay wall repairs and a new pedestrian walkway. Emergency works are currently ongoing upstream of the Railway Bridge and these should be completed in the next couple of months. The raising of the parapets on London Bridge and New Bridge will commence in March and should be completed in the second half of 2013. </p><p>  It is planned to commence the next stage of major works up to Ballsbridge in the first half of 2013 subject to Part 8 planning approval being received by Dublin City Council. The Council must first adopt The Dodder Catchment Flood Risk Management Plan which is expected to go before the Council in early February. Based on this programme, it is estimated that expenditure on the various works will be in the region of &euro;2 million in 2013.  In relation to future works, it is estimated that the cost of the defence works to Donnybrook will be in the region of &euro;10 million over the next 3-4 years, subject to the availability of funding in those years.</p></reply>

The public service pay and pension bill at 36% of spending is an important constituent element on which a substantial part of the burden of adjustment has and must continue to fall. It is this significant fiscal deficit, and the need to reduce it in accordance with the EU/IMF Programme, which is the primary driver for the ongoing reduction required in the cost of the public service pay and pension bill on which talks have commenced with staff representatives.</p><p>  While comparisons of public servants pay rates across different countries are not widespread, the best available figures, those published by the OECD as part of its &ldquo;Government at a Glance 2010&rdquo; report, do not show Irish public service pay rates to be significantly out of line with other OECD countries across a broad range of disciplines on a purchasing power parity basis.  Furthermore, the statistics on which the OECD based its report predate the pay reductions applied to all public servants, on a progressive basis, under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2010.  The pay reductions applied to higher paid public servants under that legislation were based on the recommendations of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, which conducted a cross-country comparative exercise on pay rates for certain senior grades.  On foot of that, the then Government cut the pay of the highest paid public servants by between 8 and 20%.  A further reduction of 10% was applied to the pay rates of new recruits at entry level across the entire public service on 1 January 2011.</p><p>  This Government,  to help ensure that pay expectations for higher paid public servants are set appropriately and having regard to the resources available to the State, has applied a further reduced pay ceiling at the highest levels in the public service.  That policy brings pay levels at senior levels in the public service in line with those the Government accepted for itself. In addition significant reductions in non pay terms of employment have been secured including standardisation and reduction in annual leave entitlements and a reduction in sick pay entitlements to a level less than those available to public servants in other EU member states.</p></reply>

The overriding objective is to have a more customer focused, leaner, more efficient and better integrated public service which delivers maximum value for money.</p><p>  It should be noted that significant progress is being made in reducing the numbers employed in the public service. The numbers working in the public service have continued to fall, with the preliminary returns for end-2012 now standing at some 290,300, which means that, overall, we are now close to the 2005 staffing levels.</p><p>  Of course, such a reduction in public service numbers poses challenges. It requires a refocus on business processes and adjustments to the way all public bodies use available resources. It will also require changes to the way individual public servants go about their daily work and greater flexibility in the way services are provided, for example with greater use of technology and shared services.</p><p>  The Government is committed to making fundamental changes to the way the public service operates to safeguard the delivery of essential services in a way that is in keeping with the needs of a modern society while driving value for money for the citizen.</p><p>  The moratorium on recruitment will continue until such time that the targets agreed in the Programme for Government are met.  If the general moratorium on recruitment was lifted and numbers were allowed to return to their former levels, the paybill would increase over time and accordingly a substantial part of the savings already achieved would be lost.  However, the precise operation of the moratorium is being kept under review by my Department.</p><p>  It should be noted that there are with certain limited exceptions to moratorium for example in relation to some frontline posts, or statutory positions, etc. or where a sufficiently strong business case is made.  In the Health and Education sectors in particular special arrangements are in place for exemptions to the moratorium on recruitment for specified grades and positions.  However, I wish to make clear that it is part of the day to day function of the Boards and Management of all public bodies to assess, budget and plan for current and ongoing staffing requirements within allocated resources.  When any vacancy arises the first issue to be considered must always be if the post still needs to be filled, or if the work can be discharged in any other way.</p><p>  The historical data requested by the Deputy are available on my Department&rsquo;s website  which contains data for each year back to 1994.  This data is regularly updated and I would urge all Deputies to utilise this resource.</p></reply>

State indemnity for personal injury and third party property damage was legislated for in the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act, 2000 where the management of personal injury and third party property damage claims against certain State authorities, and underlying risks, was delegated to the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA).  When performing these functions, the NTMA is known as the State Claims Agency (SCA). </p><p>  Under the general rule of State indemnity enacted through the statutory provisions above, certain State bodies are indemnified by the Minister for Finance for the following:</p><p>- Personal injury to employees of the State;</p><p>- Personal injury to third parties (the public) &ndash; this includes injury resulting from medical negligence;</p><p>- Third party property damage &ndash; this includes claims arising from road traffic collisions (RTC&rsquo;s);</p><p>  Since 2001 the remit of the SCA has been expanded through various delegation orders based on a value for money analysis.  More recently in 2010 the management of Health Service Executive (HSE) personal injury (non-clinical) and third party property damage claims was delegated to the State Claims Agency (SCA) under the National Treasury Management Agency (State Authority) Order 2009.  13 other State authorities claims associated with these risks were also delegated to the SCA in 2011.  </p><p>  Additionally, the following additional classes of claims were delegated to the State Claims Agency with effect from 7th February 2011:</p><p>- Bullying/harassment claims by state employees, which allege personal injury.</p><p>- Claims by members of the Defence Forces alleging personal injury whilst serving abroad &ndash; includes stand alone PTSD cases.</p><p>- In-cell sanitation claims by current and former prisoners</p><p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (Delegation of Claims Management Function) (Amendment) Order 2012 formally delegated management of Thalidomide and Nimesulide (Aulin) claims to the State Claims Agency on 3rd April 2012. </p><p>  In conjunction with the State, the SCA has a strong track record in reducing the cost of managing claims under its remit.  For example, during 2012 the SCA achieved significant savings on claims and related legal costs associated with the management of the Clinical Indemnity Scheme (CIS). An independent actuarial assessment projected that &euro;127.5 million would be required to satisfy CIS claims and related costs in 2011. The outturn for the year was &euro;84 million, representing a saving of &euro;43.5 million.</p><p>  Prior to the delegation of the management of Employers Liability/Public Liability/Property Damage claims to the SCA, the HSE and 13 other State Authorities were paying in excess of &euro;22 million in insurance premia per annum. Only approximately &euro;2 million has been expended to date in the management of such claims since 2010, yielding a cash flow saving of approximately &euro;64 million. Based on the current outstanding estimated liability associated with these delegated claims since 1st January 2010, a long term saving of at least &euro;26 million will be achieved for the State by managing these claims on the &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; basis operated by the SCA.  </p><p>  Where Agencies have been dealing with their own insurance in many cases, it has been policy to encourage them to delegate the management of the risks and the processing of claims to the State Claims Agency. Analysis and experience has shown that the cost to the State of dealing with these risks and claims directly, through State indemnity managed by the SCA, is significantly lower than the premium cost of insuring these risks.  My Department are currently preparing a delegation order and have been in correspondence over the last few months with Departments on this.</p><p>  In addition, a State Legal Costs Unit is being set up in the SCA to deal with legal costs &ndash; initially to deal with Tribunal claims but with the intention of expanding this remit. Heads of a Bill have been cleared by Government with a view to the publication of legislation to underpin the SCA&rsquo;s remit.</p></reply>

It should be noted that engaging with the citizen and improving customer services are key and ongoing considerations for all Government Departments and Agencies in this regard.   </p><p>  Communication and effective governance structures are important in implementing the Public Service Reform Plan.  An Advisory Group of Secretaries General has been established, which provides support and advice on strategic / policy issues to the Cabinet Committee on Public Service Reform.  In addition, a Reform and Delivery Board, primarily comprising Assistant Secretaries responsible for leading reform in each Department / Office, meets regularly to oversee and monitor the delivery of Public Service Reform at a strategic level and provide assurance to my Department and to the Cabinet Committee that Public Service Reform is being successfully delivered.  These structures, in addition to exiting cross-organisational groups and networks, facilitate communication and information sharing across Government.  </p><p>  The Public Service Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council was also established last year as a representative forum for senior managers responsible for ICT and/or eGovernment from across the Civil and Public Service.  The Council discusses key ICT and eGovernment issues, and provides expert input to decisions and actions aimed at maximising the positive impact of these on public service modernisation and customer service.  A separate group, the Data Sharing Clearing House, has been established to deal with issues as they arise on the improved access to and sharing of data across the system.  </p><p>  In line with best practice governance, Project Boards have been established for many of the projects which are being implemented under the Reform Plan, for example for the various shared services projects.  In addition, each of the actions in the overall Reform Plan is assigned to a lead official, with Senior Responsible Owners appointed to lead the Major Projects which have been identified as being of major strategic importance.  </p><p>  In addition, each Department / major Office has its own Change Delivery Team to manage and drive the reform process at organisational / sectoral level.  </p><p>  The Reform and Delivery Office in my Department monitors the progress being made in making reform plans a reality, including driving cross-organisational cooperation on key projects.  It also works closely with each of the main sectors to ensure that they have appropriate governance arrangements and structures in place to drive and support the delivery of their own organisational and sectoral reform programmes.  </p><p>  In conclusion, this Government is strongly committed to its ambitious programme of Public Service Reform and I believe that a robust governance framework is in place to ensure its successful implementation.  Reform of our public services is an ongoing process and effective communications are essential to ensure the success of the reform programme.</p></reply>

The initiative promotes a new approaching to procurement on the part of Contracting Authorities by encouraging them to tender for a solution to a particular requirement, without being overly prescriptive as to what the solution might be.</p><p>  The objective is to allow greater scope for innovative SMEs to offer new solutions that can provide better value for money and more effective products/services for the Contracting Authorities.</p><p>  Not every public contract will necessarily be amenable to the Procuring Innovation approach.  The aim, however, is to identify a number of projects across the public service that are suitable to the provision of more innovative solutions and which can serve as exemplars for an expansion of this approach.  </p><p>  A number of Departments and agencies expressed a willingness to participate in the Procuring Innovation Initiative in 2012.  These include the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA), the Department of Defence, the HSE, ESB, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Irish Prison Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and An Post.

No. 388 of 2002).  Under these Regulations, it is an implied term of every commercial transaction that where a purchaser does not pay for goods or services by the relevant payment date, the supplier shall be entitled to interest (late payment interest) on the amount outstanding. </p><p>  Ireland must transpose the Recast of the Late Payment Directive (2011/7/EU) which repeals and modernises the old rules.  I signed the Statutory Instrument transposing Directive 2011/7/EU on 22 December 2012 and this will come into effect on 16 March 2013.</p><p>  The purpose of the recast Directive is to combat late payment in commercial transactions, in order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, thereby fostering the competitiveness of undertakings and in particular of SME&#8217;s.</p><p>Directive 2011/7/EC lays down the specific deadlines for the payment of invoices and establishes a right to compensation in the event of late payment in all commercial<i></i>transactions, whether they relate to transactions between private or public undertakings, or between undertakings and public authorities. Member States may exclude debts that are subject to insolvency proceedings, including proceedings aimed at debt restructuring.</p><p><b>Main Provisions:</b></p><p>  EU Member States shall ensure that if the date or period for payment is not fixed in the contract, the creditor is entitled to interest for late payment upon the expiry of any of the following time-limits:</p><p>  - 30 calendar days following the date of receipt by the debtor of the invoice or an equivalent request for payment;</p><p>  - If the date of the receipt of the invoice or the equivalent request for payment is uncertain, 30 calendar days after the date of receipt of the goods or services.</p><p>  In addition, Member States shall ensure that:</p><p>  - The maximum duration of the procedure of acceptance or verification does not exceed 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the goods or services, unless otherwise expressly agreed in the contract and provided it is not grossly unfair to the creditor;</p><p>  - The period for payment fixed in the contract does not exceed 60 calendar days, unless otherwise expressly agreed in the contract and provided it is not grossly unfair to the creditor.</p><p>  In practical terms, this translates into the following operational objectives: (1) Confront debtors with measures that successfully discourage them from paying late; (2) Provide creditors with measures that enable them to fully and effectively exercise their rights when paid late, and (3) Create a level playing field across Member States.</p><p>  The Directive, will contribute significantly to the liquidity of enterprises and therefore to employment and growth.  </p><p>  The proposed legislation will act as a deterrent to late payment and a driver for payment on time by establishing a clear expectation in law that payment will be made according to agreed terms that creditors will not be penalised financially when paid late and debtors will not benefit.</p><p>  Prompt Payment compliance will assist SME&#8217;s improve their cash flow situation and will ease the credit difficulties being experienced by business and facilitate their long term sustainability. </p></reply>

It was envisaged that one-to-one matching funding from the community and/or private sector would be a condition of this fund. </p><p>  The establishment of such a fund would, of course, be contingent on the availability of Exchequer resources.  Given the competing priorities for funding across Government, much of which is supporting other employment creation measures, it has not been possible to proceed with the proposal for a dedicated Community Investment Fund in 2012.</p><p>  However, there were significant activities and investments over the course of 2012 which focused on supporting employment creation and retention at a local level.  For example, within my own Department&#8217;s remit, over &#8364;18 million was allocated to the 35 County and City Enterprise Boards to provide a range of supports to micro-enterprises and entrepreneurs across the country. </p><p>  The Microfinance Fund, which was launched in September 2012, will provide loans of up to &#8364;25,000 for viable micro-enterprises who have difficulty accessing credit from the banking sector.  This initiative will help many small community-based enterprises to start up and grow.  In June 2012, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr Phil Hogan, launched a Local Government Sectoral Strategy to promote employment and support local enterprise<i>.  </i>This Strategy<i></i>outlines measures being taken by Local Authorities to assist enterprises in the areas of business charges, local enterprise supports, procurement, and local development and community-based initiatives. </p><p>  The Minister of State for Tourism &amp; Sport, Deputy Michael Ring, announced almost &#8364;26 million in new funding for local sports projects across the country in December 2012.  This was the first round of sports capital funding in four years.  Many of the projects selected for funding under the programme will support local employment as sports facilities are improved and upgraded throughout the country.</p><p>  Recognising the important role that local communities play in job creation, the Government will continue to support local development in 2013 through a range of initiatives such as these across various Departments.</p></reply>

I received the CLRG&rsquo;s report at the end of September and, shortly after that, I brought that report to the attention of the Government.  The CLRG made five recommendations, which it separated into two categories &ndash; those that can be implemented straightaway and those that require more analysis. </p><p>  The CLRG&rsquo;s main conclusion was that there are some amendments that could be made to the existing process of examinership that would reduce costs and make it more easily available to small private companies.  Accordingly, its first recommendation was that the Companies Acts be amended to allow small private companies to apply directly to the Circuit Court, rather than first to the High Court.  As for medium sized companies, the CLRG recommended that they continue to have the option of going to the High Court for the appointment of an examiner.  I have agreed with these recommendations and included provisions to give effect to them in the Companies Bill 2012, which was published on 21 December 2012. </p><p>  The CLRG went on to say that there could be scope for reducing the role of the courts in examinership further, and made proposals for the appointment of an examiner by an administrative, rather than judicial, decision.  The CLRG envisaged that this procedure would require the involvement of a State agency to exercise this administrative decision, and identified the forthcoming new Insolvency Service, to be established under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, as the most appropriate agency.  However, it acknowledged that implementation of these recommendations would require more consideration, not least as the Insolvency Service is not yet in operation. </p><p>  I and my Department are assessing the appropriateness and practical implications of the State providing an administrative body to facilitate SME restructuring.  We will also take into account the experience of the insolvency service once it has been established and in operation for a while.</p></reply>

I understand that this situation has arisen due to difficulties across its operations in the UK and Ireland, arising from dramatic changes in the way music and films are bought and sold.  On becoming aware of the evolving situation in the company last week, I asked the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) to contact the workers involved in the sit-ins and to mobilise NERA resources to answer queries from all workers on their employment rights.  My Department established a direct line of contact with the receiver from the outset and I was assured that communicating with staff would be a priority.  I understand that, over the weekend, the receiver secured the agreement of staff to discontinue their sit-ins in return for his commitment to arrange for payment of wages this week. The receiver has indicated he is making every effort to find a buyer for the Irish operation.</p><p>  In the event that an insolvent employer is unable to pay monies due to employees in respect of pay, overtime, holiday pay, sick pay etc. there are a number of protections in legislation which enable the employees to receive payment out of the Social Insurance Fund.  In relation to access to social welfare entitlements, I would point out that this is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Social Protection.</p></reply>

Ireland is currently ranked 27th in the World Economic Forum&rsquo;s Global Competitiveness Index 2012-2013, with our position improving up to 20th in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook 2012.  Ireland is also ranked 15th in the World Bank&rsquo;s Doing Business 2012 Report.  </p><p>  There are a number of key areas where Ireland tops the global list, such as:</p><p>-   business impact of rules on foreign direct investment;</p><p>-   inflation;</p><p>-   FDI and technology transfer;</p><p>-   availability of skilled labour;</p><p>-   flexibility and adaptability of the labour force; and</p><p>-   investment incentives.</p><p>  We have jumped ahead of a number of other small countries in the latest international competitiveness rankings, such as Belgium and New Zealand.  We need to make sure that we tackle those remaining areas where we can best support our enterprises and our people.  </p><p>  What is even more important, though, is that Ireland&rsquo;s underlying competitiveness potential, those important factors for achieving sustainable competitiveness in the medium and longer term, and having a supportive environment enabling enterprises to go out and do business successfully, are those factors where Ireland shows particular strengths.  The EU Commission&rsquo;s Competitiveness Report 2012 shows that Ireland is better than the EU average in the vast majority of the competitiveness indicators examined, including in relation to labour productivity, our share of high-tech exports, the energy intensity of industry and our overall business environment.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 contains over 270 actions designed to improve the operating environment for business, enhance our competitiveness and support the creation of employment.  One of these actions focused on identifying specific actions we need to take to deliver the aim of making Ireland the best small country to do business.  Forf&aacute;s has prepared a Report which provides detailed costs profiles to assess the importance of various costs to 17 sectors of the economy and assesses Ireland&rsquo;s cost performance vis-&agrave;-vis our key competitors across seven key cost categories.  As well as acknowledging the range of activities that are currently underway to improve cost competitiveness, the report recommends a series of actions that would support further improvements in cost competitiveness, which the Government will pursue in 2013 and future years in order to achieve this objective.  </p><p>  The &ldquo;Action Plan for Jobs 2013&rdquo; will be published shortly, with the aim of building on the progress already achieved during 2012, and will set out further measures to improve our competitiveness with the overall aim of achieving our commitment to making Ireland the best small country in which to do business.</p></reply>

This is not without precedent, as Ireland previously amended the constitution in 1992 to allow for the ratification of the Agreement relating to Community Patents, which subsequently did not come into effect.  </p><p>  This proposed transfer of jurisdictional powers will enable a unitary patent for at least twenty-five EU Member States to be properly enforced, enhancing the Single Market for intellectual property.  This shift towards the Unified Patent Court will ensure uniformity of decisions on key issues relating to the new unitary patent and will create a new legal paradigm of a judicial remedy for unitary patents which will lessen costs and improve legal certainty in the EU.</p><p>  Under the current system, a European patent can be enforced only at national level, which entails translating it into the official language of the country concerned.  Under the proposed unitary patent system and associated translation arrangements, once the patent is granted, it will be automatically enforceable in 25 Member States without the need for further translations.  It is important to point out however that automatic machine translations of patent specifications into all EU languages is currently being developed and when fully implemented will uphold the principle of linguistic diversity within the European Union. </p><p>  Currently, translation costs of patent specifications represent a very high proportion of the cost of the European patent and this places Europe at a distinct disadvantage vis-&agrave;-vis other major trading partners such as the United States and others.  The European Commission estimates that patent translations can account for up to sixty-three per cent of the cost of protecting a patent in Europe. </p><p>  It is anticipated that the Agreement will come into effect in 2014, along with the corresponding EU Regulations on the unitary patent system.  This will enable participating Member States to obtain a unitary patent valid in 25 Member States at a fraction of the current cost, while also making it far more affordable to enforce their patent rights.</p></reply>

Moreover, Right Holders need to be assured that where IP rights are infringed or subject to unauthorised attack, remedial action and mechanisms for redress are available to protect those Rights.  Ireland is generally regarded as having an effective IP system that provides comfort on both those fronts.</p><p>  With regard to enforcement which lies at the heart of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, Ireland has implemented fully the 2004 EU Directive on the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights (2004/48/EC).  The European Commission is currently reviewing this Directive and we will consider any follow-up proposals that the Commission may bring forward as a result of this review.  The provisions of this Directive complemented existing provisions of domestic patent, trademark and copyright legislation which set a high standard in terms of enforcement measures and remedial action that Right Holders can avail of.</p><p>  As regards digital piracy in particular, the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000 governs the protection of copyright and provides for rights and remedies against those who engage in such activities.  Where it has been found necessary to strengthen legislation in this area, appropriate action to ensure that digital piracy can be effectively tackled has been taken.  Specifically, in the context of the European Union (Copyright and Related Rights) Regulations 2012 which were signed into law in February 2012, these Regulations clarified beyond doubt the position that a court injunction could be sought and granted against intermediaries whose services were being used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department keeps under active and ongoing review, measures that may be necessary to maintain an effective IP system to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s legislation in this area is fully fit for purpose.</p></reply>

At the end of last year there were 11,785 recipients on the scheme at a cost of &euro;115 million.  This means-tested payment is similar to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme, on which it is based.  The farm assist scheme was introduced in 1999 to replace &lsquo;Smallholders Unemployment Assistance&rsquo; for low income farmers, without the requirement to be available for and genuinely seeking work.</p><p>  In Budget 2013 two measures were announced, for implementation in April 2013, which will bring the farm assist scheme into closer alignment with the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme&rsquo;s treatment of self-employed persons by: a) Increasing the amount of means from self-employment, which is assessed against the claimant from 85% to 100%; and b) Discontinuing the means testing disregards for child dependents of claimants.</p><p>  A person may qualify for farm assist if they are a farmer aged between 18 and 66, and they satisfy a means test.  A person is considered a farmer if they farm land that they own or lease and use for the purpose of husbandry.  Husbandry means working the land with the object of taking produce from the land.</p><p>  If a person farms land for the purpose of husbandry but does not own or lease that land, then they may still qualify as a farmer as long as the land is not part of a larger holding.  The land, which includes commonage, must be within the State.  A person will not qualify for farm assist if they lease or let all their land to another person.</p></reply>

JobBridge is one of the key measures taken by the Department to address the problem of Youth Unemployment.</p><p>  The JobBridge Scheme has made significant progress since it came into operation on the 1<sup>st</sup> July 2011.  13,770 internships have commenced to date with 5,548 participants currently on an internship as at 17<sup>th</sup> January 2013 with 1,900 internship opportunities advertised on  as of that date. 25% of participants as of 17 January 2103 were aged between 20 and 24 years and a further 43% of participants were aged between 25 and 34 years.</p><p>  At present one of the main qualifying conditions is that participants must have been in receipt of a qualifying payment for at least three months before they begin their internship.  The purpose of this condition is to try to ensure that the JobBridge scheme supports those who are most in need of assistance in securing employment.  At present 42% of those joining the live register exit within three months of registration.  Given that very many people secure normal, open-market employment unaided during this initial three month period I would be concerned that reducing the JobBridge eligibility period could have an adverse and costly impact on the efficient functioning of the labour market, to the detriment of individual jobseekers.  I would also be concerned that it would be wasteful of scarce exchequer resources to make the JobBridge scheme available in an indiscriminate manner during this initial three month period.</p><p>  The recent interim evaluation report conducted by Indecon found that 67% of JobBridge participants had been unemployed for over six months and that 38% of this sub-group had been unemployed for over a year prior to commencing their JobBridge internship.  Given that the long-term unemployed have particular difficulties in securing employment it is important that the scheme serves this client group first and foremost, and this will continue to be the focus of the JobBridge scheme for the foreseeable future.  I will however keep the situation under review.</p></reply>

To this end, and in line with commitments contained in the Programme for Government, I established in June 2011 the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience to examine a number of specific issues and make cost effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes. To date the Group has held 22 meetings. </p><p>  In its Terms of Reference, the Group has been asked to examine a number of specific issues and make recommendations on them, including child and family income supports, working age income supports, the appropriate unit of assessment in both the tax and social welfare codes, the interaction of the tax and social welfare codes, issues concerning social insurance for self-employed people and any other issues that may be referred to the Group, which includes the Budget 2012 proposals concerning Disability Allowance and Domiciliary Care Allowance. The Group&#8217;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the terms of reference. The full terms of reference are set out below. </p><p>  The Advisory Group is chaired by Ms Ita Mangan, a barrister with considerable experience in public policy. Members of the Advisory Group have expertise from economic and social policy and other relevant areas, and are drawn from within and outside of the public sector. In line with a practical, problem-focused and evidence-orientated approach, they are appointed to the Group on the basis of their expertise and not as representatives of specific sectors. The current membership of the Group is set out below, together with details of their professions.</p><p>  Interested organisations, stakeholders and individuals are periodically invited to make submissions in respect of each work module, offering an opportunity to make proposals on the topics covered in the Terms of Reference.  I understand that submissions made to the Advisory Group are an important source of views for the Group in fulfilling its mandate and in assisting its deliberations. With regard to the work module relating to social insurance for the self-employed, I understand that 30 replies were received from a variety of groups and individuals, a number of whom are self-employed. </p><p>  The Group commenced its work programme by prioritising the area of family and child income supports and submitted its report to me during 2012. Since then, I have been considering the Group&#8217;s findings and have held discussions with my Ministerial colleagues on the issues raised in the report. I intend to formally bring this report to Cabinet in the near future and thereafter publish it subject to agreement. The Advisory Group also submitted to me in 2012 its report on the Budget 2012 proposals concerning Disability Allowance and Domiciliary Care Allowance and I intend to publish this report in the near future.</p><p>  Among the issues that the Group is currently considering are the issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons   in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable. The Group will submit its report on this issue to me once its examination of the various questions has been completed. The Advisory Group is also currently examining the issue of working age income supports and the interaction of the tax and social welfare systems and I expect that the group will complete its work on this module as quickly as possible.</p><p><b>Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare - Terms of Reference</b></p><p>1. The Government agreed the following Terms of Reference for the Advisory Group: </p><p>  a. To constitute a forum to which the Minister for Social Protection may refer specific issues around the income supports and tax systems so that they provide good incentives to take up work and to contribute to the reduction of poverty and child poverty in particular. In particular, the Advisory Group will examine the following specific issues and make recommendations on: <blockquote>i. Child and family income supports (in particular child benefit, increases for qualified children and the family income supplement);<br /><br />ii. Working age income supports (including unemployment payments and similar payments made by other agencies, one parent family payment, one parent family tax credit, back to work tax credit, increases for adult dependants as well as secondary benefits such as medical cards and rent and mortgage supplementary payments);<br /><br />iii. The appropriate unit of assessment in both the tax and social welfare codes;<br /><br />iv. How to address identified anomalies in the interaction of tax and social welfare codes.</blockquote>  b. To examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable; </p><p>  c. To examine and report upon how to improve interaction between the tax, social welfare systems and other supports so as to improve the operation of both in a cost-effective way and in the delivery of positive social and economic outcomes; </p><p>  d. To examine and report upon any other issue that may be referred to the Group by the Minister for Social Protection following consultation with the Ministers of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and the agreement of the Minister for Finance on taxation matters. </p><p>  It is intended that the Advisory Group should consider any proposals for change to existing arrangements in a cost-neutral or cost-reducing context<i>.</i></p><p>2. Following Budget 2012, the Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton T.D. refers the following additional terms of reference to the Advisory Group:</p><p>  a. To examine and report on the policy objectives underpinning the Budget 2012 proposals regarding: <blockquote>i. Changes in the eligibility criteria and rates of payment for Disability Allowance (DA); <br /><br />ii. The increase in the age threshold for payment of Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA); </blockquote>  b. To assess the effectiveness of the Budget 2012 proposals in delivering on the policy objectives taking account, inter alia, the ease of implementation and the timing/phasing of implementation; and </p><p>  c. To consider alternative ways as to how the policy objectives might be achieved.</p><p><b>Current Membership of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare </b></p><p>  Ita Mangan, Chairman of the Advisory Group (Barrister)</p><p>  John Bohan, Department of Social Protection (Civil Servant)</p><p>  Miche&aacute;l Collins, Nevin Economic Research Institute (Senior Research Officer)</p><p>  John Conlon, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Civil Servant)</p><p>  Gerry Harrahill, Office of the Revenue Commissioners (Civil Servant)</p><p>  Catherine Hazlett, Department of Children and Youth Affairs (Civil Servant)</p><p>  Paul Kealy, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Civil Servant)</p><p>  Pat Mahon, Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) (Partner in tax services)</p><p>  Geralyn McGarry, Citizens Information Board (Manager, Social Policy and Research)</p><p>  Aebhric McGibney, Dublin Chamber of Commerce (Policy and Communications Director)</p><p>  Brenda McVeigh, Department of Finance (Civil Servant)</p><p>  Mary P.

Hedgerows are an important reservoir of biodiversity and habitat for birds, insects, wild flowers and other wildlife during the summer breeding season.  The purpose of these provisions is to protect bird life during the nesting season, to prevent forest fires, and to protect vegetation and wildlife habitats during the months of growth and reproduction.  I have no current plans to extend the period for hedge cutting.</p><p>  While hedgerows and scrub are important as wildlife habitats, they need to be managed in the interests of both farming and biodiversity.   Accordingly, I included a commitment in the National Biodiversity Plan 2011-2016 to review the overall policy in this area.  The commitment is to review, in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, both hedgerow and scrub regulation with a view to producing guidelines to encourage best practice for hedgerow and scrub management for wildlife.</p></reply>

Both are included in a list of species protected under the EU Habitats Directive.  Consequently, Ireland is obliged to monitor and report on their status, including in relation to their population, every six years, with the next such report due in June this year.</p><p>  In terms of monitoring Harbour Seals, my Department has conducted surveys of the numbers of Harbour Seals occurring at a number of key sites each year since 2009, with data published annually in reports which are available on the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department.   In addition, my Department has also commissioned two aerial surveys, in 2011 and 2012, to collect data that will contribute to an estimate of the national population of Harbour Seals.  This data is currently being analysed and I expect that this analysis to be completed and published in the coming months.</p><p>  My Department&rsquo;s monitoring programme for Grey Seals has been undertaken with the valued support of the Irish Air Corps.  Each year, aerial surveys are undertaken of key haul-out sites, gathering data that will contribute to an estimate of the national breeding population of Grey Seals.  The last of these surveys was completed in November 2012 and all data from the previous years are now being analysed in advance of the forthcoming report to the European Commission.</p><p>  The data from both the Harbour and Grey Seal monitoring programmes will be comparable with previously-collected data and will inform my Department&rsquo;s view as to the current status of the respective populations.</p><p>  In terms of ascertaining the likely effects of seals on the fishing industry, I will be informed not only by the population monitoring undertaken by my Department, but also by investigations into seal-fisheries interactions that have been commissioned by Inland Fisheries Ireland, who, I understand, will publish an interim report shortly and by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, who anticipate reporting later in 2013.</p><p>  While seals are protected under the Wildlife Acts, licences may be obtained under section 42 of the Wildlife Act to hunt seals where damage is being caused. Licences are issued in response to specific applications and each application is considered on its merits. This redress is available to individual fishermen to control damage to fisheries by seals at particular locations.</p></reply>

The issue was widely reported on television, on national and local radio and in both national and local press.  This covered everything from personal testimony from bereaved family members to television demonstration of correct fitting of carbon monoxide alarms.</p><p>  There have been similar media campaigns at the start of the heating season, to try to prevent the tragic loss.  They have been organised by Bord G&aacute;is, approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and reported to the CER&rsquo;s Gas Safety Committee, in which my Department participates.  While the focus is on the start of the heating season, when people start up boilers and appliances that may not have been used for some time, there are media messages throughout the year.</p><p>  Publicity campaigns are only part of the work that the Government does to try to ensure people&rsquo;s safety.</p><p>  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has recently revised the Building Regulations so that it will become compulsory to fit approved carbon monoxide alarms to certain types of new building.  A lot of work has been done on the relevant standards that apply to these alarms, both at national and at European level.  The Gas Technical Standards Committee of the National Standards Authority of Ireland is currently working on guidance documentation to assist with proper installation of such alarms.  They also issued a special standard to fill the gap until the relevant European Standard can be enhanced.</p><p>  I also wish to acknowledge the great work done by the gas industry to raise safety standards.  The gas industry has worked with the energy regulator to establish a register of approved gas installers.  This has been a hugely important development in improving quality control in gas matters, including reducing the risk posed by carbon monoxide in gas installations.</p><p>  This &ldquo;joined-up&rdquo; approach to matters relating to carbon monoxide can be well demonstrated by the specific campaign last year to warn the public about gas cookers which could be operated in an unsafe manner, creating a carbon monoxide risk.  Industry, government, regulator, standards authority and the National Consumer Agency all acted together to identify and promote the risks and the solutions to consumers.  As a result, very many potentially dangerous appliances were identified and associated risks were mitigated.</p><p>  I assure the Deputy that I take this matter very seriously and that I intend to launch this year&rsquo;s Carbon Monoxide Week after the summer.  </p></reply>

The latter allocation may be provided where anglers demonstrate that they have completed their logbook appropriately and used their initial gill tag allocation.</p><p>  An angler may receive one gill tag where a one day ordinary licence is issued up until the close of the season.</p><p>  Further controls on the issuing of gill tags will be implemented for certain rivers where it is considered necessary by IFI in the interest of conserving stocks to closely monitor the angling quotas and ensure that river based quotas are not exceeded.</p><p>  With specific reference to the River Feale, as requested by the Deputy, the surplus available for harvesting is 1,992 salmon so that number of tags is available.  There are 51 commercial draft net licences and approximately 600 angling licences are sold in the River Feale catchment.  The split of the quota between commercial salmon fishermen and recreational salmon anglers is yet to be determined.  For information, the allocation of tags for 2012 and 2011 was set at 60% to commercial draft net licence holders, 30% to angling with a 10% reserve withheld and divided between the sectors as the season progressed.  As in previous years a decision on the proportional split of the salmon quota will be made following consultation with the Fishery District Committee.

In addition to investment in infrastructure, the National Broadband Plan contains actions relating to demand stimulation, infrastructure barrier removal, spectrum policy, potential contribution of State entities, as well as policy and regulation.</p><p>  NewEra has commenced work on the element of Plan dealing with the potential contribution of State entities and has met with the State commercial and non-commercial entities and with industry.

It has, in the past, undertaken, following EU State aid clearance, a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.

Under the NBS contract, specific service level agreement (SLA) standards are in place, which define the service and support levels to be provided by the NBS service provider, &ldquo;3&rdquo;, to NBS subscribers.  The NBS contract imposes a service credit regime on &ldquo;3&rdquo;, with financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met.

Due the wide variety of remediation works which could arise, and the number of trades and professions which could be involved, I have no plans to establish a registration system for contractors involved in remediation works.</p><p>  I have stated on numerous occasions that where remediation works arise as a result of an inspection under the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012, those works will be the most appropriate and cost-effective, based on the nature of the problem, the site size and the extent of the risk to human health or the environment.  There is no question of any person being required to acquire additional land. However, homeowners should be aware that section 3 of the Local Government ( Water Pollution ) Act 1977 provides that a person must not cause or permit any polluting matter to enter waters.  Consequently, it is an offence to pipe untreated domestic wastewater directly into a drain or ditch. </p></reply>

This review has addressed the appropriateness of making mandatory provision for Carbon Monoxide Detectors/Alarms (CO detectors) in certain circumstances.   Proposals to amend Building Regulations Part J /TGD J were released for public consultation in 2012. In cases where an open-flued or flueless appliance, including a fireplace, is installed in a building (including a dwelling) or as a replacement appliance in an existing building , the consultation proposals favoured the mandatory provision of CO detectors in or near bedrooms and in the room where the appliance is located. The public consultation concluded on 7 November 2012. All submissions received are currently being reviewed with a view to preparing a definitive set of regulations for signature into law later this year.   </p><p>  There are no plans under consideration in my Department to introduce a scheme of financial aid or support to encourage persons to purchase and install carbon monoxide detectors along the lines suggested.</p></reply>

Efforts are made on a continuous basis to prevent the flow of contraband into our prisons, by for example, the installation of nets over exercise yards, vigilant observation of prisoners by staff, enhanced CCTV monitoring, the stricter control of visits and the use of prisoner and random cell searches on a daily basis.</p><p>Random searches of cells and their occupants have uncovered significant quantities of contraband in recent years. Nevertheless, the Irish Prison Service recognises that constant improvements are required in this area.</p><p>The table illustrates the total number of drugs seized in each prison over the years mentioned by the Deputy. Provisional figures for 2012 show that there were 1,256 seizures of drugs across the institutions.

At that time there were approximately 22,000 applications awaiting decision, many of which had been waiting for 2-3 years or longer.</p><p>  Over the past 22 months there has been a major improvement in the position, notwithstanding a significant increase in the volume of valid applications received which has increased from 12,500 in 2010 to 19,900 in 2012 &ndash; an increase of almost 60%.  More than 43,000 decisions on naturalisation applications have been made since I came into office with some 25,000 certificates for naturalisation issued last year alone.  It is my intention that we will continue to build on this success over the coming year an in this regard, nearly 6,000 valid applications have been decided to date this year.</p><p>  Considerable resources continue to be deployed to process applications. In such a rapidly changing environment where the focus continues to be on processing as many applications as quickly as possible, the value of allocating resources to calculating average processing times that in any event are changing constantly, is greatly diminished.   </p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that alongside the improvements in processing, in June 2011, I introduced formal citizenship ceremonies for the first time since the foundation of the State. The ceremonies, which are being met with universal approval, allow candidates for citizenship make their declaration of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State and receive their certificate of naturalisation in a meaningful and dignified manner which befits the importance and solemnity of the occasion.</p></reply>

I understand that no court venue has been singled out for or indeed exempted from the review and that Ballyconnell, Virginia and Clones District Courts have been identified as venues to be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case.  </p><p>  In this context the Courts Service has established a general framework within which such venues are being assessed taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc.  The likely impact on other Justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, is also taken into account.  The review identified a range of venues nationwide which, based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue which has now commenced.  </p><p>  However, the Courts Service has assured me that no decision in relation to the future of Ballyconnell, Virginia and Clones District Courts will be taken without prior consultation with local interested parties and court users.  This consultation has commenced and the views received will be taken into account in the decision making process which will be a matter for the Courts Service Board.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

Prior to giving my approval for the project to proceed, the need for the new prison and the alternatives to constructing it were fully considered by my Department  following submission to me of a business case prepared by the Irish Prison Service. The Deputy will know that although there are many alternatives to prison there will always be  a need for  prison accommodation.</p><p>  I am advised that the cells in the new facility, which will be double occupancy cells, will be approximately 12m&sup2;,  have full in-cell sanitation and showering facilities  and will be  fully compliant with the standards for double occupancy as set down by the Inspector of Prisons. I am further advised that it is the intention of the Irish Prison Service to separate remand and sentenced prisoners in the new prison proposed for Cork. </p><p>  The new facility will have a modern visiting area which will, in so far as is practicable, accommodate visitors and prisoners in  a relaxed atmosphere that will lend itself well to bringing children in to visit family members who are imprisoned in Cork. Equally, the medical, educational and training facilities will allow for the provision of appropriate medical and rehabilitative programmes for prisoners. </p><p>  In relation to the future of the existing prison, I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that  it will be &quot;mothballed&quot; i.e. it  will be kept secure and maintained until a feasibility study  has been completed and  a decision on its future is taken as part of the next Capital Expenditure Plan for the Irish Prison Service. </p><p>  For the project to proceed,  development consent will have to be secured from the Oireachtas, in accordance with the provisions of Part 4 of the Prisons Act 2007, in due course. This will require me to move a draft  resolution in both Houses of the Oireachtas under Section 26 of the Prisons Act  which, if approved, will be confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas. </p></reply>

The strategy comprises two essential elements:</p><p>  - firstly exploring the feasibility of replacing the existing prison through the construction of a new prison with all related and support ancillary services, on the adjacent prison car park site  and</p><p>  - secondly the enhancement of sentence management, prisoner interventions and structured release of suitably risk assessed prisoners into the community on a multi-agency approach basis.  Arising from the publication of the Strategy the Irish Prison Service in co-operation with the Probation Service, statutory and non-statutory community based services set up a Cork based implementation team to progress the Strategy and to develop robust community based programmes which could act as alternatives to custody.</p><p>  In December 2012, a joint Irish Prison Service/Probation Service Initiative was introduced which specifically aims at providing supports to prisoners immediately before and during the critical period after their release. The primary aims and goals of this Scheme are to (a) reduce the current recidivism rates by arranging for additional support structures and (b) provide for a more structured form of temporary release. It is anticipated that over 160 prisoners will benefit from this initiative in 2013.</p></reply>

Following that decision it was decided that it was not viable to retain a three brigade structure within a strength ceiling of 9,500 personnel and accordingly, a major re-organisation encompassing a reduction in the number of Army Brigades from three to two was undertaken. The major reorganisation to give effect to this decision is still ongoing.</p><p>  This major reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Force will ensure that within the reduced strength, the operational effectiveness of the Permanent Defence Force is maintained. This is being achieved through the rationalising of headquarters, administrative and support functions and re-balancing force elements in favour of &ldquo;front line&rdquo; operational Units.</p><p>  One such consequence of the reorganisation was the amalgamation of the 4th Field Artillery Regiment with the 2nd Field Artillery Regiment, to be based in Custume Barracks, Athlone. As the process of reorganisation is still ongoing it is not possible to quantify the overall savings that will accrue into the future from the reduction from a three to two brigade structure and for which the disbandment of the 4th Field Artillery Regiment and its amalgamation with the 2nd Field Artillery Regiment is just one small element.</p></reply>

Where forged or tampered passports accompanying horses to slaughter are detected, it is the policy that such animals are destroyed and removed from the food chain.</p><p>  These requirements are designed to ensure that meat produced in approved slaughter plants is suitable for human consumption.  All equines (which include horses, ponies and donkeys) are required to be identified in accordance with EU and national legislation.  All equines issued with a passport after I July 2009 must have a corresponding microchip implanted by a veterinarian which is recorded in the passport and creates a link between the passport and the animal.</p><p>  The passport includes information on any veterinary medicines administered to equines.  An equine for slaughter for human consumption must be accompanied to the slaughterhouse by its passport in compliance with current veterinary requirements - this requirement is an essential part of the food-chain information required by food law and the information on the passport determines whether the animal can be slaughtered for human consumption.  Under EU legislation, horses treated with certain veterinary medicines such as phenylbutazone, known in the industry as &ldquo;bute&rdquo;, are permanently excluded from the human food chain in order to protect public health and the passport of the horse in question is endorsed by the prescribing veterinary practitioner to this effect.</p><p>  My Department has developed detailed procedures for the slaughter of horses in abattoirs and has communicated these and the checks required both to its staff and the business operators.  It has liaised with passport issuing agencies in Ireland and has developed protocols to allow abattoir operators to check the details of passports with these agencies to seek to ensure that they are valid and that only those horses eligible for slaughter are slaughtered.</p><p>  Ongoing vigilance is maintained in relation to official controls in this area.  In that connection, the European Communities (Equine) (Amendment) Regulations, S.I. No. 371/2012, introduced recently, provide for the updating of S.I. No. 357/2011 (European Communities (Equine) Regulations 2011) to strengthen the powers of the Minister in relation to approval of an issuing body for equine passports, authorised officers and prosecutions in relation to equine identification.</p><p>  The Department is also developing a central database (traceability system) of horses which will involve migration of selected data from passport issuing organisations to the Department.  The database will be populated by information provided from the databases maintained by the passport issuing organisations; by the Department from records obtained from sources such as slaughter plants and knackeries; and by Local Authority Veterinary Inspectors in respect of records maintained at appropriate slaughter plants.</p><p>  The Animal Health and Welfare Bill, which was introduced into the Dail last year, is a very comprehensive piece of legislation on animal health and welfare and will give the Minister and Local Authorities additional powers in relation to the protection of the health and, particularly, the welfare of horses.  While my Department does not comment on ongoing investigations, I can advise that during 2012 it revoked the approvals of one organisation to maintain a stud book and issue horse passports; and the approval of one slaughter plant was voluntarily suspended.</p></reply>

The relevant national legislation is S.I. No. 357 of 2011 - European Communities (Equine) Regulations 2011 (as amended).  This legislation provides that if an equine animal has not been identified within six months of the date of its birth, or by the 31<sup>st</sup> of December in the year of its birth, whichever date occurs later, then the equine animal cannot be admitted to the food chain.  It is an offence under S.I. 357 of 2011 (as amended) Article 24(1) and (2) to forge or tamper with an equine passport.</p><p>  With regard to the slaughter of horses, an official veterinarian must be present in a meat plant when slaughtering is taking place.  All animals are subject to an ante-mortem inspection, which includes an identification check, by an official veterinarian prior to slaughter.  The horse passport is examined to confirm the identification of the animal and to check if any medications have been administered that might render the animal unfit for human consumption.  If there is evidence that the passport has been tampered with or if the passport is a replacement rather than original passport, the animal will not be allowed go for human consumption.  If the animal fails the ante-mortem inspection, it will be slaughtered and the carcase sent for disposal.  The animal is not permitted to leave the abattoir alive. If the animal passes the ante-mortem inspection, it is allowed go for slaughter for human consumption.  Where forged or tampered passports accompanying horses to slaughter are detected, it is Department policy that such animals are destroyed and removed from the food chain.</p><p>  My Department has introduced enhanced<b></b>legislation and<b></b>procedures in relation to the registration of horse premises and the identification and slaughter of horses over the past year or so.  With regard to the registration of horse premises, my Department introduced new regulations in January 2012 such that, from May 2012, anyone who is the owner/person in charge of any premises on which horses are kept is required to register the premises with the Department.</p><p>  On the issue of identification, my Department up-dated national legislation last September in relation to controls on the identification of horses in order to strengthen the powers of the Minister in relation to approval of an issuing body for equine passports, authorised officers and prosecutions in relation to equine identification.  Under this legislation, my Department revoked the approval granted to one of the passport issuing agencies (PIOs) to issue passports to non registered equines last year because of its non-compliances with the rules relating to issuing passports.</p><p>  My Department also introduced enhanced procedures for the slaughter of horses in abattoirs in October 2011 and communicated these and the checks required both to its staff and the business operators.  It has liaised with PIOs in Ireland and has developed protocols to allow abattoir operators to check the details of passports with these agencies, which are obliged by regulation to maintain a database, to seek to ensure that they are valid and that only those horses eligible for slaughter are slaughtered.</p><p>  EU legislation provides that horses treated with certain veterinary medicines (such as phenylbutazone or &#8220;bute&#8221;) are excluded from the human food chain.  In order to verify the effectiveness of the intake procedures at slaughter plants carrying out the slaughtering of horses, my Department decided last year to increase sampling for &#8220;bute&#8221; from 60 in 2011 to 104 in 2012 and to 160 in 2013.<b></b> The last positive test for &#8220;bute&#8221; was in 2010.</p><p>  My Department is developing a central database of horses which will involve migration of selected data from PIOs to the Department.  The database will be populated by information provided from the databases maintained by the PIOs, by the Department from records obtained at slaughter plants and knackeries and by Local Authority Veterinary Inspectors in respect of records maintained at appropriate slaughter plants.  The intention is that this database will be used at abattoirs to verify the authenticity of the passport for the equine presented and to record its date of slaughter.</p><p>  In conclusion, my Department maintains ongoing vigilance in relation to official controls on the identification of horses, including at slaughter, through national and EU legislation.  I am satisfied that robust procedures are in place in approved business establishments to ensure that only horses with valid identification are accepted for slaughter.</p></reply>

Pig meat imported into this country could only qualify to be labelled as Irish if it was processed (subject to substantial transformation) in Ireland.

Swaps are normally initially proposed or organised by the fishing industry lead by the Federation of Irish Fishermen (FIF) and completed in a transaction between Member States. This may happen for a number of reasons. Firstly at the start of each year when the TAC and Quota Regulation is published, quotas for  a number of fisheries which are of little interest to the Irish fleet are swapped for quotas for stocks which are of interest to our fleet.</p><p>  Secondly throughout the year, the industry lead by the FIF works closely with the Department to recommend  effective monthly management regimes for pressure stocks. In this monthly process the Industry recommends that some quotas  or effort be swapped in order to maintain a supply of a particular quota for a stock of particular importance to the Irish fleet.  In addition,  where such proposals are received from other Member States, the FIF recommends the amounts and species to be swapped.  These swaps are completed by the Department using the EU FIDES fishery database system.  The third reason for swaps is at the end of year where a quota has been exceeded and any opportunity to address this overfishing is used through completing swaps with other Member States.  The tables which the Deputy has requested are large and voluminous in nature and therefore they are being sent directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

However the health sector has a role in terms of providing health-related supports to these children, where required. The Health Service Executive is currently reconfiguring therapy resources for children with disabilities aged 0 to 18 year, including those with autism. Its <i>National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years)</i>  , established since 2010, seeks to bring consistency in service delivery and a clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need, regardless of where they live, which pre-school or school they attend or the nature of their disability. In practical terms this means that health professionals and parents will know exactly where a child should be referred and how to refer them. Services may be provided at primary care level or by early intervention and school age disability teams, with access to specialist services, according to the child&#8217;s needs.   </p><p>  The particular issue of speech and language supports that has been raised by the Deputy is a service matter for the Health Service Executive. Accordingly I have arranged for the Deputy's questions to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The basis of the complaint, which was upheld by the Data Protection Commissioner, was that the NSCs should not be retained indefinitely without consent as this constituted a breach of the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003.  During 2010, a number of meetings were convened with the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner and representatives of the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive, and Temple Street, and Cork University Hospitals.  A policy was agreed in conjunction with the DPC to address both the legislative and ethical requirements of the National Newborn Screening Programme.</p><p>  In accordance with the policy, from 1 July 2011, the blood portion of the Newborn Screening Card (NSC) will be retained for ten years and disposed of during the child&rsquo;s 11th year for the purpose of confirming an initial diagnosis should this be deemed necessary.  Parents/guardians are provided with specific information on the retention of the NSC&rsquo;s with regard to their use and written consent is sought in this regard.  The changes to the National Newborn Screening Programme since 1 July 2011 bring about compliance with both national and EU data protection legislation, uphold ethical principles and meet ethical obligations with regard to consent, privacy and confidentiality.</p><p>  The agreed policy also provided for the disposal of archived NSCs older than ten years.  Following receipt of representations concerning the proposed destruction of archived Newborn Screening Cards, I requested the HSE to conduct a review of this decision.  The report and recommendations of the review group were submitted to my office in January 2012.  Having carefully considered the issue, I have accepted the recommendation of the review group, that in order to meet our legal and ethical responsibilities, newborn screening cards older than ten years will be destroyed.  Arrangements have been put in place by the HSE for any person who prefers that their newborn screening card is not disposed of, to have it returned to them.  They are free to donate these cards for medical research.</p></reply>

I understand that the contractors have already been procured. </p><p>  I understand from the RSA, that, when the new system comes into operation later this year, the photograph will be digital and will not be stuck on to the card in the way it is to the old paper licence.  The capture of the photograph will be included in the fee for the licence.  As the system develops, the SAFE2 ID standard will be implemented, at which point the only option will be the digital photo taken at the Front Office Network.</p><p>  It should be noted that members of the public will now only have to make one journey to get their photograph taken and license application processed. Furthermore, the &euro;55 fee for a ten year license includes the cost of the photograph as well as the license.</p></reply>

The fee for renewing or adding these categories to a licence is &euro;35.  There is a production cost associated with each card, and the fee of &euro;35 is to cover the cost of producing the licence so that the overall service can be less reliant on the Exchequer in future years.     </p><p>  In respect of people between the ages of 60 and 67, a driving licence may be granted for a period of 1 year or 3 years, where the application is required to be accompanied by a medical report and the medical report indicates that the applicant appears to require medical review.  However, where an application does not require a medical report, all licences with a validity period greater than 3 years and less than 10 will be charged at &euro;55.  It would have been administratively difficult to apply a different or proportionate pricing regime in these circumstances.     </p><p>  I have opted to maintain the position that no fee applies to applicants over 70 years of age.  Similarly, no fee will apply to anyone wishing to change personal details on a licence.</p></reply>
