However, the Bill is carefully balanced to allow a statutory agency to provide sensitive personal information about a birth parent to an adopted person without consent.  This provision is supported by a suite of measures to ensure that the birth parent's constitutional rights are safeguarded.  From a legal perspective, I am advised that the transfer to non-statutory agencies of the information required to provide a service may not be compatible with the protection of rights that the Bill aims to provide.  For this reason, Tusla will be the sole provider of adoption information and tracing services under the Bill.</p>  <p>  I should emphasise that legislation will operate on a presumption in favour of disclosing information in so far as is legally and constitutionally possible.  It provides clarity regarding the information that can be provided and the circumstances in which it can be provided.  It provides that an adopted person aged 18 years or over who was adopted before the proposed legislation comes into operation, will be provided with his/her birth certificate information, as held on record, following a request to Tusla, subject to certain conditions.  An adopted person may request information about his or her  birth parents, the existence of birth relatives, and the adopted person's early life circumstances.  They can also request their own medical information, and medical information regarding a birth relative where this is likely to be of relevance to the maintenance or management of the physical or mental health of the adopted person or his or her relative.  Where this information is held on record, it can be provided to an adopted person without consent.  The Bill also provides that the Adoption Authority  will be responsible for collecting, restoring, preserving and the safekeeping of all adoption records.   </p>  <p>  A key concern in this Bill will be to achieve a fair and reasonable balance between the rights of adopted persons and their birth parents.  I believe we can get this balance right, and I look forward to discussing the Bill further as it progresses through both Houses.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-11a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017051100043#WRA01000"><p>I am pleased to confirm that major improvements in childcare subsidies will come into effect this September, including increases of up to 50% in targeted childcare subsidy rates and a new universal childcare subsidy for children aged between 6 and 36 months.  September&rsquo;s changes will be delivered through existing childcare schemes, pending the introduction of the Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS), which will come into operation at the earliest possible date.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that up to 70,000 children will benefit from childcare subsidies from September, which would more than double the number of beneficiaries of existing schemes.  I want to stress that these figures &ndash; and also figures on ACS take-up&ndash; are estimates.  The take-up of childcare subsidies depends not just on eligibility, but on parental demand for childcare and on the availability of childcare places.  Given the expected level of parental demand, it was estimated that 79,000 children would benefit from the ACS during its first year of operation.  The estimated difference of 9,000 this September is partly accounted for by children aged 3 and older whose family incomes are above the threshold for a GP Visit Card but below the threshold for the ACS.  The difference is also partly accounted for by children aged 3 and older whose parents may be eligible for a GP Visit Card &ndash; or other eligibility criterion &ndash; but have not taken it up. </p>  <p>  An information campaign in the coming weeks will aim to minimise low take up through raising awareness among parents about eligibility.  In such cases, the families we are talking about generally have incomes near the maximum income-threshold for the ACS, and the subsidy payable under the targeted elements of the ACS would therefore be small.  Further, in such cases, when children are aged less than 3, their families will be able to benefit from the universal, non means tested subsidy of up to &euro;80 per month .</p>  <p>  We are not anticipating widespread price rises as a result of increased subsidisation of childcare.  Of course, prices are entirely at the discretion of childcare providers.  However, the scope for price increases will be constrained by the fact that some parents with children aged over 3 will not receive a subsidy.  Nevertheless, my Department will keep the matter under active review.</p></reply>

The approach to its investigation is a matter for the Commission and I do not have any information on its engagement with the Adoption Authority or other individuals, groups or corporate bodies.</p><p>In its Second Interim Report, which I published on the 11<sup>th</sup>of April, the Commission acknowledges that the term &lsquo;illegal adoption' is used to cover a wide range of situations and actions including the incorrect registration of a birth.  The Commission sympathises with the need for people in such situations to establish their true identity but reports that &ldquo;<i>it is difficult to see what assistance could be provided by further investigation.</i>&rdquo;  The Report notes that &ldquo;<i>not even a national DNA database would assist all of the people</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>The Commission suggests that an amnesty from prosecution may help &ldquo;<i>to encourage those responsible to come forward and correct the record</i>.&rdquo;  The legal implications and practicalities of any such amnesty need considerable further consideration and I will explore this matter further with the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Social Protection, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.</p><p>The Adoption Act 1952 provided a legal basis for adoption in Ireland.  This brought order to what had been the system of ad-hoc arrangements in lieu of formal adoption procedures up to this point.  Prior to the introduction of the Adoption Act 1952 some children were placed in life long family care arrangements, where a child was in the custody of a person other than his or her parent or guardian and where no adoption order was effected.  These arrangements were never formalised. </p><p>The Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 was published on 23 November 2016.  As the Deputy will be aware, this Bill is intended to facilitate access to adoption information and operates on the basis of a presumption in favour of disclosing information in so far as is legally and constitutionally possible.  The Bill will, for the first time, provide a statutory basis for the provision of information related to both past and future adoptions.  It will provide clarity around the information that can be provided and the circumstances in which it can be provided.  The Bill provides that adopted persons, birth parents, relatives, a person who was in an informal arrangement where no adoption order was effected, and persons whose birth was incorrectly registered, can engage with the adoption information and tracing services to be provided by Tusla. </p></reply>

I am supportive, in principle, to an appropriate follow-up study, and I will pursue this further with the T&aacute;naiste, whose Department leads on this area.</p><p>The Department of Justice and Equality plays a whole-of-Government role in this area through the National Office for the prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence (Cosc).  That Department has indicated that it is investigating the resource implications and approaches to identify a ring-fenced funding stream for undertaking this body of work.</p><p>I understand that the proposal for a second Sexual Abuse and Violence in Ireland (SAVI 2) research project envisages a significant level of expenditure over a three year period by the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills and my Department.  The overall expenditure has been estimated to be approximately &euro;920,000 over three years, of which &euro;230,000 is being sought from my Department.</p><p>Apart from the funding of existing commitments relating to the <i>Growing Up in Ireland</i>Study, my Department has only a very limited commissioned research budget.  The majority of this budget has been committed for 2017 and 2018. </p><p>In relation to the prioritisation of expenditure, Tusla has advised my Department that its priority in this area is aimed at enhancing its knowledge regarding Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence in order to support the planning and commissioning of services.  To this end, Tusla is working with funded service provider organisations to implement standard data gathering and reporting mechanisms and to address data quality issues. </p><p>In addition, Tusla advises that, in implementing its obligations under both the Istanbul Convention and commitments under the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, it will be examining how to address specific research and evidence needs to inform future commissioning and to support the measurement of outcomes.</p><p>Finally, there are important public procurement considerations, and accordingly, in order to be compliant with public procurement rules, any commissioned research funded by my Department is subject to the procurement process.</p></reply>

This applies to children under the age of 18, living in their own home or living in care.  Each referral received by Tusla is assessed and dealt with on an individual basis by the relevant social work team. </p>  <p>  Any complaint or allegation of abuse made by a child in care is dealt with urgently and seriously.  Children First procedures apply to the investigation of the allegation.  The safety and well being of the child are the key priority.</p>  <p>  There are safeguards surrounding each child care placement, whether foster or residential care.  Placements are supervised by a professionally qualified social worker, and the provision of care services is monitored by Tusla management and subject to  inspections by the Health Information Quality Authority and by Tusla Registration Services. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should also be aware that children in care have access to independent advocacy supports, such as the organisation Empowering People in Care, or EPIC.  Children in care also have access to the complaints mechanism in Tulsa, and may make complaints, or be assisted to make complaints, about their care to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children . </p>  <p>  We have a strong set of child protection measures, and have made significant improvements in recent years - but we cannot be complacent. Increased funding for Tusla in Budget 2017 provides additional capacity for Tusla to respond to areas of identified risk and anticipated demand.  It will also allow Tusla to progress key service developments during 2017.</p></reply>

Inspection of the early years sector is important to ensure our children are safe and to make sure education quality and standards are met.</p>  <p>  As someone who has more than three decades experience working and campaigning with the sector I am also aware that inspections, administration and red tape remains one of the main challenges.  Clearly there is a balance to be struck.  As Minister I am committed to a coherent, streamlined inspection system which does not require us to compromise on child protection issues, quality and high standards.</p>  <p>  The Early Years Inspectorate at Tusla and the Inspectorate in the Department of Education and Skills  both conduct inspections.  Each focuses on different aspects of the services &ndash; Tusla on safety and protection, the Department of Education and Skills on quality. Deputy, such dual inspection regimes are not uncommon and in fact operate in several other countries and jurisdictions.  Despite the unique focus of both the inspection units they are committed to working closely together in order to avoid unnecessary administrative burdens on, or disruption to, early years services.</p>  <p>  My own officials also lead a group called the Operations and Systems Alignment Group.  In addition to both inspection units it also involves other bodies including Pobal and the Early Years Specialist Unit.  Its ongoing work is to ensure that the approach taken is the most efficient &ndash; including the sharing of data and reaching agreement on scheduling visits in advance. </p>  <p>  I accept there has been a settling down period between the two inspection units, bearing in mind the Department of Education Inspectorate is still in its first year in operation.  I am assured that the levels of co-operation will increase as the relationship between both units becomes more firmly established.</p></reply>

The first is for HR and recruitment supports, while the second will provide funding to pay the costs of the required additional staff until September 2017 in the first instance.  I am making up to &euro;2,000 available for services initially, to assist with the recruitment process or to provide expert support in HR management.  I understand that all but one of the services impacted have now accessed this funding. </p>  <p>  County Childcare Committees are now working closely with the affected services on the second phase to establish the amounts, and timing, of the payments that they will need to maintain services.  Funding is available now, but it is not possible to issue payment until services can identify their need; nor would it be prudent to issue flat-rates, as each service has different needs.  My officials are committed to progressing applications as soon as they are received. </p>  <p>  In the longer term, the question of sustainability must be addressed comprehensively, and at the core of this is working with community services to develop adequate funding streams and business models. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I have recently announced a significant expansion and extension of the funding available under the Community Childcare Subvention from September of this year; which I anticipate will be of significant assistance to families but also to services.  In addition arrangements are progressing for the provision of 'non-contact time' funding to services this summer, amounting to &euro;14.5m per annum.  I will also be examining how the &euro;1m sustainability funding provided for 2017 can be used in 2018, and I will be working with the sector and stakeholders in this endeavour.</p>  <p>I have asked my officials to progress the Independent Review of the Cost of Childcare as a priority.

I have visited the site of the former home in Tuam and met with former residents and their families, so I am acutely aware that many people are experiencing a great deal of anxiety and anticipation for what might happen next.  For these reasons it is very important that Government and all relevant agencies respond sensitively and respectfully to these issues, with particular regard for the hurt and pain involved for those directly connected to the former Tuam Mother and Baby Homes. </p>  <p>  While the Commission has concluded its physical excavations in Tuam, it has not yet reached any formal conclusions about the site.  The Commission is continuing its comprehensive programme of work and the facts which will be established by its investigations will further assist relevant authorities. </p>  <p>  The Government is mindful that there are many questions to which people understandably want answers, including the matters raised by the Deputy. Since the Commission announced the discovery of human remains at this location, the Government has been working to establish an inclusive process which can engage with interested parties with a view to building a consensus on how these sensitive issues could be addressed.  It is essential that this process respects the memory and dignity of the deceased children who lived their short lives in this home. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs my focus is on bringing a coordinated approach to this process which by necessity involves a number of Government Departments and State agencies with specific roles in respect to these issues.  Galway County Council are the owners of the site and I have met with my colleague Simon Coveney TD, Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, to discuss the central role of the Council in actively progressing matters.  As part of these discussions, I am considering the potential for specialist expertise to provide additional technical advice and assistance.  I also understand that Galway County Council has been liaising directly with the Commission and has written to the Coroner around these matters. </p>  <p>  While it will take some further time to resolve all the questions which have arisen, it is important to again reassure the public that the site has been sealed and secured by the Commission to protect the remains which are interred pending the outcome of current deliberations.</p></reply>

Work on the development of a new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department and consultations with youth services are continuing with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the review.  The new services being established in 2017 will be in line with recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review.</p>  <p>  Future funding decisions will also be informed by a recent mapping exercise which has provided a detailed social demographic profile, in terms of population number and deprivation levels, with existing youth service provision mapped onto the data.  </p></reply>

I understand that the overwhelming majority of such disclosures are about sexual abuse. </p>  <p>  Tusla has advised me that  there were 1,895 historical/retrospective cases on hand at the end of March 2017.  Tusla has also indicated that, included in these cases, they received 354 reports from adults about past abuse during the first three months of this year.

Tusla&rsquo;s focus is to screen historical/retrospective disclosures for any indication of current risk to children.  In cases of urgent need, the disclosure is acted on immediately.</p>  <p>  Tusla has a limited role where there is no evidence of a current risk to children.  In relation to the adult making the disclosure,  Tusla may assist them in accessing HSE counselling services.   </p>  <p>  Tusla's policy in assessing risk relating to an adult about whom an allegation of sexual abuse has been made is strictly guided by the principles set out in the Barr Judgement.  In such cases, the person must be informed of the nature of the allegation and the identity of the person who is making the complaint.  Tusla  must adhere to the practice of due process and fair procedure.  </p>  <p>  Tusla has put in place a service improvement plan-with experienced social workers dealing with the high priority cases.  Medium and lower priority cases will be dealt with by social workers drawn from other services and provided with training and supervision. </p>  <p>  I have asked Tusla to report to me monthly on the progress they are making. </p></reply>

Recently, I was informed that to date 21 children have come to Ireland through the Calais Special Project (CSP).  Of these 19 children are now in care placements and a further 2 children, in keeping with our process of assistance, were reunited with family members.</p><p>I would like to note that carrying out such an important mission in a safe and effective manner is no small task.  From the granting of refugee status under the <i>International Protection Act 2015 </i>to the arrival of a child into safety and security in Ireland - a detailed process must occur. Social workers meet the children in France to assess their needs in terms of education, health, linguistic knowledge, family ties and recent experiences.  This process improves the capacity of the placement organised for the child to meet their needs, and provide whatever additional services are required.  It is this thoughtful approach that lays the foundations for a successful care placement, facilitating human flourishing.</p><p>Preceding our progress to date, there has been an all-Government response aimed at efforts to address the plight of the young people who were previously in the unofficial camps near Calais.  Tusla has put in place a Calais Special Project to manage the aspects of this response that come within its remit.  There has been positive coordination between the relevant State bodies.  Our current progress has been augmented by the support and guidance of the International Organisation for Migration, Irish Refugee Protection Programme, International Protection Office, the French Ministry of the Interior, the French Red Cross, the Irish Embassy in France, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</p><p>As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I welcome the results of our humanitarian effort to date and the course we are on with respect to the D&aacute;il resolution passed last November. </p></reply>

I very much value the positive impact of their work in supporting families and local communities.  FRCs provide a holistic service of child, family and community support and advocacy.  This allows for early identification of need, provision of appropriate interventions, and timely referrals to appropriate services.</p>  <p>  The FRC in question has received funding under Tusla's Family Resource Centre Programme since 2004.  Core funding from Tusla covers the employment of a full-time Co-ordinator, a part-time Development Worker and a part-time Administrator.  It should be emphasised that Tusla is not the sole funder of FRCs.</p>  <p>  Tusla has advised me that this FRC offers early intervention support to families in difficulty and it has experienced financial pressures over recent years.  In 2016, Tusla provided funding of &euro;82,940 to support the Centre in its work.</p>  <p>  I recognise the benefits that additional space would bring to this FRC, and I understand the wish of its Board of Management to secure the property.

The reason for his being that they had reached 18 years of age. At the end of 2016, Tusla has indicated that 1,055 young persons in care were aged 16 or 17 years of age.  Of these 432 (41%) had been allocated an aftercare worker.  Tusla has advised that it does not collate data on the waiting periods before an aftercare worker has been assigned.  I have made the tabular data requested by the Deputy available for inclusion in the record of the House.</p><p>Each year, between  approximately 500-600 young persons will turn 18 years of age while in care.  In recent times, I understand that about 75% of 17 year olds in care were in foster placements, a further 20% approximately were reported to be placed in residential settings.  The remaining 5% are in other settings, for example a disability setting or supported lodgings.  </p><p>I am conscious that the transition to independent adulthood can be challenging for many young people.  This is particularly true for children and young people in care.  Planning for leaving care needs to begin in the years prior to leaving care and continue as part of the care planning process.  This preparatory work is facilitated by a social worker and is based on collaboration with the young person, their carers and partner agencies.  It is specific to the individual young person's needs.  During the preparation for leaving care an aftercare worker is introduced to the young person.  They are involved in the preparation for the leaving care process.</p><p>Tusla prioritises children in residential care, and short term foster care, for the early allocation of an aftercare worker.  Children in long term foster care, with an allocated social worker, have their aftercare plan developed with the social worker.  If their plan is to remain living with their foster carers, on a case by case basis, it may be considered best practice that they would be allocated an aftercare worker when they are in their 17th year.  I believe that this is a pragmatic approach which matches needs to available resources.</p><p>There are pending amendments to the Child Care Act 1991 which will place a statutory obligation to provide an aftercare plan before the young person leaves care.  I intend that this provision will be commenced shortly. I have secured the funding needed to recruit additional aftercare workers to enable Tusla to deliver this new commitment in full. </p><p>In some situations, the child's social worker may continue in the role of an aftercare worker when the child reaches 18 years.  My Department working to implement the changes that are needed.  There is no doubt that improvements are needed and I intend to ensure that they happen. </p><p><b>Children 16 &amp;amp; 17 years with an allocated aftercare worker at end December 2016</b><table><tr><th>Area</th><th>Number of 16 &amp;amp; 17 year olds in care</th><th>Number with allocated aftercare worker</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin South East/Wicklow</td><td>48</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South West/Kildare/West Wicklow</td><td>91</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South Central</td><td>62</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>63</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North City</td><td>121</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North</td><td>56</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Louth/Meath</td><td>70</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan/Monaghan</td><td>19</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>24</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>143</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow/Kilkenny/South Tipperary</td><td>70</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford/Wexford</td><td>59</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>29</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim/West Cavan</td><td>22</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>20</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Galway/Roscommon</td><td>63</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Midwest</td><td>95</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>National Total</td><td>1,055</td><td>432<br /><br /></td></tr></table></p></reply>

In regard to making recommendations to the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes (and certain related Matters) the Deputy will be aware that the Commission is independent in the performance of its functions. </p>  <p>  The Second Interim Report of the Commission which I published on the 11th April 2017 did not make any recommendation regarding an extension of their terms of reference.  The Commission stated that it was satisfied that the institutions it is investigating are &lsquo;unquestionably&rsquo; the main such homes that existed during the 20th century and that it does not currently recommend that other institutions be investigated.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that the Commission's terms of reference already include mechanisms to ensure that any additional matters which the Commission may deem to warrant investigation can be brought to the attention of Government.  However, I have committed to a scoping of Commission's terms of reference to see if broader terms of reference would help answer additional questions now arising and will carry it out with a focus on allowing the Commission to complete its existing work in the first instance.  The Commission will be consulted as part of this process in accordance with the Commission of Investigations Act 2004  .</p></reply>

However, my Department is aware that there is anecdotal evidence of a reduction in places for children from birth to three in centre based care, as some service providers have adapted their service offering to children aged three and older, due to increased state investment for this age group.  Pobal will conduct this profile on an annual basis so that my Department can continue to actively monitor the situation.</p>  <p>  The affordability measures introduced by my Department commencing this September will significantly increase targeted childcare subsidies, including to children under three years of age, and will for the first time provide a universal subsidy for up to 33,000 children under the age of three of up to &euro;20 per week.  This new subsidy marks an important investment in the 0-3 years age cohort, supporting all parents of children under three in registered childcare providers that take part in the scheme.</p>  <p>  When the Affordable Childcare Scheme is introduced, subsidy rates will, for the first time, vary according to the age of the child.  The highest subsidy rates will be provided to the youngest children, reflecting the higher cost of providing childcare to younger age groups as a result of differences in the adult-child ratio required by regulations.  It is expected that the higher subsidy rates for younger children will incentivise childcare providers to increase the availability of places for children less than 3 years old in particular.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year I announced a capital funding scheme that will provide &euro;3 million for additional childcare places for children in the 0-5 age range, which may include provision for children aged less than 3.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have established The Early Years Forum to allow these, and other issues of relevance, to be discussed with key stakeholders in the sector.  The Forum has enabled consultation and engagement between me, key officials from my Department, and key representatives of the sector.  My Department has established three sub-groups to provide recommendations on how to address issues raised during Forum meetings. </p>  <p>  One of these sub-groups, the Under 3&rsquo;s working sub-group of the Early Years Forum, has been tasked with identifying practical, impactful measures which could be implemented to support and sustain provision for children aged up to three years in Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC).  This sub-group has already met on three occasions and I am looking forward to receiving their recommendations.</p></reply>

While the independent statutory investigation progresses its work, I wish to develop complementary gender-sensitive transitional justice mechanisms which could support and empower former residents of these institutions and their families.  The focus will be to further acknowledge the experiences of former residents and to enhance public awareness and understanding of a range of past abuses and human rights failures. </p>  <p>  As previously outlined I have asked Dr. James Gallen of the School of Law and Government, Dublin City University, to map out a potential model of &lsquo;transitional justice&rsquo; as a means of giving voice to former residents of Mother and Baby Homes and County Homes.  Dr Gallen is currently preparing a framework document to inform my deliberations which will be submitted to the Department in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The work of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related matters is a vital step in the process to establish the facts of what happened to vulnerable women and children in these institutions.

Social work duty teams keep high priority cases under review by regularly checking to ascertain risk to the child, and where necessary will reprioritise the case.  I would note that the issue of internet safety , including the making of any regulations, generally comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  However, officials from my Department are aware of such potential threats including the sexual exploitation of young people.  These concerns were taken into consideration in the development of the new Children First Guidelines.  </p>  <p>  A joint protocol for interagency collaboration has been recently published together by Tusla and the HSE and both agencies are committed to implementing it across the country.  The protocol clarifies the separate and distinct roles, responsibilities and legal requirements of both agencies and will ensure joint and effective management of the transition of young people with a disability and / or complex mental health issues to adult services.  The objective of the protocol is to provide clarity for children and families whose needs cross between the HSE and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  It also seeks, among other things, to ensure that services are child and family centred and eliminate the potential for fragmentation or duplication.  This is a highly significant protocol governing how children in care and young people in aftercare access disability-related services.  The Protocol also provides for a clear escalation process that can be used by Tusla or the HSE should an issue arise, or if there is an unresolved matter regarding access to appropriate, available services.</p>  <p>  Each referral received by Tusla is assessed and dealt with on an individual basis by the relevant social work team.  Tusla's policy is to refer child welfare referrals to relevant family and community support services.  At any stage, if a determination is made that there is abuse, whether physical, emotional, sexual or neglect, from which there is an ongoing risk of significant harm, the child protection pathway is followed.  In a minority of cases this may lead to the child being placed on the Child Protection Notification System (CPNS) or the child being received into care.</p></reply>

Following the signature of the new legislation by the President, a commencement order will be made to commence this legislation on 1 June 2017 along with the commencement of the third payment option itself via the commencement of Part 3 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, as amended.  The implementation of the third payment option has involved ongoing collaboration between a number of key stakeholders - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Courts Service, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and my Department - and will be the culmination of a number of years work.  The project has been overseen by the Criminal Justice (Fixed Charge Processing System) Working Group, jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and has been a standing agenda item at the Working Group's meetings. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the commencement of the third payment option will lead to a further increase in fixed charge amount payment rates, as a result of the provision of an additional/third opportunity to pay the fixed charge amount.  In addition, the commencement of Section 38 of the 2010 Act on 1 June 2017 as part of the suite of fixed charge offences/FCN provisions for commencement under Part 3 of the 2010 Act, will provide that FCN service can be exercised by posting the FCN to the alleged offender.  In addition, certain presumptions have also been provided for, where the matter proceeds before the Courts, allowing for evidence of postage to be provided by An Post (or another post provider) to assist the presiding judge to challenge oral evidence whereby the accused claims not to have received the FCN in the post.  The introduction of the third payment option is also expected to impact on summons service by bringing about a reduction in the volume of road traffic offence cases proceeding to court. </p>  <p>  In tandem with the third payment option,  I can also inform the Deputy that work is underway in Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to progress the Master Licence Record (MLR) project, which will entail linking the vehicle and driving licence database of the National Vehicle Driver File.  The project will facilitate the application of penalty points to driving licences, thereby improving the effectiveness of road traffic enforcement measures.  To enable the MLR, multiple system and process changes will need to be implemented across a number of organisations, including the Courts Service, which will take some time to design and develop.  The Working Group is also responsible for monitoring and overseeing progress on the MLR project and the provision of a progress report on the Master Licence Record project is a standing agenda item at the Group's meetings. </p>  <p>  I have requested a Garda report on the matters referred to in the Deputy's Question 43 and will contact the Deputy directly on receipt of a Garda report. </p></reply>

The preparation of a Gambling Control Bill, and of a number of related early measures for inclusion in the General Scheme of the forthcoming Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, continues on that basis.  I intend to move forward as quickly as possible with the appropriate measures on both of these fronts.  I can also confirm that it remains my intention to bring forward the main Gambling Control Bill for government approval and publication later this year.</p><p>Work on the preparation of the General Scheme of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is at an advanced stage in my Department.  The General Scheme for this Bill will contain a range of provisions, many of them technical in nature, that are expected to relate to such matters as electronic courts services and some early amendments, as previously signalled, to gaming legislation.  In that regard, we expect to bring forward a number of useful modernisation and clarification measures to the outdated Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956.  In particular, it is hoped to address issues concerning minimum age for gambling activities, realistic stake and prize amounts and a clearer setting out of the circumstances for the conduct of certain activities.  It is anticipated that the General Scheme of the Civil Law and Courts (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will be brought to Government by the T&aacute;naiste soon for approval both to publish it and to submit it for  pre-legislative scrutiny and for detailed drafting to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. </p><p>In parallel to these imminent measures, work also continues in bringing forward the main Gambling Control Bill building on the General Scheme that was published in 2013.  The preparation of legislation providing for the regulation of a large, multi-million euro economic activity, with significant cross-border and electronic on-line operations, will be a major and complex undertaking.</p><p>In support of this work, I published, on 23 February 2017, a study by University College Dublin under Dr. Crystal Fulton which I had commissioned at the end of 2016.  The aims of the study, entitled &quot;Developments in the Gambling Area - Emerging trends and issues supporting the development of policy and legislation in Ireland&quot;, were to identify developments in the area of gambling, inclusive of all aspects of gambling such as technological innovation and international legislation, and, to identify new or emerging legislative and policy issues in the area of gambling not currently represented in the original General Scheme and which may need to be addressed in new legislation.  The study can be accessed through the internet link <i>.</i></p><p>Along with officials of my Department, I am continuing to consult with relevant stake-holders.  In that spirit, I look forward to discussing quite soon the gambling measures that will be contained in the General Scheme of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and, after that, to discussing the main Gambling Control Bill when it, in turn, is approved by Government for publication.</p></reply>

The Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (DAHRRGA) is the lead Department in respect of this commitment.  DAHRRGA undertook a consultation process, engaging with stakeholders and interested parties, which finished at the end of March of this year.  As part of this consultation process, meetings were held with Sparkassen, Irish Rural Link and the Public Banking Forum of Ireland. </p><p>Officials from my Department are assisting DAHRRGA to prepare a report for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and myself setting out the findings and conclusions of this investigation into the key elements of the Sparkassen model of local public banking as it relates to SMEs.  It is anticipated that this report will be completed by mid-year. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, SMEs can access lower cost, flexible finance from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI).  To the end of December 2016, the SBCI has lent &euro;544 million to 12,593 SMEs.  The SBCI&rsquo;s goal is to increase the availability of funding to SMEs at a lower cost and on more flexible terms than has been available in recent times on the Irish market.  The SBCI uses an on-lending model; this means it does not lend directly to SMEs.  At present, the SBCI has 3 bank and 5 non-bank on-lenders.  The SMEs who received SBCI finance are from a variety of business and economic sectors.  More than 80% of loans are for investment purposes and the average loan size is &euro;43,200.  There is a broad regional spread of the SMEs supported, with 84.8% of them based outside Dublin. </p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that there are already significant Government measures to support the financing needs of SMEs.  As well as the SBCI, there is the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the Microenterprise Loan Fund, Local Enterprise Offices and the Credit Review Office. </p><p>The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is a cross-government initiative.  By answering eight simple questions, SMEs will receive a tailored list of available Government supports to suit their needs.  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at<i>www.supportingsmes.ie</i>.</p><p>The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.  Further information is available on the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation website. </p><p>The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, is an additional source of credit that provides loans for up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people.  Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices nationally to administer this fund (<i>www.microfinanceireland.ie</i>).</p><p>The Credit Review Office (CRO) is another government initiative that helps SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.  This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank.  The CRO overturns more than 50% of appeals it receives.  Further details are available at <i>www.creditreview.ie</i>. </p><p>The Deputy may rest assured that it is a key Government strategy to ensure State supports enable the growth of Irish SMEs by facilitating access to credit and promoting investment in SMEs. </p></reply>

This working group was set up in January 2017, is chaired by the Department of Finance and its membership consists of officials from the Tax and Economics Divisions of the Department of Finance; the Revenue Commissioners; the Housing Division of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government (DHPCLG); and the Residential Tenancies Board.  </p>  <p>  As notified to the Deputy previously, there was an opportunity for all interested parties to engage with the Working Group as part of the targeted public consultation which was conducted over four weeks from Friday 10 March to Friday 7 April 2017.  The consultation paper asked ten targeted questions which covered subjects such as mortgage interest relief, capital repayment relief, rental accommodation as a pension investment, the deductibility of various expenses, Capital Gains Tax, long-term tenancies, accidental landlords, the Rent-a-Room Scheme and vacant properties.  Individuals had the option to answer any, all, or none of the questions, when making their submissions.  The public consultation received almost 70 written submissions from a wide range of interested parties, including individual landlords, representative bodies and charitable organisations.  A number of representatives from the sector were also invited to a meeting of the working group to discuss and present on relevant issues from their perspectives.</p>  <p>  To date, the Working Group has met five times and a sixth meeting is scheduled for early next week.  It is estimated that the report of the Working Group will be presented to me by the end of July 2017, to allow for consideration of any of the options put forward, as part of my deliberations for Budget 2018.</p></reply>

Credit unions need to maintain sufficient reserves to ensure continuity and to protect members&rsquo; savings.  The regulatory reserve requirement (capital requirement) for credit unions is the amount required to be held in the regulatory reserve of a credit union, expressed as a percentage of the assets of a credit union.  All credit unions are required to maintain a minimum regulatory reserve of at least 10% of the assets of the credit union.  Credit union reserves comprise retained earnings from current and previous years, which limits their ability to raise reserves as they do not have the ability to raise capital through other means.  Reserves available to a credit union for the purposes of the Regulatory Reserve Requirement must be realised, unrestricted and non-distributable to ensure they are capable of absorbing losses.</p>  <p>  The Report of the Commission on Credit Unions, published in April 2012, sets out detailed governance standards for credit unions.  The majority of these governance standards were reflected in the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 which provides a legislative framework to improve governance standards in credit unions with a particular focus on those who exercise significant influence and control in a credit union i.e. board of directors and the management team.  The Commission on Credit Unions also made recommendations in relation to the introduction of fitness and probity for credit unions.  In 2013, a tailored version of the Fitness and Probity regime applying to all other regulated financial service providers was introduced for credit unions and is now fully implemented. </p>  <p>  Credit union members should have confidence that those individuals holding senior positions in credit unions can demonstrate that they are competent and capable, act honestly, ethically and with integrity and are financially sound.  Under the Fitness and Probity regime for credit unions an individual is required to have and to demonstrate the competence necessary to perform specified functions.  This is normally tested with regard to the relevant experience of the individual and/or relevant qualifications.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that in the performance of her regulatory and supervisory functions, the Registrar of Credit Unions is working in the best interests of individual credit unions, their members and the sector as a whole. </p>  <p>  This Government recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in Ireland and the Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.</p></reply>

However, due to a pick-up in receipts throughout the remainder of year, income tax finished 2016 ahead of target.  </p>  <p>  It is important to point out that income tax encompasses a broad range of elements, some of which are not directly impacted by employment or wage developments.  These include Deposit Interest Retention Tax, Life Assurance Exit Tax, Dividend Withholding Tax, Professional Services Withholding Tax and Back Duty.  These payments can be 'lumpy' in nature and the timing of payments can vary from year to year.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the majority of these specific components are having a drag on overall income tax receipts in the first four months of 2017.  In relation to income tax (PAYE), the most significant component of overall income tax, it closed the first third of the year, broadly in-line with profile, down just 0.6% or c. &euro;25 million.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the performance of USC is lower-than-expected, and my Department is currently reviewing the performance of income tax in 2017, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners.  The initial indications are that Revenue is satisfied that the overall estimate of the Budget 2017, Universal Social Charges (USC) changes of &euro;335 million in 2017, were costed accurately.  </p>  <p>  At the time of Budget 2017, the apportionment of the total USC package between PAYE and Schedule D was allocated by my Department at &euro;263 million and &euro;72 million respectively, in line with previous norms.  However, subsequent analysis by Revenue, indicates that the allocation of the USC package between PAYE and Schedule D should have been &euro;311 million and &euro;24 million in favour of PAYE and Schedule D respectively, due to the dynamics of the USC package.  While, this is helping to explain the current under-performance against profile, it is important to point out that this reapportionment should have no adverse impact on the overall collection of USC receipts as this should equalise later in the year.   </p>  <p>  However, my Department along with the Revenue Commissioners will continue to examine this issue and consider all relevant developments.    </p>  <p>  Finally, with regards to State's compliance with EU fiscal obligations, Government policy as outlined in the recently published Stability Programme Update, still remains oriented to achieve our medium term objective of a structural budget balance, which we are projected to achieve in 2018.  </p></reply>

This is necessary given the mandatory nature of third party motor insurance in Ireland.  Insurance Ireland operates the Declined Cases Agreement on a voluntary basis as a means of ensuring that persons seeking motor insurance will obtain cover.  The Agreement is only triggered if an individual is unable to obtain a quotation in the open market, i.e. a person has to have approached at least three insurers without being able to obtain cover from them.  </p><p>In order to be as helpful as I can, my officials  contacted Insurance Ireland about your information request.  In response they have provided me with statistics on the number of cases they have dealt with which are set out in the table below. In relation to these cases Insurance Ireland has informed me that they secured a quotation for the applicants in question through the Agreement and that they therefore consider all of these applications to have been successful.  With regard to information on the average premium per successful application, I am informed that this is a matter for individual insurers and that this information is therefore not recorded by Insurance Ireland.  <table><tr><th>Year </th><th>No. of Cases</th></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>1941</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>1164</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>669</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>308</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>178</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>169</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>130</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>115</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>152</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>246</td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>310</td></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>379</td></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td>393</td></tr><tr><td>2001</td><td>478</td></tr><tr><td>2000</td><td>328</td></tr><tr><td>1999</td><td>329</td></tr><tr><td>1998</td><td>297</td></tr><tr><td>1997</td><td>306</td></tr><tr><td>1996</td><td>348</td></tr><tr><td>1995</td><td>350</td></tr></table></p><p>It should be noted that the Cost of Insurance Working Group examined the issue of the  Declined Cases Agreement, on foot of receiving a number of submissions and queries from individuals about its operation.  In light of feedback from members of the public, the Working Group recommended that the Declined Cases Agreement process should be made more transparent.  In this regard, Insurance Ireland are scheduled to provide a report by the end of June and annually thereafter to my Department on the operation of the Agreement, including on the cases submitted and resolved, and also on cases where a premium and/or terms are so excessive as to be tantamount to a refusal.  The Working Group also recommended that Insurance Ireland should provide further information on its website with regard to the recourse a consumer should have in cases where there is not a satisfactory outcome through the Declined Cases Agreement.  The first quarterly report on the implementation of the CIWG&rsquo;s recommendations has reported that Insurance Ireland has made the necessary alterations to its website in order to provide more prominent information in respect of the Declined Cases Agreement on the home page and that work has commenced on their first annual report on the operation of the agreement.</p></reply>

This policy has been in place since mid-2011.  In brief, remuneration in State supported banks is capped at &euro;500,000 (excluding normal pension entitlements) and no form of remuneration with any variable pay component(s), can be awarded or paid.  This policy remains in place and I have no immediate plans to alter it.</p>  <p>  However, as I indicated recently, given the State's minority shareholding in Bank of Ireland, should the bank's preferred candidate for CEO be an external individual of the required calibre and with the necessary experience for the role, I would be willing to consider an exception to the pay cap consistent with the terms of the outgoing CEO's remuneration package.</p>  <p>  In addition to the pay restrictions that are currently in place as part of Irish Government policy, it is important to acknowledge the wider European regulatory changes to bankers  remuneration that have been implemented since the banking crisis.  This includes a number of changes to the framework that applies to bonus payments (including salaries and discretionary pension benefits) to staff of relevant institutions.  The introduction of the framework in 2014 and enforced by the relevant competent authorities across Europe is designed to ensure that the excessive risk taking culture and short term focus on targets seen prior to 2008 is not repeated. </p></reply>

In a seven to ten year cycle, the FATF organises peer-reviews of its member countries Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) measures.  As part of this process, it conducts an in-depth examination of all legal, regulatory and operational measures recommended by the standards at that particular time. </p><p>Ireland was reviewed in 2006 (3rd round evaluation), and was required to take a series of follow-up actions which were signed off by FATF in 2013.  The focus of that review was on technical compliance, i.e. ensuring that our legislation was aligned with FATF standards.</p><p>Ireland is now undergoing a new &lsquo;mutual evaluation review&rsquo; (&ldquo;MER&rdquo;) under the FATF&rsquo;s 4<sup>th</sup>round.  There is a significant change in emphasis in this round, and much more attention is being paid to the effectiveness of a country&rsquo;s AML/CFT systems.  The first step in the review process was to prepare both a technical compliance submission and an effectiveness one in order to provide FATF with a good understanding of our system and how it operates. </p><p>In addition, a key aspect of the new assessment approach is that countries are required to have a much better understanding of the money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF) risks they face.  Consequently there was a requirement for Ireland to conduct an extensive national risk assessment (&ldquo;NRA&rdquo;) exercise in this area.  The NRA of ML/TF risks was published in October 2016 and can be found at the following link:</p><p>-<i>.  </i></p><p>The NRA was prepared under the auspices of the Anti-Money Laundering Steering Committee (AMLSC), a multi-agency body chaired by the Department of Finance.  The AMLSC&rsquo;s membership includes the Central Bank, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) within the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB), the Officer of the Revenue Commissioners, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB), as well as a number of other relevant Departments and bodies. </p><p>The Department of Finance, in its capacity as chair of the AMLSC and head of the Irish delegation to the FATF, coordinated and hosted the FATF&rsquo;s two week onsite assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s AML/CFT framework in November 2016.  During this time the main AMLSC members and representatives from the private sector, met with the FATF assessors in a series of meetings which covered issues such as our understanding of AML/CFT risk, supervision of the financial and non-financial areas for these risks including preventative actions been taken by &lsquo;designated persons&rsquo; such as credit institutions, the practical application of our AML/CFT legislation etc. </p><p>The FATF&rsquo;s MER, which will be formally signed off in June, seeks therefore to gain a holistic view of the effectiveness of the Irish AML/CFT regime.  Once finalised the MER will be published on-line as an external assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s AML/CFT systems.</p><p>Whilst the Department cannot comment on the results of the assessment or the contents of the draft MER in advance of finalisation at the June 2017 FATF Plenary meeting, we are satisfied with how the assessment has been conducted, and are confident that the report will be constructive for Irish AML/CFT policy going forward.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-11a.192.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017051100046#WRD02900"><p>The Deputy will be aware that I, as Minister, do not have a role in NAMA's commercial decisions.  However, while respecting NAMA's independence, I and my officials regularly engage with NAMA regarding its performance and strategy.</p><p>I maintain a regular dialogue with the NAMA Chairman and receive appropriate updates regarding NAMA's ongoing progress and future plans.  I also meet on occasion with the NAMA Board, which provides me with an opportunity to share my views and understand the Board's views.</p><p>Turning to the specific question, I assume the Deputy is referring to the article published on 16 April 2017 in the Sunday Times, referencing my attendance at a NAMA Board strategy day on 5 February 2014.  That article makes reference to NAMA's memo of the away day, which was released by NAMA under the Freedom of Information Act 2014.  I provide below the text of relevant section of NAMA's memo to which the Deputy refers: </p><p><i>&quot;The Minister noted that following Ireland&rsquo;s emergence from the Bailout Programme, one of the Government&rsquo;s key priorities was to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s debt to GDP ratio from the current 120% to the European average of 94%.  The Minister noted the wider implications and impact of NAMA&rsquo;s performance for the country and particularly for the banks.  In this context he noted that the proceeds from a sale of Ireland&rsquo;s bank shares could be used to reduce the national debt and requested that NAMA consider whether it could advance the repayment schedule of Senior Bonds through accelerating asset disposals with a view to making bank assets more saleable.&quot;</i></p><p>Though this is NAMA's note of the meeting and not my own, I do not disagree with their summary of the sentiment I expressed.</p><p>It is important to place these comments in the context of what was happening more broadly at the time.  Ireland's debt to GDP was around 120%, excluding the State's contingent liabilities relating to NAMA and IBRC.  </p><p>NAMA had achieved the major milestone of redeeming &euro;7.5bn of its government guaranteed senior debt by YE2013 and had issued an additional &euro;12.9bn of senior debt in support of the IBRC liquidation for which it had been directed to act as a backstop bidder.  </p><p>Through concerted efforts across the economy, we had generated positive momentum around Ireland's recovery and recently had exited the EU-IMF Programme of Support in December 2013.  We faced the challenge of sustaining and building upon that momentum in a way that allowed for continued debt reduction and productive investment in Ireland that facilitated not just a recovery of the FDI sector but a real recovery in the broader domestic economy.  At that point we were all making decisions every day that would impact how and at what speed our underlying domestic economy would recover and we had an ongoing responsibility to remain vigilant for opportunities to lay the foundation to accelerate a sustainable recovery of the Irish economy.</p><p>NAMA played a key role in various aspects of that sustainable recovery.  NAMA's ability to meet its objectives provided clear signals to the market evidencing Ireland's recovery.  NAMA bonds also remained a significant contingent liability for the State and posed a challenge to the recovery of the banks as holders of significant amounts of NAMA debt.</p><p>It was in the context of NAMA's contribution to Ireland's broader recovery - including the recovery of our banking sector - that I would have challenged NAMA to take advantage of the buoyant market dynamics to accelerate bond redemptions without threatening its objectives under the Act.  By achieving its objectives expeditiously, in line wit the NAMA Act, NAMA would assist in the normalisation of the Irish banks and the broader market.</p><p>These were entirely appropriate challenges to pose to the NAMA Board during its strategy day.  It is important to note that my comments to the NAMA Board did not constitute an instruction nor a direction.  These were challenges posed to the NAMA Board in the context of their overriding objectives as defined in the NAMA act.</p><p>It remained a matter for the Board to assess these challenges  and to determine the most appropriate strategy for fulfilling NAMA's obligations.  </p><p>As the Deputy is aware there were clear interdependencies between NAMA, the banks and the wider Irish economy.  In this context, it is not surprising that such linkages were a matter of discussion between the Minister for Finance and the NAMA Board at a crucial period in establishing Ireland&rsquo;s recovery.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that my officials were concurrently preparing a report under Section 227 of the NAMA Act in the period 2013-14.  The report, published in July 2014, assessed the extent to which NAMA had made progress toward achieving its overall objectives and whether the continuation of NAMA was necessary for the purposes of the Act.  The report concluded that NAMA had made significant progress in achieving its overall objectives, and based on its performance and financial projections in light of the strength of investor interest in Ireland, was well positioned to achieve its overall objectives and so continued to be necessary.</p><p>In the context of this report, consideration was given to various strategic alternatives that may facilitate NAMA achieving and ideally surpassing its objectives.  The Section 227 Review is available on the Department of Finance website via the following link: <i>www.finance.gov.ie/sites/default/files/NAMA_Section_227_Review_web2.pdf.</i></p><p>Following that review, I fully endorsed the view of the NAMA Board that, like any rational commercial operator, it should take advantage, to the greatest extent possible, of favourable Irish market conditions by increasing the flow of assets to the market while remaining faithful to its purpose and objectives under the NAMA Act.</p><p>Finally I would point out that, as this note relates to a meeting from over 3 years ago, I was referring to potential future sales of the State&rsquo;s bank assets generally and not with any specific transaction in mind. </p></reply>

The HEA allocates this funding to the institutions and the internal disbursement of funding is then a matter for the individual institution. </p>  <p>  The HEA has been closely monitoring the financial position of all of the IoTs and in particular are working closely with those Institutes, such as DKIT, that are experiencing financial difficulties in order to ensure appropriate mechanisms are put in place to eliminate any deficit as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  The HEA has a policy framework in place for engaging with vulnerable IoTs which requires Institutes to submit a three year plan to return them to a balanced budget situation.  If the Institute is unable to demonstrate how a return to a balanced budget can be achieved within this timeframe, or if actual performance deviates significantly from the plan, then the HEA will seek the appointment of an independent financial expert to work with the Governing Body and Executive Management Team to agree a revised plan and programme of remedial action. </p>  <p>   My Department and the HEA are aware of the financial difficulties being experienced by a number of the IoTs.  The Financial Review of the Institutes, recently undertaken by the HEA in order to provide an overview of the financial health of the IoT sector, to consider capacity issues and to examine the challenges for the institutions given their respective plans for the future, makes a number of recommendations on how some of the issues which contribute to funding problems in the IoT sector can be addressed.  These policy recommendations will feed into the work being undertaken on developing a sustainable funding model for the sector. </p>  <p>  In November 2015 it emerged that the draft financial results for year-end 31 August 2015 showed an increasing deficit at DKIT.  This gave rise to an urgent request by the HEA for a new 3-year financial plan designed to return DKIT to a break-even position by 31 August 2018 through a combination of income increases and cost reductions in a number of key areas including financial, staffing, research projects and maximising the effectiveness of education provision.  An external Financial Advisor was appointed to oversee this process.  This new plan was submitted to the HEA in January 2016 and agreed in consultation with my Department.  </p>  <p>  DKIT has exceeded its targets set in the financial plan thus far.  The Institute has implemented a number of actions and efficiencies from their strategic plan and have identified new approaches to including apprenticeship provision.  DKIT has also reviewed its research initiatives and have implemented a number of savings and secured a number of additional projects and funding in this area.  A revision of the draft strategic plan is currently awaited following appointment of a new Acting Head of School. </p>  <p>  The Plan is subject to ongoing monthly reviews by the Executive, the Governing Body and the HEA to monitor progress and mitigate potential issues as they arise.</p>  <p>  Funding overall for the higher education sector is a key concern for me particularly in light of the additional pressure that will fall on the system over the next decade or so. In seeking to address the issue in the short term, I have for the first time in nine years secured as part of Budget 2017, additional funding for the sector. In 2017 additional funding of &euro;36.5m will be made available with &euro;160m additional over the next three years. </p>  <p>  The Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education, published in July 2016, clearly outlines the funding challenges and offers a number of approaches and recommendations for consideration for the medium term.  As committed to in the Programme for Government, the report has been referred to the Oireachtas Education Committee and this consultation will form part of the process of formulating a plan for the future of the sector. </p>  <p>  In addition, in Budget 2017 the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I, announced a policy review with the aim of designing and implementing a sustainable and predictable multi-annual funding model for higher and further education and training involving increased Employer and Exchequer contributions from 2018.  The review will be undertaken as part of the overall response to meeting the anticipated skills needs in the economy over the coming years, in line with the policy framework set out in the National Skills Strategy.</p>  <p>  It will include an analysis of the business case for enhanced investment in the higher and further education and training sectors. In this context it will identify key elements of the new funding model and of the expected impacts including those on employers.  The review will include consultation with stakeholders.  The policy review will be published by the end of Q2 2017, and will complement the ongoing work by the Oireachtas Committee in relation to the Cassells report.</p></reply>

Seven activities were originally selected for YEI funding and the individual allocations for these activities over 2014/15 are provided in the table.</p><p><table><tr><th>Activity</th><th>Total - Allocation 2014/15 - &euro;m </th></tr><tr><td>Back to Work Enterprise   Allowance Scheme</td><td>4.648</td></tr><tr><td>JobsPlus Incentive Scheme</td><td>7.992</td></tr><tr><td>T&uacute;s</td><td>35.347</td></tr><tr><td>JobBridge</td><td>57.24</td></tr><tr><td>Youthreach </td><td>79.876</td></tr><tr><td>Momentum</td><td>13.333</td></tr><tr><td>Social inclusion &amp;amp; Community Activation Programme</td><td>6.0</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>204.436</td></tr></table></p><p>The YEI activities are fully funded up-front by the Exchequer.  The EU Regulations allow for the 2014/15 allocations to be spent and claimed before the end of 2018.  This timeframe allows Member States to undertake the necessary verification work on claims in accordance with the EU Regulations.  As no ESF claim has been submitted to date no expenditure declarations have been made in relation to the YEI.</p><p>The ESF Managing Authority and the Operational Programme Monitoring Committee (PMC) maintain an ongoing overview of the funding allocations under the PEIL and will re-allocate the available funding as required, in accordance with the EU Regulatory provisions.  The PMC has agreed in principle to the inclusion of the Community Training Centres, which are funded by the ETBs in consultation with SOLAS, as an approved activity under the YEI with effect from 1 January 2017 with an allocation to be approved following the completion of the current review of allocations.</p><p>In relation to ESF receipts, the Regulations provide for initial pre-financing/advances of EU support at 1% (or 1.5% for Member States under financial assistance in 2014 and 2015) of the full programme support, payable for each year from 2014 to 2016, together with annual pre-financing of between 2% and 3% payable from 2016 to 2023.  In May 2015 an amendment to the relevant EU Regulations resulted in an unprecedented increase in the YEI advances to be paid to Member States.  The Commission subsequently released pre-financing payments from the dedicated YEI budget line, worth 30% of the YEI budget, to provide additional financial liquidity to support YEI implementation.  However, the relevant Regulations specified that where a Member State did not submit an interim payment application by 23 May 2016 for at least 50% of the additional pre-financing amount, that the Member State must reimburse the Commission the total YEI pre-financing contribution.  The ESF regulations also provide that annual pre-financing for any year in which an interim payment application is not made in that year must also be reimbursed.</p><p>As Ireland did not submit an interim YEI payment application, the &euro;19.8m additional pre-financing received was reimbursed to the Commission.  Furthermore, as there was no ESF application made in 2016, the &euro;11.6m annual pre-financing for 2016, including &euro;1.36m for the YEI, will be offset against the 2017 pre-financing due.  The reimbursement of these amounts has not resulted in any loss of EU monies to the Exchequer.</p></reply>

The Teachers Conciliation Council is part of the scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for Teachers and was set up to deal with claims and proposals relating to the Terms and Conditions of employment of teachers.  The Council is composed of representatives of teachers, school management, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and is chaired by an official of the Workplace Relations Commission.</p>  <p>  The Teacher Exchange scheme is open to primary teachers who are registered with the Teaching Council, have completed probation and who wish to exchange their posts for educational purposes.  Educational purposes would include enabling teachers in primary schools to gain experience of teaching in different types of settings.  The concept is that teachers will gain a different experience, enrich their knowledge and understanding of their professional work and share this understanding with colleagues.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Circular the minimum period for which an exchange may occur is one year and the maximum is five years.</p>  <p>  In 2016 the issue of this time limit and the purpose of the scheme was reviewed under the auspices of Teachers Conciliation Council.  Pending the outcome of the review, the maximum period for which an exchange may occur was extended to allow applicants a sixth year of exchange in the school year 2016/17.  The outcome of the review was that the scheme was to remain for educational purposes with existing time limits.  However, following a request from teacher representatives that a voluntary transfer scheme for Primary Teachers be considered it was decided to extend the maximum period for which an exchange may occur for one further year.  Proposals, such as a voluntary transfer scheme, are normally dealt with through confidential negotiations conducted under the auspices of the Teachers Conciliation Council.</p>  <p>  The number of teachers who availed of the teacher exchange scheme in the school year 2016/17 is 232 of which 10 are in their sixth year of exchange.</p></reply>

The Department of Education and Skills invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling:</p><p>- 63% of students to attend mainstream schools</p><p>- 26% to attend special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, and</p><p>- 11% to attend special schools.</p><p>My Department considers it essential that in assessing the need for special class placements the individual needs of children should be properly assessed to determine the appropriateness of special class provision for them.</p><p>Some students, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there.  This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.</p><p>Enrolment in an ASD special class should only be considered where it has been demonstrated that a student requires the support of a special class because he/she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day even with appropriate supports.</p><p>Students enrolling in ASD Special Classes must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals (for example, psychologist, speech and language therapist, psychiatrist) stating that:</p><p>- S/he has ASD</p><p>- S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p><p>Since 2011 the NCSE has increased the number of such classes by over 50% from 548 in 2011 to 1153 at present.  The NCSE has informed my Department that it intends to establish an additional 181 Special Classes for the 2017/18 school year which will bring the total number of Special Classes available across the country to 1334.</p><p>This will include 143 ASD early intervention classes, 626 primary ASD classes and 281 post-primary ASD classes.</p><p>The number of Post Primary ASD special classes available for the 2017/18 school year will be more than double that available in 2013/14, increasing from 124 in 2013/14 to 281 in 2017/18.  This is a natural consequence of the earlier growth in primary ASD special class numbers.</p><p>However, it should not be assumed that the same levels of growth in post primary class numbers should apply.  This is because, for children with Autism, transferring from a special class in a primary school to a special class in a post primary school may not always be the optimal choice.  Many children can progress to mainstream post primary with support of SNA and Resource Teaching hours, while more may transfer from primary to a special school depending on their presentation and needs.</p><p>It should also be noted that there is a proportionally larger enrolment at Primary level due to the higher number of standard years.</p><p>The NCSE continues to establish additional special classes to support children with Special Educational Needs including Autism as required.</p><p>Parents/guardians who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) who can assist in identifying an appropriate educational placement for their child.  Contact details are available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p><p>Where there is no educational placement available, my Department will consider applications under the Home Tuition Grant Scheme, where a student can receive 20 hours home tuition per week as an interim measure until a placement becomes available.</p></reply>

The retirement provisions, which apply to public servants (including SNAs) who are not new entrants, are not affected by the Act.</p><p>There is a provision in Circular 41/2011 which enables a retired SNA to be employed by a school post retirement: 'Where an SNA who is retired and is in receipt of a pension returns to the position of an SNA on or after 1 January 2011, s/he will start on the first point of the post 1 January 2011 incremental salary scale&rdquo;.  In the event that a person who has retired on pension is subsequently re-employed, within a period of 26 weeks after retirement this subsequent employment will be in a non-pensionable capacity.</p><p>The SNA scheme provides recognised schools with additional adult support staff to cater for the care needs of pupils with disabilities in an educational context, where the nature of these care needs have been outlined in professional reports as being so significant that a pupil will require adult assistance in order to be able to attend school and to participate in education and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), is responsible, through its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports, including SNA support.</p><p>Responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational supports and resources to be allocated to schools to support individual pupils rests with the NCSE.  In making allocations to schools, the NCSE takes into account the assessed care needs of all children with identified needs in the school.  It should be noted that SNA allocations are not made to individual children, but are made to schools to support the care needs of children with assessed special educational needs in the school.  The NCSE has published an Information booklet for parents in relation to the SNA scheme on its website:<i>www.ncse.ie.</i></p><p>It is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school to allocate SNA support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised in the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.</p></reply>

This applied to Secretary and Caretaker posts in Community and Comprehensive Schools.  However, alleviation measures were put in place which permit schools to fill Clerical Officer and Caretaker vacancies provided they have less than 1 Clerical Officer or less than 1 Caretaker.  In this regard my Department is not in a position to sanction the replacement of a Caretaker or Secretary that may retire in the school referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  My Department acknowledges the need to improve these alleviation measures, particularly for the larger schools.

This determines the level of concentrated disadvantage across the school system in order to identify those schools which require the greatest level of support. </p>  <p>  Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates.  This data is applied uniformly to all schools in a fair and objective way, to identify the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in each school. </p>  <p>  Schools are not required to apply for inclusion as all schools across the country are included in the assessment. </p>  <p>  A communication is currently being prepared for issue to all schools.  This will provide further information on the identification model, including details of how the datasets are used to determine a school's level of disadvantage; the importance of data quality to the process and the need for schools to provide detailed and up to date information to my Department's online pupil databases. </p>  <p>  A key feature of the new DEIS identification process is its use of independent data which can be regularly updated to ensure a currency of the information on which resource allocation is based.  Small Area Statistics, based on the 2016 National Census will be available later this year following which the HP Index will be updated.  It is planned that the next update of the DEIS Identification Process will take place later this year when the updated Census and pupil data become available.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the DEIS programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources. </p>  <p>  Work will be carried out to consider designing a more tailored system of resource allocation, within which there are more grades of disadvantage identified and resources are allocated accordingly in response to the needs of individual schools;</p>  <p>  A Monitoring and Evaluation Framework will be implemented, to improve transparency and to determine which interventions are having the greatest impact in terms of delivering better outcomes for learners;</p>  <p>  A review will be carried out at the end of the 2017/2018 academic year to examine how the new model of allocating resources has operated;</p>  <p>  The aim will be that, following this work, in 2018 the new model of resource allocation will be finalised, the objective of which will be to more closely match resources with identified needs in individual schools. </p></reply>

In this regard, I can advise that the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill was published in July 2016.  The Bill passed second stage on 17 November 2016 and will shortly progress to Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides an over-arching framework to ensure that how schools decide on who is enrolled and who is refused a place in schools is more structured, fair and transparent.  The following is an outline of some of the Bill's key provisions:</p>  <p>  - The Bill will oblige all schools to admit pupils where there are available places.  It is important to note that 80% of schools are not oversubscribed.</p>  <p>  - The Bill provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion while including provision for single sex schools and denominational schools to reflect, in their admission policy, the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation.</p>  <p>  - The Bill includes a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school's arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction. </p>  <p>  - The Bill contains a provision prohibiting the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions for an application for admission to a school or for the enrolment or continued enrolment of a student in a school. </p>  <p>  - The Bill also provides for the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) to designate a school for a child with no school place and for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to designate a school for a child who has no school place for reasons related to the child&rsquo;s special educational needs. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that I ran a public consultation process from 24 January to 20 March 2017 on the role of denominational religion in the school admission process and possible approaches for making changes.  </p>  <p>  The 8 week phase of receiving written submissions formed part of a broader consultation process which will include additional steps, including any follow-up consultation that is required, collation of responses and development of next steps.  </p>  <p>  My Department has begun the process of examining the submissions and formulating next steps.  I will not make any decisions around next steps until such time as all of the submissions have been examined and considered.</p></reply>

In this regard, as I have said throughout, I am mindful of the need to avoid possible pitfalls and unintended consequences such as possible impacts on these minority religions and on the wishes of Protestant, Jewish, Islamic and other communities to be able to run schools in accordance with their ethos and admit children from their communities to attend those schools.</p>  <p>  The 8 week phase of receiving written submissions formed part of a broader consultation process which will include additional steps, including any follow-up consultation that is required, collation of responses and development of next steps. </p>  <p>  My Department has begun the process of examining the submissions and formulating next steps.

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence.  The self-assessed charge was set at &euro;200 per annum and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.  It is a matter for an owner, whether resident in Ireland or elsewhere, to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge and any late payment fees applicable.  Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect Non-Principal Private Residence Charges, and late payment fees due to it and all Charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.</p><p>Proceeds from the charge are retained by local authorities and are used for the provision of local services.

For example, detailed information on residential construction activity is available from local authorities and the four Dublin local authorities reported 144 active construction sites, encompassing the construction of some 5,200 new dwellings, at the end of 2016.  This is a very important source of information in terms of informing policies aimed at increasing supply in the key Dublin housing market.  </p>  <p>  In terms of building energy regulations, I understand that, in line with the European Union (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 243 of 2012), a BER Certificate must generally be obtained before a new dwelling may be occupied or offered for sale or letting.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), which comes within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, is the statutory agency responsible for the day-to-day administration of the BER Scheme, while local building control authorities are responsible for enforcement of the obligation to obtain BER certificates, in line with the 2012 Regulations.  My Department is examining the potential of BER records to offer housing activity data and will continue to work with all available datasets in order to gain as complete a picture as possible.  </p>  <p>  The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA), with the support of my Department, introduced the on-line Building Control Management System (BCMS) with effect from 1 March 2014 to facilitate building control authorities, building owners, builders and construction professionals in discharging their responsibilities under the Building Control Act 1990, as amended.  The Department is actively engaging with the LGMA with a view to further developing the potential of the BCMS as an additional source of data in relation to house building activity.   </p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office established an independent group in January 2017, chaired by an Assistant Director General, to examine housing statistics and my Department participates on that Group.  This Group is considering the best analytical approaches to reconciling and combining datasets in this area and will have oversight of, and a direct involvement in, the examination of any output arising from the variety of analyses currently underway.    </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has also established a new Housing Data Analytics Group, with membership from the CSO, Central Bank, local authorities and others to examine this complex area and to monitor and review the various sources of data collected nationally to provide a comprehensive and coherent suite of statistics relating to housing matters.</p></reply>

The total employer debt to the Social Insurance Fund at 31 December, 2016 stood at &euro;459 million.  Almost two-thirds of the debt originated during the recession years of 2008 to 2013 and three-quarters of current outstanding employer debt is in respect of insolvent companies &ndash; companies who are no longer trading.</p><p>The total expenditure and recoveries for the redundancy and insolvency payments schemes for the years 2014-2016 is outlined in the table below.  Total expenditure on the schemes over the three years was &euro;170 million. Total recoveries in the same period were &euro;29 million.</p><p>The Department of Social Protection liaises with the Insolvency Unit of the Revenue Commissioners in respect of insolvent companies.  This liaison is governed by a Memorandum of Understanding between the department and the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>The Department has a dedicated debt management unit in the redundancy and insolvency section which has responsibility for managing employer debt in line with the Department&rsquo;s debt management policy and for the provision of statistical information.  The debt is managed through the department&rsquo;s Debt Recovery and Accounting System (DRAS), which issues automated reminders and annual statements on outstanding debt.</p><p>In most cases, recovery of debt is pursued with liquidators through the liquidation process.  In cases where employers are not insolvent and are still trading the Department engages directly with the employers concerned.  In these cases the Department is mindful that an overly aggressive process in pursuing debt with companies that are still trading, but are nevertheless in a financially precarious position, might result in those companies being pushed into an insolvency situation which could result in further job losses.  Accordingly the unit engages with employers to establish the situation on a case by case basis and seeks to recover debt on a mutually agreed basis, including setting up repayment by instalment where appropriate.</p><p>The unit has a staff of six (5.1 fte) and the total cost of running the unit (including management costs) is &euro;310,000 per annum.  One of the duties of the staff in the unit is to gather and monitor data on employer debt, including data on trading status from third parties such as the Companies Registration Office.</p><p><b>Total Expenditure and Recoveries on the Redundancy and Insolvency Payment Schemes for 2014-2016</b><table><tr><th></th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016*</th></tr><tr><td>EXPENDITURE</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td></tr><tr><td>Redundancy Payments Scheme</td><td>64.6</td><td>34.9</td><td>31.0</td></tr><tr><td>Insolvency Payments Scheme</td><td>23.6</td><td>8.2</td><td>7.3</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL EXPENDITURE </td><td>88.2</td><td>43.2</td><td>38.3</td></tr><tr><td>RECOVERIES</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Redundancy Payments Scheme</td><td>7.9</td><td>5.5</td><td>8.2</td></tr><tr><td>Insolvency Payments Scheme</td><td>2.3</td><td>1.9</td><td>2.3</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL RECOVERIES</td><td>11.2</td><td>7.4</td><td>10.5</td></tr></table></p><p>*The 2016 figures are provisional pending the finalisation of the SIF Financial Statements.</p></reply>

In 2016, the Department overpaid customers by &euro;110 million.  Of this, customer fraud accounted for &euro;41 million and relates to cases where a customer intentionally provides incomplete or inaccurate information in order to receive benefits, or deliberately fails to inform the Department of relevant changes in circumstances.</p><p>Customer error accounted for &euro;46.7 million in overpayments last year.  These cases arise where a customer has provided inaccurate or incomplete information, or failed to report a relevant change in circumstances (such as an increase in means or a change in medical condition), but where clear fraudulent intent is absent.  In addition, some &euro;20 million was deemed to have been overpaid during the process of settling the affairs of persons who had died.  Most of these cases relate to pensioners who were receiving a State Pension Non-contributory payment where, after death, some level of overpayment of entitlement was judged to have arisen.  Overpayments arising from departmental/administrative errors were recorded at &euro;2.3 million in 2016.</p><p>While overpayments at any level are unacceptable, they must be judged against total programme expenditure of some &euro;19.2 billion across the 70 or so schemes that the Department administers.  The outstanding debt balance due to the Department as the end of 2016 was &euro;482.5 million in respect of approximately 191,660 individual debts.  Of this figure, 42,352 were repaying their debt which is defined as having made a repayment in the previous 5 weeks.</p><p>The number of full-time equivalent staff and the grades of persons directly involved in the recovery of overpayments is set out in the table below.  It is important to note that the recovery of overpayments is also a function of the Department&rsquo;s Intreo Service and of all centralised scheme areas.  It is not possible to further distinguish the debt recovery component of the staff engaged across the Department&rsquo;s services.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Central Debt Unit is the area that monitors and collects statistics on overpayment and recovery policies.  There are a further three dedicated Debt Recovery Units located in my Department&rsquo;s Offices in Letterkenny, Longford and Sligo.</p><p><b>TABLE &ndash; Number of Staff (FTE) on Debt Recovery Duties (May 2017)</b><table><tr><th></th><th>Central Debt Unit</th><th>Other Units</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Assistant Principal</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Higher Executive Officer</td><td>1</td><td>1.5</td><td>2.5</td></tr><tr><td>Executive Officer</td><td>4</td><td>4.5</td><td>8.5</td></tr><tr><td>Clerical Officers</td><td>10</td><td>22.3</td><td>32.3</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>16</td><td>28.3</td><td>44.3</td></tr></table></p><p><i>FTE = Full-time equivalent</i></p><p>In late 2014, the Department introduced a new integrated overpayment recording and debt management IT system, known as DRAS.  DRAS expanded on the functionality previously available to the Department and enables the operation of best practice standards in overpayment recording and debt recovery.  The improved system has provided improved control, management information and audit functionality in relation to debt transactions.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

If confirmed, these actions would amount to serious violations of fundamental human rights.</p>  <p>  Last week, senior Departmental officials met the Russian Ambassador at my request to convey my grave concerns, and those of the Irish public, at these reports.  During the meeting, my officials urged the Russian authorities to fully investigate these allegations, to ensure that any such persecution is ended immediately, to provide all affected persons with the assistance they require, and to ensure the safety of activists and journalists investigating the reports of abuse in Chechnya.</p>  <p>  In a statement delivered to the Seanad on my behalf by Minister Helen McEntee on 12 April, I joined in the widespread calls for the Russian Government to urgently undertake a full and thorough investigation into these reports and to ensure that any individuals found to have committed crimes be brought to justice.  I also emphasised Russia&rsquo;s international obligations to protect all persons who may be at risk of persecution.  This call was reiterated by the Irish Ambassador to the Council of Europe at a meeting of the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers in Strasbourg on 19 April.</p>  <p>  The European Union is also pressing the Russian authorities to ensure that the allegations are fully investigated and that those fleeing persecution are given full protection.  The EU High Representative Federica Mogherini raised the matter during a meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on 24 April.  HR Mogherini highlighted the serious concerns of the European Union and its Member States over the allegations and urged the Russian government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the rights of the gay community in Chechnya are respected, in line with Russia&rsquo;s international human rights commitments.</p></reply>

These issues include both the numbers of Palestinian prisoners, some being held under administrative detention without trial, and the conditions in which prisoners are held.</p>  <p>  Ireland raised particular concerns about the detention of minors in our intervention at the Universal Periodic Review of Israel at the UN Human Rights Council in 2013.</p>  <p>  It is only fair to acknowledge that similar concerns about conditions in prisons could be expressed about many other countries in the region and elsewhere.</p>  <p>  In relation to the current situation, I am of course deeply concerned by the hunger strike involving a large number of prisoners, now in its fourth week.  We cannot support the use of hunger strikes as a means of exerting pressure.  There is a real risk of attitudes hardening on either side, leading to tragedy.  We do not want to say anything that could add to that risk.  I am aware that previous hunger strikes have been resolved, allowing a tragic outcome to be avoided.</p>  <p>  I do not wish to comment therefore on the specific issues which the strikers have apparently raised.  However, I would reiterate our essential position &ndash; which should be an obvious one, and which applies to all prisoners &ndash; which is that detained Palestinians should have the same protections and conditions that Israel affords its own citizens.</p>  <p>  My Department raised our concerns about the hunger strike with the Israeli Ambassador on 9 May.  They have also been raised in a bilateral meeting with the Israeli mission at the EU on 10 May.</p>  <p>  The EU missions in Palestine issued a statement on Saturday concerning the hunger strikes and issues related to conditions of detention, and calling on Israel to respect fully the rights of prisoners.</p>  <p>  I addressed these matters at slightly more length in response to a Topical Issues debate in the house yesterday, and I would direct the Deputy also to my statement on that occasion.</p></reply>

The card is available to all Irish citizens who are over 18 years and hold a valid Irish passport book.</p>  <p>  The passport card is a supplement to the passport book, as such, identity and entitlement requirements are assessed on the basis of the passport book application rather than on the card application itself.  For this reason, the validity of a card cannot exceed that of the passport book on which verification of entitlement and identity was last established.</p>  <p>  All passport cards are issued with a validity of five years or until their passport book expires, whichever comes sooner.  In order to alert applicants to these parameters, when a passport card is due to expire in fewer than five years, the applicant is advised of the expiry date of the new passport card by way of information notice, generated on-screen by the application system.  In this way, the Passport Service ensures that all applicants are fully aware of the expiry date of their new passport card in advance of finalising their application and can choose not to proceed with the application at that stage, if they so wish.   </p></reply>

Expenditure outside of this timeframe is not covered by electoral rules.  Thresholds for spending in constituencies are based on the number of seats.  As long as the threshold is respected, it is for candidates and their agents to determine how to spend their resources.  This may include print and broadcast media, expenditure on posters, and digital campaigns among others.  Reimbursement of expenses from the Exchequer is capped and only applies to specific types of expenditures. </p>  <p>  SIPOC also oversees the Register of Third Parties, for individuals and organisations, other than political parties, that accept donations for political purposes and may engage in political campaigns.  Third parties who accept a donation above a certain threshold given for political purposes must register with SIPOC and submit annual returns. </p>  <p>  SIPOC is an independent statutory body and, as such, is not accountable to my Department in the performance of its functions.  However, I am advised that, at every election, SIPOC issues guidelines to candidates, election agents and political parties regarding acceptable donations and expenditures during an election campaign and that these guidelines set out what is or is not considered acceptable. </p>  <p>  I am also advised that SIPOC is aware that new and evolving technologies may impact election activities.  While all expenditures, including expenditure on digital media, are subject to the provisions of the Acts, some digital activities related to an election may fall outside of their scope, including, for example, social media engagement by individuals. </p></reply>

In the meantime, the Programme will continue to work with the six Hospital Groups to assist in increasing access to anomaly scans for those units with limited availability.</p>  <p>  One of the current challenges to increase access to anomaly scans is the recruitment of ultrasonographers.  In this context, it is expected that the establishment of Maternity Networks across Hospital Groups will assist in developing a sustainable model that ensures that all women within each Hospital Group can access anomaly scans.

We do not know yet what changes the UK may seek to the current arrangements. </p>  <p>  In theory, the UK could indeed seek to gain larger quota shares at the expense of others.  However, that could only happen if the UK were content to ignore the potential repercussions that would certainly arise from the EU side.</p>  <p>  Any attempt by the UK to increase its current quota shares at the expense of Ireland and others must, and will be resisted strenuously.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I hosted a dedicated Civic Dialogue on the potential impacts of Brexit for the seafood sector as whole.  This was very well attended by stakeholders from across the industry and gave a clear insight into the real dangers that a 'hard' Brexit presents for our fishing communities.  Representatives from across the seafood sector also met with An Taoiseach and myself to discuss the potential threats arising from Brexit.</p>  <p>  I will remain in close contact with fisheries stakeholders as the issues develop and work with them to ensure that we are all fully prepared for what are likely to be extremely complex negotiations.</p>  <p>  I am also continuing to work closely with my European colleagues to ensure that fisheries remain a top priority in the negotiations to come. </p>  <p>  I welcome the establishment of the European Fisheries Alliance, which includes representatives from the Irish industry, and believe that they will be a strong and constructive voice throughout the  negotiations.  It is clear that the alliance shares the concerns and priorities of Ireland and the other fishing Member States, namely that existing shares and access must be protected.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that, working with all stakeholders, I will be unequivocal in opposing any dilution of our existing EU quota shares and any limitations on our existing rights of access.</p></reply>

And 2017 has seen the extension of our beef market access to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to include a range of minced and processed beef products, as part of my Trade Mission there. Some technical steps remain to be taken here before exports will commence.</p>  <p>  However, despite the significant successes achieved to date, I reviewed the Department's approach to market access at present and one of the findings was that there should be a review of export markets which are open but where there are barriers to trade.  For example in relation to beef some of these barriers or costs could include the requirements for BSE testing on cattle, only cattle aged under 30 months being accepted or conditions that the meat be boneless only.  Certificates and conditions with different Third countries have evolved at different times and some of these restrictions may be related to historical issues.</p>  <p>  This review is now complete and my Department now consulting with industry  to identify priorities.  I should say of course that the conditions for importing beef are a matter for the competent authorities in the importing country.  I would envisage that this work will continue on an ongoing basis as needs arise.</p></reply>

Successful applicants are required to have completed a recognised course of education in agriculture giving rise to an award at FETAC level 6 or its equivalent.  This requirement is in place to ensure that National Reserve and Young Farmer Scheme funding is targeted at bona fide young farmers.  Under the 2015 National Reserve and Young Farmer Scheme Ireland introduced increased flexibility in order to maximise the number of eligible applicants into the schemes and  students of agricultural education were included if otherwise eligible.  Ireland was required to notify the EU Commission of the additional educational criteria being applied to the schemes in 2015 and the increased flexibility regarding educational criteria did not receive the approval of the EU Commission.  Therefore, successful applicants under the 2017 National Reserve and Young Farmers Scheme must have completed their agricultural educational qualification by 15th May 2017. </p>  <p>  Where an applicant has fully completed all aspects of their course by 15th May but has not yet been verified as successful or received final certification, a Confirmation of Education Form should be submitted with the young farmer&rsquo;s application.  This form is available to download on the Department&rsquo;s website.  The form is to be filled out by a representative of the college to confirm that the applicant has fully completed all aspects of the course by the 15th May 2017.</p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to the National Reserve and Young Farmers Scheme, including educational qualifications, are made in consultation with the Direct Payments Advisory Committee which includes members of the main farming bodies, and agricultural education and advisory services.</p></reply>

This will be an ongoing process and since the UK decision to leave the EU, includes  extensive consultation with stakeholders via the Department's Stakeholder Consultative Committee and the All-Island Civic Dialogue process, in respect of which I have hosted four agri-food and fisheries sectoral dialogues. </p>  <p>  In terms of published works, Teagasc published a study on 14 April 2016 under the title "Brexit - Potential Implications for the Irish Agri-Food Sector".  The study examined four scenarios under which Irish agri-food exports to the UK declined by differing amounts, with exports diverted to other markets at varying discounts, and found that the value of exports could fall by between 1.4% and 8%.  </p>  <p>  In January of this year, Bord Bia launched its &ldquo;Export Performance and Prospects 2016-2017&rdquo; report, which analysed the performance of the food and drink sector during 2016 and its prospects for 2017.  According to its estimates, the underlying weakness and volatility of sterling negatively affected the competitiveness of Irish exports, reducing the value of trade with the UK by a potential &euro;570 million in 2016.  However, this was offset by increased exports to other international and emerging markets such as North America, China and the rest of Asia, and overall, the value of agri food exports increased in 2016.</p></reply>

These include production costs, tastes and preferences in export and import markets as well as any issues which effect demand and supply, including geo-political stability or exchange rate volatility. </p>  <p>  The 4,162mt referred to in the Deputy's question appears to relate to a figure ascribed to UK imports of cheddar for March, published in the media earlier in the year.  It is my understanding that the UK import statistics published were in respect of the month of January and that UK March Trade statistics are not yet published.  The UK statistics for January did show that the UK imported 4,162mt of cheddar of which 3,620mt was imported from Ireland.</p>  <p>  While any reduction in trade values is a matter of concern, it is not possible to draw clear conclusions from statistics available for a particular month.

China is now such an important partner of Ireland on agri-food issues and they are our third largest trading partner in this sector.  Irish Agri-food exports to China have increased from approximately &euro;240 million in 2012 to &euro;780 million in 2016, a three-fold increase.  </p>  <p>  Signing the Beef Protocol on the export of beef from Ireland to China with Minister Zhi marked another major milestone in the process of getting Irish beef exported to China.  It is the culmination of five years of intensive political, technical and diplomatic engagement with the Chinese authorities.  The Protocol sets out the obligations of the Department in trading beef with China. </p>  <p>  In order to complete the process to allow Irish beef exporters access to the Chinese market a veterinary health certificate with AQSIQ must be finalised.  This is the document which would accompany the actual consignment of beef.  Some of the criteria that will need to be in the certificate are already set out in the Protocol. </p>  <p>  This will be followed by an inspection visit by the Chinese Certification and Accreditation Administration (CNCA) to approve individual processing plants for export.</p>  <p>  The conclusion of this process is regarded by my Department as a matter of the highest priority and is currently being progressed in conjunction with the Irish Embassy in Beijing.  Ultimately, however, the timeline for the finalisation of these arrangements is a matter for the Chinese Authorities.  </p></reply>

The draft legislation was referred to the Office of the Attorney General on 4 May for priority drafting of a Bill.</p><p>The proposals aim to address a number of key issues which have been identified as being areas where current employment rights legislation can be strengthened to the benefit of employees, particularly low-paid and more vulnerable employees, without imposing unnecessarily onerous burdens on employers and businesses.  </p><p>The proposals are the result of extensive consultations, including the public consultation of the University of Limerick study on Zero Hour Contracts and low hour contracts as well as a detailed dialogue process with ICTU and Ibec over a period of several months.</p><p>The proposals address the following key issues:</p><p>-  Ensuring that employees are better informed about the nature of their employment arrangements and in particular their core terms at an early stage of their employment.</p><p>-  Strengthening the provisions around minimum payments to low-paid, vulnerable workers who may be called in to work for a period but not provided with that work.</p><p>-  Prohibiting zero hours contracts, except in cases of genuine casual work or emergency cover or short-term relief work for that employer.</p><p>-  Ensuring that workers on low hour contracts who consistently work more hours each week than provided for in their contracts of employment, are entitled to be placed in a band of hours that reflects the reality of the hours they have worked over an extended period.</p><p>-  Strengthen the anti-victimisation provisions for employees who try to invoke a right under these proposals.</p><p>I am referring the draft legislation to the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for the Committee to consider and determine if it wishes to engage in pre-legislative scrutiny of the proposed Bill.</p></reply>

In terms of overarching national outcomes one of the metrics relates to Ireland's competitiveness.</p>  <p>  The  metric used is sourced from the World Bank Doing Business.  Economies are ranked on their ease of doing business, from 1&ndash;190.  A high ease of doing business ranking means the regulatory environment is more conducive to the starting and operation of a local firm.  The rankings cover ten topics, each consisting of several indicators, giving equal weight to each topic.</p>  <p>  At the time of developing Enterprise 2025, Ireland ranked 13th overall and 7th when compared with small economies.  Based on the most recent World Bank data, Ireland's ranking has dropped to 9th when compared with small economies. </p>  <p>  However, as measured by the IMD's World Competitiveness Yearbook, Ireland's relative competitiveness has improved since 2011 - moving from 16th to 7th in 2016.  According to the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report, Ireland's ranking has moved up from 25th to 24th position.</p>  <p>  Ireland's relative competitiveness and ease of doing business is crucially important as we face a considerably changed global landscape.  </p>  <p>  In this context I have asked my officials to undertake a progress review of Enterprise 2025 and of our performance overall against the range of metrics used.  We need to determine the extent to which the policy framework and priorities set out in Enterprise 2025 are robust in light of potentially disruptive global change and domestic enterprise growth dynamics and changes necessary.  In addition, the work of the National Competitiveness Council is of considerable value in highlighting specific challenges in terms of relative competitiveness that will inform our policy responses</p></reply>

Although the global economy has been in a low growth phase over the last five years, Ireland&rsquo;s internationally traded sector has driven solid economic growth, demonstrating its ability to rebound following a deep recessionary period.  Our export led strategy is delivering jobs throughout the economy &ndash; there have been almost 209,000 jobs created since 2012 and the unemployment rate is now down to 6.2%.</p><p>In terms of agency supported enterprises, total exports for 2015 (latest data available) amounted to &euro;171 billion.  Of that, exports of Irish-owned agency assisted firms were &euro;18.7bn, equating to almost 11% of total exports by agency supported enterprises, as illustrated in the following table.  </p><p>In terms of Direct Economic Expenditures (materials and services sourced in Ireland and payroll), Irish-owned firms account for just over half of the total expenditure in the Irish economy by agency supported firms in 2015, as set out in the following tables. </p><p><b>Exports - agency supported enterprises</b><table><tr><th></th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;'000</td><td>&euro;'000</td><td>&euro;'000</td></tr><tr><td>Foreign Owned</td><td>126,696</td><td>134,963</td><td>152,577</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Owned</td><td>14,909</td><td>16,569</td><td>18,731</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>141,605</td><td>151,532</td><td>171,308</td></tr><tr><td>Irish owned   as % of total</td><td>10.53%</td><td>10.93%</td><td>10.93%</td></tr></table></p><p><b>DirectEconomy Expenditures</b><table><tr><th>Foreign Owned</th><th>19,061</th><th>20,471</th><th>20,818</th></tr><tr><td>Irish Owned</td><td>18,844</td><td>20,605</td><td>21,793</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>37,905</td><td>41,076</td><td>42,611</td></tr><tr><td>Irish owned as   % of total</td><td>49.71%</td><td>50.16%</td><td>51.14%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This research on manufacturing exports examines how firms launch, adapt, diversify and grow their exports and provides insights into the opportunities, risks and challenges of operating in the global marketplace.</p>  <p>  It shows that exporting is highly concentrated in a relatively small percentage of firms and most exporters sell a small number of products to few markets.  11% of highly globalised Irish-owned firms (exporting more than 20 products to over 20 destinations) account for 46% of total exports.  Exporting firms continually adjust product and market mixes.  In the context of indigenous manufacturing companies it outlines the risks and challenges faced by businesses across many sectors in gaining traction with new products in existing markets and new products in new markets.</p>  <p>  Export growth is largely driven by product and market changes.  While in the short and medium run export volumes may be largely explained by the sales of existing products to their current markets, in the long run, the drivers of export growth are expansion of markets and products.</p>  <p>  The findings in this report formed an input into the development of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy 2017-2020 &ndash; Build Scale, Expand Reach, Deliver Global Ambition, which is designed to support companies to further growth in existing markets and to develop new products and services to gain entry to new markets.</p>  <p>  Following the UK withdrawal from the EU and given the level of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s clients&rsquo; exports to the UK (37% in 2015), I have secured additional Capital and current funding for Enterprise Ireland in 2017, to further assist it in supporting clients, protecting Irish jobs and exports. </p>  <p>  39 extra staff are being provided for Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s overseas offices and in the Irish based team.  These will be assigned to markets that are growing and have scale (including China, India, Latin America, Africa) and markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth (including UK, France, Benelux, Germany, USA, the Nordics).</p>  <p>  Driving new growth and supporting companies exposed to Brexit is a priority for my Department.</p></reply>

The Council's report provides a timely reminder of Ireland's strengths, which need to be protected and enhanced, and also of areas where we need to remain vigilant and accelerate progress on addressing competitiveness gaps with the UK so as to ensure job creation across all regions.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Government are very conscious of the need for a sustained focus on competitiveness.  The 2017 Action Plan for Job sets out an ambitious target for Ireland to achieve a top 5 global competitiveness ranking based on the IMD Competitiveness Scorecard by 2020.  Through the reforms set out in the 2017 Action Plan for Jobs, my Department and others are working to improve the ease of doing business, reduce the administrative burden by putting transactions on-line, enhance our cost competitiveness such as addressing insurance costs, increase innovation capacity and productivity and drive greater efficiencies across the enterprise base.</p>  <p>  My Department is also increasing resources for Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to increase the competitiveness of our indigenous enterprise base and enhance our attractiveness as a location for FDI relative to the UK.  We have increased resources for the enterprise development agencies.  Enterprise Ireland has published its new strategy for the period to 2020 while IDA Ireland is undertaking a progress review of its five year strategy.  We are undertaking a review of our own Government enterprise policy Enterprise 2025.  We are examining the sector-by-sector implications of the UK leaving the Single Market.  Work is underway on possible future supports for SMEs that could be impacted by Brexit.  As a follow-on to the Government&rsquo;s new Trade and Investment Strategy, Ireland Connected, launched in March, Enterprise Ireland will shortly publish its Eurozone Strategy.</p>  <p>  The challenges posed by Brexit provide urgent impetus to pursue policies that enhance our competitiveness performance.  We have already begun steps to address this, prioritising investment to improve the availability and quality of infrastructure as part of the Review of the Capital Plan and the forthcoming National Planning Framework, within the context of ensuring the sustainability of our public finances.</p>  <p>  We have placed a central focus on further developing our skilled labour force so as to retain and win mobile investment and support the growth of a cohort of internationally-trading indigenous companies.  We are continuing to invest in skills development under the National Skills Strategy.</p>  <p>  Through a range of measures, including MicroFinance Ireland and the Credit Guarantee Scheme developed by my Department, we are enhancing access to competitively priced sources of finance for growth to facilitate businesses to establish and grow.  We are also increasing public investment in R&amp;D to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s innovation performance.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to implement improvements to policies that were identified as priority areas in the report.  Competitiveness is key to success in international markets and helping businesses to improve their competitiveness will remain a key focus for my Department and Government.</p></reply>

EFSI is one of the three pillars of the Investment Plan for Europe that aims to revive investment in strategic projects around Europe to ensure that money reaches the real economy.  EFSI has been integrated into the EIB Group and projects supported by EFSI are subject to the normal EIB project cycle and governance. </p>  <p>  My Department has no direct role in securing funding from EFSI on behalf of SMEs or commercial enterprises. </p>  <p>  EFSI has two specific windows: the SME Window and the Infrastructure &amp;amp; Innovation Window.  The latter is managed by the European Investment Bank (EIB) whilst the former is managed by the European Investment Fund (EIF), through financial intermediaries.  Each Window has a ring-fenced budget. </p>  <p>  Under the SME Window, SMEs and mid-caps seeking loans and equity capital under EFSI must contact EIF-approved financial intermediaries directly. </p>  <p>  Such financial intermediaries are Financial, Credit &amp;amp; Guarantee Institutions, and Loan Funds established and operating in one or more of the EU Member States duly authorised to carry out lending/leasing activities to SMEs and Small Mid-Caps, as well as Fund management companies targeting SMEs and Small Mid-Caps.  They apply to the EIF to become approved financial intermediaries and to secure EFSI financing, deployed through EIF.</p>  <p>  Under the Infrastructure and Innovation Window, large corporates, special purpose vehicles or Midcap companies (with up to 3,000 employees) can apply directly to the EIB for project loans or loans to finance research and innovation.  These loans have a minimum size of &euro;25 million.  Such projects undergo the standard EIB due diligence process, in order to verify their eligibility for EIB financing and for EFSI backing.</p></reply>

The policy paper examined the option of imposing price-caps on childcare providers to prevent erosion of subsidies through fee-inflation.  The policy paper noted the potential benefits of price-caps, including preventing fee-inflation and providing certainty for parents, and equity between parents.  It did however note the problems that might arise. Introduction of price-caps would represent economic regulation of the market, raising legal questions as well as economic questions as to what constitutes a fair price for childcare. </p>  <p>  The policy paper recommended that there should be no initial price-cap, but that the option of price-caps should be considered following the Independent Review of Costs and examination of the initial market response to higher subsidies.  The Independent Review, which will be commissioned later this year, will include examination of variation in costs and fees.  It will be a key input into any future consideration of the potential benefits and risks of introducing price-caps.</p></reply>

When it is introduced, two schemes will then be in operation to support the affordability of childcare and early education: the Affordable Childcare Scheme, and the ECCE free pre-school programme, which will continue to provide 15 hours of free early education each week during term-times for children from the age of 3 until they start primary school.</p>  <p>  The Independent Review of the Cost of Quality Childcare, which will be commissioned later this year, will include consideration of factors that impact on the financial viability of the childcare sector.  While the precise scope and methodolody of the Independent Review is still to be confirmed, the Review is likely to examine issues such as: </p>  <p>  -  the total average cost of provision;</p>  <p>  -  costs and revenues for services operating in disadvantaged communities, including the range of service provided by such services and sustainability issues and </p>  <p>  -  the likely impact of future cost-pressures. This will inform future policy development and Estimate processes.</p>  <p>  In the longer term, the question of sustainability must be addressed comprehensively, and at the core of this is working with community services to develop adequate funding streams and business models.  The Deputy will be aware that I have recently announced a significant expansion and extension of the funding available under the Community Childcare Subvention from September of this year; which I anticipate will be of significant assistance to services.  In addition arrangements are progressing for the provision of 'non-contact time' funding to services this summer, representing an additional seven days' payment to each service, for which I secured &euro;14.5m in Budget 2017.  I will be seeking to retain this funding in 2018 and am examining integrating this into the capitation rates paid to services.  I will also be examining how the &euro;1m sustainability funding provided for 2017 can be used in 2018, and I will be working with the sector and stakeholders in this endeavour.</p></reply>

As many families have more than one child in childcare, the number of families benefiting from the scheme is expected to be less. </p>  <p>  It is expected that over time the number of beneficiaries is likely to rise further, as the labour market response and changes in parental choices in response to the rise in childcare subsidies will take time to have their full effect. </p>  <p>  It must be stressed that these figures are estimates.  The take-up of childcare subsidies depends not just on eligibility, but on parental demand for childcare, and on the availability of childcare places in local childcare facilities that are taking part in the scheme.</p>  <p>  As the policy paper on the Single Affordable Childcare Scheme makes clear (p.66) &ldquo;We do not know how great the increase in demand will be, and the research evidence does not offer a clear guide.  International research in relation to the impact of childcare reforms on the demand for childcare indicates considerable variation between countries, which reflects variation in labour market conditions, in the degree of targeting of reforms and in parental preferences between different types of childcare, and there is no Irish research on the question."</p></reply>

However, it is essential that public subsidies are only provided to childcare providers where there is a sufficient level of assurance of the quality of provision.  For this reason, the Affordable Childcare Scheme will be delivered through Tusla-registered childcare providers, both centre-based providers and childminders. </p>  <p>  A working group has been established, chaired by Childminding Ireland (CMI), and including officials from Tusla and the Department, to make recommendations on reforms for the sector including proposals in relation to quality assurance, whether on a voluntary/non-statutory basis in the short term, or on a mandatory/statutory basis in the long term.  These will include recommendations in relation to childminders who are exempt from registration with Tusla (Child and Family Agency) (those minding three or fewer pre-school children, or those minding school age children only).  The recommendations are likely to include proposals to be progressed in the short, medium and long term, including the development of National Quality Standards for childminders and a proportionate system of quality assurance and regulation.  The Group hopes to present its recommendations to me as Minister very shortly.</p>  <p>  Depending on the recommendations of the Working Group, it is possible that other approaches to quality assurance may be developed for childminding, possibly on a temporary basis pending transition to full regulation.  It is with that possibility in mind that the Heads of Bill and General Scheme for the Affordable Childcare Scheme proposes the possibility that approved providers under the Scheme may include both Tusla-registered providers and other approved providers whose quality has been assured by other mechanisms, to be specified in regulations.  This proposed approach to the inclusion of childminders in the scheme is dependent on the development of a satisfactory approach to quality assurance.  There is no question of providing subsidies where quality standards have not been assured.</p></reply>

This can be as a result of abuse and/or neglect and their parents' inability to care for them due to a combination of difficulties in their own lives.  Of the children in care at the end of February, 92% were in foster care nationally; there were 4,127 (65%) children in general foster care, 1,695 (27%) in relative care.  </p><p>At the end of February, 355 (6%) children in care  were in a residential placement.  A child is placed in a residential setting only when they have an identified need that can be met by this service or for an intensive assessment or provision of specialist services.  In general, these centres are based in domestic style homes in the community, and staffed by social care workers to attend to the needs of the child.  Specialist supports are also made available, as needed, and many centres have specialist skill-sets and therapeutic modalities. </p><p>Tusla has advised that figures from 2015 are the most up to date regarding the duration of stay.

The census findings indicates that at that time there were 59 children in residential care, and 523 children in foster care, who have been diagnosed by a clinical specialist as having a moderate to severe disability. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that  information which affects a young person's care plan is addressed as part of care planning.  A child in care will be allocated a social worker and a regularly reviewed care plan will be put in place.  Children in care who have been diagnosed by a clinical specialist as having a moderate or severe disability may avail of disability services operated by the HSE, or from the private sector.  Foster care placements are monitored by Tusla, for example by regular visits from the child's allocated  social worker and the foster family's  link worker.  In addition, Tusla's services are subject to regulatory inspection, primarily  by the Health Information and Quality Authority. </p>  <p>  Any allegation involving a child is dealt with under Children First, and, under its policies and procedures, these are given child protection assessments.  Where credible disclosures of welfare or abuse concerns are received, social workers act sensitively to protect the child, taking into account the negative impact that may arise from disrupting the life of the young person, when mitigating the risk to them.  However, this is sometimes unavoidable, particularly where a young person must be moved to a new care setting.</p>  <p>  With respect to young persons with special needs or mental health issues, a joint protocol for inter-agency collaboration has been recently published together by Tusla and the HSE, who are committed to implementing it across the country.  The protocol clarifies the separate and distinct roles, responsibilities and legal requirements of both agencies and will ensure joint and effective management of the transition of young people with special needs and/or complex mental health issues to adult services.  The Protocol also provides for a clear escalation process that can be used by Tusla or the HSE should an issue arise, or if there is an unresolved matter regarding access to appropriate, available services.</p>  <p>  A young person is no longer in Tusla's care when they reach the age of 18 years.  Where a young person with special needs has been in care with Tusla, the young person is supported in the transition to independent living or, where appropriate, transfer to adult services provided by the HSE.  The aftercare planning is a collaborative approach that involves the young person, their families, their carers and relevant State bodies.  In the case of vulnerable adults, the HSE has a national policy and safeguarding team in place. </p></reply>

Any child who resides in Ireland and who is not receiving adequate care and protection can be received into the care of the State if deemed to be the appropriate action required.  Tusla is required under the 1991 Act to investigate allegations of abuse, including historical abuse, and to engage with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where appropriate.  Tusla has a key role in supporting some of the most vulnerable children and young people in State care.  My Department provides funding for Tusla. In 2017 it has been allocated exchequer funding of &euro;713 million, representing an increase of &euro;37 million on 2016.  Tusla provides a comprehensive range of services and supports for vulnerable children and families.  These include child welfare and protection, including family support; educational welfare; pre-school inspection and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  These services and supports are provided by Social Workers, Educational Welfare Officers, and Early Years Inspectors.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that my Department is leading a review of the Child Care Act 1991.  This work is being progressed in close cooperation with Tusla. The review process will also involve consultation with stakeholders.</p><p>The Children First Act 2015 was signed into law on 19<sup>th</sup>November last year.  With the removal of the common law defence of reasonable chastisement, children now enjoy the full protection of the law in relation to assault.  This new legislation will also provide for mandated reporting of child protection concerns and will require organisations working with children to prepare Child Safeguarding Statements.  I have approved phased preparations for implementation of the remaining provisions of the Act in the period up to end 2017.  The legislation will operate side-by-side with the existing non-statutory obligations provided for in Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2011.  The Guidance is currently being revised and updated to take account of the new legislative obligations so as to provide in one place a comprehensive reference resource for individuals and organisations.  A statutory Children First Inter-Departmental Implementation Group has been established to promote the importance of Children First compliance across Government and to ensure a consistent approach is adopted. </p><p>My Department has responsibility for the Oberstown Children Detention Campus and it has a range of procedural safeguards in place to ensure the safety and welfare of the children detained there.</p><p>The Deputy will of course be aware that there is a broad range of legislative protections for children across a range of Government Departments - Health, Education, Justice, Social Protection - which are embraced by the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.</i></p></reply>

The key principle of the Children Act 2001 is that detention of a child should only be imposed as a last resort.  When children come into contact with the criminal justice system there is an emphasis on the promotion of community based options in the first instance.  The Irish Youth Justice Service oversees a significant investment in community based programmes to divert young people from further involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour.  In 2016, approximately &euro;17m has been allocated by the Department of Justice and Equality to the Irish Youth Justice Service to administer Garda Youth Diversion Projects, Young Persons Probation Projects and a number of other youth diversion community-based projects.  These projects also benefit from support under the European Social Fund.</p>  <p>  My Department provides funding to the Irish Youth Justice Service for services relating to the Oberstown Children Detention Campus (Oberstown) and the Bail Supervision Scheme which has recently been established on a pilot basis.</p>  <p>  The Bail Supervision Scheme provides therapeutic supports in the community for children who are subject to bail conditions.  The service is a &lsquo;wraparound&rsquo; service to the young person and their family with a prescribed reporting system back to the courts through the appropriate statutory bodies; Probation Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Oberstown.</p>  <p>  If a child is remanded or sentenced to a period of detention in Oberstown, a range of rehabilitative supports is offered as part of an overall programme, which focuses on the child&rsquo;s individual needs and provides the framework for each child&rsquo;s individual journey through detention.  The focus is on developing supportive relationships with the main emphasis placed on education and rehabilitation.  </p>  <p>  The Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS) is a national service provided by Tusla; they provide clinical services to children in the community, children in detention and also in special care facilities.  On admission to Oberstown an individual management plan is put in place for each child which includes a mental health assessment to determine the need for more specialist support provided by ACTS and short term interventions may continue when the child returns to the Community.</p>  <p>  Oberstown also have service level agreements with EPIC, the Youth Advocacy Programme (YAP) and Le Ch&eacute;ile - Mentoring and Youth Justice Support Services.  These provide rehabilitative services to children and young people in detention and during their transition back to their home and community by providing mentoring and support to both the young person and their family.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills provides education and training services through the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board.  These include both primary and secondary level courses as well as a wide range of vocational and Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) accredited awards through the Oberstown Education Centre.</p>  <p>  The wide range of rehabilitation, education and support services provided and supported by the Irish Youth Justice Service are detailed in the Tackling Youth Crime: Youth Justice Action Plan 2014 &ndash; 2018, and a progress report covering the period 2014 to 2015, published in December 2016, is available on my Department's website.</p></reply>

Against this backdrop, my Department has engaged in a reform programme to ensure quality effective, value for money services that are evidence based and designed to secure the best outcomes for young people.  In this regard you will be aware that the targeted schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of the impact youth service provision has on young people&rsquo;s lives.  The review made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead.  These included the merging the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects into a single youth funding scheme.  The work on the development of this new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department and consultations with youth services are continuing with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the Value for Money and Policy Review of Youth Programmes over the coming years.</p>  <p>  My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  The funding schemes support national and local youth work involving approximately 1,400 youth work staff working in youth services and communities throughout the country.  The schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme under which funding is made available on an annual basis to thirty national and major regional youth organisations, the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme which supports youth work activities at a local level and the Youth Information Centre Scheme which funds twenty five Youth Information Centres.</p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy 2015-2020, published in 2015 was developed in close consultation with statutory youth interests and the voluntary youth organisations and services that work with young people.  The strategy sets out Government&rsquo;s aims for young people, aged 10 to 24 years, so that they are active and healthy, achieving their full potential in learning and development, safe and protected from harm, have economic security and opportunity and are connected and contributing to their world.  </p>  <p>  My Department, along with all government departments, was required to deliver substantial savings on all funding programmes in line with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2012 &ndash; 2014.  My Department sought to ensure that front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people, were protected as far as is possible from the impact of any necessary reductions in funding.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that Budget 2017 has provided some &euro;57m in current funding to my Department to support the provision of youth services.  The increase of &euro;5.5m, along with increases previously provided in Budget 2016 effectively reverses the cuts endured in recent years. </p></reply>

The Government decision provided that the deployment is subject to finalisation of a bilateral arrangement with the Italian authorities in relation to the operation of the mission and the landing of persons rescued.  </p>  <p>  Standard practice, since the first deployment of the Naval Service to the Mediterranean, has been that the Naval Service vessels do not depart their base in Haulbowline until the relevant diplomatic procedures are completed, which normally takes four to six weeks.  This is necessary to ensure that the requisite coordination arrangements with the Italian authorities and the arrangements for the landing of rescued migrants are in place before a vessel commences operational duties.  The requirement for completion of the diplomatic arrangements has been a feature of all Naval Service deployments to the Mediterranean to date and is well understood by all involved.  As such, no date for a deployment had been determined and there has been no delay in the deployment of the vessel.</p>  <p>  On receipt of the Government decision, the relevant communication was made to the Italian authorities by the Department of Defence through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Embassy in Rome.  There has been ongoing contact with the Italian authorities in relation to this matter and I expect, in accordance with normal procedures, the exchange of diplomatic notes to be completed shortly.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Naval Vessel cannot deploy until all of the relevant diplomatic procedures have been completed in accordance with standing practice and the relevant Government decision.</p></reply>

Private Doherty was later found dead from gunshot wounds and Private Joyce was missing.  The attackers are unknown. Over the years, extensive diplomatic and military efforts to locate Private Joyce have proved fruitless.  To date, no information has been elicited to lead to the recovery of Private Joyce&rsquo;s remains.</p><p>In late June 2015, Mr. Roderick Murphy presented his draft report to the Minister for Defence.  Following a review of his report a number of clarifications were raised with Mr. Murphy which were addressed.

The Reviewer received comments from families and a number of persons identified.  He has considered these comments and has amended the draft Report where he has considered it appropriate to do so.  As a result of this exercise further legal advice was sought from the Attorney General.  This advice has been received and is under consideration with a view to finalising the report.
