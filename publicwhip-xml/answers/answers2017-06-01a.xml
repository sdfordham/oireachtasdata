My decision at that time was informed by the instability in the international economy (including risks posed by Brexit), the still fragile nature of our economic recovery, the need to protect hard won competitiveness gains, the high level of debt, the continuing fiscal deficit, the obligation to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact, and the need to balance competing demands within the available fiscal space.  All of these factors remain challenging.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government committed the Government to establish a Public Service Pay Commission to examine pay levels across the public service.  The Public Service Pay Commission produced its first report earlier this month.  The independent evidence-based analysis is a key input to the negotiations currently underway on the extension of the Lansdowne Road Agreement and further unwinding of the financial emergency legislation. The outcome to these negotiations and the ongoing economic and budgetary environment will inform my necessary considerations for the next statutory report under the FEMPI legislation which will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas at the end of June. </p></reply>

PRD applies to the pay, including any non-pensionable pay elements, of pensionable public servants.</p>  <p>  Specifically, section 2(1)(b) of the 2009 Act provides that any public servant who is a member of a public service pension scheme or who is entitled to benefit under such a scheme or receives a payment in lieu of membership of such a scheme is subject to PRD.</p>  <p>  Across the public service certain cohorts of employees in a few specific occupations are not members of a public service pension scheme, but may instead qualify for a one-off non-recurring gratuity payment at retirement provided that they meet certain conditions.</p>  <p>  It is understood that the possibility of qualifying for such a gratuity would exist in particular for certain retained firefighters and for certain home help workers.  The overall number of such affected public service employees is believed to be quite small.</p>  <p>  The payment of such a one-off non-recurring gratuity at retirement to qualifying public service workers constitutes a payment in lieu of pension scheme membership.  On that basis the pay received by those workers before retirement and gratuity award, is liable to PRD. </p>  <p>  It should however be noted that in practice many of those employees may already be free of PRD, or may be paying much less PRD than previously, on account of the significant amelioration of PRD provided for under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015.  This amelioration means that, from 1 January 2016, all persons with annual public service earnings of up to &euro;26,083 were exempt from PRD, and from 1 January 2017, this exemption threshold has risen to &euro;28,750.  </p></reply>

In the three year period 2015 to 2017 there is annual average growth in gross voted expenditure of 3 per cent. This represents prudent growth in expenditure following the period when significant fiscal consolidation was required to put the public finances on a sound footing.</p>  <p>  The Government continues to prioritise investment in economic and social infrastructure to underpin the economy&rsquo;s growth potential.  The Revised Estimates Volume 2017 provides an additional &euro;0.3bn in capital expenditure over the 2016 outturn, bringing the total to &euro;4.5bn. Furthermore, as indicated in the Stability Programme Update published last month, gross voted capital expenditure will increase to &euro;7.3bn by 2021. </p>  <p>  Within a context of increasing resources, managing the delivery of public services within Budgetary allocations remains a key responsibility of each Minister and their Department, and important measures are in place to help ensure that these budgetary targets continue to be met.  The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against the published expenditure profiles.  There is regular reporting to Government on these matters, and information is published monthly, as part of the Exchequer Statement. Gross voted expenditure of &euro;17,849 million to end-April was &euro;282 million (1.6%) below profile.</p>  <p>  Turning to public service pay the Government Expenditure Ceiling for 2018 includes a provision of &euro;0.3 billion relating to pay commitments arising under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  As the Deputy will be aware, negotiations are currently taking place with the Public Service Unions on a successor to the Lansdowne Road Agreement. </p>  <p>  Given the many competing priorities and demands for resources, the Spending Review currently underway will support prudent fiscal management and assist with prioritising between policy initiatives to ensure resources are allocated to areas where they can have the greatest impact in terms of social and economic gain.</p></reply>

This process will result in capital allocations being made by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to other Government Departments, rather than allocations being made by my Department to specific projects or geographic areas.  Any decisions on the capital allocations will not be made until after that process is complete.</p>  <p>  The Deputies will appreciate that it is a matter for each Department, in the first instance, to identify its sectoral priorities and projects in their submission for any additional funding under the review. </p>  <p>  Submissions in relation to the review and the additional funding available for allocation were sought from Departments in January and are currently under review by my Department.  </p>  <p>  Assessments and recommendations made by each Department will play an important role in ensuring that the additional funding is aligned with priorities in terms, for example, of overall economic and social returns from increased public capital investment.</p>  <p>  A public consultation process was also held in April to ascertain the views of the public and key stakeholders on what our national infrastructure priorities should be.  This consultation also sought views on infrastructure investment priorities beyond the period of the current Capital Plan, which will help formulate a longer term Capital Plan for the next 10 years.</p>  <p>  My Department's assessment of the submissions received as part of the Capital Review will be based on, for example, an Infrastructure Capacity and Demand Analysis carried out by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service.</p>  <p>  My Department is also liaising closely with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in order to ensure close alignment with the new National Planning Framework due to be published later this year.</p>  <p>  This work being carried out by my Department will ensure that the additional capital resources available are targeted on priority public capital infrastructure required to support Ireland's medium-term growth potential and underpin social cohesion.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the review process will be completed in Quarter 3 of 2017, to enable the Government to make final decisions in due course on how the remaining additional capital funding should be allocated.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-01a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017060100055#WRA02400"><p>Whilst the reform of public procurement has been a key element in the ongoing Government reform programme, care has been taken to ensure it is carried out in a manner that encourages SME participation. The EU Procurement Directives, transposed into Irish law in May 2016, contain provisions to make it easier for SMEs to tender for public procurement contracts.  These include the following:</p>  <p>  - financial capacity criterion is less demanding and generally limited to twice the contract value;</p>  <p>  - there is discretion to divide public contracts into lots;</p>  <p>  - there is a provision for "consortia bidding" to encourage SME involvement; and</p>  <p>  - there are reductions in the time limits for receipt of tenders;</p>  <p>  Moreover, Government Policy as set out in Circular 10/2014 updated and strengthened measures aimed at facilitating SME participation in Public Procurement.</p>  <p>  My colleague, Minister of State Eoghan Murphy TD, in accordance with the Programme for Government, chairs the SME Advisory Group which meets quarterly and seeks to enhance the measures already in place to support SME access.  This group comprises of SME industry representative bodies (IBEC, ISME, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF) as well as the Office of Government Procurement (OGP), the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Inter-Trade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  This positive initiative shows a willingness to engage with and learn from private sector counterparts.</p>  <p>  In terms of assessing involvement of SMEs, data from the Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis Report for 2014, published by the OGP indicates that 95% of the analysed expenditure is with Irish based firms and the majority of the spend analysed is with SMEs.  In addition, the OGP conducted an analysis of the 122 Framework Agreements it has in place which shows that 67% of Framework members are SMEs and 63% of the Frameworks had multiple lots, facilitating SME access.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Bill, you will be aware that it was not opposed by the Government in the D&aacute;il.  However, care must be taken not to disproportionately impact on SME's bidding for public contracts. If a blanket suite of social benefit clauses was attached to all public procurement opportunities, it is likely that this would be ineffective, disproportionately favour larger enterprises, reduce competition in supplying goods and services to the State and drive up the costs. SMEs representative bodies have raised similar concerns.  </p>  <p>  Social clauses impose additional costs on both the State and suppliers in meeting their requirements and demonstrating and verifying compliance.  In general, the inclusion of social clauses in a procurement process would appear to be most effective where the benefit could be considered a core requirement and can be directly linked to the contracting authority's policy or strategic plan.  The appropriateness of including social clauses in public procurement projects needs to be examined on contract by contract basis.   There needs to be sufficient flexibility to allow each individual contracting authority to decide what, how and when social clauses can be used taking account of, for example, the economic environment and labour supply in a specific sector. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, the reform of public procurement across the public service is on-going and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business.  The OGP will continue to work with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.</p></reply>

This will complement the Group&rsquo;s Work Programme and the specific measures that are identified for the areas at risk in the Draft Shannon Flood Risk Management Plan.  The Group has agreed to the delivery of targeted maintenance activities to be carried out in a range of locations this year in accordance with the permitted seasonal windows for such activities.  It has established a sub-committee that is currently considering all of the necessary legal, environmental, technical and other considerations that arise in bringing forward both short term and long term proposals. </p>  <p>  In addition to these targeted measures over the coming months, the Group has agreed to some environmental and habitat surveys as a first necessary step to inform a long-term plan of maintenance. </p>  <p>  The Group has also endorsed the commencement of a specific project to identify viable flood risk reduction measures in the Shannon Callows.  Building on initial assessments undertaken as part of the Shannon CFRAM study, the OPW is leading on the project, in conjunction with Waterways Ireland, Inland Fisheries Ireland and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.

It does so in a progressively structured way which has a proportionately greater effect on higher value pensions. </p>  <p>  A very significant part-unwinding of PSPR in three stages is taking place under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015, with PSPR-affected pensioners getting pension increases via substantial restoration of the PSPR cuts on 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018.</p>  <p>  This three-stage part-unwinding of PSPR is delivering significant pensions increases to PSPR-affected pensioners.  On 1 January 2016 all pensions of up to at least &euro;18,700 became exempt from PSPR; from 1 January 2017, all pensions of up to at least &euro;26,000 are now exempt from PSPR, and from 1 January 2018 all pensions of up to at least &euro;34,132 per year will be exempt from PSPR.  Those pensioners not fully removed from the reach of PSPR by dint of these changes will, in the majority of cases, benefit by &euro;1,680 per year from 2018. The cost of these changes is estimated at about &euro;90 million on a full-year basis from 2018.</p>  <p>  Under section 12 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, I as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform am required to review the necessity of the FEMPI legislation annually and cause a written report my findings to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.

The Public Spending Code sets out the value for money rules and guidance for spending in all public bodies at all stages in the expenditure life cycle &ndash; before, during and after spending.  The Public Spending Code applies to both capital and current expenditure.  The Code outlines what is required of public service managers at different points of the expenditure life cycle and offers advice on how to fulfil those requirements.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the financial reporting requirements, principles and procedures established in legislation and set out in Public Financial Procedures, new and updated requirements for the management of grant funding provided from public money issued in the form of a DPER Circular 13/2014 &ndash; Management and Accountability for Grants from Exchequer Funds.  This circular outlines the public financial management principles, procedures, and additional reporting requirements to be followed in the management of grant funding provided from public money.  The fundamental principle is that there should be transparency and accountability in the management of public money, in line with economy, efficiency and effectiveness.  The provisions of the circular apply to the movement of funds from a Vote to an outside body, and to any/all onward movements of that funding.  The objective is to ensure that all Exchequer funds, regardless of the method of distribution, are accounted for and properly managed.  </p>  <p>  The Accounting Officer has a key role in the system of accountability for public moneys.  The Role and Responsibilities of Accounting Officers are set out in the Memorandum for Accounting Officers issued by my Department.  The document outlines the system of accountability for public moneys and describes the key elements.  It sets out the duties and responsibilities of Accounting Officers in that system and describes the systems and functions that should be in place to support Accounting Officers in carrying out their duties.  This document is given to all Accounting Officers on their appointment along with other relevant guidance material such as the Public Financial Procedures.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that a detailed and comprehensive governance framework for public expenditure has been put in place by my Department to ensure that there is economical, efficient and effective use of public funds in line with the purpose to which they are allocated.  It is, of course, a matter for each Department and public body concerned to ensure that there are appropriate oversight arrangements and structures in place to ensure that this framework is fully implemented in all cases and where any misspending takes place, financial reporting, internal controls and audit systems to ensure as much as possible that these are detected and are addressed. </p></reply>

Clearly this is a very serious decision but an essential element of our child protection system. </p>  <p>  While the report found that individual Garda&iacute; go to great efforts to treat children with sensitivity and compassion, it identified serious shortcomings in our child protection system and made a number of recommendations.  These include:</p>  <p>  - A new Garda Protocol to set out the circumstances in which section 12 may be used,</p>  <p>  - A set of Risk Principles to act as guidance in operational decision making by Garda&iacute;,</p>  <p>  - Data Capture/Data sharing and review of data held on Pulse,</p>  <p>  - Specialised child protection units to be established in the Garda&iacute; &ndash; including having social workers assigned to these units,</p>  <p>  - Implementation of Children First Act to provide clear guidelines or co-operation between Garda&iacute; and other State Agencies,</p>  <p>  - Comprehensive training to be provided to Garda&iacute; reflecting law and international best practice, and</p>  <p>  - GRIDO (Garda Racial, Intercultural and Diversity Office) should be expanded and reviewed to ensure that positive work undertaken by the Office is relevant to all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. All members should be required to undergo diversity training.</p>  <p>  We now need to act with haste and ensure that we have a clear Roadmap on implementing these recommendations.  The Commissioner has commenced an examination of all the recommendations that relate to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is committed to engaging with Tusla and other relevant State agencies with a view to taking this work forward without delay.  For my part I will certainly give whatever support I can to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in addressing these recommendations and also to the Garda Authorities in their work in putting in place the very necessary reform, policies and procedures to ensure that we can have confidence in our child protection system.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy might be aware, this morning I met with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs Ms. Katherine Zappone, T.D., to discuss the matter.  The meeting was also attended by senior management in Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the relevant Departments.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Children and I have agreed that Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will work together using the Strategic Liaison Committee to oversee the timely implementation of the recommendations in Dr. Shannon&rsquo;s report.</p>  <p>  Reassurance was provided on the developments underway or already in place across both organisations to ensure a clear and consistent response to children at risk.  A range of measures have already been put in place since 2015, to enhance inter-agency cooperation, provide appropriate Garda training and the expansion of the Tusla out-of-hours service.  Both Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are in full agreement to build on this work and to develop further opportunities to enhance close working and communication such as increased linkage between Tusla and the Garda Youth Diversion Programme.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has requested the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy to review progress in three months including the findings of the report by Tusla of the 91 cases in Dr. Shannon&rsquo;s report.  </p></reply>

As the Deputy will also be aware, the Committee is examining the Garda Commissioner in relation to the Interim Audit Report and intends to resume that examination in the coming weeks, and will report subsequently.  The Garda Commissioner has been Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote since July 2006.  Very particular responsibilities lie with Accounting Officers under the law and you will appreciate that I must be careful not to interfere in any way with the work of that Committee. </p>  <p>  In relation to the period prior to the Commissioner assuming the role of Accounting Officer, my officials have provided available information to the Committee.  The Deputy will appreciate that the period prior to the appointment of the Garda Commissioner as Accounting Officer relates to over 10 years ago and that the establishment of the company to which he refers dates back to the early 1990s, with consequent difficulties in establishing precise facts in relation to detailed aspects of this matter, particularly in the absence of relevant records. </p>  <p>  In all events, I am advised that no records have been found in the Department which relate to the matters referred to by the Deputy in relation  to the establishment of the Company in question. As previously stated, the Department became aware of certain issues in relation to Templemore in September 2015 having received representations from local TDs in relation to the desire of people to continue to have access to Templemore Golf Club.  Subsequently, in September 2016 the Department received the interim Internal Audit report which highlighted the issues around the lack of proper financial controls in operation in Templemore which are now being examined by the Committee.</p>  <p>  In the circumstances, I believe that the best course at this stage is to allow the examination by the PAC continue unhindered and can assure the Deputy that I will pay very careful attention to the proceedings at the Committee and, in particular, any report that it may make.  If action is required on my part as a result, I will not hesitate to take it.</p>  <p>  While, of course, there has to be accountability in relation to what went on at the College, the immediate priority has to be ensuring the problems identified in the audit are resolved.  I have been assured that the Garda Authorities recognise the gravity of the issues raised and that they are taking comprehensive steps to progress the recommendations in the Report.  External governance expertise and auditors have been engaged.  A Steering Committee, chaired by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Chief Administrative Officer and including a representative from my Department, is overseeing the implementation of the recommendations. In addition, upon receipt of the report I referred it to the Policing Authority to oversee the implementation of the recommendations and to report back to me each quarter.  I expect the Authority to submit its first report to me in July.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I am advised that the Commissioner has requested an  Assistant Commissioner to examine the Report with a view to establishing if there are any matters of discipline or criminality that need to be addressed and, if so, how such matters should be progressed.</p></reply>

This offering will include an opportunity for retail investors to participate on the same terms as institutional investors.  The structure of the retail element is informed by previous privatisations and the changes in the regulatory environment for retail investors in recent years. As such, there will be no active marketing of the shares and the minimum required order size will be &euro;10,000.  Prospective retail investors will need to be a client of a participating intermediary broker.  Further details are available on the AIB website here: </p><p>I would strongly encourage any prospective retail investors to take appropriate independent financial advice before making any investment decision given the risks associated with investing in an equity instrument.</p><p>The criteria required of Participating Intermediaries include the requisite regulatory authority to (i) provide advice to retail customers; (ii) accept client funds; and (iii) accept client orders.  They are required to adhere to the terms of participation as set by the Department of Finance, AIB and the underwriting syndicate.  These terms include restrictions on commission charges, compliance with anti-money laundering regulations, limitations on marketing activities and other obligations to ensure the smooth operation of the IPO process.  The Participating Intermediaries are required to have a physical office in Ireland to facilitate those who wish to open a new account with whichever such intermediary they so choose. </p><p>Further details on the participating intermediaries can be found here:  </p></reply>

This exemption also applies to transfers of property made on foot of a foreign court order if the particular dissolution is recognised as valid in this State.  The relevant provisions are contained in section 97 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act (SDCA) 1999.  Section 97A of this Act provides for a stamp duty exemption in the case of a property transfer between cohabitants on foot of an order made under the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.</p>  <p>  These exemptions do not apply if any part of the property is being transferred other than on foot of a specified court order or is being transferred to a party other than one of the spouses, civil partners or cohabitants covered by the particular court order. </p>  <p>  Section 92B SDCA 1999 previously provided for a stamp duty exemption for first-time buyers that was ended with effect from 8 December 2010.  This exemption was available to former spouses in a legally-ended marriage.  A spouse who bought another house could avail of the first-time buyer exemption on that house provided that he/she had not retained an interest in the former marital home, which home continued to be occupied by the other spouse following the ending of the marriage.  A stamp duty exemption is not currently available to any first-time buyer, whatever his/her marital situation is.</p></reply>

Our priorities are clear: minimising the impact on trade and the economy, protecting the Northern Ireland Peace Process, maintaining the Common Travel Area and influencing the future of the European Union.</p>  <p>  The Government is clear and determined that all possible preparations will be made ahead of the UK leaving the EU.  The Government is focused on protecting and advancing Ireland's interests before, during and after these negotiations. </p>  <p>  A critical part of this work is to ensure that these priorities are heard and understood across Europe and, therefore, engagement with our EU partners and with the EU institutions is critical.  The EU negotiating guidelines, approved by the special European Council (at 27 level) on 29 April 2017, include very strong acknowledgement of our unique circumstances.  This is a positive outcome showing that the Government&rsquo;s extensive political, diplomatic and official campaign of recent months has been effective in ensuring understanding and recognition of our unique circumstances and specific issues. </p>  <p>  Our Brexit preparations include detailed engagement with the European Commission, where we have made them aware that Brexit is already having an impact on the Irish economy, and of the disproportionate consequences posed by Brexit to the Irish economy overall in comparison to other Member States.  In the context of Brexit, it is more important than ever that the EU continues to support economic growth and employment, and those Irish businesses most affected by Brexit.  </p>  <p>  The Government document sets out Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the EU-UK negotiations including the economic implications.  As stated therein, the Government will explore existing and possible future EU measures that could potentially assist in mitigating the effects of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal on specific Irish businesses and economic sectors while also, in the light of developments, making a strong case at EU level, that Brexit represents a serious disturbance to the Irish economy overall and that we will require support.  (The annex to the document details Government actions taken to date to support business and the economy).  The Deputy should also be aware that the issue of investment funding, in the context of the Brexit challenges facing the Irish economy, is the subject of ongoing discussions with the European Investment Bank (EIB). </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with EU partners to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s concerns and priorities continue to be reflected In the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position as it evolves. </p></reply>

Once the Liquidator has the claims ready for examination, the State Claims Agency will step in to commence the validation process. The State Claims Agency has assured the Department that it will act swiftly so that there will be no unnecessary delay caused by this validation process. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-01a.171.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017060100058#WRD03400"><p>The fiscal rules - formally known as the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) - have direct application through a number of EU regulations and domestically via the Fiscal Responsibility Act.  Changes to these regulations would have to follow the normal EU approach starting with a proposal from the Commission before consideration by Member States and the European Parliament.</p>  <p>  However, there are matters within the SGP subject to the discretion of the European Commission.  The Commission regularly issues updated guidance on how it will implement the SGP.  It is in this context that I sought and secured a major change from the Commission in achieving an annual update of the reference rate used in the expenditure benchmark.  The former practice had been to fix the reference rates for three years at a time.  This new approach significantly increases the permitted room for expenditure growth, which would not have been possible under the former practice.  In line with the principle of equal treatment for all Member States, the annual update of reference rates applied to all Member States.</p>  <p>  There are already in place specific provisions within the SGP designed to promote capital investment.  For instance, within the expenditure benchmark, capital formation increases are smoothed over four years with the result that only one quarter of the increase in public investment must be funded in the first year from within the fiscal space.  This provision, which means increases in capital spending for housing and other purposes can be front-loaded within the EU rules, has been utilised in Ireland's budgetary plans.  It should also be noted that the investment clause and the structural reform clause allow for temporary deviations from the required structural budgetary adjustment if spending on capital investment can be shown to qualify for either of these clauses, which are subject to strict conditions.</p>  <p>  My approach to promoting additional investment has mainly involved securing additional EIB investment (off-balance sheet) and in this context, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform met with the EIB President last week to discuss, among other issues, how this could be moved forward. </p>  <p>  The fiscal rules are designed to promote budgetary discipline and underpin sustainable economic growth.  While Ireland's economy is growing and debt is on a downward trajectory, the debt level is still comparably high and caution must be exercised due to the potential of rollover risk should interest rates increase.  We are a small and very open economy in a world that has more risks than usual. Compliance with the fiscal rules underpins the Government&rsquo;s objective of maintaining sound public finances.  The answer, therefore, is not simply about spending more; it is about getting more from each euro of taxpayers' money that is spent. </p></reply>

As long as the policy holder makes regular payments and the payments are sufficient to maintain the chosen benefits, this type of cover will pay a lump sum on the death of the policy holder.</p>  <p>  The regular payment into the plan covers the cost of providing the benefits chosen on the plan.  In the early years the payments are higher than the cost of the policy holder&rsquo;s benefits.  The extra money paid goes into the plan fund. Protection benefits get more expensive as policy holders get older; usually as the plan progresses the payments begin to equal the cost of the chosen benefits.  In the later years of reviewable protection plans, the cost of the benefits increases significantly.  In order to keep the level of benefits at the current level of payments, the difference is made up from the plan fund.</p>  <p>  The insurance company carries out regular reviews (the period in which these are completed can be 5 years, 6 years, 10 or 12 years depending on the product) to see if the consumers  regular payment plus any fund that has been built up is enough to cover their  chosen benefits for their reviewable protection plan.  During a policy review the insurance company may find that the consumer&rsquo;s current level of payments is enough to maintain the level of cover that the consumer wants.  The insurance company may also find that the current level of payments is not enough to maintain the level of cover desired by the consumer.</p>  <p>  Finally, I might conclude as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  </p>  <p>  Consequently there is no role for my Department or the Central Bank in any post-sale reviews on whole-of-life policies.  These are an individual matter for each insurance company and may differ from policy to policy.  </p></reply>

Credit Servicing Firms are required to obtain authorisation from the Central Bank in order to conduct credit servicing activities as defined in the 2015 Act.  A register of those firms which have notified the Central Bank that they wish to avail of the transitional provisions provided for in the legislation (whereby, by virtue of the 2015 Act, they are taken to be authorised to carry on the business of a credit servicing firm pending a decision on their application by the Central Bank) and those firms that have been authorised to carry on the business of a credit servicing firm is available on the Central Bank website.  </p><p>Credit servicing firms must act in accordance with the requirements of Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.  This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank.</p><p>Additionally, the SME Credit Demand Survey, conducted on behalf of the Department of Finance, monitors the credit requirements of SMEs.  The latest survey indicates that non-bank finance for SMEs is considerably lower than bank finance.

I am also aware that other State entities have submitted claims but these are a matter for those entities.</p><p>As per the most recent progress update report of 5 May 2017, the Special Liquidators have advised that it is their expectation, based on current information, that the eventual unsecured creditor dividend will be in the range of 75%-100% of all eligible claims.  This eventual dividend range is subject to change depending on future events which are outside the control of the Special Liquidators.  The ultimate level of dividend paid to each creditor, and timing of same, cannot be known until such time as all loan assets are sold, the total level of adjudicated creditors is finalised and other contingent creditor claims which may crystallise, including those from litigation, are known.</p><p>As a result of the  European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010), IBRC is classified in government.  Any payment from the Special Liquidators of IBRC to the State is considered an intra-government payment with no impact on the deficit.  Such payments do however improve the exchequer borrowing requirement as the cash received increases the cash balances in the Central Fund and thereby reduce the required level of borrowing.</p></reply>

However, it is not possible to say definitively at this stage what proportion of the claims this will amount to, but current indications are that this is unlikely to be sufficient to cover all of the 35% gap.</p>  <p>  In 2014, a preliminary assessment was carried out by Towers Watson who indicated that the Liquidator would not be in a position to meet more than 30% of claims out of the assets of the liquidation.  The Liquidator has informed the Department that as the Supreme Court has now made its judgement, it will be necessary for a new report to be commissioned to provide updated figures.  This is expected to commence shortly. </p>  <p>  The extent of the shortfall (i.e. the difference between the full amount due and the combined total of the ICF payment plus the Setanta distribution) is unlikely to become fully clear until the liquidator has determined the remaining monies in Setanta that he has to distribute to policyholders. </p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to the issue as to when payments can be expected to commence, it should be noted that Department of Finance officials have had discussions with the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice and the State Claims Agency and they have indicated that they have plans in place to deal with this issue.  Our understanding is that both agencies are working with the Liquidator to plan out the process of validation and presentation of claims.  Once the liquidator has the claims ready for examination, the State Claims Agency will step in to commence the validation process.  The State Claims Agency has assured the Department that it will act swiftly so that there will be no unnecessary delay caused by this validation process.  I hope to have greater clarity on the timescale shortly.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware the forthcoming legislation based on the recommendations of the Review of the Framework for Motor Insurance Compensation in Ireland will amend the relevant Insurance Acts to ensure 100% of third party motor claims will be covered in future by the ICF.</p></reply>

This information will be provided directly to the Deputy when it is available.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that current practice is that an End of Year Statement (P21) is issued only on foot of a request from a taxpayer or if a taxpayer completes a Form 12 tax return.  This approach, based on specific request or the filing of a Form 12, ensures that a taxpayer&rsquo;s record is fully up-to-date before the P21 issues and avoids the possibility of incorrect notification of an undercharge or an overcharge to the taxpayer where Revenue may not be in passion of the full facts relevant to the taxpayer.</p><p>I know that Revenue has taken a number of initiatives to assist PAYE taxpayers to comply with their obligations and claim their entitlements ensuring, insofar as possible, that they pay the right amount of tax at the right time.  These initiatives include:</p><p>- The automatic granting of certain tax credits each year based on the latest information available so that taxpayers who do not claim their entitlements still receive them.</p><p>- The receipt of ongoing and up-to-date information from the Department of Social Protection (DSP) ensuring that any tax due on DSP payments is collected through the PAYE system.</p><p>- The provision of modern, user-friendly online services through Revenue&rsquo;s myaccount facility to allow taxpayers manage their own tax affairs. These include:</p><p>- A facility since January 2017 to automatically divide tax credits and rate bands across different employments (in cases where the customer has more than one job or occupational pension or, in joint assessment cases, where both spouses/civil partners have a job or pension) based on information provided by the taxpayer. This ensures that a taxpayer gets the full benefit of tax credits and rate bands and reduces the possibility of an under or overpayment of tax.</p><p>- A simple online End of Year Statement (P21) request facility where there are no changes to be made to the taxpayer&rsquo;s record (in effect a confirmation by the taxpayer that Revenue&rsquo;s records are fully reflective of their personal circumstances, including income details.</p><p>- An online tax return (Form 12) that is pre-populated with information available to Revenue to enable taxpayers to get an end of year review.</p><p>- A RevApp launched in October 2016 which assists taxpayers to keep track of and store their receipts, such as health expenses, during the year.</p><p>- A short version of the paper Form 12 to assist customers unable to use online services to claim their entitlements and obtain a refund of tax, where appropriate.</p><p>- Various campaigns to raise awareness of entitlements including numerous radio interviews, advertising campaigns and outreach visits. Last October, Revenue wrote to 137,000 PAYE taxpayers who made no changes to their tax record in the previous four years to advise them to review their records to ensure they were claiming all their entitlements and to remind them of the four-year time limit for claiming a tax refund. Up to April 2017, almost 11,000 taxpayers have received refunds to a value of around &euro;23million on foot of these letters.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that Revenue is currently undertaking a PAYE Modernisation Project and is examining the option of conducting an automatic end of year review for all PAYE taxpayers based on the receipt of payroll data in realtime directly from the payroll systems of employers and pension providers.  In such a situation it would be possible for PAYE taxpayers to have an opportunity to update their record before the review is finalised by Revenue so as to ensure that the end of year review fully reflects the relevant personal circumstances of each taxpayer.  </p></reply>

Stage 1 is the Application Stage, wherein prospective applicants can query whether they qualify for the incentive.  They can also get clarity on the maximum amount of rebate they could potentially benefit from, based on their tax paid in a four-year period.  Stage 2 is the Claims Stage, wherein applicants that decide to proceed with purchasing or building a qualifying property must provide documentary evidence of the relevant property transaction or their mortgage draw down.</p><p>As of Thursday 25 May 2017 Revenue has received 6,607 applications to Stage 1 of the Help to Buy incentive, of which 4,095 have been approved.  However, it is possible that many of these applicants may never make a claim to Stage 2 for a variety of reasons.  These could include individuals who, do not go on to obtain mortgage approval, who may decide to purchase a second-hand property, or who are not able to source the new home that they desire.</p><p>To date, 1,917 Stage 2 claims have been made, of which 1,376 have been approved.  The total estimated cost of these claims to the Exchequer is &euro;20.3 million, of which &euro;10.1 million represents retrospective claims (in respect of the period 19 July to 31 December 2016).  Given that the estimated cost for claims approved under the incentive for the first 5 months of 2017 comes to &euro;10.2 million, my officials estimate that the cost of the incentive this year will largely be in line with the original estimate of &euro;50 million.</p><p>HTB incentive statistics are updated regularly by the Revenue Commissioners and can be accessed on their website at: .</p></reply>

A "credit intermediary" is defined as "a person...who in the course of his business arranges or offers to arrange for a consumer the provision of credit or the letting of goods in return for a commission, payment or consideration of any kind from the provider of the credit or the owner, as the case may be". </p>  <p>  The CCPC provides licenses to credit intermediaries and keeps an online list of credit intermediaries holding a valid authorisation which is available on the CCPC website www.ccpc.ie.

In this regard the CCPC has conducted research into the car market and car finance, and conducted numerous public awareness campaigns on the issue of car finance.

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers. </p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. </p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers.  The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.  </p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.  </p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;85 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  However there are other types of equality that we must also bear in mind, for example equality between public servants and people who work elsewhere or don&rsquo;t work at all.  It would also not be equal or fair for us to do unaffordable deals with particular groups of public servants that mean that we do not have the money left in the public purse to provide increases in social welfare payments for vulnerable groups, tax reductions for people at work, or investments in improvements in public services that people rely on.</p>  <p>  In education, there is a well-established increment system. Teachers are not paid equally. For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from &euro;32,009 to &euro;60,155 depending on the date that the individual began teaching. Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods. </p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector. A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay will be informed by the recently published analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission. The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve. However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of public service pay talks.  My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, invited the Public Services Committee of ICTU to discussions on public service pay and a continued approach to the unwinding of the FEMPI legislation and these discussions are now underway.</p></reply>

The ESRI has forecast in its Spring Quarterly Economic Commentary that housing completions will reach 18,500 during 2017.</p>  <p>  Looking ahead, I have recently published the latest Status Report on Social Housing Construction Projects, which is available at the following link:http://rebuildingireland.ie/news/social-housing-construction-projects-report-2017/.  The report provides details of over 600 social housing projects, involving the construction of over 10,000 new social homes across the 31 local authority areas.  The scale of the construction pipeline, as at end-Quarter 1 2017, represents a major escalation in the social housing build programme and more projects are being added on an ongoing basis, to ensure we deliver on the Rebuilding Ireland targets. </p>  <p>  Providing affordable, quality and accessible housing is a top priority for the Government.  Under the aegis of the Cabinet Committee on Housing, chaired by An Taoiseach, the Government and I will be keeping the implementation of Rebuilding Ireland under careful review.  The Third Quarterly Progress Report, for Quarter 1 2017, is being published today and is available at: www.rebuildingireland.ie.  </p></reply>

The 2015 Report on Student Accommodation: Demand &amp;amp; Supply by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) estimates an existing level of unmet demand of about 25,000 student bed spaces nationally.  </p><p>Measures to support greater provision of student accommodation come under Pillar 4 of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  Details of progress on actions  set out in Rebuilding Ireland can be found in the quarterly progress reports published on the Rebuilding Ireland website, the latest of which is available at the following link .</p><p>There has been a significant uptake in the provision of student accommodation during 2016/2017 by both Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) and private developments and projected developments to 2019 are currently capable of meeting the student accommodation targets identified under Rebuilding Ireland. </p><p>In terms of recent progress, figures compiled by the HEA for construction activity to end Q4 2016, confirmed that there had been 1,117 additional bed spaces of purpose-built student accommodation completed since the publishing of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan in July 2016.  Furthermore, an additional 8,670 student accommodation bed spaces are expected to be developed nationally by 2019, based on projects under construction and projects where planning permission has been applied for and/or already granted.  </p><p>The 2015 HEA Report identified the availability of affordable finance as a key requirement to enhance student housing provision.  The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 includes provisions enabling the Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) to access finance from the Housing Finance Agency specifically for student accommodation projects. </p><p>In addition, student accommodation complexes of 200 or more bedspaces will benefit from the new direct strategic housing development application process to An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016.  This will have major potential to cut processing time and enhance certainty in the provision of new accommodation projects. </p><p>New planning policy guidance was also issued to local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2016 on the use of student accommodation complexes outside of the academic year, as their use during these periods provides a potential additional income stream, thereby aiding the overall viability of these projects.  The guidance is available at the following link: </p><p>.</p><p>In order to maximise the potential for student accommodation provision on suitable sites as part of mixed developments, an inventory of publicly owned lands has been assembled by my Department.  The information, including the mapping of the sites identified, was published in April 2017 and is available via the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:</p><p>. </p><p>In fulfilment of Action 4.7 of Rebuilding Ireland, the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills is preparing a National Student Accommodation Strategy in consultation with my Department and other stakeholders in the sector.

The Board of CIB is committed to supporting the long term delivery of services at a local level and there may be opportunities to extend or improve existing service delivery over time.  However, in so doing CIB is obliged to ensure that it and its service delivery partners comply with standards as set out in the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies and ensure that Comptroller and Auditor General requirements are met.  This is the context in which the Board has made its decision to reorganise the governance arrangements of local CIS and MABS companies.  I accept the bona fides of the Board in its decision.  </p>  <p>  Before making its final decision, CIB had engaged in an extensive and comprehensive consultation process, involving service delivery companies and representative organisations and groups.  This process included representative groups having audiences with the CIB Board itself.  </p>  <p>In recent months, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection held hearings and received submissions from the various stakeholders.  Cognisant of the various concerns expressed to the Committee, CIB undertook a series of regional consultations with stakeholders throughout the month of May, to discuss and examine   key aspects of implementing the new sixteen board model.  These sessions were attended by 127 representatives of local company Boards and 223 representatives of management, staff and volunteers of local services.  Each session was chaired by an independent facilitator.  All who attended had an opportunity to raise any concerns they had about service delivery under the new model.  CIB reports that these engagements were well received and there was considerable support for the change.</p>  <p>  My Department understands that CIB intends to host further consultations over the summer period, on key areas such as the role of volunteers, the delivery of consistent high quality services countrywide and the preservation of the fundamentally valuable local community focus and support ethos within the new model.  CIB will consider these findings in the development of its Volunteer Strategy.</p>  <p>  CIB has established an Implementation Group, with   cross-sectoral representation, to assist with the governance reorganisation.  CIB has also committed to carry out a full Cost Benefit Analysis on the sixteen company model.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that CIB is making genuine efforts to allay the concerns of staff, boards and volunteers and is actively seeking to find ways to best embed the historically strong community ethos in the new governance structure for CIS and MABS services.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

In the 4 year period from 2013 to 2016 the number of applications has increased by 54%, from under 5,000 to almost 7,500 per annum.</p>  <p>  In addition to the increased volumes, there has recently also been a significant increase in the complexity and length of time required to process applications.  This has been impacted by a High Court ruling, following a legal challenge by an un-successful applicant, which places a greater onus on the deciding officer to provide the applicant with more detail of the reasoning used in coming to their decision.</p>  <p>  This requirement combined with increased application volumes, which show no sign of diminishing, has impacted negatively on processing times, which currently average 16 weeks. In April 2017, 53% of applications were processed within the 15 week target.</p>  <p>  Staffing levels in the scheme are kept under continuous review to ensure the best use of available resources. </p></reply>

The PSC is designed to replace other cards within the public sector including the free travel pass and to make it easy for providers of public services to verify the identity of customers.

The scheme allowed students to take up part-time work useful to their community and to receive payment for this work.  The scheme required considerable administrative effort to deliver.</p>  <p>  Take-up was initially high, but dropped significantly as unemployment fell in the late 1990s, leading to greater and wider availability of alternative summer employment.  In view of declining numbers and in order to focus available resources and administrative effort in the best possible way, it was decided to discontinue the students&rsquo; summer jobs scheme in 2003. </p>  <p>  It remains the case that there are higher priority uses for the financial and administrative resources of the Department of Social Protection than support for summer employment for students.  Schemes such as Community Employment and Tus, supporting employment in the community and voluntary sector, are concentrated on the registered unemployed, and particularly those who have been out of work for longer periods.  There are no plans to reintroduce a scheme of support for summer student jobs.</p></reply>

The CSSO is a constituent part of the Office of the Attorney General and comes under the remit of the Department of the Taoiseach.  The CSSO has its own Vote and is subject to the oversight of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG) in relation to its expenditure.  Disbursements arising as a result of a court award or settlement of proceedings (e.g. damages, costs) are funded by the relevant Department or Office of State and accounted for in its Appropriation Account.   </p>  <p>  The Chief State Solicitor is the Accounting Officer and, pursuant to section 3(5) of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act 1997, may be called to give evidence before the Public Accounts Committee in relation to the general administration of the office.</p>  <p>  The main legal expenditure within the Office is in regard to fees paid to Counsel and the Office has a rigorous process in place to ensure value for money. </p>  <p>  Oversight on legal spend by Central Government is a matter for the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The CSSO has no visibility of defence litigation expenditure where it is not the solicitor on record and the CSSO has no oversight role in this regard. </p>  <p>  The State Claims Agency provides legal defence in respect of personal injury matters for 145 public bodies.  It is mandated to contain the cost of claims to the lowest achievable level and, in relation to legal defence costs. The SCA does this in a number of ways, including through procurement of legal services on a competitive tendering basis via the Government&rsquo;s eTender website, extensive use of its own in-house solicitors for much of the litigation arising on its General Indemnity and Clinical Indemnity Schemes, and the establishment of a Legal Costs Unit in 2012 which is primarily involved in the negotiation of third party legal costs but also provides guidance and assistance to the SCA&rsquo;s claims&rsquo; teams in relation to defence legal costs.  Furthermore, all aspects of the Agency's work is the subject of both internal and external audit, including by the C&amp;AG and the NTMA&rsquo;s internal audit function.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Office of Government Procurement, which commenced operations in 2014, has taken responsibility for the procurement of Professional Services and has developed a sourcing strategy for legal services and more particularly those services which public bodies procure from solicitors.  Given the range of legal requirements that exist across all sectors within the public service, the OGP has already implemented six key Framework Agreements/contracting arrangements for Legal Services and is currently examining a further two. </p></reply>

These documents were published in 2015 and are available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  Officials at my Department are currently in the process of preparing a successor to the Public Service Reform Plan which is intended to cover the period up to 2020.  I expect that alternative models of service delivery, including the option to outsource services in appropriate circumstances, will feature as a mechanism that is available to public service managers to allow them to innovate and deliver the most cost-effective services to the citizen. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I wish to stress that decisions to outsource functions are reached on a case-by-case basis by the organisation that manages the service in question.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s role is to support public service bodies in exploring all service delivery options that are available to them and to ensure evidence-informed decisions are made when selecting a delivery model.  In order to meet that objective, my Department have undertaken a substantial programme of learning and development over a number of recent years to up-skill public service managers on best practice around outsourcing using evidence-based techniques.</p>  <p>  In line with existing expenditure policy, public bodies are generally required to look at a number of different factors when exploring the potential to outsource a function.  These factors include issues such as costs, quality, service effectiveness and the public interest.  This continues to be the case in respect of any new service that is being mooted for delivery by public bodies.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in concluding the Lansdowne Road Agreement in the summer of 2015, a limitation was placed on the ability of public bodies to outsource existing services.  In particular, a restriction was introduced which prevented direct comparisons being made between total labour costs for direct provision of a service against the total labour costs of a potential outsourced provider in the preparation of the business case. </p>  <p>  As I have stated, this restriction only applies in respect of existing services; that is services that are currently being provided directly by the State or its agents.  It does not apply in respect of newly conceived or planned services.</p>  <p>  In respect of the second aspect of the Deputy's question, these matters are currently under deliberation by the management and staff association parties in the context of the ongoing pay talks.  Accordingly, it would be inappropriate for me to comment any further on that issue at this point.</p></reply>

It is assumed that the Deputy's question is concerned with the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR).</p>  <p>  PSPR was introduced on 1 January 2011 under terms set out in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010.  It applies as a progressively structured decrease in the value of affected public service pensions.  PSPR has been formed an  important element of the pay and pension measures under the financial emergency legislation which have been critical to the stabilisation of the public finances.</p>  <p>  Following its introduction on 1 January 2011, PSPR originally applied only to those public service pensions with values above &euro;12,000 which were already in payment or which were afterwards awarded in respect of retirements up to end-February 2012.</p>  <p>  Later-awarded public service pensions, that is to say pensions awarded in respect of retirements after end-February 2012, only became liable to PRD from 1 July 2013, under terms set out in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013.</p>  <p>  The PSPR burden on pensioners is now being significantly alleviated as provided for under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act  2015.  This substantial part-reversal of PSPR, which is benefitting both pre- and post-2012 awarded pensions, is proceeding in three stages on 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018.  When complete in 2018, it will mean that most public service pensioners are not affected by PSPR.</p>  <p>  The cost of this very substantial PSPR amelioration under FEMPI 2015 is estimated at about &euro;90 million on a full-year basis from 2018. </p>  <p>  PSPR has at all times had a greater impact, in terms of applicable exemption thresholds and reduction rates, on pensions awarded in respect of retirements before end-February 2012, by comparison with later retirements.  This difference in PSPR treatment is accounted for by the fact  that the later-awarded, post-February 2012, pensions are based on salary rates which have been affected by the public service pay cuts of 1 January 2010; earlier-awarded pensions, by contrast, are effectively based on higher salary rates, being rates which do not take these 2010 pay cuts into account. </p>  <p>  Under section 12 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, I as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform am required to review the necessity of the FEMPI legislation annually and cause a written report my findings to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The next report is due by end June 2017 and in the context of that report, I shall review the scope of the existing financial emergency measures and the possible further scale-back of those measures, including the PSPR.  </p></reply>

A costing's exercise is currently being progressed and should be completed later this year.</p>  <p>  It does however continue to be the position that state organisations are not the employer of the particular employees concerned and that it is not possible for the State to provide funding for such a scheme.  The employees in question are, or were, employees of private companies notwithstanding the fact that the companies concerned are, or were, reliant on State funding.  In considering the matter, regard must be had to the costs and the precedent of such an arrangement were one to be created.  Further detailed scoping work is required in this regard over the coming months and I look forward to being briefed on the outcome of that work in due course.</p></reply>

Thankfully, we are at a point where we can consider and negotiate on modest improvements to current public service pay and conditions, while also recognising that Government must continue to act prudently regarding the management of the national finances.</p>  <p>  The initial Report of the Public Service Pay Commission was published on Tuesday, 9 May 2017.  For its initial report the Commission was asked to provide input on how the unwinding of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest legislation should proceed having regard to:</p>  <p>  - The evolution of pay trends in the public and private sectors, based on published data;</p>  <p>  - A comparison of pay rates for identifiable groups within the public service with prevailing non-public sector market rates;</p>  <p>  - International rates and comparisons where possible; and</p>  <p>  - The state of the national finances.</p>  <p>  The Commission was also asked to give consideration to other conditions of service of public servants, including tenure and pension, as well as recruitment and retention trends in the public service.</p>  <p>  The findings of the Commission are contributing to and informing considerations in relation to Public Service remuneration by Public Service employers and staff interests in negotiations on an extension to the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  These negotiations are currently underway and are being facilitated by the Workplace Relations Commission.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of these discussions is to seek agreement with staff interests on an extension to the Lansdowne Road Agreement (LRA).  The discussions will also seek to secure and to provide a fair, balanced and sustainable response to the expectations of public servants in the area of pay on the one hand and an economy which is subject to ongoing financial constraints and a number of emerging international risks and challenges, not least of which is Brexit.</p></reply>

This resulted in Ireland successfully leaving the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support in December 2013 and exiting the Excessive Deficit Procedure at the end of 2015.  Government Departments played a key role in ensuring that public services were delivered effectively during a period when significant fiscal consolidation was required to put the public finances on a sound footing.  </p>  <p>  2015 marked the turning point where expenditure reductions were no longer required to meet our fiscal targets.  An amount of &euro;58.1 billion has been allocated to gross voted expenditure in 2017 bringing the annual average growth rate in expenditure to c.3 per cent over the period 2015 to 2017.  The expenditure increases over this three year period have provided for additional spending on key public services and on social and economic infrastructure.</p>  <p>  As the Government looks to continue with its policy of providing for prudent and sustainable increases in expenditure, once account is taken of calls on expenditure relating to demographics, the Public Capital Plan and the Lansdowne Road Agreement, there are limited resources remaining to address a variety of competing demands.  In this context the Spending Review currently underway will support prudent fiscal management and assist with prioritising between policy initiatives to ensure resources are allocated to areas where they can have the greatest impact in terms of social and economic gain.</p>  <p>  Looking at pay in the public and private sector, data released by the CSO recently highlighted modest growth in private sector average weekly earnings in the year to 2017.  The Government Expenditure Ceiling for 2018 includes a provision of &euro;0.3 billion relating to pay commitments arising under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  As the Deputy will be aware, negotiations are currently taking place with the Public Service Unions on a successor to the Lansdowne Road Agreement. </p>  <p>  On an ongoing basis, managing the delivery of public services within Budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and their Department, and important measures are in place to help ensure that these budgetary targets continue to be met.  My Department is in regular communication with all Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters.  The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against the published expenditure profiles.  There is regular reporting to Government on these matters, and information is published monthly, as part of the Exchequer Statement. Gross voted expenditure of &euro;17,849 million to end-April was &euro;282 million (1.6%) below profile, with gross voted current expenditure &euro;247 million (1.4%) below profile and gross voted capital expenditure &euro;35 million (3.6%) below profile. </p>  <p>  A new phase of public service reform, to cover the period 2017-2020, is currently being developed and last September I invited the members of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach to input to this process.  This new phase will place the customer's needs at the core of every decision from policy formulation to service design through to the service delivery.  It will set out a series of actions to be delivered out to 2020 which will both build on the achievements of the last six years and respond to new challenges. </p></reply>

This plan is now being reviewed to ensure that capital spending remains strictly aligned with national economic and social priorities, consistent with Programme for Partnership Government objectives.  This includes examining how available capital funds can continue to best be allocated to underpin sustainable medium-term economic growth and future growth potential, in light of recent developments since the Plan was published, including Brexit.  </p>  <p>  As signalled with the recent publications of its position paper on Brexit, the Government is intensifying its focus on the economic implications of Brexit and will produce a further paper on the economic implications of the Brexit challenge.</p></reply>

This Study enables Local Authorities to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties, including the identification, prioritisation and, subject to the availability of resources, the implementation of coastal protection works both of a structural and non-structural nature.</p><p>The Local Authorities may carry out coastal protection works using their own resources. If necessary, they may also put forward proposals to the relevant central Government Departments for funding of appropriate measures depending on the infrastructure or assets under threat.</p><p>Because intervention within a coastal area may cause problems further along the coast, any proposed intervention measures are best developed in conjunction with a formal coastal erosion risk management study that has carefully investigated the problem and explored the full range of management options. </p><p>The OPW operates the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, under which applications for funding from local authorities are considered for measures costing up to &euro;500,000 in each instance.  Funding for coastal erosion risk management studies may also be applied for under this scheme.  Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for projects which meet the eligibility criteria including a requirement that the proposed measures are cost beneficial.  The OPW has published guidelines for coastal erosion risk management measures and funding applications under the Minor Works Scheme, available on the OPW website.  Any applications received will be considered in accordance with the overall availability of resources for flood risk management and the scheme's eligibility criteria available on the OPW website. </p><p>It is not possible to say how much funding will be made available in 2017 under the Scheme for coastal protection studies or how many studies will be funded.

This approach is set out in the Public Financial Procedures at C8 Section 11 whereby the general rule is that no insurance should be effected against the risk of any loss which, if it arose would fall wholly and directly on public funds.  This is based on the understanding that the risks for which the Government is liable are innumerable and widely distributed and that losses maturing in any one year are never so large as to materially disturb the financial position of the year, so that it is cheaper in the long term for the Exchequer to &ldquo;carry its own insurance&rdquo;.</p><p>The National Treasury Management Agency is designated as the State Claims Agency (SCA) when performing the claims and risk management functions delegated to it under the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000.  Since the establishment of the SCA, the management of claims functions has been delegated to the Agency.  </p><p>The table below provides a summary of insurance costs incurred during the period in question by bodies under the aegis of my Department.</p><p><b>Annual Insurance Costs 2012-2017 </b><table><tr><th>Body</th><th>2012<br /><br />&euro;</th><th>2013<br /><br />&euro;</th><th>2014<br /><br />&euro;</th><th>2015<br /><br />&euro;</th><th>2016<br /><br />&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga </td><td>1,250</td><td>1,250</td><td>912</td><td>1,234</td><td>1,357</td></tr><tr><td>National Gallery of Ireland</td><td>45,855</td><td>39,027</td><td>41,814</td><td>38,731</td><td>23,168</td></tr><tr><td>National Library of Ireland </td><td>23,456</td><td>41,227</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>National Museum of Ireland</td><td>10,231</td><td>9,946</td><td>9,750</td><td>9,658</td><td>9,750</td></tr><tr><td>Waterways Ireland</td><td>94,998</td><td>78,750</td><td>23,800</td><td>184</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Arts Council</td><td>15,564</td><td>16,685</td><td>12,907</td><td>12,448</td><td>13,695</td></tr><tr><td>Chester Beatty Library</td><td>31,469</td><td>28,926</td><td>30,709</td><td>34,192</td><td>30,311</td></tr><tr><td>Crawford Art Gallery</td><td>46,525</td><td>42,186</td><td>45,067</td><td>42,118</td><td>42,279</td></tr><tr><td>Heritage Council</td><td>34,481</td><td>30,919</td><td>29,345</td><td>15,604</td><td>17,260</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Film Board</td><td>6,749</td><td>9,560</td><td>8,702</td><td>9,585</td><td>10,761</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Museum of Modern Art</td><td>9,520</td><td>9,385</td><td>9,574</td><td>9,688</td><td>11,097</td></tr><tr><td>National Concert Hall</td><td>44,639</td><td>56,364</td><td>56,613</td><td>53,950</td><td>51,123</td></tr><tr><td>&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta</td><td>266,987</td><td>260,583</td><td>273,532</td><td>305,200</td><td>334,164</td></tr><tr><td>Western Development Commission</td><td>6,805</td><td>6,855</td><td>6,639</td><td>6,572</td><td>6,633</td></tr><tr><td>Foras na Gaeilge</td><td>36,751</td><td>33,167</td><td>13,491</td><td>26,390</td><td>44,475</td></tr><tr><td>The Ulster Scots Agency</td><td>6,552</td><td>4,243</td><td>5,184</td><td>5,477</td><td>8,799</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>681,832</td><td>669,072</td><td>568,039</td><td>571,030</td><td>604,873</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This approach is set out in the Public Financial Procedures at C8 Section 11 whereby the general rule is that no insurance should be effected against the risk of any loss which, if it arose would fall wholly and directly on public funds.  This is based on the understanding that the risks for which the Government is liable are innumerable and widely distributed and that losses maturing in any one year are never so large as to materially disturb the financial position of the year, so that it is cheaper in the long term for the Exchequer to "carry its own insurance".</p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency is designated as the State Claims Agency (SCA) when performing the claims and risk management functions delegated to it under the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000.  Since the establishment of the SCA, the management of claims functions has been delegated to the Agency. It currently manages claims and risks on behalf of 139 delegated State Authorities.</p>  <p>  I have also forwarded your question to the HSE for direct reply. Details for other bodies under the aegis of the Department are operational matters for the bodies concerned and the Deputy should contact the relevant Director/CEO/Registrar directly.</p></reply>

For that reason, the Department of Health is currently engaged in a detailed process to design a new system of regulation for these important services.  This process will also determine the new standalone funding scheme that will apply to home care. </p>  <p>  As an initial step, the Department commissioned the Health Research Board to undertake an evidence review of the home care systems that are in place in four other European countries.  This review was published on 11 April.  The Review will help us to learn from the experiences of other jurisdictions and will inform the debate and future consideration of approaches to formal home care financing and regulation here in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Another important step in this process is a public consultation process which I will be launching shortly.

The primary screening method currently used by CervicalCheck is liquid based cytology, with HPV testing as a secondary screening method.  HIQA have now completed this HTA and the final report was published on Monday 29 May.</p>  <p>  The report states that a change to primary HPV screening at five yearly intervals for all eligible women would improve the efficiency of the CervicalCheck programme.

The hospital will be a world class facility to care for children and young people from all over Ireland who are in need of specialist and complex care and, with two outpatient and urgent care centres, will also be the local children's hospital for children and young people in the Greater Dublin area.  These two outpatient and urgent care centres, being developed on the campuses of Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals, are an integral part of the children's hospital, and will be supported by the hospital in providing urgent care and outpatient services, including general paediatric rapid access outpatient clinics, orthopaedic outpatient fracture clinics and other chronic disease clinics.  The centres will improve geographic access to urgent care for children in the Greater Dublin Area as well as further afield.  </p>  <p>  In relation to access to the children's hospital at the St James's campus, while noting that the campus is better served by public transport than any other hospital in the country, the plans and design for the hospital recognise the need of most families to access the hospital by car.  A traffic management and traffic mobility plan for the hospital, endorsed by the National Transport Authority and Dublin City Council, formed part of the planning application.  A 10-day oral hearing took place in December 2015 in which traffic evidence was presented in detail and allowed for cross questioning by those who had concerns.  Planning approval for the hospital was granted without change to the proposed traffic and mobility plan.  The plans for the hospital provide for 1,000 car parking spaces, of which 675 will be dedicated for use by families, three times the number of spaces currently available at the three Dublin children's hospitals combined.  Parents will be able to reserve their space ahead of arriving at the hospital, and emergency drop-off spaces are also being provided. </p>  <p>  Incorporating leading practice in children's hospital design, children and young people who need to stay in hospital will have their own single room.  Every room, with the exception of critical care rooms, will have an en-suite bathroom and facilities for a parent to comfortably stay overnight.  The development of a new 53-bed family accommodation, to be built adjacent to the new children&rsquo;s hospital, was also included in the new children&rsquo;s hospital planning permission.</p>  <p>  A national model of care for paediatric healthcare services in Ireland has been developed by the HSE.  The model aims to ensure that all children should be able to access high quality services in an appropriate location, within an appropriate timeframe, irrespective of their geographical location or social background.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital will engage in shared care arrangements and outreach to support regional paediatric units in Cork, Limerick and Galway, and in turn local hospitals, thereby providing clinically appropriate healthcare for children as close to home as possible.  With the new children&rsquo;s hospital as the future hub, the initial focus in the implementation of the model of care will be on developing the regional units to provide an appropriate range of regional services to minimise the need for children and families to travel to Dublin for services. </p></reply>

The value of land is of course governed by the laws of supply and demand and for those selling land this is, of course, a positive development.  There are many reasons why lands are put up for sale which can include lands which are viewed as marginal for agriculture or indeed the restructuring of farm holdings following retirement, death or inheritance.  There are also regional variations in terms of demand, supply and quality which influences the final price paid for land. Forestry may be one of many factors which can influence movements in land prices.</p>  <p>  The market for farmland in Ireland is characterised by a low volume of land sales with relatively high prices and this is attributable to a number of factors, both social and economic.  CSO data shows prices vary across regions and by land type.  The recent Agri-taxation Review acknowledged that access to land is an issue and identified as a key policy objective to increase the mobility and the productive use of land.  A number of measures to rebalance the rental sector in favour of long-term leasing have been introduced in recent years and are having a significant impact, especially among younger farmers and those seeking to expand. </p>  <p>  The perceived link between afforestation grants, premium rates and movement in land prices overlooks the complexity that exists within the land market.  The investor portion of new planting is not significant although it is increasing.  For farmers, forestry offers a viable alternative enterprise which allows them to diversify their income stream away from volatile agricultural markets and towards the more stable timber market and for this reason the supports offered by the State are very much welcomed.</p>  <p>  Access to finance is a priority issue and earlier this year I introduced the &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo;.  Following the success of the Scheme, I met with the Chief Executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other issues relating to the agrifood sector, including access to finance for farmers. </p></reply>

Addressing the most recent Forum, I took the opportunity to highlight that one of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some sectors, which have caused cash flow difficulties for farmers. </p><p>Therefore I was pleased to facilitate the &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo;, which was developed by my Department in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and makes &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at interest rates of 2.95%.  Distributed through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, it provides tillage farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.  The loans are for amounts up to &euro;150,000 for up to six years and are flexible with interest only facilities of up to three years.  Although no official returns have been made to my Department as yet, preliminary information from the SBCI shows that some 8% of the loans to date have been drawn down by the tillage sector.  The banks have confirmed that they have applications up to the amounts available under the Scheme. </p><p>There may be some residual availability but this will only emerge as applications are processed and loans drawn down.  I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance. </p><p>I have met with the Chief Executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other issues relating to access to finance in the agri-food sector.  I have asked the banks to respond positively to this demand by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future. Implementation of this Scheme is subject to the provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1408/2013 (de minimis aid in the agricultural production sector).  Support provided under the de minimis regulation complies with State Aid rules in the agriculture sector and does not require prior approval by the EU Commission.</p><p>Specifically in referring to Council Regulation No. 1305/2013 relating to the funding of EU rural development programming 2014 &ndash; 2020, support under this regulation refers to damage caused by adverse climatic events and is directed towards restoration of the production potential of lands affected, rather than support for specific losses.</p><p>However, under this regulation, I introduced the Tillage Investment Scheme under TAMS II which opened for online applications on the 8 March 2017.  The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers.  This Tillage Scheme is the latest of the Targeted Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II) to be launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  The Scheme is co-funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). All applications must be made on-line, either by the farmer or by an adviser authorised to act on his or her behalf.  The closing date for applications under the first tranche of the new scheme will be Friday 30 June 2017.  </p><p>As an additional support to cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, up to &euro;1.186 billion has been paid out under the Basic Payment Scheme to 124,112 farmers with payments ongoing. Payments of &euro;202.16 million<b></b>have also been made to 94,456 applicants under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme.  </p><p>I can also confirm that a wide ranging discussion took place among all the stakeholders who attended the recent session of the Tillage Forum, including on the issue of crop losses as a result of the poor harvest conditions of last autumn.  My officials have since then had some additional meetings with stakeholders and I will consider further the outcome of those deliberations.  </p></reply>

This extension followed a review by EFSA which was extended to allow for detailed consideration of the report produced by IARC and concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans and can be used safely without putting consumers or users at risk.</p>  <p>  The RAC delivered its opinion in mid-March and concluded that glyphosate does not warrant classification as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction.  This will mean that legally glyphosate does not meet any of the substance non-approval criteria specified in the Plant Protection Products Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009).  The RAC agreed to maintain the existing harmonised classification of glyphosate as a substance causing serious eye damage and being toxic to aquatic life with long-lasting effects.  The implication of this classification is that appropriate precautionary measures should be put in place for use of glyphosate.  The RAC opinion was adopted by consensus with the full support of all members.</p>  <p>  Once the draft RAC Opinion goes through an editorial check, ECHA will formally submit the dossier to the Commission (expected to be in June), which takes the final decision on the glyphosate classification.  The adopted RAC Opinion will provide the Commission with a scientific basis to make a final proposal about the renewal of glyphosate under Regulation 1107/2009.  Any such proposal must be put before a technical experts standing committee meeting. </p></reply>

Such statistics are accessible through the Local Government Management Agency&rsquo;s series of service indicators annual reports available from the publications section of the LGMA&rsquo;s website <i></i>and the enforcement section of the EPA&rsquo;s website <i><font color="#2F2F2F">www.epa.ie/enforcement/prosecute</font></i>.</p><p>Section 34 of the Waste Management Act 1996 requires all bodies involved in the commercial collection of waste to have this activity authorised by a waste collection permit.  Penalties available under the Waste Management Acts are substantial.  Persons who are found to be responsible for, or involved in, the unauthorised disposal or collection of waste are liable to a Class A fine on summary conviction and/or imprisonment for up to 12 months, and to a maximum fine of &euro;15 million on conviction on indictment and/or imprisonment for up to 10 years. </p><p>Waste enforcement is supported by state funding for waste enforcement officers.  I have made &euro;9 million available from the Environment Fund this year to support the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs) and the recruitment and continued employment of a network of local authority waste enforcement officers.  This investment is critical in tackling issues such as illegal dumping in local communities and in providing an enhanced response on the ground to other infractions of the waste code.</p><p>My Department has also developed an anti-dumping initiative to work in partnership with local authorities and community organisations in identifying high risk or problem areas, developing appropriate enforcement responses and carrying out clean-up operations.  In response to the hugely positive reaction from local authorities and communities since I launched this measure, I have made further funds available to support it.  The initial allocation of &euro;650,000 has been doubled with total funding of &euro;1.3 million now being made available to support the clean-up of dumping black-spots and to target those who engage in this illegal practice.</p><p>Successful applications from the initial phase included projects that will equip authorities with the latest enforcement technologies including overt and covert surveillance equipment and drone technology to target dumpers.  A range of clean-up and restorative projects led by community, environmental and sporting groups have also been approved.  The extra funds will support strategic, community led anti-dumping projects that remediate specific site(s) and develop effective deterrents.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government sets out that Ireland&rsquo;s long-term interests are best supported by further decreasing our dependence on fossil fuels through the continued development of renewable electricity generation.  This is underpinned by the Energy White Paper which sets out a framework that will guide policy in the energy sector from now up to 2030. It sets a vision of reducing emissions from the energy system by 80-95% by 2050.  This will require the share of fossil fuels to be of the order of 26-51% of total primary energy requirement.  Government will not determine what the exact energy mix used for electricity generation will be out to 2030 and 2050, however policy clearly shows that there will be a much greater influence from renewable sources and increasingly less impact from high carbon, non-renewable sources.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing a proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which will be designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions out to 2030.  The new scheme design requires detailed economic analysis on the viability and cost effectiveness of supporting several renewable technologies at various scales.  Once the analysis is complete, my Department will publish a final public consultation on the design of the new support scheme.  There will be several decisions to be made with regard to scale, technologies and, in particular, how communities will have a greater involvement than in previous schemes. </p>  <p>  Subject to securing the necessary approvals, it is expected that the new scheme will become operational in the first half of 2018</p>  <p>  Looking to the European Union's emerging climate and energy targets for 2030, it is likely that all Member States will be required to expand their renewable electricity generation portfolios beyond their 2020 capacities.</p>  <p>  As acknowledged in the Energy White Paper, oil and natural gas will remain significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply in the course of the transition.  The 2014 National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, which is underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, provides the high-level policy direction for the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050.  I will be publishing the first National Mitigation Plan required under the Act in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

The Advocate General issued his Opinion in the case on the 11 May last.  He concluded that the service offered by the Uber platform must be classified as a 'service in the field of transport' which is regulated by the law of Member States, and it follows from that interpretation that Uber's activity is not governed by the principle of the freedom to provide services in the context of 'information society services'.</p>  <p>  The Opinion of the Advocate General is in line with Ireland's position as presented at the Oral Hearing in this case.  Ireland's position is that Uber services are services in the field of transport and the ability of Member States to regulate such services must be maintained with a view to ensuring public safety and consumer protection.  Uber and other taxi app companies providing such services in Ireland are licensed as Dispatch Operators by the National Transport Authority.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Opinion of the Advocate General is not binding on the Court.

The Directive however permits Member States to test cars more frequently, and so with effect from 1 June 2011, Ireland introduced annual testing for cars ten years old and above.</p>  <p>  The NCT is a periodic test which checks, at a point in time, whether or not the components which are required to be tested meet a basic standard.  I am advised that the NCT certificate issued at the time of the test does not confirm the condition of the vehicle for the duration of the certificate.  It merely states that a NCT was passed on that date and when the next test is due.</p>  <p>  Road Traffic law places the onus on users of vehicles on public roads to ensure that their vehicles comply with the law, and are maintained in a roadworthy condition at all times.  It also requires motorists to ensure that their vehicles are in compliance with Construction, Equipment and Use Regulations in respect of their lights, tyres, brakes, windscreens etc.</p></reply>

A JLC is comprised of equal numbers of representatives of employers and workers in a sector.  JLCs meet regularly, under an independent Chairperson to discuss proposals for terms and conditions to apply to specified grades or categories of workers in the sector.  If agreement is reached the JLC publishes details and invites submissions from interested parties.  </p>  <p>  If, after consideration of any submissions received, the Committee adopts the proposals it will submit them to the Labour Court for consideration.  The Labour Court will then make a decision on the adoption of the proposals.  If the Court decides to adopt the proposals, a copy is presented to me and if I consider it appropriate to do so I will make an Order giving effect to the proposals. Such Orders are known as Employment Regulation Orders. </p>  <p>  The Joint Labour Committee for the Security Industry was established in accordance with Statutory Instrument No. 377 of 1998 (as amended by Statutory Instrument No. 30 of 2014).  The Deputy may be aware that the JLC structure has in recent years undergone an extensive overhaul as the result of a successful Constitutional challenge in 2011 and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 addresses the shortcomings identified in the ruling on that challenge.</p>  <p>  In relation to the membership of the JLC I am informed that, in accordance with the Statute, the Labour Court consulted with ICTU, Ibec and the two employer organisations most closely connected with the Security Industry, the National Union of Security Employers (merged with the Security Institute of Ireland in 2011) and the Irish Security Industry Association.  Following consultation, these bodies nominated representatives of both employers and employees for membership of the Committee.  The current members were appointed on 12 May 2014.</p>  <p>  The Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson are Industrial Relations Officers from the Workplace Relations Commission and are appointed by me. </p>  <p>  The constitution and proceedings of JLCs is set out in the Fifth Schedule to the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.  The discussions within the Joint Labour Committees are not open to me nor to my Department. </p>  <p>  The draft proposals for an employment regulation order to replace the one that currently exists for the Security Industry and that you refer to were advertised as part of the public consultation process.  The closing date for submissions on those proposals was 7 February last.  The proposals were subsequently adopted by the Labour Court and forwarded to me.  Having considered them in the context of the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 as amended, I am satisfied that the legislation was complied with during the formulation of the proposals by the JLC and their adoption by the Labour Court and I signed an Order on 30 May to give effect to the proposals from 1 June 2017.  (S.I. No. 231 of 2017 - Employment Regulation Order (Security Industry Joint Labour Committee) 2017).</p></reply>

The strategy was developed in the context of Brexit and focuses on supporting clients to both Build Scale and Expand Reach.  In addition, in May 2017 Enterprise Ireland launched a new Eurozone Strategy to assist Irish exporters increase exports in Eurozone countries by 50% by 2020.  This strategy will be accompanied by a new &lsquo;Irish Advantage&rsquo; campaign which will target Eurozone buyers to promote Irish innovation in key Brexit impacted sectors.</p>  <p>  Eurozone markets can provide currency stability, proximity and potential for growth and opportunities for Irish companies.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Eurozone Strategy will see the agency partnering with some 600 client companies, approximately half of which are &lsquo;Eurozone Start&rsquo; (relatively new to the market and who are heavily reliant on the UK) while the remainder are &lsquo;Eurozone Scale&rsquo; (already exporting to the Eurozone).</p>  <p>  In addition to the market diversification drive characterised by the new Eurozone Strategy, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus continues to be on supporting companies on a one to one and on a sector by sector basis to enhance their competitiveness and capability and build on their success in existing and new markets.  To this end, on 31 March Enterprise Ireland launched its &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo;, a new interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars - Business Strategy, Operations, Innovation, Sales and Marketing, Finance and People Management.  Based on answers supplied by the user, the Scorecard generates an immediate report which contains suggested actions and resources, and information on events for companies to attend, to prepare for Brexit.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has also launched a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; that supports the costs of SME clients in preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities arising from Brexit.  It can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and out of pocket expenses associated with researching the direction of their Brexit action plan.</p>  <p>  To communicate Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Eurozone Strategy and the supports available as part of the implementation of the agency&rsquo;s strategy, a &ldquo;Prepare for Brexit&rdquo; Breakfast Roadshow is being rolled out nationally to engage with companies.  A number of invited Food speakers, panellists and clients have already participated in these roadshow events.</p>  <p>  Bord Bia is the state agency under the Department of Agriculture and Food responsible for the marketing and promotion of agrifood and drink.  I am advised that Bord Bia's programmes and activities in this area are all directly relevant to expanding market penetration and diversifying outlets for Irish food and drink against the background of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union.</p>  <p>  On 22 March, Bord Bia launched a Brexit Barometer to assist food, drink and horticulture companies to identify the levels of risk across six topics - route to market, trade, customs, currency, supply chain and people.  In all, 135 companies completed a Brexit Barometer assessment.  Each participating company received an assessment that identified levels of risk across the six topics and a supporting document with actions for mitigating some of these risks.  The data collected is being analysed and the high level findings will be presented at a Bord Bia Brexit event on 29 June 2017.</p></reply>

In addition, some of the advertising initiatives would cross years, so the yearly figure is an estimate of the expenditure relevant to that year</p><p>** Note- the expenditure figure for farm safety initiatives in 2010 is recorded on a now disused database system and the retrieval will take some time.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will revert to the Deputy when this figure is available.</p><p>Below is a table showing the breakdown of the annual farm inspection numbers carried out by the HSA from 2010 to date in 2017.</p><p><b>Farm inspections and investigations 2011 &ndash; 2016</b><table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Number of farm   Inspections and Investigations</th></tr><tr><td>2010 </td><td>1,646 </td></tr><tr><td>2011 </td><td>3,058 </td></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>3,136 </td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>2,784 </td></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td>2,644 </td></tr><tr><td>2015 </td><td>3,056 </td></tr><tr><td>2016 </td><td>2,008 </td></tr><tr><td>2017 (to date)</td><td>966 </td></tr></table></p><p>The Health and Safety Authority allocated a budget of &euro;384,000 for farm safety initiatives in 2016.  These initiatives  included the organisation of, participation in, or support for a number of agriculture related events such as the FTMTA Grass and Much Event, Farmer of the Year Awards, Farm Safety Fortnight, Teagasc Beef 2016, the Tullamore Show, the National Ploughing Championships and some other minor events some with supporting media campaigns. </p><p>In 2017 the Health and Safety Authority has allocated a budget of &euro;287,000 for farm safety initiatives.  These initiatives will again involve the organisation of, participation in, or support of a wide range of agriculture related events such as the FTMTAMachinery Show, Assisting in KTGFacilitator Training, Farmer of the Year Awards, Farm Safety Months, (March/Livestock, May/Tractors&amp;amp; Machinery, November/Falls from Height &amp;amp; Falling Objects) , Teagasc Dairy Event, the Tullamore Show, the National Ploughing Championships and again some other minor events all with media coverage or campaigns. </p><p>The funding allocations that the HSA makes for particular aspects of its annual programme of work, including farm safety initiatives, can fluctuate from year to year as the HSA decides how to prioritise its non-pay funding in order to implement its overall programme of work. </p><p>The totality of the work of the HSA in relation to farm safety is not confined to specific farm safety initiatives or formal inspections.  In addition to such initiatives visits to farms by inspectors include routine unannounced inspections to monitor compliance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 and with other health and safety regulations and to investigate fatal and serious farm accidents.  Typically in any one year there can be between 60 &ndash; 90 investigations on farms with the rest being unannounced inspections. In 2017 the HSA is carrying out three focused farm campaigns each of one month duration.  The first focused on &ldquo;animal handling&rdquo;, the second on working with &ldquo;machinery&rdquo; and the third on &ldquo;working from heights&rdquo;. </p><p>Since 2014 the HSA has redirected some of its inspection resources to engaging directly with farmers on other accident prevention initiatives.  This approach continues in 2017 particularly through the Knowledge Transfer Groups of which 42 have been attended so far this year and all facilitators of knowledge transfer groups have now been trained in occupational health and safety by Teagasc and the HSA. </p><p>The priority tasks for the HSA in relation to engagement with the farming sector for 2017 include:</p><p>- ongoing delivery of the Farm Safety Partnership Action Plan, 2016 to 2018;</p><p>- continuing awareness campaigns through the media, events and advertising targeted at agricultural sector;</p><p>- promotion of good health for farmers;</p><p>- publication of information sheets;</p><p>- roll out of the revised Code of Practice on farm safety;</p><p>- finalising an e-learning tool on tractor and machinery safety,</p><p>- focusing on child safety on farms through programmes at primary and post-primary school level, letters have already issued to over 3,000 such schools;</p><p>- increasing awareness of farm safety throughout the sector.</p><p>I, of course, remain very concerned at the ongoing high level of farm fatalities. Since the start of this year there have been 12 people killed on farms, with 8 deaths of farmers over 70 years of age.  Indeed myself and my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Michael Creed TD, invited leading stakeholders involved in the agriculture sector, including representatives from four (4) major farming organisations (IFA, ICMSA,  Macra na Feirme and ICSA) to a round table meeting on farm safety.  The meeting facilitated a full and frank discussion on practical targeted actions that could be taken at a number of levels.  I have asked all participants to formally submit their suggestions and proposals on actions that can be taken at Government and sectoral level and all will be given detailed consideration.</p><p>Farm Tractor &amp;amp; Machinery Trade Association</p><p>Knowledge Transfer Group</p></reply>

Over 66,000 jobs were created during 2016. Employment growth is spread across all regions and all sectors of the economy.</p>  <p>  In February, we published the Action Plan for Jobs 2017 which sets out the whole of Government response to secure employment and retain jobs in the face of global uncertainty by strengthening the resilience and agility of our enterprise base.</p>  <p>  In developing the 2017 Plan, I met a wide range of stakeholders including a broad selection of Enterprise Ireland and IDA client companies and the employer representative bodies.  I have expanded the Industry Partners Forum to include a wider sectoral and regional representation.  These meetings with enterprise informed the priorities that I and my Ministerial colleagues are progressing under the 2017 Plan to support further job creation and deliver sustainable enterprise growth in the short to medium term.</p>  <p>  Accelerating the pace of progress in each region to maximise their job potential has been a top priority for the Action Plan for Jobs.  In 2015, we launched the Regional Action Plans for Jobs initiative to help each region achieve its economic potential and increase employment.  Each Regional Action Plan has an Implementation Committee that brings together enterprise, third level and other stakeholders from within each region and senior officials from my Department and I have met with the Committees at various stages over the last year.  I am also engaged in a range of stakeholder and industry consultations as part of my work on Brexit preparedness. </p>  <p>  I am keen that the Department continues to engage in in-depth and frequent dialogue with our stakeholders on a range of policy areas which fall within our remit.

Such Orders are known as Employment Regulation Orders. </p>  <p>  The Joint Labour Committee for the Security Industry was established in accordance with Statutory Instrument No. 377 of 1998 (as amended by Statutory Instrument No. 30 of 2014).  The Deputy may be aware that the JLC structure has in recent years undergone an extensive overhaul as the result of a successful Constitutional challenge in 2011 and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 addresses the shortcomings identified in the ruling on that challenge.</p>  <p>  In relation to the membership of the JLC I am informed that, in accordance with the Statute, the Labour Court consulted with ICTU, IBEC and the two employer organisations most closely connected with the Security Industry, the National Union of Security Employers (merged with the Security Institute of Ireland in 2011) and the Irish Security Industry Association.  Following consultation, these bodies nominated representatives of both employers and employees for membership of the Committee.  The current members were appointed on 12 May 2014.</p>  <p>  The Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson are Industrial Relations Officers from the Workplace Relations Commission and are appointed by me. </p>  <p>  The constitution and proceedings of JLCs is set out in the Fifth Schedule to the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.

Having considered them in the context of the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 as amended, I am satisfied that the legislation was complied with during the making of the proposals by the JLC and their adoption by the Labour Court and I signed an Order on 30 May to give effect to the proposals from 1 June 2017.

Such Orders are known as Employment Regulation Orders. </p>  <p>  The Joint Labour Committee for the Security Industry was established in accordance with Statutory Instrument No. 377 of 1998 (as amended by Statutory Instrument No. 30 of 2014).  The Deputy may be aware that the JLC structure has in recent years undergone an extensive overhaul as the result of a successful Constitutional challenge in 2011 and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 addresses the shortcomings identified in the ruling on that challenge.</p>  <p>  In relation to the membership of the JLC I am informed that, in accordance with the Statute, the Labour Court consulted with ICTU, IBEC and the two employer organisations most closely connected with the Security Industry, the National Union of Security Employers (merged with the Security Institute of Ireland in 2011) and the Irish Security Industry Association.  Following consultation, these bodies nominated representatives of both employers and employees for membership of the Committee. The current members were appointed on the 12 May 2014.</p>  <p>  The Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson are Industrial Relations Officers from the Workplace Relations Commission and are appointed by me. </p>  <p>  The constitution and proceedings of JLCs is set out in the Fifth Schedule to the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.  The discussions within the Joint Labour Committees are not open to me nor to my Department. </p>  <p>  The draft proposals for an employment regulation order to replace the one that currently exists for the Security Industry and that you refer to were advertised as part of the public consultation process.  The closing date for submissions on those proposals was 7 February last. The proposals were subsequently adopted by the Labour Court and forwarded to me.  Having considered them in the context of the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 as amended, I am satisfied that the legislation was complied with during the formulation of the proposals by the JLC and their adoption by the Labour Court and I signed an Order on 30 May to give effect to the proposals from 1 June 2017. (S.I. 231 of 2017 - Employment Regulation Order (Security Industry Joint Labour Committee) 2017).</p></reply>

For children under three years of age, maximum subsidy rates &ndash; for families with the lowest incomes &ndash; will be &euro;4.18 per hour for 2 year olds, &euro;4.37 per hour for 1 year olds and &euro;5.11 per hour for children between 6 and 12 months . These maximum subsidy rates will apply to families with net incomes below &euro;22,700. For families with net incomes between &euro;22,700 and &euro;47,500, the hourly subsidy rate will taper down evenly from the maximum subsidy rates to the minimum subsidy rate of &euro;0.50 per hour.</p>  <p>  The ECCE capitation rates are &euro;64.50 per week for the standard capitation and &euro;75 per week for the higher capitation.  These rates provide for 15 hours per week. On an hourly basis, they are therefore equivalent to &euro;4.30 per hour for the standard rate and &euro;5 per hour for the higher rate.</p>  <p>  The ECCE capitation rates are not directly comparable with the ACS rates as the ACS is intended to be a subsidy, with the parents expected to pay a co-payment (with the level of co-payment dependent on the family net income and on the price charged by the childcare provider), whereas ECCE is a full payment, with no charge for parents.  In addition, the difference in rates between the schemes reflects the different adult-child ratios that are required depending on the age of the child and the type of session (e.g. whether sessional or full-time/part-time).  Unlike in the ECCE programme, it is not proposed that ACS subsidy-rates will vary according to the qualification levels of childcare workers, though the link between the cost of delivery and qualification levels will be further examined in the context of the forthcoming independent review of the cost of quality childcare. </p></reply>

Two annual reports on the progress of implementing <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, </i>covering the first two years of the framework have been prepared, and are available to the public on my Department&rsquo;s website.  A third annual report is being finalised in my Department, and will be made available to the public in Q3 2017.</p><p>These reports present a positive picture of implementation across government, as well as a high level of engagement from Departments and agencies. The community and voluntary sector is involved in the implementation of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures </i>through the Advisory Council, which is working with Departments on a range of issues including child poverty, prevention and early intervention, mental health and wellbeing and others. </p><p>Children and young people are engaged in the implementation process through the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g National Executive and the Young Voices group.</p><p>Even the most complex issues, such as child poverty, obesity, homelessness and prevention and early intervention are being progressed across government, through engagements occurring within the implementation structures of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.</i></p><p>The cornerstone of the <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures </i>implementation infrastructure is the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Consortium, which is responsible for having oversight and driving whole of Government implementation of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures. </i>Since being appointed Minister, I have chaired meetings of the Consortium.</p><p>My Department has also developed a set of outcome indicators for <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, </i>aligned with the five national outcomes.  These will act as a barometer of progress on the five national outcomes, and will influence future policy development.</p><p>The constituent strategies on <i>Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision Making, </i>and the <i>National Youth Strategy </i>are both being implemented, and work is ongoing in my Department developing an <i>Early Years Strategy.</i></p><p>As 2017 represents the mid-point in the life of the framework, my Department is organising a mid-point review to consider issues such as engagement, outputs and the effectiveness of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, </i>as well as identifying priorities for implementation up to 2020. It is intended that all stakeholders will have the opportunity to contribute to this review.</p></reply>

It is a valuable report and raises a number of issues that are of concern to us all.   </p>  <p>  Dr. Shannon's report refers to a number of case studies based in Garda records. I have asked Tusla to obtain the information on these cases and review them against their records so that we may have a fuller picture of events.  I understand that a report based on these cases is expected to be available for my information in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  A protocol between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla-Child and Family Agency is near completion and, shortly, a Tusla social worker will be co-located with the national child protection unit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Liaison will be in place between Tusla and newly established Garda divisional child protection units.  I understand that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla already have excellent co-operation at senior management levels.</p>  <p>  In November 2015, Tusla launched a consolidated national out of hours service, to improve on previous arrangements.  I understand this was after the period reviewed by Dr. Shannon.  All Garda&iacute; who  contact Tusla under this arrangement will speak with a social worker in a dedicated unit in Tusla's national office.  This office  may provide advice or in the busiest areas  make arrangements to deliver a child to Tusla following the invocation of section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991.  Garda&iacute; also have limited access, for data protection reasons, to the Child Protection Notification System to identify if a child is subject to a child protection plan.  There are social workers available to be on the ground in Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Cork city, where demand is greatest, and an on-call social worker service across the areas where an out of hours request is not as frequent.  Tusla has indicated that it is monitoring these arrangements and will report to me when they complete their review.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the powers under section 12 of the Act can only be invoked by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under certain circumstances and Garda&iacute; must then take steps to deliver a child to Tusla once the child has been removed.  Tusla is then obliged under the Act to either reunite the child with a responsible caregiver or to seek an emergency care order in the Courts.  </p></reply>
