Successive Irish Governments, in our ongoing bilateral relations and through the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg, have raised the issue of collusion with the British Government.</p>  <p>  We continue to do so, including in relation to a number of individual cases of long-standing concern such as the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the case of the late Pat Finucane.  In particular, we advocate that all relevant documentation be made available to be examined by the appropriate mechanisms.  Such cases must be adequately addressed if we are to achieve a genuinely reconciled society.</p>  <p>  Many families, including those bereaved by incidents in which collusion has been alleged, continue to deal not only with the awful pain of losing a loved one, but with the struggle for answers decades after these traumatic events.  I understand and acknowledge the frustration of families who for too long have had to contend with inadequate mechanisms for addressing their cases.  For that reason, the establishment of a new comprehensive framework for dealing with the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement, remains a priority of the Government.  We believe that these mechanisms offer the best hope of helping the thousands of families touched by the Troubles &ndash; including those affected by collusion.</p>  <p>  These institutions will include a Historical Investigations Unit (HIU) to take forward investigations into Troubles-related deaths, as well as an Independent Commission on Information Retrieval (ICIR) to enable victims and survivors seek and privately receive information about Troubles-related deaths.  Good progress is being made on the establishment of these institutions which I believe will assist all victims, including the victims of collusion, in their quest for justice and the truth.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-14a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015071400063#WRA01100"><p>We have all been deeply shocked and saddened by the recent event in Tunisia, where three Irish citizens lost their lives in this terrible tragedy.  I am sure that the whole House will join me in extending our heartfelt sympathy to the families of the deceased at this especially difficult time.</p><p>In countries where there is no resident Irish mission, diplomatic representation and consular assistance is provided to Irish citizens through our network of Honorary Consuls and by the accredited non-resident Irish Embassy.  In the case of Tunisia, Ireland is represented in country by an Honorary Consul and through secondary accreditation by the Embassy of Ireland in Madrid.</p><p>Upon the Department learning of the incident, our Consular Emergency Response Plan was immediately activated.  The Embassy in Madrid was immediately notified by the Consular Division of the Department.  Embassy officials then quickly ascertained through its information network in Tunisia, the extent of the attack and the likely numbers of Irish citizens who might have been involved.</p><p>The<b></b>Department's standing Consular Response Centre was immediately activated to offer assistance and advice to citizens in Tunisia and their families in Ireland.  </p><p>The Ambassador and Consul based at the Irish Embassy in Madrid and accredited to Tunisia flew on the first available and most direct flight to Tunisia, arriving there a number of hours after the incident.  They made contact with the Irish citizens in the region, provided consular support to the families of the deceased, met with the relevant authorities on the ground and maintained constant contact with the Consular team in Dublin.</p><p>Officials at my Department both at home and across the network of missions abroad, regularly review their crisis response plans so as to best serve and protect Irish citizens in such instances.  In dealing with and responding to the tragic events of Tunisia, having these response plans in place allowed the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and this Government to appropriately meet the needs of Irish citizens who were involved in the tragedy.</p><p>In addition to the on-the-ground response that was mounted, the Government's Travel Advice for Tunisia was updated very soon after the incident.  This decision was taken in the light of the attack and informed by consultations with various actors on the ground (such as Tunisian security forces, other EU partner missions in Tunis) who were well placed to advise.  The Government's travel advice for Tunisia, as for all other countries, is kept under constant review by the Consular Division of my Department and updated as may be deemed necessary.  </p><p>In the specific case of the travel advice for Tunisia, having consulted relevant agencies and our international partners, our travel advice was changed again on Friday 10 July, to advise against all non-essential travel, the second-highest warning category on our five-point scale for travel advice.  We are now encouraging Irish visitors currently in Tunisia to review whether their presence in Tunisia is essential and, where this is not the case, we are advising them to leave by commercial means.</p><p>Our Embassy in Madrid, which is accredited to Tunisia, has been notifying Irish citizens resident in the country of the changes to the travel advice.</p><p>Irish citizens travelling or living abroad are strongly advised to register their travel and contact details online through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's website.  Registration enables the Department to establish contact with citizens more quickly in the event of an emergency.  In having an overview of the number of Irish citizens who may be in an affected region, the Department is better facilitated in reaching, assisting and accounting for them when it activates its established protocols in responding to crisis situations.</p></reply>

This troubling report essentially confirms the view which I and many others expressed in the D&aacute;il during the conflict last year, which was that both the scale and nature of the military action, and the high level of civilian casualties, inevitably led to the conclusion that the principles of distinction and proportionality were not being adequately respected, which they must be if the action is lawful.  These views were very clearly conveyed to the Israeli authorities at the time, as reported to the House.  There was of course no channel for making similar criticisms directly to Hamas and other groups on the Gaza side.</p>  <p>  The cases and evidence contained in the report were submitted earlier by the three NGOs to the Commission of Inquiry set up by the UN Human Rights Council last year to investigate these and other aspects of the conflict.  The Commission produced its report to the Human Rights Council on 22 June last.  In debate in the HRC, Ireland welcomed the report, commended the Commission on what we saw as a careful and balanced assessment, and stated that we broadly agreed with its conclusions.</p>  <p>  On 3 July, a draft resolution tabled by the Palestinian delegation, welcoming and following up on the Commission's report, was adopted by the Human Rights Council.  Ireland and the other EU Member States who are members of the Human Rights Council voted in favour of it.  In the course of these discussions at the HRC, Ireland's views on the conflict and the Commission report were again conveyed to both the Israeli and Palestinian authorities, at the HRC in Geneva and in capitals.</p></reply>

Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., we continue to work closely on this agenda with high level Government contacts and with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond.  The aim of these contacts is to achieve relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the US and to improve channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.</p>  <p>  The administrative measures announced last November by President Obama, which could benefit thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants based in the US, were very welcome.  I am conscious however that they remain under legal challenge in US Federal Courts and that in any case legislation in Congress is still needed to build on what has been promised in President Obama's announcement.  For that reason, the Government and our Embassy continue to avail of all contacts with the Administration and with Republican and Democratic political leaders to make the case for comprehensive immigration reform legislation. </p>  <p>  To that end, the Taoiseach and I recently met with John Boehner, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and a number of his Congressional colleagues, when they visited Dublin.  We both took the opportunity to re-emphasise the Government's wish to see comprehensive legislative reform so as to provide relief for the undocumented Irish and a legal pathway to allow for future Irish immigration to the US.</p>  <p>  The Government has also repeatedly raised the issue of immigration reform during other high level visits with US officials.  During the Taoiseach's visit to Washington for St. Patrick's Day, he met with President Obama, Vice President Biden as well as other senior US Administration figures and key Congressional contacts from both sides of the aisle.  These meetings provided an important opportunity to reiterate our concerns in regard to the position of the undocumented Irish, to seek further information on the detail of President Obama's executive action and to encourage progress on a comprehensive legislative package by Congress. </p>  <p>  I raised immigration reform issues when I met with Vice President Biden in Boston on 30 March.  I have also discussed these matters on a number of occasions recently with US Ambassador O'Malley.</p>  <p>  The Government as a whole, including my Department in Dublin and our Embassy in Washington, will continue to actively follow up on all of the issues raised in recent contacts with the US Administration, with Congress, in particular with the Republican leadership, and with the US Embassy in Ireland.</p></reply>

Both the Consulate and Consular Division are also in ongoing contact with other concerned parties including the J1 travel companies and sponsoring organisations, and with the local Irish community organisations in San Francisco which have been providing magnificent support to the families and the J1 students who have been very upset by the tragic experience. </p>  <p>  In common with the Government's general approach to consular cases and the right to privacy of those involved, it would not be appropriate to provide information on an individual basis as to the condition of the injured. </p>  <p>  The investigation by the local District Attorney into the balcony collapse remains ongoing.  While I welcome the investigation, it would be premature and unhelpful to anticipate the result of that formal investigation or on possible next steps. </p>  <p>  In respect of Sousse, in addition to the activation of the Department's Emergency Consular Response Centre in Dublin, an emergency consular response team led by Ambassador David Cooney in Madrid also travelled immediately to Tunisia to provide consular assistance on the ground to the families of the victims and to other affected Irish citizens.</p>  <p>  I wish to reassure the Deputy that officials will continue to liaise with the families of those affected by both tragic incidents and will continue to provide them with any consular assistance they require.  However, out of respect for the privacy of all the families involved, and in keeping with their wishes in this regard, my Department will not be commenting publicly on the assistance it provides.</p></reply>

Of these over 30 people avail of the one day turnaround.</p>  <p>  A passport reminder service is available on the Passport Service website.  This reminder service sends an e-mail, to those who have registered, three months before a passport is due to expire.  Registration is simple and merely requires those interested to record their name, e-mail address and the expiry date of the passport.  It is possible to register a number of different passports (e.g. all members of a family) using the one e-mail address with the reminder e-mail detailing which passport registered is about to expire.  The reminder e-mail also provides details of how to renew the passport, where to obtain passport application forms, etc.</p>  <p>  However, my Department faces a continual challenge in respect of people who only check the location and validity of their passport days or even hours before travel.  I thank the Deputy for his constructive suggestion in order to address this. </p>  <p>  My officials will raise this matter with Irish airlines at the next meeting of the National Facilitation Committee which is comprised of key stakeholders in the aviation sector. </p>  <p>  I would encourage Deputies to use opportunities in their regular communications with constituents to remind them to check where their passport is, where their child's passport is and are all passports in date.</p></reply>

He is sought by the ICC in relation to a number of charges, including charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.  These charges arise out of an investigation conducted by the ICC Prosecutor in relation to a protracted conflict that existed in Darfur since 1 July 2002.  The situation in Darfur, since 1 July 2002, was referred to the ICC by the UN Security Council in Resolution 1593 on 31 March 2005, using its authority under the Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court.</p>  <p>  Full co-operation with the ICC is a pre-requisite for its effective functioning.  Any State Party to the Rome Statute has an obligation to arrest and surrender to the ICC any ICC indictee present on its territory.  On 13 June 2015, in the context of President Al Bashir's proposed attendance at the AU Summit in South Africa, the ICC Pre Trial Chamber issued a decision, following the ICC Prosecutor's request for an order further clarifying that the Republic of South Africa is under an obligation to arrest and surrender Al Bashir, which confirmed this obligation.  </p>  <p>  It is Ireland's established position, together with the EU and its Member States, that States Parties to the Rome Statute are obliged to execute ICC arrest warrants.  Ireland expected South Africa to fulfil its commitments in this regard and is disappointed that it did not do so. </p>  <p>  The legitimacy of the ICC is not in question.  The Rome Statute has 123 States Parties.  It is the first permanent international criminal judicial body. Ireland views the ICC as a vital element of the international criminal justice system.  It represents a collective effort to end a culture of impunity for crimes which the international community regard as the most serious of all.  The Court has faced many challenges since its establishment.  The cases before the Court arise from complex and challenging situations.

Members of the ETC reported on their activities against individual Action Points most recently at the ETC meeting on 4 November 2014. </p><p>I would draw the Deputy's attention to the following examples of progress, made by my Department over the last 18 months, on a selection of the reconfigured Actions Points:</p><p><b>- Build Ireland;s profile abroad</b>: The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade opened eight new diplomatic missions over the past year across South East Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas, which has widened the footprint of Ireland's diplomatic representation and has increased the profile of Ireland in key markets including Brazil, Indonesia and Thailand.  These Embassies and Consulates will provide a platform for further promotion of Irish exports, investment, tourism and education.  </p><p><b>- Maximise impact of St. Patrick's Day period worldwide: </b>As part of the 'Reputation' theme of the revised Action Plan model, the 2015 St. Patrick's period saw 29 trade-focussed visits led by the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Ministers.  Trade, tourism and investment in Ireland were promoted at 148 dedicated business events, attended by almost 18,000 Irish and international company representatives.  As part of the Tourism Ireland &ldquo;Global Greening&rdquo; campaign, 170 iconic buildings and landmarks around the world turned green for St. Patrick's Day &ndash; in many instances these greenings were achieved due to direct support from the Embassy network.</p><p><b>- Maximise Ireland's access to international markets: </b>My Department works through its Embassy network, and in cooperation with State agencies and the relevant Departments, to facilitate access to markets for Irish companies, including through organising introductions for business leaders, resolving market access barriers or advocating for better access to international markets for Irish products and services.  For example, my Department worked closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine towards the reopening of the US and Chinese markets to Irish beef. </p><p><b>- Maximise the impact of integrated trade missions: </b>My Department's Embassy network continues to support Enterprise Ireland's programme of Ministerial-led international trade missions and works closely with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Bord Bia and other State agencies to promote Ireland, Irish companies and Irish products overseas.  Ministers attached to my Department have led nine trade missions or trade events in the last 18 months.  In the past two months, for example, I led a major trade mission to South Africa and Minister of State Sherlock made trade-focused visits to the UK, France and Estonia. </p><p><b>- Maximise opportunities presented by Joint Economic Commissions: </b>My Department<b></b>manages Joint Economic Commissions (JECs) with four countries, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and China.  JECs offer significant opportunities to discuss greater access to international markets for Irish products and services and provide a forum for the resolution of existing market-access barriers.  JECs were held with Russia and the Republic of Korea in 2014, and it is intended to hold a JEC with China before the end of the year.</p><p><b>- Support overseas networks and maximise engagement with the Diaspora: </b>My Department<b></b>regularly engages with Irish people overseas in order to ensure that we are leveraging the potential of our diverse and influential Diaspora.  An important element of that engagement is the Global Irish Network, a network of 300 of the most influential Irish and Irish-connected people abroad who provide Ireland with valuable international expertise.  The Network works closely with the Government and State agencies in promoting Ireland's economic, cultural and tourism messages in key markets.  Minister of State Deenihan and I also launched &ldquo;Global Irish: Ireland's Diaspora Policy&rdquo; earlier this year, and in November, my Department will host the 4<sup>th</sup>Global Irish Economic Forum. </p><p>The current Government Trade Strategy runs to the end of 2015 and the focus of Departments, the Embassy network and the State Agencies is on its continued implementation over the remainder of its lifetime.  My Department, in consultation with the Embassy network and other Government Departments, State agencies and private sector members of the ETC, would propose to conduct a scoping exercise towards the end of the year to examine options for future approaches in the trade, tourism, investment and education areas.</p></reply>

These well documented reports by Human Rights Watch of alleged use of cluster munitions by the Saudi led coalition in Yemen are a cause of deep concern to me.  This concern has been expressed by Ireland at the recent Intersessional Meetings to the Convention on Cluster Munitions held in Geneva in June.  Ireland regularly urges all countries who have not signed or ratified the Cluster Munitions Convention, including the States which form the Saudi led coalition in Yemen, to sign and ratify the Convention and to cease use of these indiscriminate weapons.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to support and encourage universalisation of the Convention on Cluster Munitions in all multilateral fora and is deeply concerned about reports of any use of cluster munitions.</p>  <p>  The Convention prohibits all use, transfer, and stockpiling of cluster munitions, and I call upon all states, including those States who have not signed the Convention, as well as non-state actors to refrain from using these weapons.</p>  <p>  The Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) was adopted at a Diplomatic Conference in Dublin in 2008. Ireland has been a major supporter of the movement to ban cluster munitions from the very outset of this initiative.  The Convention entered into force on 1 August 2010 and as of 8 July 2015 a total of 116 states have joined the Convention (92 States parties and 24 Signatories). </p>  <p>  My Department is now preparing for the First Review Conference to the Convention which will take place in Croatia in September 2015, which presents an important opportunity to further strengthen and solidify the growing international norm against the use and retention of these inhumane weapons.</p></reply>

Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., we continue to work closely with high level Government contacts and with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond.  The aim of these contacts is to achieve relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the US and to improve channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.</p>  <p>  While measures announced last November by President Obama, which could benefit thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants based in the US, were welcome I am conscious that they remain under legal challenge in US Federal Courts and that in any case legislation in Congress is still needed to build on what has been achieved in President Obama's announcement.  We continue to express our desire to see a political way forward on this issue which would encourage progress on a comprehensive legislative package by Congress.  For that reason the government and our Embassy have been working, and will continue to work, with the Administration and with Republican and Democratic political leaders in the area of immigration reform. </p>  <p>  The objective of achieving an E3 visa agreement between Ireland and the United States  remains a key element of Ireland's overall position on U.S. immigration reform and one which we regularly emphasise both in contacts with US interlocutors at Ministerial level and through the  immigration reform activities of our Embassy in Washington, DC.</p>  <p>  Earlier this month I had the opportunity to meet with John Boehner, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and a number of his Congressional colleagues, when they visited Dublin.  The Taoiseach also met with him and we both took the opportunity to re-emphasise our wish to see comprehensive legislative reform so as to provide relief for the undocumented Irish and a legal pathway to allow for future Irish immigration to the US.</p>  <p>  The Government has also repeatedly raised the issue of immigration reform during other high level visits with US officials. During the Taoiseach's visit to Washington for St. Patrick's Day, he met with President Obama, Vice President Biden as well as other senior US Administration figures and key Congressional contacts from both sides of the aisle.  These meetings provided an important opportunity to reiterate our concerns and aspirations in regard to immigration reform.  I also raised these issues, including the possibility of immigration reform legislation, when I met with Vice President Biden in Boston on 30 March.  I have also discussed these matters on a number of occasions recently with US Ambassador O'Malley.</p>  <p>  The Government as a whole, including my Department in Dublin and our Embassy in Washington, will continue to actively follow up on all of the issues raised in recent contacts with the US Administration, with Congress, in particular with the Republican leadership, and with the US Embassy in Ireland.  This includes preparing the ground for movement on an E3 visa arrangement when the opportunity for this arises.</p></reply>

I addressed the NPT Review Conference in New York at its opening on 27 April this year in order to highlight Ireland's continuing strong commitment to nuclear disarmament.  I also had the opportunity to meet with a number of delegations on that occasion.</p><p>It is a matter of great regret that, despite strenuous efforts, including by Ireland, the 2015 NPT Review Conference ended without an agreed outcome document.  Both before and during the Conference, Ireland worked for concrete progress on creating an effective outcome document through our national efforts and also through the New Agenda Coalition (NAC), a cross-regional group of States, including Ireland, which are committed to promoting urgent progress on nuclear disarmament.</p><p>Right from the inception of the NPT, Ireland has emphasised - primarily for humanitarian reasons - the urgent need to pursue the effective measures for nuclear disarmament mandated by Article VI of the Treaty.  It is clear that, in order to be effective, these measures need to be legally binding, and it is my view that work on elaborating them needs to begin immediately.</p><p>The need for urgent progress on nuclear disarmament has been given even greater impetus by the facts and research presented at three major recent conferences on the risks and consequences associated with nuclear weapons and the devastating humanitarian consequences of any nuclear detonation whether by accident or design.  A statement endorsed at the Review Conference by 159 States, including Ireland, asserts that nuclear weapons must never be used again under any circumstances and that the only way of ensuring this is through their total elimination.</p><p>Ireland's final statement to the Review Conference recalled our commitment to nuclear disarmament and our belief that effective measures for the implementation of Article VI are required as a matter of urgency. </p><p>This has always been and remains Ireland's position, as was shown last year when Ireland was Coordinator of the New Agenda Coalition and contributed significantly to the debate at the Final Preparatory Committee meeting for the NPT Review Conference by presenting on behalf of the NAC a Working Paper with detailed proposals on the effective measures required by Article VI.  This work was taken forward by the current NAC Coordinator, New Zealand, at the Review Conference itself.  I can assure the Deputy that we will continue<font color="#FF0000"> </font>to work towards achieving a world without nuclear weapons, including by consulting closely with like-minded partners and by supporting South Africa, which assumed the role of Coordinator of the New Agenda Coalition on the 1 July 2015.</p></reply>

The appointment of a new, independent, chair of the Prison Forum should assist progress on implementation, which to date has not moved as quickly as I would wish.</p>  <p>  Strip searching, controlled movement, and detention in the Care and Supervision Unit (CSU) of Maghaberry Prison continue as points of difference and tension between prisoners and prison management.  Balances are required to be found between vindicating the rights of prisoners in very restrictive imprisonment with the duty on management to ensure an environment where the health and safety of staff and inmates are protected.  There are differences in emphasis between management and prisoners in where that balance lies, complicated by the differing responsibilities of the Department of Justice and the Northern Ireland Office on these matters.</p>  <p>  The effective address of strip searching, controlled movement, and the vindication of the rights of those in the CSU features in my regular discussions with Minister Ford and Secretary of State Villiers.  In addition, my officials follow-up with the relevant Departments, with the NI Prison Service, and with the Prisoner Ombudsman on these and other matters.  I am aware also that the new independent chair of the Prison Forum is seized of the importance of these issues.</p></reply>

That is because we believe that UK membership of the Union is hugely important to Ireland's interests, and to the interests of the EU as a whole.  Of course, work has been underway for some time to ensure we best understand the various issues at stake and to examine the potential implications for Ireland of a possible British exit from the Union.  However the focus of our work remains helping to keep the UK in the EU, rather than mitigating the effects of UK withdrawal.</p>  <p>  In relation to Greece, the Taoiseach has made it clear that we understand and sympathise with the difficult situation in which the Greek people find themselves.  We want to find a way forward that takes account of the realities of the situation and the political priorities of the Greek Government, while also respecting existing commitments.  Our focus remains very much on finding a broadly acceptable and sustainable solution that is in the interests of Greece, the Euro area and the European Union as a whole.</p>  <p>  These issues and the financial and economic crisis from which Europe is emerging have naturally impacted on the confidence of citizens across the EU.  It is therefore unsurprising that support for parties that question the European project should increase.  However, despite the difficult circumstance in which last year's European Parliament elections were held, a substantial majority of the electorate endorsed pro-EU parties and candidates. </p>  <p>  The Government will, of course, continue to work alongside the Governments of fellow EU Member States and the EU institutions, including the European Parliament, to try to resolve difficulties that emerge and to address the concerns of European citizens.  </p>  <p>  The Lisbon Treaty introduced a range of measures to reinforce democracy and accountability in the EU, including by strengthening the role of the European Parliament as a co-legislator with the Council of Ministers and by allocating national parliaments specific responsibility for enforcing the subsidiarity principle. </p>  <p>  Given these responsibilities, it is important that national parliaments engage effectively with one another and with the European Parliament, as well as with other EU institutions.  In that context, I welcome the particular priority which the European Commission, led by President Juncker, has afforded to engagement with national parliaments and the work which has been taken forward by national parliaments themselves to enhance coordination structures through COSAC, helping to bring EU decision-making closer to our citizens.  There is also regular and significant contact between MEPs and the Oireachtas, both between individual members and at committee level.</p></reply>

Here in Ireland and through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., we continue to work closely with high level Government contacts and with many other individuals and groups.</p><p>As part of these contacts, we have highlighted the issue of those amongst the Irish undocumented who might be eligible for<b></b>visas, but who would be required to return to Ireland for their issuance and hence would require waivers for their prior period of undocumented residence.</p><p>The Government has repeatedly raised the issue of immigration reform during high level visits with US officials in the first half of this year.  During the Taoiseach's visit to Washington for St. Patrick's Day, he met with President Obama, Vice President Biden as well as other senior US Administration figures and key Congressional contacts from both sides of the aisle.  These meetings provided an important opportunity to reiterate our concerns in regard to the position of the undocumented Irish, to seek further information on the detail of President Obama's executive action, to raise the question of visa waivers and to encourage progress on a comprehensive legislative package by Congress.  I also raised immigration reform issues, including the possibility of immigration reform legislation and the question of visa waivers, when I met with Vice President Biden in Boston on 30 March.  I have also discussed these matters on a number of occasions recently with US Ambassador O'Malley.</p><p>Measures announced last November by President Obama, which could benefit thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants based in the US, were very welcome.  However, I am conscious that they remain under legal challenge in US Federal Courts and that, as President Obama correctly emphasised at the time of his announcement, legislation in Congress is still needed to ensure reform which is fully comprehensive.</p><p>We continue to push for a political way forward on this issue which would encourage progress on a legislative package by Congress.

During the Taoiseach's visit to Washington for St. Patrick's Day, he met with President Obama, Vice President Biden as well as other senior US Administration figures and key Congressional contacts from both sides of the aisle.  These meetings provided an important opportunity to reiterate our concerns in regard to the position of the undocumented Irish, to seek further information on the detail of President Obama's executive action and to encourage progress on a comprehensive legislative package by Congress. </p>  <p>  I raised immigration reform issues when I met with Vice President Biden in Boston on 30 March.  I have also discussed these matters on a number of occasions recently with US Ambassador O'Malley.</p>  <p>  The Government as a whole, including my Department in Dublin and our Embassy in Washington, will continue to actively follow up on all of the issues raised in recent contacts with the US Administration, with Congress, in particular with the Republican leadership, and with the US Embassy in Ireland.</p></reply>

The Programme will also be an opportunity to present the best of Irish arts and culture to the world.</p>  <p>  The Programme includes a number of flagship events. In Washington D.C., the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, in partnership with the Embassy of Ireland, will host a three-week festival of Irish arts and culture entitled 'Ireland 100: Celebrating a Century of Irish Arts and Culture', from 16 May to 5 June 2016, while in London, a concert featuring Irish classical musicians and singers will take place at the world-renowned Wigmore Hall, in April 2016. </p>  <p>  The Programme also engages with young people and local communities.  In Argentina, for example, the Irish Embassy in Buenos Aires will hold schools' essay and art competitions, which will encourage participants to reflect on themes that include the Easter Rising and Irish-Argentine relations.  In addition, the importance of the Irish language to our communities abroad is reflected in the Programme.  In June 2016, Gl&oacute;r na nGael and our Consulate General in Boston will hold a conference bringing together Irish language groups from across the United States.</p>  <p>  Film screenings, artistic and cultural programmes, seminars and commemorative and community events from Paris to Dubai, and from San Francisco to Tokyo, are already included in the Programme and many more are being planned.

Higgins.  My Department took the initiative to instigate a consultation process with the Irish humanitarian community in response to the UN Secretary General's initiative to convene a World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul in May next year.  It will address the challenges, and the suffering, posed by the unprecedented number of humanitarian crises across the world.  The Irish Summit involved the public and private sectors, civil society and diaspora and academic communities in Ireland.</p>  <p>  At the Summit, I underlined the Government's strong commitment to providing humanitarian aid that is neutral, independent, impartial and based on need.  The outcomes of the Summit and the emerging recommendations from the ten-month consultations which preceded it will inform Ireland's engagement in the UN World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul.</p>  <p>  One of the key challenges is how to meet the needs of those living in and displaced by conflict.  Nearly 60 million people are now displaced around the world, the highest number since World War II.  Displacement caused by protracted conflict has a devastating impact on families who have had to flee their homes and communities.  The Irish Naval Service, through the work of the L.&Eacute;. Eithne has already made a huge contribution in rescuing thousands of migrants in the Mediterranean.  We must also, of course, address the root causes of displacement.  Ireland has strongly engaged in the EU to promote a political resolution to ongoing conflicts across the world.  Through the Irish Aid programme, we are making a significant contribution to addressing the root causes of displacement in countries of origin, notably through our humanitarian and development assistance in the Middle East, the Horn of Africa and other regions of Africa.  </p>  <p>  The demands on humanitarian funding have grown steeply in the past three years.  While donor funding has increased, there are substantial gaps in the funding required.  I am proud to say that in 2014 Ireland was in the top ten of donors per capita, in our provision of humanitarian assistance.  A total of &euro;85 million in Irish Aid funding was allocated for humanitarian crises in 2014.  Through this funding, Ireland responded to emergencies in the Philippines, South Sudan, Syria, Central African Republic and to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.  In keeping with Ireland's policy commitment to protracted and underfunded crises, significant support was directed to crises in Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Chad, Somalia and Ethiopia.  In addition, eight airlifts transported 269 tonnes of essential supplies to affected populations and 32 highly-skilled members of Ireland's Rapid Response Corps were deployed to work as surge capacity with Ireland's UN Stand-by Partners in a number of emergency response operations.  </p>  <p>  The Government is strongly committed to Ireland's overseas aid programme, which funds our humanitarian assistance, and has managed to stabilise the ODA budget despite the very difficult economic circumstances facing the country in recent years.  I will be making the strongest case possible for the aid budget in the upcoming budgetary process.</p></reply>

In his official level meetings, the Secretary General discussed issues relating to Cuba's reform process and human rights, US<font color="#004080">-</font>Cuban relations, bilateral trade and cultural ties.  The consultations took place in a constructive atmosphere and provide a good basis for further progress in strengthening our relationship with Cuba.</p><p>During his visit, the Secretary General signed a 'Memorandum on the Establishment of a Mechanism for Political Consultations'.  This initiative will promote political dialogue between Ireland and Cuba.  It is intended to develop mutual contacts and to deepen bilateral relations on the basis of the principles, and with respect for, the provisions of the United Nations Charter.  The agreement provides a basis for regular discussion with Cuba on international and bilateral relations at a senior level, and is a welcome development in our relationship.</p><p>Officials of my Department are also in discussion with the Cuban side on a Memorandum of Cooperation between our two countries.  This will provide an important basis for cooperation across various areas of interest, including economic and cultural interaction and engagement in the areas of investment, scientific and research collaboration.</p><p>As regards bilateral trade in goods, this was valued at &euro;1.35 million in 2014, consolidating the increase of the previous year.  We hope that, as the process of economic reform proceeds, and as Cuba's relations with the US are normalised, it will be possible to develop our trade relationship further. </p><p>In the context of the European Union, I am pleased that negotiations are underway on an EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Co-operation Agreement.  This agreement, which the EU is seeking to conclude before the end of the year, will strengthen the EU-Cuba relationship and provide an improved framework for political dialogue, economic relations and cooperation in the period ahead.  The EU is Cuba's second most important trading partner, accounting for 20% of total Cuban trade.  The EU is also Cuba's biggest external investor and approximately one third of all tourists visiting the island every year come from countries of the European Union.</p></reply>

This is clearly contrary to international law.  I have expressed these concerns in public statements, in contacts with the Israeli Embassy here, and directly to the Israeli Foreign Minister when I visited in February.</p>  <p>  We have also consistently made this clear at EU level.  The EU has consistently condemned these policies, most recently in the Conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council in November 2014.  I have urged the EU and the international community to take stronger action to oppose this policy.</p>  <p>  The villagers of Susiya have been under threat of eviction for some years, and indeed many of them have been evicted from other homes in the area on previous occasions, in some cases more than once.  The apparent intention of the authorities is to force them off the land altogether and into the already crowded cities under Palestinian government administration, in order to clear the land for settlements and other purposes.  I note the UN Secretary General's view that, should it proceed, this may amount to forcible transfer contrary to the Fourth Geneva Convention, and I share that assessment.</p>  <p>  The Irish Representative in Ramallah has visited Susiya twice in recent weeks to show our support for the villagers, including a visit in June as part of a delegation of EU Heads of Mission, accompanying the Palestinian Prime Minister. Irish Aid has also helped provide practical assistance to threatened villages in the area, including solar power and water equipment.  Ireland has also supported local NGOs fighting these eviction orders through the courts.</p>  <p>  I repeat today my condemnation of these eviction plans, and I call for them to be set aside.</p>  <p>  I have had the opportunity to discuss this case more fully with the Deputy and others in my meeting last week with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.

The Conferences are interlinked.  They are on Financing for Development, this week in Addis Ababa, on a new framework for global development at the UN in New York in September and on a new climate change agreement in Paris in December.  The aim is to deliver a new and transformative sustainable development agenda, with Sustainable Development Goals, up to 2030.</p>  <p>  The Addis Conference will seek to unlock the range of financing sources required to implement the new universal Goals.  These include domestic resource mobilisation, private sector contributions, as well as Official Development Assistance (ODA), which remains critical for the poorest countries.  The Government remains firmly committed to reaching the 0.7% target for ODA and to making further progress towards it as our economic recovery consolidates.  Ireland is a world leader in the proportion of our aid which goes to the Least Developed Countries and we also strongly support the UN target of providing 0.15 &ndash; 0.2% of GNI for the Least Developed Countries, which we already exceed.</p>  <p>  Issues of taxation will be central to the financing of sustainable development.  We believe the most effective way to deal with global tax issues is through the OECD.  In this regard upgrading the UN Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters to intergovernmental status could result in competing processes rather than fostering more cooperation.</p>  <p>  In an effort to ensure the involvement of the developing world in these processes, the Minister for Finance has previously called at the OECD for all countries to undertake spill-over analyses of the impact of their taxation regimes on the developing world, similar to the analysis already commissioned by the Department of Finance in respect of Ireland.</p></reply>

It is based on two clear objectives: firstly to see this individual released by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland as soon as possible and, secondly, to provide consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention.</p>  <p>  A number of NGOs and other parties who are interested in this case have made representations to, or are in ongoing contact with, my Department.  At no time did my Department ever seek to direct or circumscribe any actions taken by any NGO or state agency. </p>  <p>  In April the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission contacted my Department and sought its advice on whether making a public statement on this case would be helpful.  This request was made a few days prior to the first hearing when a bail application, formally supported by the Irish Government, was due to be considered by the court. </p>  <p>  The Department's advice to the Commission was that a statement issued at that precise time might not be in the citizen's best interests.  This advice was entirely consistent with the ongoing approach of the Department in this difficult case which has been to avoid, where possible, any actions which might prejudice the citizen's case in the eyes of the Egyptian authorities.  It also did not seek to foreclose on the option of the IHREC issuing a statement after 26 April, when the bail application was in the event refused by the Court. </p>  <p>  NGOs and relevant state agencies are of course free to pursue such courses of action they feel appropriate and I fully respect their right to do so.  The Deputy will appreciate that all actions and statements by my Department must be guided by the imperative of what we judge to be in the citizen's best interests and in furtherance of the two key objectives outlined above.</p></reply>

The appointment of a new, independent, chair of the Prison Forum should assist progress on implementation, which to date has not moved as quickly as I would wish.</p>  <p>  Strip searching, controlled movement, and detention in the Care and Supervision Unit (CSU) of Maghaberry Prison continue as points of difference and tension between prisoners and prison management.  Balances are required to be found between vindicating the rights of prisoners in very restrictive imprisonment with the duty on management to ensure an environment where the health and safety of staff and inmates are protected.  There are differences in emphasis between management and prisoners in where that balance lies, complicated by the differing responsibilities of the Department of Justice and the Northern Ireland Office on these matters.</p>  <p>  The effective address of strip searching, controlled movement, and the vindication of the rights of those in the CSU features in my regular discussions with Minister Ford and Secretary of State Villiers.  In addition, my officials follow-up with the relevant Departments, with the NI Prison Service, and with the Prisoner Ombudsman on these and other matters.  I am aware also that the new independent chair of the Prison Forum is seized of the importance of these issues.</p></reply>

At that time negotiations were being taken forward with the Institutions and by Finance Ministers through the Eurogroup.  </p>  <p>  However, following the breaking off of negotiations by the Greek government, the holding of a referendum on 5 July, and the radical deterioration of Greece's financial situation, the situation in Greece was discussed at a special Euro Summit meeting on 7 July.  At that meeting, it was agreed that the Greek government would, on Thursday 9 July at the latest, present proposals for a comprehensive and specific reform agenda for assessment by the three institutions and presentation to the Eurogroup.  The Eurogroup considered these proposals at its meetings on 11 and 12 July.</p>  <p>  After all-night talks, the Euro Summit reached agreement yesterday, 13 July, on a series of measures that will enable negotiations on  a third programme of assistance, funded by the ESM, to begin.  The Greek government has committed to legislate for a first set of measures by tomorrow. It is in everyone's interests that our Greek colleagues move swiftly with partners to ensure that the programme is finalised, with a view to providing certainty for the Greek people and returning stability and growth to the Greek economy. </p>  <p>  The Euro Summit recalled that Member States have, throughout the last few years, adopted measures supporting Greece's debt sustainability, which have smoothed Greece's debt servicing path and reduced costs significantly.  Against this background and in the context of the possible future ESM programme, they agreed to consider possible additional measures to ensure that gross financing needs remain at a sustainable level.  It was stressed that nominal haircuts on the debt cannot be undertaken.</p>  <p>  Throughout these negotiations, I have expressed Ireland's understanding and empathy with the difficult situation faced by the Greek people.  I have highlighted our willingness to negotiate a way forward and achieve a sustainable solution that takes account of the realities of the situation in Greece, while also respecting existing commitments.  I have stressed our determination to ensure that Greece can continue as a member of the euro area.  At the two Euro Summits I intervened along these lines, and participated in the Summit's negotiations on the texts of the Conclusions. </p>  <p>  The negotiations were undoubtedly difficult and Greece remains in a very challenging situation.  However, if the agreed measures are now taken forward swiftly, I believe that there is a basis for Greece, with the support of partners, to return to stability and growth within the euro area.  That is the objective towards which we have all worked and will continue to work.</p>  <p>  While ECB President Draghi participated in the Euro Summit meetings of 7 and 12/13 July with a particular focus on financial stability and the situation of the Greek banks, there was no discussion on  the general role of the ECB, nor is this in question.  The ECB is, of course, independent in carrying out its mandate and tasks.    </p>  <p>  The issue of youth unemployment was not specifically discussed.  However, the importance of supporting growth and job creation in Greece, as part of an overall agreement, was fully recognised, and is reflected in particular in the final paragraph of yesterday's Euro Summit conclusions which deals with the funding of investment in Greece.</p>  <p>  I did not attend any bilateral meetings in the margins of the Euro Summit meeting on 7 July.  Neither have I had specific bilateral contacts with Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande or President Juncker since the Greek referendum.  However, I did, of course, meet and talk to these three leaders and my other euro area counterparts at the two Euro Summit meetings.</p>  <p>  On 10 July, I had a detailed meeting with Prime Minister Renzi in Rome.  During that meeting, we reviewed a range of issues on the EU agenda, including the situation in Greece, and discussed proposals to enhance our bilateral cooperation.</p></reply>

This is a major undertaking for the Central Statistics Office and requires detailed forward planning in order for census enumerators to call at every home in Ireland to deliver in the region of 1.8 million census forms. </p>  <p>  The CSO works hard to ensure that the information collected and provided from the census remains current, relevant and of maximum use to the public. It has been common practice in advance of each census to conduct a public consultation on possible new questions and changes to existing questions, which are then considered by a specially convened Census Advisory Group in advance of testing in the field in the form of a pilot survey of some 12,000 dwellings. Unfortunately given the very tight budget circumstances in 2013 and 2014, with constraints on resources right across the public sector, it was not possible to pursue this route for census 2016. Accordingly the 2016 census is being run as a &lsquo;no-change&rsquo; census with the questions (including the religion question) on the 2016 questionnaire remaining unchanged from those used in the 2011 census, with the exception of the question on marital status.</p>  <p>  The format of the question on religion used in 2011, and being repeated in 2016, was agreed by the Census Advisory Group which was established to assist the CSO in developing the 2011 questionnaire. This group comprised representatives of central and local government, the social partners, universities, research bodies and other users of census data, along with the relevant CSO personnel.  The group reviewed over 90 submissions for new questions or changes to existing questions during the course of their work. </p>  <p>  In private households the head of household is asked to complete the form for the entire household. However in all non-private establishments each individual completes their own form.</p>  <p>  As censuses of population are traditionally held at five-yearly intervals in Ireland it is intended that should there be a census in 2021 a full public consultation on the questions to be asked will be conducted in advance. </p></reply>

The Department of Social Protection (DSP) is now responsible for CE. Neither F&Aacute;S nor DSP were parties to the LCR19293 (although F&Aacute;S did make a submission to the Court). The unions took the case under Section 20(1) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969. The rulings for such a case are binding upon the claimant to the Labour Court, but are <b>not</b>legally binding upon the respondents (i.e. the employers).</p><p>Notwithstanding the position of this Department in rejecting that liability for these costs should be met from public funds, this matter was the subject of discussions between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (D/PER) and the unions representing CE Supervisors.  The D/PER&rsquo;s position, as outlined to the unions, is that companies contracted by the State to provide a service, including in the community sector, have to manage their expenditure pressures, including labour and pension costs, from within existing funding levels. </p><p>It should be noted that this Department is not the employer of CE supervisors and such employees are not public servants, but are employees of the sponsoring organisations.  The responsibilities of the sponsoring organisations as employers and the individuals concerned as employees must also be considered. </p><p>Employers (including CE Sponsoring Organisations) are legally obliged to offer access to at least one Standard Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) under the Pension (Amendment) Act 2002.  All CE sponsoring organisations were informed of their responsibilities under this Act at that time. </p><p>It should also be noted that CE Supervisors may also qualify for the State Pension at 66 years of age.  If they have accrued sufficient PRSI contributions (520 contributions @ full rate, equivalent to 10 years contributions) they will qualify for the State Pension (Contributory), which is not means-tested.

An enquiry into the case referred to was carried out in the General Register Office in 1999.</p>  <p>  Section 32 of the Family Law Act 1995, the legislation which was in place at the time of the case referred to, required that each party to an intended marriage notify the appropriate registrar of their intention to marry not less than three months in advance of the solemnisation of the marriage. The 3 months&rsquo; notice was declared to be a substantive requirement for a valid marriage. This means that if 3 months&rsquo; notice was not given (or an exemption to the 3 months requirement was not granted by the Courts under section 33 of that Act) a marriage would not be deemed to be a valid marriage and cannot be registered. </p>  <p>  In the case referred to, the required notification was not received nor was an exemption granted by the Courts. The marriage, therefore, could not be deemed to be a valid civil marriage and could not be registered. </p>  <p>  The Civil Registration Act 2004 is now the governing legislation for the registration of marriages. The Act retains (in section 46) the requirement that, for a marriage to be considered valid, not less than 3 months&rsquo; notice of the intended marriage shall be given to a registrar. </p>  <p>  The Act also provides (in section 47) that an application for an exemption to the 3 months&rsquo; notice can be made to the Circuit Family Court or the High Court and this exemption may be granted if it is justified by serious reasons and if it is in the interests of the couple. Therefore, there is no requirement to amend the legislation.</p></reply>

While the customer is on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment this support is available and is not limited to the 12 month engagement that applies for other jobseekers from the date of their one to one meeting.  The aim of this broader support is to improve the individual&rsquo;s employment prospects and will be tailored to meet the person&rsquo;s individual needs.</p>  <p>  The Department will commence engaging with this cohort of customers from September of this year when the school term recommences.</p>  <p>  Customers who transition to a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment will gain access to the same activation supports as are currently provided to all jobseekers.</p>  <p>  In addition, in cases where lone parents affected by the reforms lose financially and are having difficulty increasing their hours of employment in order to be able to claim the family income supplement and the back to work family dividend, the Department will work with these customers directly to offer every possible assistance.</p>  <p>  As I have stated previously in the D&aacute;il, I am also looking forward to examining the various supports available to all families with children, including single parent families, in the next Budget.

Budget 2014 further extended the reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to recipients under 26 years of age. This is a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency. It aims to incentivise young jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.</p>  <p>  Based on data from June, 2015 the additional full year cost for my Department of providing a weekly rate of &euro;188 for all Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance recipients aged 25 and under is some &euro;146.4 million. However, it should be noted that such an increase will also have cost implications for the Department of Education and Skills as it will impact on the allowances paid by the Education and Training Boards.

Applicants who are under age 66 must be in receipt of a qualifying payment in order to qualify for the scheme.  The qualifying payments for those aged under 66 are invalidity pension, blind pension, disability allowance, carer&rsquo;s allowance or an equivalent social security payment from a country covered by EC Regulations or one with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement.  Accordingly, there are currently approx. 828,000 customers with direct eligibility with an annual allocation of &euro;77 million.</p>  <p>  If the scheme was to be extended to people under 66 who are not eligible for a qualifying payment, an assessment procedure would be required for all such applications, changing the nature of the scheme.  Successive Governments have instead used existing underlying entitlements to confer eligibility for this scheme, and there are no plans to change this.</p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the free travel scheme would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.</p></reply>

The Short Term Enterprise Allowance (STEA) provides immediate access to those who have lost their jobs and qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and wish to set up a business. Payment under the scheme is at the same rate and for the same duration as their entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.

The best route out of social welfare dependency and poverty is through paid employment.  Research shows that being at work reduces the at-risk-of-poverty rate of lone parents by three-quarters when compared to not being at work.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the recently implemented OFP scheme reforms is to maximise the opportunities for lone parents to enter into and increase employment by providing them with enhanced access to the wide range of education, training, and employment supports that make up the Department&rsquo;s Intreo services.  These supports include the recently introduced Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD), which provides a significant incentive for families with children to move into employment, as recently reported by the ESRI.</p>  <p>  At present, the level of employment among lone parents stands at 45%.  Although it is too early to anticipate what the levels of participation by lone parents in paid employment will be in the months and years ahead, access to the Department&rsquo;s Intreo services is imperative for transitioning lone parents in order to ensure that their prospects of securing employment and financial independence are further improved.</p>  <p>  Any reversal of the OFP scheme reforms would delay the critical interaction between lone parents and the Department&rsquo;s Intreo services and would potentially increase the barriers they face to entering employment in the future.  I therefore have no plans to reverse these reforms.  Instead, my priority is to ensure that we, as a society, arrive at a situation where lone parents can avail of the same opportunities to access employment, education, and training as everyone else in order to attain their full potential.</p>  <p>  However, I look forward to examining the various supports that are available to all families with children, including lone parent families, in the next Budget.  In particular, I will look at the scope for improvements in the child benefit payment as well as in other supports for families that are engaged in both full-time and part-time employment.</p></reply>

Data from this sample survey are not available at the county level. The most recently published Eurostat data indicate that in 2014, on average, 15.2% of young people aged 15-24 years (or approximately 79,000 young people) were in this situation.</p><p>Table 2 sets out the number of training and other programme places set aside for young people in each of the years 2014 and 2015.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by unemployed jobseekers and, in accordance with the EU Council recommendation for a Youth Guarantee by young jobseekers under 25 in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee plan.</p><p>As, under services such as Intreo, Youthreach, VTOS, PLC programmes, and JobBridge, Ireland already had many of the recommended component parts of a Youth Guarantee, the main plank in Ireland is to prioritise access to these existing supports for young people, who become unemployed, with the objective of ensuring that they have an opportunity for employment, further education or work experience within the recommended period of four months as per the EU council recommendation.</p><p>In this regard our first intervention is to provide case officer support to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs. Accordingly operating processes are being refined in each of our regions to prioritise the early engagement of young people through Intreo to ensure that all young people receive expert advice and have access to progression options. For those who do not find employment through the process just described, additional offers are provided for. Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes. Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s. Overall, over 23,300 opportunities were taken up on the relevant programmes in 2014.</p><p>Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall (with a rate of 19.8% in June 2015 estimated by CSO, as compared to 24.1% in June 2014 and with a peak of over 31% in 2012).</p><p>Table 1.

FIS is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.  There are in the region of 50,000 families in receipt of FIS, an increase of 70 per cent since 2011.  The average FIS payment per family is &euro;114 per week.</p>  <p>  To qualify for FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight (or 19 hours per week).  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p>  <p>  Reforms to the one-parent family payment (OFP) which were implemented in a phased basis in July 2013, July 2014 and July 2015, have resulted in an increase in lone parents applying for FIS.  Approximately 1,600 new FIS applications have already been received from lone parents who were affected by the reforms on 2 July 2015.  This is evidence that lone parents whose entitlement to OFP ceased on foot of the age reforms have over the previous two years increased their working hours in order to claim FIS.  Where lone parents are working less than 38 hours per fortnight they may qualify for a jobseeker's payment including the jobseeker's transitional payment if their youngest child is under 14 years of age.</p>  <p>  The Labour Market Council has established a sub-Group to specifically examine the issue of how employers nationwide can assist transitioning OFP customers with increasing their hours of work in order to enable them to qualify for the FIS payment and, subsequently, for the newly introduced BTWFD dividend.  In addition in cases where affected lone parents lose financially as a result of the reforms and are having difficulty increasing their hours, my Department will work with them to offer every possible assistance.</p>  <p>  The previous experience of the OFP reform, together with the introduction of the BWFD and the initiative of the Labour Market Council, would indicate that lone parents will have both the incentive and the opportunity to increase their hours of work, and thus to become eligible for FIS, thereby greatly enhancing their income and living conditions.</p></reply>

Over 10,000 new tenancies have been processed since the start of the year, including new claims, change of address and churn within the scheme. This level of activity shows that significant numbers of people are being accommodated under the scheme.</p>  <p>  The Department carried out a review of the maximum rent limits which found that increasing rent limits could potentially add to further rental inflation in an already distressed market, affecting not alone rent supplement recipients, but lower-income workers and students. Between rent supplement, the Rental Accommodation scheme and the new Housing Assistance Payment administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the State accounts for a third of the private rented market and is, therefore, a very significant player in the sector. The Department&rsquo;s review of rent limits points out that the main cause of difficulty for persons renting and seeking to rent is the reduced availability of affordable private rented accommodation.  In this regard, the Government will deliver significantly increased supply of social and affordable housing through the Construction 2020 Strategy and the Social Housing Strategy.</p>  <p>  Rather than a blanket increase in rent limits at this time, the Department has implemented preventative measures to provide for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework. Under this approach, the circumstances of tenants throughout the country, including those in the Meath area, are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents are being increased above prescribed limits (for both existing and new cases). The Department also works with Threshold&rsquo;s Tenancy Sustainment service in Dublin and Cork city where supply is most acute, with plans underway to extend this service to Galway city. This flexible approach has already assisted some 2,700 rent supplement households nationwide through increased rent payments.</p>  <p>  Where Departmental staff are notified of a threat of tenancy loss, the preventative measures are implemented as appropriate. The Department has also undertaken a communications campaign to encourage people at risk to avail of these measures. I am continuing to keep this matter under review to ensure that the appropriate supports continue to be provided in the light of valuable feedback received from various advocates working in the area of homelessness through engagement with Department officials and publications.</p></reply>

In addition, the Local Employment Service, which the Department contracts annually, supplements its own employment service provision and provides vocational guidance, employment supports and mediation to jobseekers and other customers.  All new jobseekers are activated within a short period of becoming unemployed. Engagement with long-term unemployed clients is also in place.</p>  <p>  The Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transition (JST) payment was introduced in July 2013 to assist lone parents back to work and towards financial independence.  Since its introduction two years ago, customers who move into this category are activated and referred to Case Officers for engagement. The objective of this engagement is to facilitate and support exploration by the customer of options open to him/her and to agree a Personal Progression Plan (PPP) outlining appropriate steps to be taken to achieve the preferred option.

Dealing with the consumer is credit servicing and the definition of credit servicing is broad. Owners of loan books who deal directly with consumers, that is, who are servicing their own loan books, will be regulated. Otherwise they can have the loan book serviced by a regulated credit servicing firm. </p>  <p>  All consumer and relevant SME loans sold by regulated financial institutions will be covered by this Act. Borrowers will therefore be restored to the protections they previously had, such as the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises. Borrowers who previously had access to the Financial Services Ombudsman will also have this right restored by this legislation.</p>  <p>  In addition, it should be noted that the transfer of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the contract. If a borrower considers that an attempt to change the terms of the contract unilaterally is being made, they should consider seeking independent legal advice. In addition or alternatively, they could make a complaint to the regulated lender or credit servicing firm as appropriate and progress to the Financial Services Ombudsman if the complaint is not resolved to their satisfaction.</p></reply>

The meetings focused on the mortgage market and specifically the comparatively high standard variable rates currently being charged by the banks.</p><p>I outlined my view, that Standard Variable Rates being charged in the Irish market are too high.  There was agreement from all lenders that customers should have access to more competitive mortgage products as per my recommendation.</p><p>The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for SVR customers. The position of home owners who are in negative equity was also discussed and assurances were sought and received that these homeowners will be able to avail of options to reduce their monthly repayments. The main banks have since announced a range of new products offering customers lower monthly mortgage repayments.</p><p>In addition to the issue of rates I also outlined the need for greater competition in the market and the need for a more active and well-resourced campaign by the individual banks. This should focus on promoting awareness of their best offering and how easy it is for customers to take up new products and switch between different institutions if they wish to avail of better rates.</p><p>In relation to switching, I understand that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is planning to provide more information to consumers to encourage switching. I expect that if financial institutions are convinced that there is a threat that they will lose these customers, they will reduce the rates that they currently charge existing customers. The CCPC website is a valuable source of information on the rates charged by various financial institutions.</p><p>The Government made a commitment in the Statement of Government priorities 2014 to 2016 to applying downward pressure on mortgage rates by increasing and supporting competition in the market and it will continue to work to fulfil that commitment.</p><p>A review of what progress has been made is now taking place. The main lenders have initiated new measures ranging from lower Standard Variable Rates to new loan to value products and fixed rate products. These new offerings could result in monthly savings for mortgage customers and I urge customers to see if there is an option available which would suit their circumstances and also save them money on their repayments. The Central Bank is also continuing to conduct research in this area following its earlier report. </p><p>As I have previously made clear, a follow up set of meetings with each of the six banks will take place in September in advance of the Budget.</p></reply>

In facilitating  the demand for commercial office space and securing potential long term tenants, NAMA's role in this regard is entirely consistent with its commercial mandate under Section 10 of the NAMA Act which requires NAMA to obtain the best financial return for the State, deal expeditiously with the assets acquired by it and to protect or otherwise enhance the value of those assets.</p><p>More generally, as is identified on NAMA's website,), NAMA ensures that its debtors and receivers are aware of any potential purchaser interest in their properties and where appropriate will facilitate engagement between the relevant parties.  </p><p>NAMA also has a policy of, wherever feasible, affording public bodies first option on the acquisition of land and property on the basis of independently assessed market value.</p></reply>

The most recent Quarter 1 2015 Report will be laid before the Oireachtas and published shortly.</p><p>Pertinent to the Deputy's question, the Chairman and Chief Executive are also accountable to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and other Oireachtas committees and to give evidence to those committees whenever required to do so.  The Deputy will, therefore, be aware that the Chairman and CEO appeared before the PAC on 9th July 2015, specifically regarding the sale of the Agency's Northern Ireland Portfolio, and welcomed the opportunity to publically state their position on record.  The recording and transcript of the Committee hearing is available on the Oireachtas website and the opening statements of both the Chair and Chief Executive are also available from the NAMA website (). </p><p>NAMA's accounts are also audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;amp;AG).  In addition, the C&amp;amp;AG has already produced three special reports on NAMA (each of which are available on both NAMA and the C&amp;amp;AG's websites) and I understand that a fourth, regarding Value for Money (VFM), is in the early stages of preparation.If there is concern about a specific aspect of NAMA's work, it is within the power of the Comptroller and Auditor General to scrutinise any aspect of it.Regarding the specific request made by the Deputy, I note that as part of its upcoming third triennial review of NAMA (s226), the C&amp;amp;AG has confirmed that it will perform a value for money review and as part of this will be looking at the Project Eagle portfolio sale to determine if NAMA did achieve best value.  The C&amp;amp;AG is best positioned to independently review this transaction and make such a determination. </p><p>Finally, as I stated in my response to Parliamentary Question No.150 on 7th July 2015, there is no suggestion that the allegations recently made in the D&aacute;il by the Deputy, and others, relate to any wrongdoing on the part of NAMA. </p><p>Taking all of the above into consideration, I do not contend that a specific inquiry into this sale process is required nor, as stated previously, is there merit in the argument that NAMA should be made more accountable.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will appreciate, decisions on sales transactions are a matter for the NAMA Board in the context of its statutory independent commercial mandate.</p><p>With respect to two particular aspects s of this transaction which have received some recent scrutiny:</p><p>- I was notified by the NAMA Chairman of the decision being taken by the NAMA Board with regard to the withdrawal of Pimco and the reasons behind this decision; and</p><p>- I also was aware that the Northern Ireland Executive sought to put a letter of intent/memorandum of understanding in place with the successful bidder to ensure the management of the portfolio post acquisition was supportive of the Northern Ireland economy.

This report was published and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 16th July 2014.</p><p>Following the completion of the report, and taking into account what NAMA has achieved to date, my officials concluded that:</p><p>- NAMA has made significant progress in achieving its overall objectives.</p><p>- Based on NAMA's performance to date and its financial projections in light of the strength of current investor interest in Ireland, NAMA is well positioned to achieve its objectives.</p><p>- As a result, NAMA's continuation is necessary to achieve these objectives.</p><p>Section 227(3) of the NAMA Act requires as soon as may be after 31 December 2012 and every 5 years after that while NAMA continues to be in existence, the Minister shall assess the extent to which NAMA has made progress toward achieving its overall objectives, and decide whether continuation of NAMA is necessary having regard to the purposes of this Act.</p><p>I would encourage those with an interest in NAMA's progress to date to read the Section 227 Report as well as the C&amp;amp;AG's special reports on NAMA and NAMA's quarterly and annual reports as they are each a rich source of information on NAMA's activity from inception.</p><p>The Departments of Finance Section 227 Report is available via the following link: <i></i></p><p>Section 227(1) also empowers the Minister to direct NAMA to report to him or her regarding progress with regard to the achievement of NAMA's purposes and requires the Minister to lay any such report, when produced, before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>To date, I have not yet deemed it necessary to apply Section 227(1) given the strong working relationship between my Department and NAMA and the many other oversight provisions contained within the NAMA Act 2009.</p><p>In accordance with Section 54, NAMA's Annual Report and Financial Statements are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.

These included the portfolio's heavy concentration in provincial and secondary property markets and the limited evidence at the time of the sale of any prospect of a sustained recovery in those markets over the medium term.  The NAMA CEO specifically stated that the asset portfolio securing NAMA loans was very granular and had few major assets which might have been of interest to purchasers if NAMA had decided to proceed to sell the assets on an asset-by-asset basis.  </p><p>Taking these factors into account, I am advised that NAMA set a reserve minimum sales price which equated to the net present value of its projected cashflows from this portfolio over the medium-term, and only agreed to sell the portfolio when that minimum price was obtained.  The portfolio sold for what it was worth at the time. </p><p>Though I am not specifically made aware of the detailed outcome of each sales process such as level of proceeds, gains or losses, as was the case with Project Eagle, I am realistic in recognising that NAMA will, in some instances, recognise a loss on the sale of some of its loans and assets.  </p><p>However, I would like to point out that losses recognised on NAMA sales stem from poor underwriting at the time these loans were issued and from the significant deterioration in property values securing these loans.  The decline in asset values prior to November 2009 was reflected in the purchase price at which NAMA acquired these loans from the banks at steep discounts to the amounts borrowed.  The further decline in asset values after November 2009 was reflected in NAMA's books through impairment provisions meaning that the amount NAMA expected to recover from these loans continued to fall with prices.  At the time of the portfolio sale a further impairment was recognised.I am informed that given the nature of the portfolio there is no reason to believe that this impairment would not have been recognised by NAMA in subsequent financial statements if it had not sold the portfolio.  The portfolio sold for what it was worth at the time.The NAMA Board believes it did achieve best value for the portfolio. </p><p>On the more general point, the Deputy will also note that NAMA is obliged to repay its senior debt.  That debt is guaranteed by the Irish Government and therefore is a contingent liability for Irish taxpayer.  During 2014 NAMA repaid &euro;9.1 billion of senior debt for which the proceeds of this portfolio made a significant contribution.  NAMA has to sell loans and assets to enable it to repay its debt and this requires the NAMA Board to make commercial decisions, based on the best available information, on the sale of loans and assets.</p><p>The Deputy will note that, to date, NAMA has redeemed &euro;19.35 billion of the &euro;30.2 billion it issued in senior debt.  The significant progress it has made in terms of senior debt redemption has been a major factor in prompting credit ratings agencies to upgrade Ireland s creditworthiness.  These upgrades have, in turn, contributed to significant reductions in Ireland's borrowing costs.  I agreed with the NAMA Board as part of my 2014 Section 227 review that NAMA would aim to repay 80 per cent of its senior debt by end 2016.</p><p>Profit or loss on loan sales is accounted for in NAMA's Annual Report and Financial Statements and Section 55 Quarterly Report and Accounts published by NAMA for the relevant period.  These reports are available from NAMA's website: </p></reply>

In the period to the end of 2013, this meant concentrating sales in Britain, particularly London, where commercial investment property yields had fallen in some cases below 3%.  Over that period, sales in Britain accounted for 73% of NAMA's total sales proceeds.</p>  <p>  In contrast, I am advised that NAMA's strategy in Ireland over that period was to limit asset disposals into the market, particularly in the period to end-2012 when prices were still trending downwards.  Reflecting this, in the period to end-2012, NAMA had disposed of less than &euro;1 billion or 5% of its Irish portfolio.  This information is set out in my Section 227 Review of NAMA, which was published in July 2014.</p>  <p>  NAMA advise me that the Agency's focus during that period was primarily on ensuring that debtor properties were efficiently managed, that rental and occupancy were optimised and that rental income was fully captured.  NAMA also sought to assist the Irish market's recovery by offering a limited number of assets for sale to test investor appetite and help bring about price discovery.  I am advised that NAMA did so in a number of cases with the benefit of NAMA vendor financing.  The interest generated by those transactions strongly pointed towards a basis for the market s ultimate recovery.  NAMA, however, waited until that recovery was fully underway before increasing the flow of assets to the Irish market.</p>  <p>  I would argue that this patient approach, which has been supportive of market recovery, is not how an agency engaged in "fire sales" would behave.  Indeed, NAMA inform me that the Agency strongly resisted attempts from opportunistic buyers looking to acquire Irish assets at what could be regarded as "fire sale" prices in 2010 and 2011, instead, as mentioned, focusing on the sale of appropriately yielding British assets in order to fund its operations, fund its investments in Irish assets to enhance their longer-term value and to retire debt. </p>  <p>  It is my experience that those who suggest that NAMA sold assets prematurely tend to draw attention to the same handful of transactions in 2011 and 2012.  Such critics ignore the fact that NAMA had to sell some assets in Ireland to help generate some level of transactional activity and seed a recovery in the Irish property market.  In addition, NAMA sold assets in order meet its end-2013 debt repayment target, a target which was monitored by the Troika.  NAMA has, since mid-2013, been able to sell substantially more assets at far more favourable pricing and, in turn, accelerate its senior debt repayments and progressively remove that contingent liability on Irish taxpayers - further enhancing our economy's recovery.</p>  <p>  The value of loans and assets as at end-2014 was, as per NAMA's Annual Report and Financial Statements for 2014, which is available on the Agency's website, &euro;13.44 billion.  I intend to publish NAMA's Quarterly Report and Accounts for the period to end-March 2015 shortly.</p></reply>

If it is received as capital it will be taxed under the Capital Gains Tax rules. </p>  <p>  In last year's Finance Act, I included provisions allowing for a measure of tax relief to the many thousands of Irish shareholders with a small shareholding in Vodafone plc who inadvertently found themselves subject to an unintended liability to income tax, PRSI and USC rather than a nil capital gains tax liability arising from a return of value payment from that company.  I did this because the shareholding of very many of those individuals arose originally from their investment in Eircom plc and, as a result of which investment, they continue to carry capital losses.  I considered, given the particular background in that case, that to leave those shareholders with income tax and other liabilities on foot of a decision they inadvertently made or did not make at all would have been inequitable.  This particular background is not a feature of the Standard Life return of value case.</p>  <p>  The fact that notifications of the options made by some individuals in the Vodafone case last year were delayed in the post beyond the deadline date in that case or were otherwise not dealt with by the company as shareholders would have wished were not factors in my decision to provide the relief, the reason for which I have outlined above.</p>  <p>  I am not in a position to say who or what is responsible for the problem that has arisen for the Irish shareholders in Standard Life plc.  While I can understand the frustration of the shareholders, I do not think it an unreasonable point to make that the State should not be required to intervene by way of changing tax legislation on each occasion that a difficulty arises resulting from the administrative arrangements put in place by commercial public limited companies for dealing with their shareholders.</p>  <p>  All that said, I will give careful consideration to the views and concerns expressed by the Deputy, as well as those of others that have been expressed to me in this matter, in the course of my preparations for the forthcoming Finance Bill.</p></reply>

For instance, in the Stability Programme Update (SPU) that was published in April the impact of alternative scenarios (such as weaker-than-assumed world growth) on the Irish economy and on the public finances was considered.</p>  <p>  In relation to the possibility of a Greek exit from the euro area, I recently met with the Governor of the Central Bank to assess the implications of such a development; in addition, the Governor of the Bank and the Head of the NTMA briefed the Economic Management Council on developments.  </p>  <p>  It is clear that our trade and investment links with Greece are relatively small; moreover, the architectural improvements in the euro area in recent years should limit the scope for contagion.  Having said that, I and my officials will monitor the situation on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the euro area Heads of State and Government (HoSG) have agreed that, subject to the Greek authorities implementing legislation in a number of policy areas over the next week or so, negotiations on an ESM programme of financial assistance can begin.  This is a positive development and it is to be hoped that the authorities legislate accordingly.  Remaining within the euro area is the best way forward for the Greek people.</p>  <p>  I am conscious of recent developments in China which, as one of the largest economies in the world, has been a key driver of global growth in recent years.  Any slowdown in the Chinese economy could dampen global demand and Ireland could not be immune from such developments.  Indeed, the  SPU analysis shows that 1 per cent reduction in world output would have a negative impact on Ireland's output of a similar magnitude, with adverse implications for the public finances. </p>  <p>  Everything else being equal, lower demand from China for various commodities would lead to a reduction in their price.</p>  <p>  To provide a buffer should future economic growth surprise on the downside, the Government will continue to implement the necessary structural reforms to increase the potential growth of the economy and continue the improvement in our fiscal position.</p></reply>

The Regulations also clearly specify the type of certification that must be produced before an exemption from LPT can be granted.

The Commissioners have assured me that all compliance activity has been put on hold to allow the person adequate time to follow up on the issue. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that I have initiated a review of the operation of LPT.  This review is being conducted by Dr Don Thornhill and is due to be presented to me no later than summer 2015.  The review will primarily have regard to recent residential property price developments, the overall yield from LPT and the desirability of achieving relative stability in LPT payments.

PIMCO named that individual as Mr Frank Cushnahan.  I am further advised that this was the first time NAMA became aware of this matter.  Mr Cushnahan was not a member of the NIAC at the time of this disclosure having resigned from that committee in October 2013. </p><p>I am advised that the NAMA Board, at a specially convened meeting on 11 March 2014, viewed PIMCO's disclosure as a very serious development.  I am further advised that, whilst the former NIAC member was no longer a member of the Committee and never had access to confidential information, the NAMA Board considered that the proposed fee arrangement could undermine the integrity of the sales process.  The NAMA Board decided that if PIMCO did not withdraw, NAMA could not permit it to remain in the sales process.  This was communicated to PIMCO on 12 March 2014.  On 13 March 2014 PIMCO informed NAMA of its decision to withdraw from the sales process.  As outlined by the NAMA Chairman at the PAC on 9th July 2015, NAMA were aware that Mr Cushnahan had the use an office in same building as Tughan's. </p><p>I am advised that NIAC members were obliged to annually declare any potential conflicts of interest to NAMA in accordance with the Ethics in Public Office Act.  </p></reply>

The NPRF was a supplementary investment fund intended to support the Exchequer when budgetary pressures increased as a result of mounting pension costs. </p><p>Section 18 of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 required the payment of a contribution equivalent to 1% of GNP from the Exchequer to the National Pensions Reserve Fund each year.  In the period from 2001 to 2009 cumulative contributions to the NPRF from the Exchequer in respect of 1% of GNP amounted to &euro;11.943 billion.  Under 2009 legislation, an additional &euro;1.416 billion was paid into the Fund in 2009 to help recapitalise AIB and BoI. In addition, &euro;993 million was received from university and certain non-commercial semi-state pension schemes in 2009 and a further &euro;1,079 million in 2010 under legislation which provided that the pension liabilities of those schemes will be met from the Exchequer.  These additional contributions were offset against future Exchequer contributions to the Fund, with the result that no contribution was required in 2011 and a partial contribution would have been required in 2012.  However an amendment to the NPRF Act, which was inserted by the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010, empowered the Minister for Finance to suspend the payment of the annual contribution, in 2012 and 2013. D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approved the suspension of Exchequer contributions in 2012 and 2013 on 7 December 2012.</p><p>Following the commencement of the relevant section of the NTMA (Amendment) Act 2014 on 22 December 2014 the assets of the NPRF became the assets of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF).  At the time of the transition to the ISIF (end 2014) the total value of the NPRF including the Directed portfolio was &euro;22.2 billion.Regardless of opinions on whether or not a restoration of the NPRF is valid it must be noted that under the provisions of the NPRF Act 2000 1% of GNP was payable from the Exchequer to the NPRF each year.  This would have meant a payment in the order of &euro;1.6 billion to the NPRF for 2014 requiring compensating fiscal adjustments elsewhere.  </p><p>While the need for the State to provide for the cost of social welfare and public service pensions has not abated, the Government decided that fostering economic activity and employment through the establishment of the ISIF was the immediate priority.  This support for economic activity and employment puts the State in a better position to meet its pension's obligations in the longer-term.  In relation to public sector pension costs, the steps this Government has taken in terms of introducing the Single Pensions Scheme will produce significant savings in the longer term. In addition, there is expected to be a significant reduction in public sector pensions following the pay and pension reductions since 2009 and the freeze in pay and pension rates until after the Haddington Road Agreement.</p><p>Further information in relation to the performance of the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) is available in the Fund's published Annual Reports which are available online on the dedicated NPRF website;<i>NPRF.ie</i></p></reply>

It is not expected that Ireland will have to refinance any of its EFSM loans before 2027.

The original EFSM maturities are reflected in the table.</p><p>***Bilateral loans were provided from the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark.</p><p>****A prepaid margin of &euro;0.53 billion was deducted from the EFSF loan of &euro;4.19 billion drawdown on 1 February 2011 giving a net liability of &euro;3.66 billion.

The pooled interest rate is a variable rate which is calculated daily and is based on the EFSF's cost of funds in managing the pool.  </p><p>- Interest payable on bilateral loans from Sweden and Denmark is also based on a variable interest rate; the 3 month Euribor interest rate.</p><p>- The interest rate on EFSM loans is based on the EFSM's cost of funds when it issues bonds to fund the loans.  Therefore the interest rate applicable on the rollovers of Ireland's existing loans will only be determined at the time the EFSM issues bonds to fund the maturity extensions.  </p><p>The fiscal forecasts in the Stability Programme Update of April 2015 covered the period 2015-2020. As part of those fiscal forecasts, projected interest costs on the EFSF, EFSM and Bilateral loans based on estimated EFSF pooled, 3 month Euribor and EFSM rollover interest rates, as provided by the NTMA, were as follows:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Estimated Interest on EFSF/EFSM/Bilateral  Loans &euro;bn</th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>1.1</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>1.3</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>1.2</td></tr></table></p><p>As all of the Bilateral loans will mature before the end of 2021, there will be no interest payable on these loans post 2021.</p></reply>

The premium may cover the tax due on the disposal and the farmer may well have received the agricultural value of the land in his or her net proceeds after disposals. This means farmers are generally able to buy agricultural land of equivalent value to the land acquired under the CPO.</p><p>The Deputy suggests a rollover relief. General rollover relief was abolished in Budget 2003. One result of rollover relief was that the Capital Gains Tax (CGT) due on an asset disposal was often never paid. While the public finances are improving, it is still the case that the yield from the various taxes, including CGT, needs to be protected.</p><p>In my Budget 2014 speech I announced that an Agri-Taxation Review would be undertaken. The review has been carried out and the report of the Review was published in the context of Budget 2015 in October last year. The Review bore Food Harvest 2020, among other things, in mind. It sets out a strategy for agri-taxation policy for the future and concluded that the three main policy objectives are:</p><p>- Increase the mobility and the productive use of land</p><p>- Assist succession</p><p>- Complement wider agriculture policies and schemes, such as supporting environmental sustainability.</p><p>The Review made policy recommendations, taking into consideration the cost of the existing agri-taxation measures that were already in existence and the need to protect the position of the public finances. Many of the recommendations made were introduced by way of the last Budget and Finance Bill process including amendments to income tax land leasing reliefs, CGT Farm Restructuring relief and CGT retirement relief. However, the Review did not recommend change to the tax treatment of land disposed under a CPO.</p><p>The Review is available at the following link: </p><p>I note the concerns of the Deputy, and of landowners who have been subject to CPO.

The valuation is not affected by any repairs or improvements made to a property or by any general increase or decrease in property prices that might occur over the course of the valuation period. </p><p>The compliance programme involves a number of different strands, including monitoring property sales through a clearance system that compares selling prices against valuations declared by the property owner on the Valuation Date. The programme also includes an online facility that allows property owners to upwardly revalue their original Valuation Band having reconsidered their original valuation as too low and pay any outstanding balance. To date over 8,000 property owners have used this facility to put their LPT affairs in order </p><p>The final strand of the programme involves monitoring the Register for properties that seem out of line with other comparable properties ('outliers'). To support this element of the programme, Revenue have developed a very sophisticated data analysis reporting tool that compares LPT Returns for properties within a geographic area. The system in effect allows Revenue staff to identify individual properties where the value returned is much lower than the average for its neighbours. LPT information available to Revenue is also linked to publicly available information such as 'Google Maps' and 'Google Instant Streetview', to further assist staff in profiling potentially non-compliant valuations. </p><p>As is the case with any tax liability, Revenue may contact the taxpayer for validation of the original valuation. If the property does not produce the required validation or if the information provided does not support the self assessed valuation, then Revenue may assess and revise the liability as appropriate. Any assessment can be appealed by the property owner to the Appeal Commissioners as provided for by Section 59 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended).</p><p>Now that LPT has settled down and is for the most part 'mainstreamed' into normal tax collection operations, Revenue is focussing on compliance activity and on ensuring that all property owners pay the correct amount of LPT. I would urge any property owners that may have significantly under-declared the value of their properties on the 1 May 2013 valuation date to immediately rectify the situation.</p><p>Finally, I am aware that Revenue has published very helpful valuation guidance on the LPT portal of its website at .</p></reply>

This group was established in February 2015 and is due to submit a report to Government shortly.</p><p>In relation to schemes under my remit, I have no plans to introduce a tax relief for child care as it could be seen to unfairly discriminate against those individuals who stay at home and look after their children. While wanting to encourage participation in the workforce, equally we cannot say to individuals who stay at home to mind children that they are making a less valuable contribution to society.</p><p>In addition, tax relief is only of benefit to those in the tax net and it is estimated that in 2014, 39% of income earners were exempt from income tax. It could also be argued that any tax relief would most likely be absorbed by child-care providers in the form of higher prices.</p><p>Having said this, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government acknowledges the continuing cost pressures on parents, particularly those with young children. In recognition of these cost pressures, a number of support measures are in place to ease the burden on working parents. These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community child-care services to enable them to charge reduced child-care fees to qualifying parents, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which provides free child-care places to qualifying Solas and VEC trainees and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for a free preschool year for children in the year before commencing primary school. Generous entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave as well as child benefit payments are also provided.</p><p>The Department of Social Protection provides financial support to families on low pay by way of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) and additionally to one-parent families through the one-parent family payment.</p><p>Furthermore, a Single Person Child Carer tax credit of &euro;1,650 is available, as well as an additional standard rate band of &euro;4,000. This credit and band is payable to any single person with a child under 18 years of age or over 18 years of age if in full time education or permanently incapacitated. The primary claimant may relinquish this credit and<b></b>the increase in the rate band to a secondary claimant with whom the child resides for not less than 100 days in the year.  To claim the Single Person Child Carer Credit a claimant must not be married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones. In considering these, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the current budgetary constraints. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

On the basis of the evidence available, it would indicate that the over-performance recorded in corporation tax receipts to end-June 2015 is a result of a combination of reasons.  These include improved trading performance across a number of sectors but with particular emphasis on the multinational sector.  In addition there has been a number of one-payments, amounting to approximately &euro;170 million.   </p>  <p>  The performance of corporation tax receipts in the first six months of 2015 has been very impressive and welcome. However, while positive preliminary tax payments suggest the outlook for the remainder of 2015 is positive, it is too early to predict whether there will be a similar strong over-performance throughout the second half of the year.  As the Deputy, will appreciate corporation tax receipts are generally skewed towards the second half of the year, with c. 40% of receipts expected in the final two months of the year.  In addition, it is important to point out that there has been significant volatility displayed in the past and a degree of caution should be used when looking at the headline performance.</p></reply>

Choices available to individuals (after taking the tax-free retirement lump sum) include the option to purchase an annuity with the remaining funds, to receive the balance of the pension funds in cash (subject to marginal rate income tax, as appropriate), to invest in an Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) or an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF), once certain conditions are met.   </p>  <p>  To deal first of all with the changes to access to AMRFs, I should explain by way of background, that under the flexible options at retirement arrangements, where an individual in a DC pension savings arrangement is under age 75 at the time of exercising the option and does not meet the guaranteed pension income requirement of &euro;12,700 per annum, that individual must place a maximum  set aside  amount of &euro;63,500 (or the remainder of the pension funds if less than &euro;63,500 after taking the retirement lump sum) in an AMRF or purchase an annuity with those funds. </p>  <p>  Any amount of remaining pension funds in excess of &euro;63,500 can be invested in an ARF with access to those funds at the owner s discretion, subject to tax, at the marginal rate.   </p>  <p>  The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that an individual without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life has a pension  nest-egg  to provide for the latter years of his/her retirement. Up to Finance Act 2014, the capital invested in an AMRF could not be accessed, except to purchase an annuity, until the AMRF owner reached age 75 (or meets the guaranteed pension income requirement before then) at which point the AMRF becomes an ARF with unrestricted access to the funds, subject to taxation. While the capital sum in an AMRF could not be accessed, as set out, any income, profits or gains accrued from the investment of the capital could, up to now, be withdrawn by the AMRF owner, subject to tax at the marginal rate.   </p>  <p>  I decided to change, from the 2015 tax year, the arrangements for AMRFs so as to allow AMRF owners voluntary, tax-liable access to a maximum of 4% of their AMRF assets each year up to the point at which the AMRF becomes an ARF. This change provides AMRF owners with access to a definitive and certain level of income from their AMRF rather than the uncertain level of income which access to the accrued income, profits and gains in the AMRF provided.   </p>  <p>  Under the previous access arrangements for AMRFs, the extent of any income, profit or gains would depend on the performance of the investment options taken and could, therefore, be highly volatile with the possibility of little or no gains accruing in certain years. In addition, the scale of the capital allowed for in an AMRF, at &euro;63,500, would not always permit for investment returns of any significant scale to be made using a prudent investment policy.   </p>  <p>  The change allowing access to a specified percentage of the capital in an AMRF is primarily aimed at those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds and who, while not wishing to purchase a pension annuity with those funds, may require access to a portion of these funds to provide a more certain form of supplementary pension income prior to reaching age 75. This facility also ensures that an individual will have some remaining funds in the AMRF at age 75 to provide for their remaining years, assuming the individual has not purchased a pension annuity in the meantime.   </p>  <p>  Individuals whose AMRF represents a less significant part of their retirement funds and whose circumstances would allow for greater investment risk and, therefore, potentially greater investment returns will be limited to the 4% level of asset draw down. However, this draw down will also be available to them for periods when their AMRF investments make losses or returns of less than 4% of the value of their AMRF assets and where, under the previous arrangement, they would not have been able to make a draw down or the draw down would have been of a lesser value than will now be permitted.   </p>  <p>  Finally, in this regard, it is open to the owner of an AMRF at any time to use some or all of the capital in an AMRF to purchase a pension annuity.   </p>  <p>  As to changes in legislation relating to AMRFs over the past 3 years, there have been a number of changes made in this period relating to the ARF option of which AMRFs form part.   </p>  <p>  Budget and Finance Act 2012 increased the annual imputed distribution applying to ARFs from 5% to 6% in respect of ARFs with asset values in excess of &euro;2 million while also extending the imputed distribution arrangements to vested Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (i.e. PRSAs where benefits have commenced.   </p>  <p>  Finance Act 2014 reduced the annual imputed distribution rate from 5% to 4% for ARF owners in the age group 60 to 70 years whose ARFs have assets of &euro;2 million or under. This change was introduced in order to reduce the risk that individuals in that age group might outlive the funds in their ARFs.   </p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2013, I rescinded the Finance Act 2011 changes to the specified or guaranteed pension income requirement for ARF access which had increased that income requirement from &euro;12,700 to a variable limit based on 1.5 times the State Pension (Contributory) which amounted to &euro;18,000 per annum. At the same time, I also rescinded the Finance Act 2011 change which increased the maximum  set aside  amount required to be invested in an AMRF from &euro;63,500 of the remaining pension fund (after taking the permissible tax-free lump sum) to a variable amount equal to 10 times the annual State Pension (Contributory) rounded to the nearest &euro;100 which amounted to &euro;119,800 or the remainder of the pension fund if less than this increased amount.   </p>  <p>  I re-introduced the original specified income requirement and maximum AMRF set-aside amount on the grounds, among other reasons, that without an appropriate transition period the 2011 Finance Act changes would detrimentally affect the plans of many individuals preparing for retirement over the medium term. The intention at the time of Finance Act 2013 was that the 2011 changes would be re-introduced in 2016. This matter is being examined in the context of the preparations for Finance Bill 2015 taking account of developments since 2013 and the current situation.</p></reply>

However, the pension levels paid to former office holders are based on their salaries at the point of departure agreed and implemented by previous Governments. The Courts view pensions as vested property rights. As Minister, I am required to work within the constitutional and statutory legal framework under which all Irish Governments operate.</p>  <p>  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Acts, including the FEMPI 2010 Act which imposed the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) on public servants in receipt of public service pensions, owe their constitutional legitimacy to the presence of an overriding public interest, in this case the fiscal crisis, and because they are very general in application, fair and proportionate.  </p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for the reductions in pensions applicable to former members and office holders of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Deputy will be aware that this Government in 2012 increased the PSPR applied to that amount of pension in excess of &euro;100,000 from the 12% enacted by the previous administration to 20%, and further increased it to 28% under the 2013 Act,  for those who have retired before March 2012. Under the recently announced proposals for the reduction of PSPR this 28% rate continues to apply.</p>  <p>  However, I am advised that this legislation cannot selectively penalise a particular cohort of public service pensioners. Accordingly, all public service pensioners will be  subject to the reduction in lower rates but I have ensured that the proposals I made to Government to reduce the impact of PSPR will significantly favour low paid public service pensioners.  Effectively the most any public service pensioner can benefit irrespective of pension is capped at &euro;400, &euro;500 and &euro;780 in each of the years to 2018. </p>  <p>  In 2014 payments totalling &euro;3,654,941.48 in respect of Officeholders pensions were paid to 119 former Ministers. A 10% reduction in this figure would potentially realise savings of &euro;365,494.15 in a full calendar year.  As noted above however, any legislation to implement such a reduction effectively would have to meet the legal constitutional requirements set out above. </p></reply>

Upon the dissolution of the body corporate, such property becomes State property. The effect of Section 28 is that the Minister does not hold the assets of dissolved companies as beneficial owner. He holds them in trust. The title which the Minister acquires under this Section has been described as a defeasible title since, if the dissolved company is restored to the Register of Companies within twenty years of the date of its dissolution, its property is automatically restored to it. The State Property Act also includes, in Section 31, a power for the Minister to waive the interest acquired under Section 28 of the Act.  The relevant functions under the State Property Act transferred in 2011 to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p>  <p>  It is understood that the property which is the subject of the current question was held within a company which was struck off the Register of Companies in September, 1972 for failure to file annual returns with the Companies Office. The beneficial owner of the property applied to the Department of Finance for a waiver of the interest acquired by the Minister for Finance under the provisions of the State Property Act and that waiver, in respect of which the consideration was &pound;160, was completed in October, 1986. The effect of the waiver, which was not a sale by the State, would have been to allow the beneficial owner to complete the process of assembling a satisfactory title. The waiver itself would have formed only a limited element in the establishment of that title and the transaction was a normal exercise of Departmental functions.  The price which the beneficial owner may have secured in a subsequent sale was not a matter for consideration in the context of the waiver and, accordingly, would not merit enquiry by me at this juncture.   This issue has been the subject of previous voluminous correspondence and I understand that the Office of the Chief State Solicitor wrote to an individual in 2013 concerning the transaction which set out the legal position.</p>  <p>  I am advised that all applications for waiver of property falling within the scope of Section 28 of the State Property Act are referred to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor for legal advice and that any policy issues that may arise in particular cases are given full consideration on their merits.</p></reply>

This includes time spent by the FOI body determining whether it holds the information requested; locating the information or documents containing the information; retrieving such information or documents; extracting the information from files, documents, electronic or other information sources containing both it and other material not relevant to the request; and preparing a schedule specifying the records for consideration for release.  There is of course an onus on requesters to ensure that their requests contain sufficient particulars in relation to the information sought to enable the records sought to be identified by the taking of reasonable steps.  </p>  <p>  My Department's attention has not been drawn to any specific problems for FOI users relating to the new reformed FOI fees regime.  Indeed, the change in fees has been received favourably by requesters.  If the Deputy has been made aware of problems in this area and if she provides me with details of same, I will ask my officials to examine the matter and I can advise the Deputy of the outcome.</p>  <p>  In relation to use of exemptions under the Act to redact material, I provided a new section 11(3) in the Act which sets out that in performing functions under the Act, FOI bodies must have regard to the need to achieve greater openness in the activities of FOI bodies and to promote adherence by them to the principles of transparency in government and public affairs; and the need to strengthen the accountability and improve the quality of decision-making of FOI bodies.  </p>  <p>  That said, each request is dealt with on a case-by-case basis and there are specific exemptions set out in the Act which each FOI body will assess to see if they are relevant or applicable.  I have no role in reviewing the decisions made under the Act.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Act provides the requester with recourse to appeal internally if he/she is not satisfied with the initial decision.  Once a decision on Internal Review has been received by the requester, he/she may appeal to the Information Commissioner if he/she is dissatisfied with that decision. </p>  <p>  As regards the provision of guidance, the FOI Central Policy Unit (CPU) in my Department has responsibility for formulating policy and issuing guidance in relation to FOI matters.  The publication of the Code of Practice for FOI is a positive step in that it promotes best practice in the operation of FOI and seeks to bring about greater efficiency and consistency throughout public bodies in dealing with FOI requests.  </p>  <p>  The FOI CPU website has been redeveloped and is an important resource for public bodies and the general public.  In addition to the provision of manuals on the processing of requests, the CPU has issued notices on a range of topics, including on the application of search, retrieval and copying charges.  Such Notices also provide practical guidance on how to process requests and how the various exemptions should be interpreted and used by the decision maker.  This information is all available on the FOI website.  In addition, the CPU, in conjunction with the Office of Government Procurement, has also put in place a single FOI Training Framework which provides a panel of trainers from which FOI bodies can procure quality-assured training in a consistent and cost-effective manner and which covers all aspects of processing requests.  </p>  <p>  Finally, work is almost completed on the development of a model publication scheme for FOI which I propose to make this year.  Publication Schemes will bring about more proactive publication of information by public bodies.  </p>  <p>  I believe that, taken together, the new FOI Act, the new fees regime, the publication schemes once in place and other transparency initiatives including the Open Data Initiative and other Open Government Partnership (OGP) actions currently being implemented, represent a fair and equitable balance between maximising the level of access to information for citizens while maintaining the ability of public bodies to deliver services, including FOI services, in an efficient and effective manner.</p></reply>

The Scheme of the proposed Bill deals with the rights of consumers and the obligations of traders in contracts for the supply of goods, digital content and services.  Under Irish law, the enforcement of contractual rights has been, and will remain, a matter primarily for the parties to the contract.  That is why it is important that the rights of consumers and the remedies available to them if those rights are breached are set out in a manner that is clear and comprehensible.  Though the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission cannot act directly on behalf of individual consumers in contractual disputes, it has an important public enforcement role in ensuring that traders do not apply contract terms which contravene the provisions of consumer legislation or engage in practices contrary to this legislation.  In the case of a contract for the supply of goods, such as for petrol or diesel, the Scheme provides that the consumer would, among other remedies, have a right within a period of 30 days after the supply of the goods to terminate a contract and receive a full refund of the price where goods are not in conformity with the specified quality and other requirements.  The statutory remedies provided for in the Scheme are expressly said to be without prejudice to the right of the consumer to pursue other remedies, in particular damages.  Under section 74 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007, a consumer aggrieved by a misleading or other practice prohibited by the Act has a separate right of action for damages, including exemplary damages, against a trader who commits or engages in a misleading or other prohibited practice.  Where a trader is convicted of an offence under the Act, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission may, on behalf of an aggrieved consumer, also apply to the court for a compensation order requiring the trader to pay the consumer an amount of money that the court considers appropriate in respect of any loss or damage to the consumer resulting from the offence.</p></reply>

I intend to publish the report for the period 30<sup>th</sup>June 2015, once this report has been finalised.  As a result of the review of the Credit Guarantee Scheme a new Credit Guarantee Scheme 2015 has now been made in accordance with the terms of the Credit Guarantee Act 2012 which will allow guarantees for refinancing loans where an SME's bank has exited or is exiting the Irish SME market.  This new Scheme will also increase the maximum length of guarantees under the Credit Guarantee Scheme from 3 years to 7 years. </p><p>To bring this Scheme into operation there are a number of steps to conclude with the participating banks including certification, approval and legal agreements.  These processes are currently being completed and it is hoped that the new Scheme will be operational in the very near future.</p><p>In addition, my Department is currently working on amending the primary legislation and once this is completed I will introduce a new Credit Guarantee Scheme, which will include the following improvements: a wider range of financial products to be covered not just traditional credit products, an increase in the level of guarantee on individual loans from 75% to the maximum permissible under State Aid rules of 80%, an increase in the portfolio cap and the removal of the annual portfolio cap.  The technical and legal amendments to the legislation are complex and my Department is working very closely with the Parliamentary Draftsman and the Office of the Attorney General to address these complexities and facilitate the introduction of the revised legislation at an early date.</p></reply>

The scheme aims to encourage the development of online engagement by Irish small businesses through the adoption of digital services or skills and the target is to get 2,000 small businesses trading online by end 2015 thereby reaching new markets, growing their business, employing more people and exporting more.<font color="#FF0000">  </font>By 1<sup>st</sup>July 2015 1,000 vouchers had been provided.</p><p>The TOVS targets traditional small businesses (with less than 10 employees) that have been trading for at least 12 months and who are not yet trading online or doing so in a very limited way.  In addition to awarding vouchers of up to &euro;2,500 each to successful applicant businesses, LEOs provide the key ingredients of training, mentoring and networking support to enable small businesses to move online. An information session, organised by the LEO, forms an important part of the application process for a trading online voucher.  It provides support to prospective applicants who have little knowledge of the internet or its potential to help them access new markets and create jobs.

There is a growing tendency worldwide for companies to outsource certain business functions and companies in Ireland are part of this trend.  Companies in all sectors utilise the practice to enhance productivity, utilise their resources better, focus on more core business areas and to be able to tap into new technologies without in-house expertise. </p>  <p>   Such Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) is a fast growing economic sector and one which represents an exciting opportunity.  It would be very short-sighted not to recognise that this sector should be pursued to assist job creation in Ireland and, indeed, thereby avoid outsourced jobs moving to other countries, given that modern technologies make this easily achievable in most cases.</p>  <p>  We have several very successful companies in this sector located in Ireland, both foreign owned and Irish owned, pursuing contracts at home and abroad.  Some of these companies are supported by either IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland.  These companies have gained a significant portion of this market and they provide several thousand valuable jobs, often in regional centres where other employment opportunities are not readily available.  Whenever such contracts are available it is obviously in our national interest that companies based here should pursue opportunities and compete for this work.</p></reply>

The Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation, through Enterprise Ireland, is active both in assisting Irish indigenous companies to find new markets and to increase their existing level of market share.  At the heart of our jobs plan is supporting more exports, and we have put in place a range of measures to deliver on this, including doubling the number of trade missions, placing extra staff for Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland in overseas markets and tax incentives for firms to place more staff overseas to help win sales.</p>  <p>  The CSO Balance of Payments statistics do not separately identify Irish indigenous enterprises, but their data for services exports for Irish and non-Irish enterprises shows these to have increased steadily annually, except for a slight slow-down in 2008 and 2009.

The 10<sup>th</sup>round is being held this week (13 &ndash; 17 July) in Brussels.  The objective during these rounds is to make as much progress as possible in all areas of the negotiations.  During the last Round, work advanced in all three pillars of the negotiations: market access, regulatory cooperation and rules.  On market access, the discussions were technical, aimed at better understanding the respective tariff offers and issues around government procurement.  Regulatory issues took up a lot of the time, with a focus on both horizontal co-operation as well as the 9 specific sectors [cars, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, cosmetics, engineering, textiles, chemicals, pesticides, ICT].  The regulatory discussions are aimed at enhancing transatlantic trade by reinforcing regulatory co-operation in areas of shared interest and cutting out overlapping, unnecessary red-tape.  The discussions in the area of rules included sustainable development, and energy and raw materials.  Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) were also discussed in the last Round, specifically, how SMEs might benefit from a new free trade deal.  A Report released by the EU Commission on 20 April, which identifies perceived obstacles to trade for SMEs, will inform the EU approach in this area.  The definitive time-frame is difficult to predict but it is expected that there will be substantial progress in these negotiations in 2015.  According to assessments made by the EU Commission, a comprehensive free trade deal could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% bringing significant economic gains as a whole for the EU.  This converts into 400,000 jobs across the EU. An independent study commissioned by my Department, carried out by Copenhagen Economics, estimates that these benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole. It suggests a boost to GDP of 1.1%, growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1.5%, and an increase in real wages of 1.5%. It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs. </p><p>It also suggests that Irish SMEs will be particular beneficiaries.  Many of these are part of European supply chains where their exports to the UK, Germany or elsewhere to the EU, feed into Europe&rsquo;s exports to the U.S.  Ireland&rsquo;s approach to negotiations will be informed by the analysis from Copenhagen Economics.  We will seek to have opportunities created in the agreement where we have clear strengths, and we will seek defend our interests where we have sensitivities.</p><p>As an economy that lives and grows by the freedom to trade, we have first-hand experience of how trade liberalisation has continually shaped and reshaped our economy.  The Copenhagen Economics study should also inform our policy responses as a result of TTIP.  Some of these may arise from sector impacts that have been identified in the Copenhagen Economics study.  We have used openness to trade in the past, and will continue to use it, as an instrument for structural reform, modernisation and development, creating new opportunities for innovation and stronger productivity growth with higher skilled jobs throughout the economy.</p></reply>

The Ecorys 2009 study addresses the technically and analytically complex task of calculating the impact of non-tariff barriers in transatlantic trade.  Non-tariff barriers include licences, standards, administrative rules or other measures that make it difficult or impossible for firms to sell into new markets.  The aim of the EU US free trade agreement is to break down as many non-tariff barriers as possible.  The Ecorys study presents a detailed qualitative and quantitative estimate of these NTBs using a multi-faceted methodology combining literature reviews, business surveys, econometric analyses, consultation with regulators businesses and sector experts.  This was also used by the European Commission&rsquo;s assessment of the likely benefits of a new free trade agreement between the EU and US which was conducted by the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR).</p>  <p>  The study commissioned by my Department on the impact of a new deal in Ireland was prepared by Copenhagen Economics who are independent and renowned external experts in this field.  The study is based on the best available techniques of economic modelling and uses the same model and methodology as the CEPR study, to facilitate direct comparison. </p>  <p>  The CEPR and Copenhagen Economics studies use a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to simulate the impact of TTIP.  These are standard tools for trade economists that create a computerised simulation of the world economy and model what happens when changes are introduced.</p>  <p>  The CGE model is state-of-the-art. It needs to make assumptions about the economy in order to work but these are as reasonable as possible to make it as close to the real world as possible.  For instance, it is able to account for the effects of economies of scale, different skill-levels of employees, imperfect competition between companies and many other features of the real world economy. </p>  <p>  Like any model, the CGE model has limitations.  The figures are an indication of the economic effects rather than precise predictions of exactly what will happen. But the model is not able to take all effects on productivity into account, for example, nor the positive effects on foreign investment by multinational firms, which is very significant for international trade in services in particular.  This suggests that the estimated benefits of an Agreement are conservative.</p>  <p>  Alternatives to the CGE approach may have their merits but none has yet proven to be sufficiently reliable for an ex-ante analysis of economy-wide effects of trade policy changes.</p></reply>

Central to these has been the moratorium on recruitment to the public sector and the Employment Control Framework (ECF) mechanism administered centrally by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) which placed challenging staff reduction targets for all public sector bodies. Accordingly, recruitment of new staff has been at a minimum and therefore, notwithstanding ongoing retirements, the average staff age figure has increased over the period in question. </p><p>In the Budget of October 2014 the Government announced the ending of the moratorium on recruitment.

This is to avoid causing any cashflow issues for farmers at the year end. However my Department would not have any details of the numbers or amounts involved because they are a matter between the milk purchaser and its suppliers. My understanding is that some purchasers are making arrangements with suppliers who are availing of the recently announced super levy instalment scheme to refund monies collected which are over and above the value of the agreed first instalment payment but again this is a matter solely between both parties.</p>  <p>  The milk purchasers are currently processing and completing the applications in respect of their suppliers who wish to avail of the scheme and tomorrow, Wednesday 15 July has been set as the deadline for the return of these application forms to my Department.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-14a.808.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015071400081#WRT00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 382, 418 and 419 together.</p><p>My Department is responsible for the regulatory (licensing) system for pesticide products in Ireland. This system is entirely based on European legislation and is designed to ensure a very high level of protection for humans and the environment.</p><p>As part of the product authorisation system under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 <b>concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market</b>, risk assessments are carried out to ensure that: </p><p>a) there are no harmful effects for spray operatives, workers, bystanders or consumers,</p><p>b) there are no unacceptable risks to non-target species (e.g. birds, fish, wild mammals, bees or other insects, earthworms and soil macro- and micro-organisms), </p><p>c) surface and ground waters are protected. </p><p>Consequently, only products that can be used safely, without any unacceptable risks to humans or the environment are authorised for use.</p><p>In addition, Directive 128/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 <b>establishing a framework for Community action to achieve the sustainable use of pesticides, </b>aims to reduce the risks associated with pesticide use. This Directive enhances the high level of protection achieved through the product approval system and places obligations on users, advisors and distributors to be trained and requires equipment to be tested at regular intervals. The Directive also prohibits the aerial spraying of pesticides, requires a more restrictive approach to applying pesticides in certain vulnerable areas and makes the application of integrated pest management a legal requirement.</p><p>In addition it requires each Member State to derive and implement a National Action Plan to achieve a more sustainable use of pesticides.</p><p>A screening monitoring programme in 2005-2006 looked for Cypermethrin at targeted sites but did not result in any detections. My Department is not aware of any subsequent detections.</p><p>The licensing system, involves the evaluation of data and the assessment of risks, to ensure that there are no harmful effects for spray operators, workers, bystanders or consumers. In addition, risk assessments are also carried out to ensure that there are no unacceptable impacts on non-target species such as birds, fish, wild mammals, bees or other insects. Additionally, risk assessments are undertaken to ensure that surface and ground waters are protected to the highest level possible.</p><p>A plant protection product is not approved unless it has been proven that it can be used in a particular use scenario without undue risks to non-targets. Therefore, when used in a proper way (dipping and individual application, i.e. no indiscriminate broadcast application), it is not expected to result in widespread deleterious effects to non-target organisms. </p><p>The system I have just outlined is similar to that which exists in all EU Member States. During the assessment, each Member State, including Ireland, takes local conditions, such as climate and pest pressure, into account.</p><p>Cypermethrin is used to control the large pine weevil <i>Hylobius abietis</i>which can be a devastating pest in replanted conifer sites. It is predominantly used as a dipping treatment where plants are allowed to dry before being transplanted in the field. No effects on non-target organisms are envisaged using this method. It can also be applied to individual plants if infestation of <i>Hylobius spp.</i>recurs in year 2 by placing a nozzle on the top of the saplings growing point and administering a dose by pressing a trigger. There is no spray or overall application. Thus exposure of non-target organisms is minimised as much as is practicable.</p><p>Cypermethrin is included in the Environmental Protection Agency's Water Framework Directive groundwater quality monitoring programme as an operational monitoring parameter. My Department is not aware of any impact studies in Ireland into the effects of Cypermethrin on the woodland bio-diversity.</p><p>My Department has been involved in research for alternative control mechanisms and some certainly offer some promise. Currently, my Department is supporting a research project, called Multi-agent control options for pine weevil. The aim of the project, building on previous research, is to investigate the potential of entomopathogenic (insect-killing) fungi (EPF) alone and in combination with nematodes, for weevil population suppression.</p><p>In relation to Coillte&rsquo;s use of the pesticide, the company has advised me that Coillte has signed up to the Forest Stewardship Council&rsquo;s&reg; (FSC&reg;) forest certification scheme, a voluntary international forest certification scheme since 2001 and that, under this forest certification scheme, cypermethrin is classed as &lsquo;highly hazardous&rsquo; and can only be used in FSC-certified woodlands under a derogation from FSC International. Coillte further advised that there is currently no effective treatment available to control this pest which can cause significant damage to young trees other than using cypermethrin. Coillte state that it currently has specific controls to minimise use, consider non-pesticide management options and trials for practicable alternatives to the use of cypermethrin but added that, until a suitable alternative is available cypermethrin is the only option available to control large pine weevil.</p><p>The company also advised that the FSC&reg; cypermethrin derogation is currently up for renewal and that Coillte therefore has applied to FSC International for its continued use in Coillte&rsquo;s forests. Coillte added that a consultation process has just been completed with stakeholders on the derogation for continued use of cypermethrin.</p><p>Coillte advise me that it fulfils its legal obligations and ensures that both staff and contractors engaged in the manual application of cypermethrin are fully trained and certified and that all pesticides are applied according to Environmental &amp;amp; Health and Safety guidelines. In relation to the specific query about water testing, Coillte advise me that it is not obliged to conduct water testing for the impacts on the environment but, to address stakeholder concerns, it conducted a water testing exercise on one site resulting in no cypermethrin being detected in any of the samples taken.</p></reply>

My Department sought information from Bord na gCon in relation to a number of these issues, including in relation to a review of an incident at Dundalk Racecourse, which is published on its website.</p><p><b>On the question of Artificial Insemination, </b>detailed rules governing the practice of the artificial insemination of greyhounds were set down in the Artificial Insemination of Greyhounds Regulations, 2005, (S.I. No. 561 of 2005), which were made by BNG under Section 39 of the Act. The Regulations included a two year limit on the use of semen for artificial insemination following the death of a stud dog, thereafter any unused semen had to be destroyed.</p><p>In March 2014, Bord na gCon invited industry stakeholders to submit proposals regarding the suitability of the Artificial Insemination of Greyhounds Regulations 2005 in the context of meeting current industry requirements. </p><p>After a detailed consideration of submissions received, Bord na gCon decided in September 2014, having consulted with the ICC, to remove the two year limit on the use of semen following the death of a stud greyhound. Arising from this decision, and with the consent of the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, new regulations were introduced by Bord na gCon which came into effect on 1 November 2014 removing this two year limit on semen from an expired sire. </p><p>I am informed by Bord na gCon that in conjunction with the Irish Coursing Club they have carried out preliminary research and discussions with various experts in the areas of Quantitative Genetics, Animal &amp;amp; Bioscience Research and Canine Genetics on the specific aspects such as:</p><p>- Pedigree analysis of inbreeding levels and rate of accumulation of inbreeding in the Irish Greyhound</p><p>- Developing a breeding program to ensure long term gains while simultaneously managing genetic diversity</p><p>- The impact on the age of semen or age of semen donor on gene mutation rate.</p><p>Following on from this, I understand that Bord na gCon have commissioned a scientific study dealing with topics outlined above with a view to assisting the Board in relation to policy development in this area.</p><p>I should also say that at the time of receipt of the letter referred to, I had already commissioned a review by Indecon International Consultants into finance, regulatory, governance and welfare issues relating to Bord na gCon, and that process involved a <b>stakeholder consultation process that sought and collected submissions from interested parties.

The ICC is subject to the general control and direction of Bord na gCon (BnG) under Section 26 (2) of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958 (the Act). BnG is the statutory body with responsibility for the improvement and development of the greyhound industry, greyhound racing and coursing.</p>  <p>  Detailed rules governing the practice of the artificial insemination of greyhounds were set down in the Artificial Insemination of Greyhounds Regulations, 2005, (S.I. No. 561 of 2005), which were made by BnG under Section 39 of the Act.</p>  <p>  The Regulations included a two year limit on the use of semen for artificial insemination following the death of a stud dog and thereafter any unused semen had to be destroyed.</p>  <p>  My Department was informed by BnG in early 2013 that procedural issues had arisen in relation to the registration of greyhounds conceived following artificial insemination which were at variance with the provisions set down in the 2005 Regulations referred to above.</p>  <p>  As a result of the operational difficulties in the implementation of certain provisions of the aforementioned Regulations, BnG invited industry stakeholders in March 2014 to submit proposals regarding the suitability of these Regulations in the context of meeting industry requirements.  Having discussed the situation at a meeting on 18 September 2014, the Board of BnG after consultation with the ICC, decided to remove the two-year time limit on the use of semen for artificial insemination following the death of a stud dog.</p>  <p>  Following that consultation and with my consent, as is required under section 39 of the 1958 Act, the Artificial Insemination of Greyhounds (Amendment) Regulations 2014 were introduced by BnG and came into effect on 1 November 2014, thus removing the two-year time limit on the use of semen for artificial insemination following the death of a stud dog.  These regulations did not have retrospective effect.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Board has decided to commission a scientific study in order to inform any decision as to what time limit, if any, should be applied in the future to the use of semen in AI after the death of a stud sire. In this regard, but prior to commissioning the study BnG and the ICC have carried out preliminary research and discussions with various experts in the areas of Quantitative Genetics, Animal &amp;amp; Bioscience Research and Canine Genetics on specific aspects of interest to the proposed AI study, such as:</p>  <p>  - Pedigree analysis of inbreeding levels and rate of accumulation of inbreeding in the Irish Greyhound</p>  <p>  - Developing a breeding program to ensure long term gains while simultaneously managing genetic diversity</p>  <p>  - The impact on the age of semen or age of semen donor on gene mutation rate.</p>  <p>  I am informed by BnG that the scientific study referred to above will provide relevant information to assist the Board with regard to further development of policy in this area.</p>  <p>  In relation to the studbook, I have received assurances from the ICC that sire and dam and resulting off spring are all verifiable and all details registered in the stud book are correct.</p></reply>

Earlier this year, my Department wrote to farmers who had retained PI animals stating that it was expected that some movement controls aimed at protecting the vast majority of clear herds would be introduced in the course of 2015.  In June 2015, Restriction Notices were sent to almost 400 farmers who were retaining PI animals born before 1st January 2014.  My Department is currently issuing Restriction Notices to farmers retaining PI animals born in 2014. Restriction notices will also be issued at a later date to herdowners who are retaining PI animals born in 2015.    </p>  <p>  Research has shown that the eradication of BVD will benefit the agricultural sector to the tune of &euro;102m per annum and that the "pay-back" period for dairy farmers is 6 months, and 12 months for suckler farmers.  The financial support available to farmers who dispose of their PI calves in a timely manner is focused on suckler herds and heifer calves in dairy herds.  My Department has been in contact with the herdowner concerned by telephone several times and also by visits to the farm with a view to resolving the issue.</p></reply>

As a consequence such farmers cannot be considered as having received a direct payment in 2013 and do not hold an automatic right to participate in the Basic Payment Scheme.  However up to now such farmers were considered as holding entitlements and consequently were also excluded from the scope of the Scottish Derogation.  Further to discussions with the EU Commission, Ireland obtained agreement that persons who were entitled to receive a payment of less than &euro;100 in 2013 may be considered as fulfilling the same conditions as farmers who fall within the scope of the Scottish Derogation.   </p>  <p>  To ensure compatibility with the Scottish Derogation, only persons who held entitlements with a value of less than &euro;100 for every year of the Single Payment Scheme will be considered as eligible.  Persons who transferred out entitlements of a value greater than &euro;100 at any time during the Single Payment Scheme will not be included in this exemption. </p>  <p>  All other terms and conditions of the standard Scottish Derogation apply including the requirement for applicants to produce verifiable evidence that in 2013 they 'produced, reared or grew agricultural products through harvesting, milking, breeding animals and keeping animals for farming purposes'.

Financial instruments can take the form of loans, guarantee funds or equity investments.  The funding for any such financial instruments would have to draw on our existing RDP allocation of European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development funding as well as National Exchequer funding.  It is also possible to incorporate funding from other sources in rolling out such instruments.</p><p>In our RDP, we have made a commitment to examining the potential for the use of financial instruments.  However, the inclusion of financial instruments by way of a modification to the RDP is required by EU regulation to be based on an <i>ex ante</i>evaluation which must assess:</p><p>- The existence of a market failure;</p><p>- The potential for added value;</p><p>- The resources required to implement a proposed financial instrument; and</p><p>- The proposed strategic approach to financial instruments.</p><p>Accordingly, I have asked officials in my Department to engage with the European Commission, the EIB and other stakeholders in order to identify areas where financial instruments could be implemented to best strategic effect, and to explore the practical steps which are required in order to implement financial instruments.  Any such financial instruments are required by EU regulation to be structured on a clear investment strategy which identifies real market failures and economic needs.</p><p>In addition to this, my Department has been exploring new and more competitive sources of funding and will continue to do so in the context of evolving market requirements.  For example, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, which includes the European Investment Bank as one of its funding partners, has recently announced a new 'Agriculture Investment Loans' product.  This credit is available at favourable terms for investments by agricultural SMEs involved in primary agricultural production, the processing of agricultural products or the marketing of agricultural products.</p></reply>

During this inspection, it became apparent that the servicing and repair of the aircraft would have involved a significantly higher level of investment than was anticipated.  Given the number of flying hours achieved and the age of the aircraft it was decided that all work on the aircraft should cease, the servicing and repair of the aircraft would not be completed, the aircraft was to be withdrawn from operational service in the Air Corps and the aircraft would not be returned back to Ireland. </p>  <p>  The aircraft, which was on the Irish military register, was not in a saleable position.  In order to put the aircraft in a saleable position by tender, public auction or otherwise would have required the demilitarisation of the aircraft, the transfer of the aircraft to the civil register and the re-registration of the aircraft which would have been reliant on the completion of a full aircraft inspection and the completion of significant repairs to the aircraft.  This would have required major expenditure by the Department of Defence with no certainty at that stage that a buyer for the aircraft would be found.   </p>  <p>  With the assistance of Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation and over a period of some months, the Department eventually concluded the sale of the aircraft on an "as seen" basis with a US based company, Journey Aviation based in Florida, USA in December 2014 for US $500,000.  The formal transfer of ownership of the aircraft was completed in mid January 2015 on receipt of payment. </p>  <p>  The Ministerial Air Transport Service (MATS) is currently being provided by the Learjet 45 aircraft.  An interdepartmental MATS Review Group has been established to examine options for the future provision of a service that will continue to provide the President, members of the Government and accompanying officials with an independent means of international air transport.  When the Group has completed its deliberations and made its recommendations, I will bring a Report to Government with recommendations on how best to provide a MATS service into the future. </p></reply>

Assistance to persons in distress at sea is being provided in accordance with the applicable provisions of international conventions governing search and rescue situations.  Co-ordination of search and rescue efforts and the provision of humanitarian assistance is being achieved through close co-operation with the relevant Italian authorities.  The <i>LE Eithne</i>, which has completed its deployment, and is <i>en route</i>back to Ireland, was involved in 22 rescue operations resulting in the rescue of 3,377 migrants.  Details regarding the countries of origin of the migrants rescued by the <i>LE Eithne</i>are listed in the tabular statement below. These figures have been compiled on the basis of information provided by the rescued persons themselves and have not been corroborated by documentation or any other authority.  The<i>LE  Niamh</i>has now deployed to the Mediterranean to continue Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the humanitarian search and rescue mission.  The <i>LE Niamh</i>will be deployed on the high seas in international waters between Sicily and Libya, which is where most migrant activity and search and rescue incidents have occurred. </p><p>  Following their rescue, once on board the Irish naval vessel, migrants are screened by medics.  The predominant ailments were those associated with sun burn and dehydration.  Other migrants received treatment for fractures and chemical burns.

Responsibility for the Armed Forces of Malta falls within the responsibility of Minister Abela.  The dinner was also attended by the Maltese Minister for Justice, Culture and Local Government, Mr. Owen Bonnici, the Minister for Social Dialogue, Consumer Affairs and Civil Liberties, Dr. Helena Dalli, the Permanent Secretary at the Ministry for Home Affairs and National Security, Mr. Kevin Mahoney, the Chief of Staff at the Ministry for Home Affairs and National Security, Mr. Anthony Vella Gregory and the Commander of the Armed Forces of Malta, Brigadier Jeffrey Curmi. </p><p>The primary focus of the discussion at the working dinner was the broad context of the migrant crisis, from causes through to the comprehensive response being pursued by the international community.  Discussion also ranged across issues of mutual interest within the areas of responsibility of all six Ministers.</p><p>On 7 July, a bilateral meeting took place between myself and Minister Abela on board the <i>LE Eithne</i>.  In addition to reviewing the response to the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean and the contribution of the mission of the <i>LE Eithne</i>, the meeting addressed issues of mutual interest and practical bilateral cooperation in Defence matters between Ireland and Malta.</p><p>Minister Abela expressed his country's appreciation of the transfer of the <i>LE Aoife</i>to the Armed Forces of Malta by the Irish Defence Forces last month.  Minister Abela said the ship will be useful in supporting Malta's work in border security and the migration crisis affecting the Central Mediterranean.  The contribution of the ship will help in bridging a gap in Malta's naval capacity pending their future acquisition of a new Offshore Patrol Vessel.  The issue of ongoing training of personnel of the Armed Forces of Malta by the Irish Defence Forces was also discussed.</p><p>I travelled to Malta on 6 July by Government Jet with the Irish delegation.

Among the measures proposed was the establishment of an EU-wide resettlement scheme to offer 20,000 resettlement places.  The Commission proposed that the scheme will cover all Member States, with the numbers suggested for each Member State calculated according to distribution criteria based on GDP, size of population, unemployment rate and past numbers of asylum seekers and of resettled refugees. It also takes account of the efforts already made on a voluntary basis by Member States.</p><p>The Commission's calculation envisaged Ireland accepting 272 refugees for resettlement between now and the end of 2016. While plans were already in place for the resettlement of 220 refugees in 2015/16, the Government agreed to accept an additional 300 refugees over and above that figure.

The amounts incurred for the years 2010 to 2013 are &euro;12.5m, &euro;10.1m, &euro;7.6m and &euro;6.5m respectively.  Precise figures for 2014 are not available but are expected to be similar to the expenditure in 2012 and 2013.  The Deputy may wish to note that protection related legal costs are also incurred by the Chief State Solicitor's Office.</p>  <p>  The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) estimates that the overall costs to the State for provision of services to protection applicants for the years 2009 to 2013 are as follows, &euro;185m, &euro;174m, &euro;153m, &euro;129m and &euro;91.4m respectively. Figures in relation to 2014 have not yet been finalised.  The reduction in costs is related to the numbers of persons in the system at any given time, particularly in relation to the numbers in the direct provision system which is the largest single expenditure item.  The question of costs of the Direct Provision system were examined in considerable detail in the 2010 Value for Money (VFM) Report which is available on the RIA website - www.ria.gov.ie.  The Report found that there are no cheaper alternatives to the Direct Provision system and that any other system which by necessity would entail payment of rent supplement, rent benefits and so forth would be twice the cost.  Moreover such a system would amount to a major pull factor which in turn would give rise to further costs which based on patterns would likely to be very significant.</p></reply>

Currently, there are over 4,599 residents in 34 centres across the State under contract to RIA.  Details of all of these centres and the companies or persons RIA has contracted to provide accommodation services are published in RIA's Annual Reports available on its website - .</p><p>All centres are managed by private companies under contract to RIA.  Seven of the 34 centres are State owned &ndash; i.e. the land and buildings are owned by the State &ndash; while the remainder are owned or leased by private entities.  There is a difference in the rates as State-owned facilities are not obliged to pay for rent, maintenance and utilities.  None of the three centres which are the subject of this question is State owned.  The rate paid to commercially owned centres is an all-in price that includes: VAT, staffing; energy and other utility costs; housekeeping; catering; security; maintenance, capital maintenance; etc.  Rates also vary depending on the location of and the services available in each centre.</p><p>In fulfilling its general accommodation responsibilities, RIA does not own, lease or rent premises from commercial contractors.  Rather, it contracts in a comprehensive range of services and facilities, including accommodation, housekeeping and so on, for a fixed sum over the period of a contract.  The amounts paid reflect this all-in price.  Generally, it can be said that there are three variables in a standard contract between RIA and the service provider: the numbers to be accommodated in the centre i.e. its capacity; the length of the contract; and the per person per day rate paid i.e the <i>per diem</i>rate.  It is not possible to provide values for current contracts entered into by RIA.  Negotiations take place with a number of commercial entities on an ongoing basis and RIA endeavours to achieve the best value for money in respect of each contract.  It is not in the interests of yielding best value for the taxpayer that details of current individual contracts are known to the public or to other parties who are, or may be in the future, engaged in negotiations with RIA. </p><p>Contract expiry dates are deliberately 'staggered' throughout the year and can span a period of months or years.  Thus for the purposes of this question, the date of 1st July was chosen for comparison purposes in each of the three centres cited.<table><tr><th>-</th><th>Contract capacity on 1 July 2011</th><th>Contract capacity on 1 July 2012</th><th>Contract capacity on 1 July 2013</th><th>Contract capacity on 1 July 2014</th><th>Contract capacity on 1 July 2015 </th></tr><tr><td>Centre 1</td><td>369</td><td>369</td><td>369</td><td>269</td><td>310</td></tr><tr><td>Centre 2</td><td>175</td><td>175</td><td>175</td><td>175</td><td>175</td></tr><tr><td>Centre 3</td><td>130</td><td>63</td><td>20</td><td>24</td><td>60</td></tr></table></p><p>The percentage increase/decrease on the per person per day rate (<i>per diem</i>) was calculated based on the rate applicable on 1st July each year.  Note that in 2012, in relation to a number of contracts RIA negotiated certain per diem rates downwards in the light of the financial pressures then prevailing on the State.<table><tr><th>-</th><th>Centre 1: <br /><br />% change over preceding year</th><th>Centre 2: <br /><br />% change over preceding year</th><th>Centre 3: <br /><br />% change over preceding year</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>0%</td><td>0%</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>-19.90%</td><td>-5.17%</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>0%</td><td>0%</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>+8.89%</td><td>0%</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>0%</td><td>0%</td><td>0%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, with penalties of up to life imprisonment for human trafficking, greatly strengthened the law in this area and this legislation was further bolstered in 2013 with new forms of exploitation, for forced begging and forced criminal activities, being provided for in new legislation.</p>  <p>  A dedicated Anti-Human Trafficking Unit was established in the Department of Justice and Equality with the purpose of ensuring that the State's response to human trafficking is coordinated and comprehensive.  A new National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Human Trafficking in Ireland was recently issued for consultation to civil society organisations active in this field.  This new Plan seeks to build on progress made to date in this area and address issues raised in independent international evaluations of Ireland&rsquo;s response to this important issue.  The new National Action Plan will outline both the Government&rsquo;s strategic approach to this issue as well as setting out a clear work programme for the relevant state authorities to collaborate with civil society and agencies in other jurisdictions in advancing the fight against trafficking and enhancing the protection of victims.</p>  <p>  This year, and for the past few years, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in its Annual Policing Plan, has identified trafficking in human beings as one of its priorities with an increased focus given to prevention and detection of human trafficking.  The Garda Commissioner has recently established the Child Protection and Human Exploitation Unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This unit includes Child Protection, Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit (DVSAIU) and the Human Trafficking Investigation and Coordination Unit.  A Detective Chief Superintendent has taken charge of this new unit.</p>  <p>  Specific detailed training is provided to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Over 900 have participated in the in-depth training course developed jointly by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).  The most recent course took place in late June 2015.  Since 2007, PSNI officers have attended this course and contributed greatly by sharing their experiences with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There are also a wide range of other training and awareness raising activities on-going and extensive consultation structures exist with up to 70 State Agencies, Non- Governmental Organisations and International Organisations.  </p>  <p>  The State provides a wide range of support services to victims of human trafficking, these include: accommodation, medical care and planning, psychological assistance, material assistance, legal aid and advice, vocational training and education. </p>  <p>  There is frequent contact between the Department&rsquo;s Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) and the Department of Justice Northern Ireland (DOJNI) to discuss issues of mutual concern in relation to human trafficking and to share experiences. AHTU and the DOJNI have a very close working relationship and work together on awareness raising activity where appropriate and possible.  For example, there have been two cross border forums on human trafficking involving representatives from a wide range of State, Non-Governmental and International Organisations from both sides of the border.  The first in October 2013 focussed on trafficking for sexual exploitation and looked at issues such as victim location and demand reduction measures.  The second event took place in January 2015.  This conference focused  on forced labour.  </p>  <p>  AHTU, in partnership with Ruhama, has been successful in obtaining EU funding for an all island project aimed at delivering activities that promote zero tolerance of human trafficking as a form of violence against women.  The Department of Justice Northern Ireland, Women's Aid Northern Ireland and the PSNI are also partners in this project.  Further information on the REACH project is available on www.reachproject.eu.</p>  <p>  The Organised Crime Task Force Sub Group on Human Trafficking and Illegal Immigration meets at Stormont on a quarterly basis.  The Detective Inspector of the Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit (HTICU)  is a member of this group.  The function of the Group is to monitor trends and facilitate the detection and prevention of human trafficking and illegal immigration, which has a cross-land border dimension.  Further information on the measures taken to tackle human trafficking can be found on the State's dedicated anti-trafficking website www.blueblindfold.gov.ie.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will appreciate, the deployment of specific Garda resources in an area is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and her management team.</p><p>The Garda strategy for tackling crime in the city centre area is being pursued within the framework of the Dublin City Centre Policing Plan.  This involves a high-visibility uniformed presence on key thoroughfares, as well as the use of undercover Garda&iacute; as appropriate.  A range of dedicated policing operations and measures are also in place including  Operation Spire in the O'Connell Street area and Operation Pier<b></b>in the Pearse Street District, which includes Temple Bar.  The resumption of Garda recruitment and the deployment of the first group of newly attested Garda&iacute; are of course key components in providing visible policing in the city centre and elsewhere.  Since September last year 300 new recruits have entered the Garda College in Templemore and a further 250 additional Garda recruits will commence training during 2015.  The first set of new Gardai were assigned to stations throughout the country in May and I am advised that twenty of these were assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan Region, with five assigned to Pearse Street station. I understand that a further group of new recruits will attest as Gardai at the end of July 2015.  The increased resources which are now coming on stream will undoubtedly support enhanced policing and community safety in all areas, including Temple Bar and other areas of Dublin City Centre.</p><p>I am sure the Deputy will acknowledge that the incidence of crime in the city centre is often linked to the complex issues which contribute to drug addiction and related behaviours, and that these must be addressed in a coordinated and cross-cutting manner.  In response to the particular issues arising in Dublin City Centre a  multi-agency street outreach approach is being used to work with vulnerable and high-risk individuals and an offender management programme is being piloted to address repeat offending in the Dublin City area.  The team includes personnel from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Anna Liffey Drug Project, Dublin City Council Housing and the HSE.  These measures, combined with the Government's initiatives to tackle homelessness, are helping to address the broader issues which may contribute to the incidence of petty crime and anti-social behaviour in the city centre area.</p><p>I am encouraged by the continued close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Dublin City Council and other agencies as well as ongoing consultation with key stakeholders, such as the Dublin City Business Forum.  My Department is maintaining contact with these cooperative initiatives, and I understand that positive feedback is being received in relation to the policing measures being employed by the Garda authorities, and their level of engagement  with business and community interests.  </p></reply>

In accordance with the legislation, the Commission was entirely independent in how it carried out its investigation.  As the Deputy is aware, the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter TD, and Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch TD, published the Report of the Commission on 1 May 2014 along with the reply by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service, Mr. Michael Donnellan.</p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s Final Report contained several conclusions relating to the management, medical treatment and psychiatric care of Stephen Egan prior to and subsequent to the killing by him of Gary Douch.  The Commission also recognised the many significant improvements which had been put in place since 2006, including reductions in prison overcrowding, investment in prisoner accommodation and improved health services for prisoners.  Having considered the Report of the Commission of Investigation, the Government decided to refer the Report to the Interdepartmental Group examining the issue of people with mental illness coming into contact with the criminal justice system.  The Interdepartmental Group was directed to consider the recommendations in a cohesive way and to report back with an implementation plan within three months.  The Group includes representatives from my Department and the Department of Health as well as relevant services including the Health Service Executive, the National Forensic Mental Health Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Irish Prison Service.</p>  <p>  The Group proceeded to examine the recommendations of the Commission of Investigation which relate to persons with mental illness and the criminal justice system and submitted an Implementation Plan for those recommendations to me and Minister of State Kathleen Lynch in September 2014.  I am advised that the Irish Prison Service has reported that significant progress has been made and that a comprehensive action plan has been put in place to ensure that the recommendations relating to the Service are being implemented.  Actions in relation to recommendations not yet complete are being progressed and I have requested that implementation of these actions be closely monitored.  I am also advised that progress is also being made by the Department of Health on the Commission's recommendations, including plans to replace the existing Central Mental Hospital and to otherwise enhance forensic mental health services nationally.  I can assure the Deputy that these issues will continue to be pursued in an objective and transparent manner, with a view to enhancing mental health services in this area.  I understand that there is correspondence on file, advising the Commission of Investigation prior to the completion of its report, that the then Minister had decided not to have a personal involvement in dealing with matters arising in relation to it, because the legal firm with which he was connected had acted as legal advisor to the Prisons Officers Association. However, I am advised that there is no correspondence relating to the specific point raised by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Commission proposed the establishment of an EU-wide resettlement scheme to offer 20,000 resettlement places by the end of 2016.  Under the new resettlement scheme, specific numbers would be allocated to all Member States, calculated on the basis of a distribution key based on GDP, size of population, unemployment rate and past numbers of asylum seekers and of resettled refugees.  The distribution key would also take account of the efforts already made on a voluntary basis by Member States.  The Commission's calculation envisaged Ireland accepting 272 persons over the 2015/2016 period.</p>  <p>  Ireland has already committed to accept 220 persons over the 2015/16 period. In response to the Commission's proposals the Government agreed to accept an additional 300 persons bringing the total to be admitted to 520 persons by the end of 2016, well above the figure suggested by the European Commission.  Ireland is one of 27 States that participate in a refugee resettlement programme led by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).  The focus of the Irish resettlement programme in recent years has been on the resettlement of refugees displaced by the Syrian conflict who are living in one of the hosting countries in the region, for example those living in Lebanon, Jordan or Turkey.  Internally displaced persons, such as the Circassians in Syria, are not eligible for resettlement under this resettlement programme. NGOs working in cooperation with the UNHCR at a local level identify the most vulnerable persons for resettlement, regardless of their race, religion, nationality or ethnicity.</p>  <p>  Resettlement is just one of a suite of responses to persons displaced by the Syrian conflict.  In 2014, Ireland introduced a Syrian Humanitarian Admission Programme (SHAP).  The SHAP offered naturalised Irish citizens of Syrian birth and Syrian nationals already legally resident in Ireland an opportunity to make an application for vulnerable close family members to join them in Ireland for up to two years under a sponsorship programme.  These are persons who are considered by their sponsoring family member present in Ireland to be most at risk. 114 beneficiaries have been granted admission under the programme.  In addition, Syrians legally resident in Ireland, for example, students or persons on work permissions may apply for an extension of their permission to remain in the State while the crisis situation continues.  I am informed by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) that 17 applications for refugee status were received from Syrian nationals in the first 6 months of 2015.  Information is not maintained on the number of applications for refugee status received from members of the Circassian minority group.</p></reply>

Where a Fixed Charge Notice is paid by Billpost and the driver licence details are inaccurately completed or omitted, payment is rejected and returned, along with the original Fixed Charge Notice.  In both of these circumstances, the Fixed Charge Notice remains effective and if not paid together with correct driving licence details, will result in a summons being issued for the original offence.</p></reply>

As with any proposals that are submitted to me, those from MRCI will receive due consideration.  Media reports however suggesting  that my Department has drawn up detailed proposals for a regularisation programme in consultation with MRCI are wholly inaccurate.  </p>  <p>  I have set out the Government's position on this issue many times before.  There is a clear obligation on anyone coming to live and work in the State to respect our laws.  In this regard it remains the responsibility of all non-EEA nationals who are resident in the State to ensure that they have an appropriate permission from the Minister for Justice and Equality and the great majority of migrants fully comply with this condition.  I am conscious that any significant departure from well established policies will invariably have implications for our immigration controls and the smooth functioning of the Common Travel Area with the United Kingdom.</p>  <p>  This does not preclude any foreign national, who finds him or herself in an undocumented situation, from returning to their home country and applying to re-enter the State or, in the alternative, from approaching the immigration authorities to seek permission to remain in the State.  Such cases would be carefully considered, taking the relevant circumstances into account, before any final decision was made.  An important factor in any such consideration would be the circumstances in which the person concerned became undocumented.  Following such a process it is reasonable for the State to expect that people will respect this decision.</p>  <p>  I would emphasise that, experience has shown us, most people become undocumented through their own conscious actions or omissions.  But this may not always be the case and in recognition of that fact the Department has operated a scheme to address the situation of those who became undocumented through no fault of their own.</p></reply>

All prisoners aged 18 years and over at Wheatfield Place of Detention enjoy the same level of access to these activities as listed.

There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning including Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.  In order to achieve this objective the Irish Prison Service has been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years.

My Department works closely with the Department of Education and Skills and other relevant Government departments to achieve these aims.</p>  <p>  Under the remit of my Department, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency  has a statutory function to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency is a statutory service supporting regular school attendance for all school age children and young people. Where school attendance problems arise for a child, the Agency concentrates on finding solutions within a collaborative intervention framework involving children and their families, schools and other relevant agencies. The aim is to generally improve the school attendance, participation and retention of young people, in particular, young people who are at risk of  early school leaving and educational disadvantage.</p>  <p>  Educational Welfare Officers work with families and schools to support children who are experiencing difficulties which impact on a child's capacity to attend school. Homelessness and temporary accommodation can impact on a child's attendance and participation in school. In such cases, I am advised that, the Educational Welfare Officer draws on a range of supports including the Home School Community Liaison and the School Completion Programme to assist the child in attending school.</p>  <p>  The School Completion Programme is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. It provides targeted supports annually to approximately 36,000 children.  There are 144 local school completion projects throughout the country operating in 470 primary and 224 post primary schools. </p>  <p>  Supports provided by local school completion programme projects including breakfast clubs, after school supports, homework clubs, summer activity projects and friendship clubs can help to support a child's participation in education and engagement in school life. Educational Welfare Officers employ these supports for the child and may seek to provide assistance with transport where this is feasible.  An Educational Welfare Officer may also engage with the Family Support Worker where this is appropriate in the child's and family's particular circumstances. The objective is to work with the family and child to support continued participation in school and good educational outcomes for children.</p></reply>

These risks were attributed largely to staffing deficits being experienced in the area.  They were brought to the attention of the area manager during the inspection and immediate action taken.  The associated action plan has been accepted by HIQA and there are clear timelines for completion before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  Tusla has confirmed that as part of the action plan, resources will be made available to meet the demands of the plan as agreed with the management team. Vacant posts are currently being filled through a variety of measures including agency staff, and recruitment from the national Recruitment Service panels.

Their findings were published at the start of July, along with an action plan from Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to address all the issued identified, and which was accepted by HIQA. There were two areas of significant risk identified which concerned delays in assessments by dedicated social workers and the management of cases concerning adults who are alleged to pose a risk to children.   </p>  <p>  These risks were immediately brought to the attention of the Area Manager by the inspectors, and action was taken to address the issues.  The identified risks were attributed largely to staffing deficits being experienced in the area.  Tusla is actively working to fill social work vacancies.  I understand that internal staff transfers have commenced to assist in the handling of high priority cases.  Training is being rolled out that will improve the management of lower risk cases, including training on the use of the Meitheal pathway and ensuring that, where it is appropriate to do so, families can be referred to family support services.  Training for social work duty teams is also being rolled out in relation to cultural competency.  Tusla has confirmed that as part of the action plan, resources will be made available to meet the demands of the plan as agreed with the management team. </p>  <p>  The number of positives identified in the report should also be noted.  The service was found to be competently managed with strong leadership and good communications.  HIQA found that children at most serious risk of harm received a timely and effective service and there was excellent inter-agency collaboration, strong leadership and communication systems in the area.  Good efforts are being made to deploy the limited resources available.  Social workers advocated strongly for children in accessing specialist services and children&rsquo;s rights were well respected.  Other positives found within the service include strategies in place to safeguard and protect children from abuse and to promote their welfare.  </p></reply>

All childcare programmes supported by my Department currently provide funding directly to childcare providers, either in the form of capitation or subvention payments. This kind of funding mechanism provides the leverage to progressively build the quality of childcare provision, while at the same time making childcare more affordable. </p>  <p>  The question of tax allowances for parents was considered prior to the introduction of these childcare programmes.  A number of issues emerged at that time which did not favour the introduction of a childcare tax credit.  For example, the introduction of a tax credit would not help to support quality improvements within the early years sector and would not help those families on low pay who may not have any tax liability. There is also concern that the application of tax credits could lead to increased prices and therefore have limited impact in terms of savings to parents. </p>  <p>  Options for future  investment in childcare, including childcare tax credits, are currently being considered by the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education, which I established in February this year. This Inter-Departmental Group, which is tasked with setting out a range of options for current and future investment, will consider options to enhance affordability, options to increase the accessibility of provision and options to build the quality of provision and support the sustainability of the early years sector.  It will submit a series of recommendations to Government shortly.</p>  <p>  These recommendations will be considered as part of the upcoming annual estimates cycle and budgetary process.  It is not possible for me to comment at this time on what future decisions may be taken by Government in the context of Budget 2016.</p></reply>

The objective of this Strategy is to create an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s early years sector and a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to 6 years. The Early Years Strategy will address a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as child health and well-being, parenting and family support, learning and development  and play. </p><p>This Strategy is one of three constituent strategies to emerge from <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People (2014-2020.</i>The Strategy will be underpinned by the Policy Framework's five national outcomes for children (i.e. active and healthy, achieving in all areas of learning and development, safe and protected from harm, economic security and opportunity and  connected, respected and contributing) and by the six transformation goals it identifies to ensure the realisation of these outcomes for children - one of these goals is early intervention and prevention.</p><p>Considerable work has been done on the development of the Early Years Strategy.  The work of the Expert Advisory Group, <i>Right from the Start</i>, has greatly informed the work to date.  I have signalled my intention to conduct focused consultations with relevant parties across the early childhood care and education sector before concluding my own deliberations on the Strategy.  I am also mindful of the importance of other work which is being undertaken in parallel in respect of the future investment priorities in respect of childcare.  Taking account of these developments, I expect to be in a position to bring the Strategy forward for consideration by Government later this year.</p></reply>

Approximately 65,000 children are participating in this Programme in the current school year. My Department does not collate figures in relation to the number of  children with special  needs who are within the eligibility age range for the ECCE programme.  </p>  <p>  While there is currently no specific funding available from my Department to provide additional support to children with special needs accessing the ECCE programme, there are a number of measures in place to ensure that the free pre-school year is more accessible to these children.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit where a child would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  </p>  <p>  In addition, while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the free pre-school year, it does work at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities. In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with disabilities in some instances to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and subject to resources. </p>  <p>  This Government recognises however, that co-ordination and provision of appropriate supports for pre-school children with special needs could be improved. Accordingly, when I established the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and School Age Care and Education, I included in its terms of reference the need to examine how best to provide for children with special needs within the ECCE Programme.</p>  <p>  To advance this, the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, and Health have agreed to work together to develop a new model of supports for pre-school children with special needs.  My Department is leading the process, with full and active support from the other two Departments and their respective agencies.  </p>  <p>  A group comprising representatives from these three Departments, the HSE, Tusla, the National Council for Special Education, the National Disability Authority, Better Start and the Dublin City Childcare Committee has started its work.  This Group aims to have an agreed model by early September, with a view to making a cross-departmentally supported proposal for the resources required in time for the Estimates process.  </p></reply>

Patients have the ability to apply to the HSE TAS seeking access to public healthcare outside the state through model form E112.  As part of the approval process it is required that the hospital outside the state will accept form E112 (IE).  Acceptance of this form effectively means payment for the treatment will be at a state to state level following from the aim of the EU Regulation to facilitate free movement for citizens of their social security entitlements within member states.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should be reminded that the HSE has never withdrawn approval from any patient including this child. The approval granted remains in place and is consistent with the criteria for the Scheme. The approval letter provided in this case specified that the approval granted for treatment abroad was limited to the particular treatment and to the hospital within the public system as was listed in that approval letter.  The child attended a private facility which was not the hospital listed in the approval letter and which does not accept model form E112 as a method of payment.  The issue of availing of private healthcare outside the terms of the Scheme and the approval given, is a matter for the parents and referring doctors and cannot be addressed by the HSE TAS.  However, the HSE is cognisant of this child's situation and is currently reviewing the case.  A decision on the review of the case will be issued within days.  The availing of the treatment abroad in the public health sector remains an option which would be fully funded as per the approval issued.</p></reply>

They are issued with a Marketing Authorisation (MA).  Roaccutane was first authorised for use in Ireland on 19 April 1983.  Comprehensive standards of quality for applications for MA's are contained within EU and Irish legislation, and regulatory guidance documents.  These were comprehensively referenced in my answer to PQ 26769/15. The same legislation covers all data requirements as well as pharmacovigilance requirements.</p>  <p>  The product information requirements, including their format and content, are also detailed in these guidance documents.  Both are approved as an intrinsic part of the licensing of a medicine and continuously updated to reflect the current state of knowledge of the medicine concerned and the risks associated with its use, as new data become available and is assessed by the HPRA and/or its European counterparts.</p>  <p>  The package leaflet is subject to user-testing to ensure its ease of readability by patients.  Package leaflets are available in the medicine&rsquo;s packaging and on the HPRA and other websites.  Any changes to the licence document or product information deemed necessary after assessment of applications are made by the company concerned.  There have been numerous updates to the product information for Roaccutane; currently available records indicate at least 27 updates to these documents, with multiple changes made to them in the context of some of these updates.</p>  <p>  There is currently no fee for the renewal of MA's.  Rather, companies pay the HPRA an annual maintenance fee of &euro;650 for the first 10 MA's they hold and &euro;812 for additional authorisations; this is to cover all aspects of routine dossier management and maintenance, including the work associated with on-going pharmacovigilance activities.  Information on the renewal of the authorisations for medicinal products was provided in my response to PQ 18776/15.</p>  <p>  Roaccutane was last renewed on 10 July 2009 with an unlimited MA. Unlimited MA's are a requirement of the legislation as explained that same response of May 2015.  An unlimited authorisation does not preclude changes to the product information for healthcare professionals and patients.  Changes can be made, when required, on the basis of ongoing pharmacovigilance activities and assessments.</p>  <p>  Part of this ongoing pharmacovigilance is the monitoring, review and evaluation of reported adverse drug reactions. Reporting of adverse events has been a function of the HPRA since its establishment as the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) in 1995, and prior to 1995 by the National Drugs Advisory Board (NDAB).  Reporting of suspected adverse reactions by healthcare professionals (e.g. doctors/dentists/pharmacists/nurses) and patients/carers is undertaken on a voluntary basis, with all groups strongly encouraged to report when they consider a medicine may have contributed to the effects experienced.  WHO data indicates that Ireland was ranked tenth highest reporter across 121 participating countries during 2014, reflecting the active contribution of Irish healthcare professionals to the reporting programme.  Given these levels of reporting and the very positive response of healthcare professionals to requests for reports over the years, it is not considered that a mandatory based system of reporting by healthcare professionals is appropriate or necessary.  The HPRA does however continue to regularly remind health care professionals about reporting adverse drug reactions via its Drugs Safety Newsletter.</p>  <p>  Since it was first authorised for use in Ireland, Roaccutane (isotretinoin) has been contraindicated in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.  Use of isotretinoin has also been consistently contraindicated in women of childbearing potential since the product was first authorised, unless all of the conditions specified in the product information are met.</p>  <p>   An EU wide Pregnancy Prevention Plan (PPP) was introduced in October 2003 to further reduce the potential risk of pregnancy in women by expanding the available information and highlighting the well-known and documented risks related to use in women of child-bearing potential.  These measures include supplementary information distributed to prescribing doctors, pharmacists, other relevant healthcare professionals and patients, including the following:</p>  <p>  -  Physician&rsquo;s guide to prescribing Roaccutane to female patients;</p>  <p>  -  Physician&rsquo;s checklist for prescribing to female patients;</p>  <p>  -  Patient information brochure;</p>  <p>  -  Important information for patients prescribed Roaccutane on contraception; and</p>  <p>  -  Pharmacist&rsquo;s guide to dispensing Roaccutane.</p>  <p>  The PPP applies across all EU member states and is monitored and reviewed at EU level.  The company submits the information gathered through the PPP on a yearly basis to the competent authority for each EU member state (i.e. HPRA in Ireland).  The European Medicines Agency&rsquo;s (EMA&rsquo;s) Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), (at which Ireland is represented by the HPRA) assesses the data provided to consider any need to strengthen/amend the PPP as part of the regular review of the effectiveness of these risk minimisation measures.</p>  <p>  Licence applications and licence renewal applications contain commercially sensitive information.  The HPRA has a duty to protect confidential information submitted by companies, healthcare professionals and patients and cannot release the information requested without third-party consent.</p></reply>

In 2012 the Department commissioned a Health Impact Assessment of a sugar sweetened drinks levy, which concluded that, "price increases tend to decrease demand but the degree to which this happens is variable because consumer behaviour and industry response to tax is difficult to predict".  Subsequent to this the European Region of the World Health Organisation (WHO), has recently published a document on the experience of other European countries and showed a mixed picture.  In some countries this is viewed as  income generation and has no impact on consumption but in others the early indications suggest a reduction in consumption of sugar sweetened drinks.  This matter is being kept under review. An Obesity Policy and Action Plan is currently under development and will address a broad range of measures to reduce the level of overweight and obesity in Ireland.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-14a.1249.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015071400090#WRCC02600"><p>Government policy is and will continue to be to prioritise facilitating older people to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as possible, and ensuring that appropriate residential care is available when it is needed.</p>  <p>  The HSE provides a range of community-based services aimed at ensuring older people receive safe, timely and appropriate care and treatment at the lowest level of complexity, and as close to home as possible.</p>  <p>  In its National Service Plan (NSP) for 2015 the HSE stated that it will continue to progress the strategic realignment of services to provide home care and community support services in order to maximise the potential of older people in their own homes and communities.  The levels of home supports planned for in the NSP are:</p>  <p>-  10.3 million hours of home help service supporting 50,000 people -  this is same level of service as 2014.</p>  <p>- 13,800 people in receipt of a home care packages at any one time - this includes an additional 600 people supported under the delayed discharges initiative.</p>  <p>-  190 people in receipt of an intensive home care package at any one time - these packages were introduced for the first time in 2014 for people with more complex care needs.</p>  <p>  It would be of great concern to me if we were placing more people in residential care than happens in other comparable countries, but I do not think that this is in fact the case.  The proportion of older people in residential care is a constantly changing one, and international comparison can be quite problematic because of differences in models of care and in definition of what constitutes long term residential care etc.  However, in Ireland we generally have somewhere between 4% to 4.5% of those aged over 65 in residential care, and this is about average for other countries in the OECD.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I would hope to reduce this number further.  The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, as well as considering the historical and future operation of the Scheme itself, will consider how community and other services should be developed in order to facilitate more older people to stay at home for longer, and towards this end it identifies the services that should be prioritised into the future as resources allow.  These include home care, better linkages between acute and community services, short stay beds, the use of assistive technology and consideration of new residential models on a collaborative basis by the Departments of Health and Environment and Local Government.  The Review is almost complete and will be published as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Prior to reimbursing any medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available to the HSE.</p>  <p>  The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.  They are not political or ministerial decisions.</p>  <p>  In May 2013, the HSE decided that it could not approve the reimbursement of Fampridine under the GMS or other schemes, as the manufacturer (Biogen Idec) had failed to demonstrate or provide any formal justification for the prices proposed.  The HSE decision was in line with many other European countries who have also, to date, not provided for the drug under their public health systems.</p>  <p>  The HSE re-engaged with the company in July 2014 (and again in October 2014) seeking improved commercial offerings.  The outputs of those commercial engagements were re-considered by the HSE Drugs Committee at it's November 2014 meeting.</p>  <p>  The Committee decided to seek additional detailed information from clinical experts as to how a responder-only reimbursement scheme (i.e. patients confirmed as positive responders to the medication) would operate for this product.  The feasibility of this option is currently under consideration.</p></reply>

Of the 78 patients who have received a pancreas transplant, 28 are currently being reviewed in the Beaumont transplant clinic and the remainder are being managed by their consultant nephrologist.</p>  <p>  It is normal practice that nephrologists take over the post-transplant clinical care of patients who they would have referred for a pancreas transplant.  Nephrologists utilise the referral process back to the transplant surgeons at Beaumont Hospital if clinically appropriate.  The transplant clinic will remain at Beaumont Hospital for all kidney and pancreas patients that have had their transplant procedure carried out at Beaumont Hospital.</p>  <p>  The consultant who undertook pancreas transplants at Beaumont Hospital retired at the end of 2014.  While Beaumont Hospital is making every effort to recruit a suitable replacement, the hospital is also collaborating with St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital in relation to a combined approach to kidney/pancreas transplants.  It is proposed that pancreas transplants, of which 6 were performed in 2014, will move to St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital.  As St. Vincent&rsquo;s is already established as the National Liver Transplant Centre, and is a designated centre for pancreas cancer services, it is well placed to undertake pancreas transplants.  Most pancreas transplants are combined with a kidney transplant.  The arrangements being put in place for such cases will involve transplant surgeons from St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital and Beaumont Hospital working together on the St. Vincent&rsquo;s campus.</p>  <p>  If a transplant patient under the care of Beaumont Hospital encounters problems, they contact the renal registrar via Beaumont Hospital's switch board.  If this occurs during day time, they may be asked to present to the renal day ward for assessment.  If the renal registrar is contacted by a patient out of hours, he/she will be advised to present to the Emergency Department where the patient will be assessed by the Emergency Department staff and also reviewed by the renal registrar, and/or the consultant nephrologist, if required.  In addition, the patient can contact the transplant coordinators at Beaumont Hospital for guidance.</p></reply>

There have been several significant cross-Border and all-island initiatives over the past 20 years, with the early experience gained through local and regional pilot projects in the Border area, building the confidence to put more permanent collaborative arrangements in place. Today, there are many examples which illustrate that co-operation between North and South in health makes sense. I am committed to strengthening and increasing North-South health co-operation.</p>  <p>  There is continued engagement between my Department and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland on progressing co-operation in paediatric cardiology services on an all-island basis. The expert international working group report on an all-island service for cardiology and cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease was published in October 2014. This report is a pragmatic example of co-operation across both jurisdictions which seeks to create an effective, integrated service for the benefit of patients. It makes clear and explicit recommendations on the development of a single congenital cardiac service for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. One of the recommendations was that paediatric surgery and interventional cardiology should cease in Belfast and that all services should be provided in Dublin, giving us the critical mass needed for such a centre. This development will ensure that a very vulnerable group of sick children and young people get the best level of care no matter where they come from on the island.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the report recommendations has commenced on a phased basis at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin this year and these  services will move to the new children's hospital when built. The new hospital will be co-located with St. James's Hospital, and ultimately tri-located with the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, which will relocate to the campus in due course. In addition to the main hospital, the project includes two satellite centres at the campuses of Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals.  Design development for the hospitals and satellite centres is ongoing and a planning submission is to be made in the coming weeks. Subject to planning, work is scheduled to commence at all three sites in early 2016. The intention is that the new children&rsquo;s hospital will become a child-centred and family-focused world class facility, capable of anticipating and responding to developments in healthcare expected over the next generation. The hospital will provide tertiary and quaternary paediatric services, including on an all-island basis where agreed, as well as secondary paediatric services for the greater Dublin area.</p></reply>

Biosimilar medicines are similar but not identical to their reference biological medicines, and therefore are not considered in the same way as generic medicines.

Figures from the National Office for Tobacco Control indicate that the overall prevalence of cigarette smoking in Ireland during 2014 was 19.5%.</p>  <p>  However, I am pleased to say that Ireland has been in the forefront of tobacco control legislation in Europe, and ranked second of thirty-four European countries in relation to tobacco control initiatives.  Tobacco Free Ireland, the latest policy in the area, sets a target for Ireland to be tobacco free by 2025. In practice, this will mean a smoking prevalence rate of less than 5%.  The two key themes underpinning the report are protecting children and the denormalisation of smoking. </p>  <p>  A high level Tobacco Free Ireland Action Plan was published in March 2015.  It outlines the responsibilities, actions necessary and timelines for the implementation of the recommendations in Tobacco Free Ireland.</p>  <p>  While the Government has no plans at present for the type of legal action the Deputy describes, tobacco control is one of the areas on which we have ongoing dialogue and co-operation with our colleagues in Northern Ireland under the auspices of the North South Ministerial Council.  Officials working in the area in my Department are also in regular informal contact with the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland on tobacco related issues.</p></reply>

This policy, which has been adopted by the Health Service Executive, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p><p>In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and my officials will follow the matter up.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable. It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need. Patients with the greatest level of need i.e. Grade 5 or Grade 4 are provided with treatment by the HSE.</p><p>Information on waiting times is collated by the HSE by region and for the intervals as shown below only.

This delivered on a commitment in the Programme for Government to develop a national Alzheimer&rsquo;s and other dementias strategy to increase awareness, ensure early diagnosis and intervention and develop enhanced community based services.</p>  <p>  The Strategy distinguishes between those Actions that can be progressed within existing resources and others to be addressed as more resources become available.  Those identified for first implementation include:</p>  <p>- Clear responsibility for dementia to be assigned within the HSE. A dedicated Office, led at General Manager level by Mr. John Linehan, Specialist, Services for Older People, has been established within the HSE to support implementation of the Strategy;</p>  <p>- Clear descriptions of care pathways, and better information and guidance on services to be made available to GPs and to people with dementia and their families and carers;</p>  <p>- A better understanding of dementia, including modifiable risk factors, to be promoted;</p>  <p>- The use of existing resources to be reviewed to ensure that they are used in the best way possible;</p>  <p>- Research to inform the design and delivery of dementia services in Ireland to be supported and given appropriate priority.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have agreed a joint initiative with the Atlantic Philanthropies to implement significant elements of the Strategy over the period 2014-2017.  This National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme will represent a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m, and the HSE contributing &euro;15.5m.</p>  <p>  This programme will promote a greater focus on timely diagnosis of dementia and on the value of early intervention, along with the long-term objective of making people in Ireland generally more aware and understanding of the needs of people with dementia, and of the contribution that those with dementia continue to make to our society. Key elements of the initiative include:</p>  <p>- the rollout of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Homecare Packages for people with dementia;</p>  <p>- the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs, who are the critical and initial point of contact with the health system for those with dementia - the resource material will include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points, etc.; and</p>  <p>- Measures to raise public awareness, address stigma, and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia.</p>  <p>  A Monitoring Group, chaired by the Department of Health, has been established to assist with and advise on implementation of the Strategy, including the National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme.  This Group includes health professionals, administrators, researchers, and advocates. In addition, the Group includes a number of new members including a person living with dementia and a representative of those who care for people with dementia.  The Group held its first meeting in April 2015 at which it commenced consideration of an Implementation Plan for the Strategy.  A further meeting is scheduled for 24 September 2015.</p>  <p>  Progress has already been made on a number of fronts.  The HSE has established a central Dementia Office to drive and oversee implementation of the Strategy.  Work has commenced on the development of a Dementia Friendly Ireland programme to raise awareness and increase understanding of the condition.  Research into the educational needs of GPs and Primary Care Team members is underway, and a body of training will follow when this is complete.  Roll-out has commenced of intensive home care packages for people with dementia, and 38 people with dementia have benefitted to date.</p>  <p>  There is no formal signing-up process for GPs in this context:-the Irish College of General Practitioners are collaborators on and supportive of this project.  We are still in the early stages of implementation, but the National Dementia Strategy is a clear indication by Government of the importance that it attaches to dementia, and of our commitment to ensuring that those with dementia can live well for as long as possible.</p></reply>

The OECD average number of GPs across OECD countries in 2013 was approximately 0.68 per 1,000 population (not enough countries have reported back, as yet, to give a 2014 average).  It should be noted that figures for some countries exclude trainees, while others (including Ireland) include all registered GPs.</p>  <p>  The OECD Health Data 2013 shows the average number of General Practitioners (GPs) per 1,000 population across OECD countries in 2011 was approximately 0.68.  It also shows that Ireland had approximately 0.73 GPs per 1,000 population in 2013.  It should be noted that figures for some countries exclude trainees, while others (including Ireland) include all registered GPs.</p>  <p>  The HSE is currently engaged in medical workforce planning, which includes workforce planning for GPs. This work is being carried out within the HSE's National Doctor Training and Planning Unit where a medical workforce planning system is due to be completed and implemented shortly.  The system will be based on a statistical model of supply and demand for medical specialists, which will be informed by expert stakeholders, population and medical workforce data.  Both entrants into and exits from the workforce will be accounted for.  Furthermore, a measure of patient need and the demand for medical specialist services will be determined and included in the statistical model. Medical workforce planning for General Practice is being prioritised in the development of workforce projections based on both the supply of GPs and the demand for GP services over the next 10 years.</p>  <p>  As the information requested by the Deputy in relation to GP numbers by County is not routinely provided to my Department, I have asked the Health Service Executive to reply directly to the Deputy on these matters.

The Health Service Executive is required to obtain value for money when disposing of surplus property assets the proceeds of which, with Department of Public Expenditure consent, will be re-invested in delivering much needed health care infrastructure.  The HSE is concentrating on applying the limited funding available for capital works in the most effective way possible to meet health care needs now and in the future.   </p>  <p>  The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan sets a public sector energy efficiency target to reduce energy use by 33% by 2020.  The HSE is endeavouring to comply with the Government&rsquo;s Green Procurement Guidelines which requires public bodies to ensure that a minimum building energy rating of B3 is achieved in all newly built and leased buildings from January 2012 and a minimum rating of A3 from January 2015.  The HSE's design and building construction tenders all reflect these targets and all buildings being procured will meet these standards.  Given the age of the old buildings on the Portrane campus, their vastness and total unsuitability for modern health care service delivery, it is generally not value for money and economically advantageous to expend scarce health care resources on their redevelopment.  However, the HSE is actively engaged in rationalising the Portrane health care accommodation needs and reducing its energy use.</p>  <p>  In the context of the planning application for the new hospital the HSE identified some buildings for inclusion in the OPW register where if future use was compatible with existing health care operations these buildings could be utilised by other public bodies.  In relation to the use of State property the Government's Reform Plan sets out commitments relating to property asset management which include ensuring that optimal value for money is achieved in the management of the State's property portfolio.  Developments including the rationalisation of State bodies, changing business practices and health care needs combined with reduced property requirements necessitate a multi-faceted adjustment to the management of the State&rsquo;s property portfolio.  The development and implementation of the Property Management Delivery Plan has been one of the outcomes of the reform process.  This plan aims to improve the planning and management of the public service property portfolio by improving co-ordination of strategies and activities, processes for strategic planning, projects and property management, standards for accommodation fit-out and data capture, accountability for decision making and deployment of resources.</p></reply>

The new contract with General Practitioners for children under six years of age includes for the first time in Primary Care the provision of a cycle of care for child patients with asthma.  The National Clinical Programme for Asthma (NCPA) and the Asthma Society of Ireland have welcomed the introduction of this first step in the provision of a comprehensive programme for asthma across primary and secondary care.  The cycle of care includes key actions such as checking inhaler technique, provision of a written asthma action plan, review of asthma medications and recording of smoking status of the home. </p>  <p>  A key focus for the National Clinical Programme for Asthma this year has been the two Asthma Integrated Care Demonstrator Projects.  Funding for these projects commenced from June in the HSE Primary Care Service Plan 2015.  The process for recruiting the clinical care staff is underway with expected commencement in October 2015.  These projects will facilitate the implementation of the cycle of care and demonstrate how care can be integrated for Asthma between Primary and Secondary Care.  This Integrated Asthma Care will be delivered by a community based Clinical Nurse Specialist (Respiratory - Integrated Care).  These projects will be further extended in 2016 so that the needs of asthma patients can be further addressed. </p>  <p>  The NCPA has made significant progress since its establishment which to date includes:</p>  <p>  - The development of asthma guidelines in acute and chronic management, care pathways, treatment protocols and care bundles for use in all care settings (primary and secondary care levels), in conjunction with National Emergency Medicine, Acute Medicine, COPD, Critical Care, Obstetrics &amp;amp; Gynaecology, Paediatric programmes and Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP);</p>  <p>  - The development of a Model of Care for Asthma (MOCA) approved by the Leadership in HSE and planned for launch in 2015;</p>  <p>  - The development and implementation in conjunction with the Asthma Society of Ireland, of asthma education programmes for healthcare professionals to underpin the guidelines implementation;</p>  <p>  - The planning of a structured Asthma Programme at Primary Care level in conjunction with ICGP and Primary Care programme to ensure implementation of evidenced based chronic asthma management guidelines and asthma care;</p>  <p>  - Supporting the work of the Asthma Society of Ireland in patient asthma education supports initiatives.</p>  <p>  As outlined above, the components of the programme are being implemented on an ongoing basis.  When the Model of Care is launched later this year, it will be up to the relevant operational divisions within the HSE to implement the programme.</p></reply>

The other hospitals in this Group are Mater Misericordiae University Hospital; St Vincent's University Hospital; St Luke's General Hospital, Kilkenny; Wexford General Hospital; National Maternity Hospital; Our Lady's Hospital, Navan; St Columcille's Hospital; St Michael's Hospital, Dun Laoghaire; Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital; Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital. (Academic Partner: UCD).</p>  <p>  The initial focus is on getting the hospital group up and running as a single cohesive entity.  The hospital group will be required to develop a strategic plan to describe how they will provide more efficient and effective patient services; reorganise these services to provide optimal care to the population they serve; and how they will achieve maximum integration with other groups and all other health services, particularly primary care and community care services.</p>  <p>  The formation of the Ireland East Hospital Group, with its own governance and management, will provide the optimum configuration for Mullingar hospital to deliver patient care in a cost effective manner.  It  will allow for hospitals such as Mullingar to be supported within the Hospital Group in terms of education and training, continuous professional development, the sustainable recruitment of high quality clinical staff and the safe management of deteriorating and complex patients.  The Group includes a primary academic partner which will stimulate a culture of learning and openness to change within the hospital group.  There will be a structured integration of Mullingar Hospital into the Ireland East Group in 2015 which will provide further support for the hospital in delivering high-quality safe patient care.</p></reply>

There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.

This serves to maintain the worldwide good reputation and integrity of the Irish passport, which, in turn, ensures the safe travel and well-being of Irish citizens as they travel abroad.  The witnessing of applications by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the State is a cornerstone of this identity verification. Moreover, it helps to combat passport fraud and identity theft.  However, recognising the additional workload the annual increase in passport applications (from 250,000 in 1995 to over 630,000 last year) has put on An Garda Siochana, the Passport Service is reviewing the witnessing process.  It is intended that the process used to apply for a passport card will serve to pilot an online application form.  This is likely to mean that the Garda witnessing requirement for adults renewing their passport application will be removed in the medium term.  This will be implemented in tandem with a number of new identity verification measures including an increased reliance on the Public Services Card as the core identify verification mechanism for all passport applicants in the State.</p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains and administers a roster of 200 observers for such missions.  The aim is to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international election observation missions organised in the main by the OSCE and the EU.  In recent years, Ireland has successfully nominated monitors to participate in a large number of missions led by the OSCE and EU, the details of which can be found on the Irish Aid website.</p>  <p>  The current election observation roster was established in May 2013 for a period of five years, following a review of the previous roster and a public call for applicants.  An independent appraisal and ranking of all 263 eligible applicants was undertaken by two assessors external to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, against four criteria specifically related to election observation.  These criteria were experience of election observation; knowledge of human rights and/or governance issues; language skills; and experience of challenging environments.</p>  <p>  Arising from this, the 200 individuals who achieved the highest scores were selected to serve on the new election observation roster and a reserve panel of the next 10 highest scoring individuals was also established, from which replacements would be drawn should any members leave the roster during the five year period.  Since its formation, four members have resigned from the roster.  Three replacements drawn from the reserve list in order of ranking have been appointed to the roster and the process of appointing the fourth replacement is underway.</p>  <p>  Ireland actively participates in the European Commission and European External Action Service - led European Observation network, which brings together election observation Focal Points from all EU Member States, together with Norway, Switzerland and Canada.  The network facilities exchange of information and international best practice on all aspects of election monitoring and roster administration and helps to ensure that we are acting in accordance with that best practice. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that all applicants have been treated fairly and impartially and all unsuccessful applicants were invited to request feedback on their applications.  Furthermore the independent review process which was established has facilitated two applicant reviews.  In both cases, as set out in the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 153 of 4 February 2014, the reviewer was of the view that the scoring of both applications was fair and impartial across all four published criteria.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the current roster is well equipped to deal with the requisite requirements of the EU and OSCE.  The Department will keep the process under review taking into account developments in the EU and OSCE context.</p></reply>

This information was confirmed at a further meeting.  As the local lawyers in any consular case are generally best placed to clarify issues relating to local law and the charges being faced by a citizen, this information has been relied upon in good faith. </p>  <p>  This is the information which has previously been relayed to the House. However, any charges being faced need to be addressed - the situation is serious and the trial is ongoing. </p>  <p>  The Government continues to seek further clarification in respect of the charges and their likely implication.</p>  <p>  I discussed the case with my Egyptian counterpart on a number of occasions and we agreed to keep our channels of communication open.  Moreover, at official level, my Department remains in ongoing contact with the relevant Egyptian authorities, both in Cairo and through the Embassy of Egypt in Dublin. </p>  <p>  My Department has a very clear strategy in place focussed on achieving a positive outcome at the earliest time possible.

This unprecedented level of consular visitation indicates clearly the priority we are placing on doing all that we can to carefully monitor his welfare in detention, and to advocate strongly on his behalf to the Egyptian authorities.</p></reply>

Ireland is currently a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council and we pursue our human rights priorities in many international fora.  Ireland is a firm supporter of the European Court of Human Rights and the European Convention of Human Rights system and liaises regularly with the UK in relation to the Council on Europe Committee of Ministers&rsquo; supervision of states&rsquo; implementation of Court judgments. There is not at this time any legislation before the British Parliament at Westminster to repeal the 1998 UK Human Rights Act. However, the British Government has announced its intention to bring forward proposals for a Bill of Rights to replace the Human Rights Act.  These proposals have not yet been published. In the absence of any detailed proposal it is difficult to speculate on potential consequences.  Obviously were any proposal to be made it would have to be carefully analysed.  On the broad question of human rights and the Good Friday Agreement, the views of the Government are clear and unchanged.  The protection of human rights in Northern Ireland law, predicated on the European Convention on Human Rights, is one of the key principles underpinning the Agreement. As a guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government takes very seriously its responsibility to safeguard its institutions and principles.  The fundamental role of human rights in guaranteeing peace and stability in Northern Ireland cannot be taken for granted and must be fully respected.  The Good Friday Agreement is clear that there is an obligation to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law and this is an ongoing obligation.</p>  <p>  Placing human rights at the heart of the peace process in Northern Ireland has helped to ensure the participation and trust of all communities.  The Government will work closely with the UK Government and with the power-sharing Executive in Belfast to ensure that the protection of human rights remains at the heart of civic life, politics and ongoing societal change in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  I have conveyed the Government&rsquo;s views on these issues to the British Government, as have other Government colleagues.  We will continue to closely follow all developments on this matter.</p></reply>

The Taoiseach and Prime Minister Cameron discussed implementation of the Agreement at their meeting in London on 18 June, underlining the collective benefit of full implementation.  </p>  <p>  To continue to take forward this work, I represented the Government at the Implementation and Review meetings of the Stormont House Agreement in Belfast on 2 June and again on 25 June.  A major focus of the 2 June meeting was the failure the previous week of the Welfare Bill to secure approval in the Northern Ireland Assembly, the potential consequent budgetary implications of this and its potential impact on the prospects for implementing the totality of the Stormont House Agreement.  In the period since this meeting took place, a Budget Bill was agreed by the Northern Ireland Assembly. </p>  <p>   The 25 June meeting was an important opportunity to take stock of progress, including in the context of the ongoing political impasse in relation to welfare reform and wider budgetary issues.  The meeting considered and approved for publication a progress report which outlines overall implementation of the Agreement, including work towards establishing new mechanisms to deal with the legacy of the past.

Successive Irish Governments, in our ongoing bilateral relations and through the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg, have raised the issue of collusion with the British Government.</p>  <p>  We continue to do so, including in relation to a number of individual cases of long-standing concern such as the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the case of the late Pat Finucane.  In particular, we advocate that all relevant documentation be made available to be examined by the appropriate mechanisms.  Such cases must be adequately addressed if we are to achieve a genuinely reconciled society.  </p>  <p>  Many families, including those bereaved by incidents in which collusion has been alleged, continue to deal not only with the awful pain of losing a loved one, but with the struggle for answers decades after these traumatic events.  I understand and acknowledge the frustration of families who for too long have had to contend with inadequate mechanisms for addressing their cases.  For that reason, the establishment of a new comprehensive framework for dealing with the legacy of the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement, remains a priority of the Government.  We believe that these mechanisms offer the best hope of helping the thousands of families touched by the Troubles &ndash; including those affected by collusion.</p>  <p>  These institutions will include a Historical Investigations Unit (HIU) to take forward investigations into Troubles-related deaths, as well as an Independent Commission on Information Retrieval (ICIR) to enable victims and survivors seek and privately receive information about Troubles-related deaths.  Good progress is being made on the establishment of these institutions which I believe will assist all victims, including the victims of collusion, in their quest for justice and the truth.</p></reply>

Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., we continue to work closely on this agenda with high level Government contacts and with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond.  The aim of these contacts is to achieve relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the US and to improve channels for legal migration between Ireland and America. The administrative measures announced last November by President Obama, which could benefit thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants based in the US, were very welcome.  I am conscious however that they remain under legal challenge in US Federal Courts and that in any case legislation in Congress is still needed to build on what has been promised in President Obama&rsquo;s announcement.  For that reason, the Government and our Embassy continue to avail of all contacts with the Administration and with Republican and Democratic political leaders to make the case for comprehensive immigration reform legislation.  To that end, I recently met with John Boehner, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and a number of his Congressional colleagues, when they visited Dublin.  The Taoiseach also met with him and we both took the opportunity to re-emphasise the Government&rsquo;s wish to see comprehensive legislative reform so as to provide relief for the undocumented Irish and a legal pathway to allow for future Irish immigration to the US.</p>  <p>  The Government has also repeatedly raised the issue of immigration reform during other high level visits with US officials. During the Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit to Washington for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, he met with President Obama, Vice President Biden as well as other senior US Administration figures and key Congressional contacts from both sides of the aisle.  These meetings provided an important opportunity to reiterate our concerns in regard to the position of the undocumented Irish, to seek further information on the detail of President Obama&rsquo;s executive action and to encourage progress on a comprehensive legislative package by Congress. </p>  <p>  I raised immigration reform issues when I met with Vice President Biden in Boston on 30 March.  I have also discussed these matters on a number of occasions recently with US Ambassador O&rsquo;Malley.</p>  <p>  The Government as a whole, including my Department in Dublin and our Embassy in Washington, will continue to actively follow up on all of the issues raised in recent contacts with the US Administration, with Congress, in particular with the Republican leadership, and with the US Embassy in Ireland.</p></reply>

The others will be on a new framework for global development at the UN in New York in September and on a new climate change agreement in Paris in December.  Taken together, they aim to deliver a new and transformative sustainable development agenda, with Sustainable Development Goals, up to 2030.  My colleague, the Minister of State for Development, Trade Promotion and North-South cooperation, Se&aacute;n Sherlock T.D., is leading the Irish delegation in Addis, which also includes representatives of the Oireachtas and civil society.  Ireland is playing a strong international role in the overall process to agree a new framework for global development to succeed the Millennium Development Goals.  The contours of agreement at Addis will need to be broad if they are to support the new set of Sustainable Development Goals to be adopted at the  Summit at the UN in New York.  Official Development Assistance (ODA) will be a vitally important element of the package, but agreement will also be needed on a much wider range of resources for development.  It will be important that all<i></i>parties contribute on an equitable basis and that we also look at measures to unlock all available sources of financing.  These must include domestic resource mobilisation, the most rapidly growing component of development finance over the last decade, taxation, science and technology and ways of involving the private sector as inclusive partners in development.  While ODA will not be sole focus of negotiations at Addis, it remains particularly important for the fight to end poverty in the Least Developed Countries.  The Government remains firmly committed to the 0.7% target for ODA and to making further progress towards it as our economic recovery consolidates.  Ireland played a vital role in the reconfirmation of the EU&rsquo;s collective commitment to reaching the 0.7% target within the timeframe of the post-2015 agenda when Development Ministers met at the Council meeting on 26<sup>th</sup>May.  The EU also agreed on the need to direct more aid to the Least Developed Countries, and especially to the poorest African countries.  Ireland is a world leader in the proportion of our aid which we provide to the poorest countries. </p><p>Ireland is committed to working with our EU and UN partners to secure an inclusive agreement at Addis that will support the new, transformative Sustainable Development Goals.</p></reply>

In my contacts, I emphasise the importance of building trust between separated prisoners and prison management in Maghaberry Prison, significantly damaged by the 2012 murder of prison officer David Black.  The way forward will be through the implementation of the recommendations of the September 2014 Stocktake Report of the Independent Assessment Team, which reviewed progress in implementing the August 2010 Maghaberry Prison Agreement.  </p>  <p>  Both the NI Prison Service and prisoners are agreed on the importance of implementing the Stocktake Report.  The appointment of a representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross as the new, independent, chair of the Prison Forum should assist progress in this regard, which to date has not moved as quickly as one would wish.  It is my understanding that representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross have been actively consulting with all parties to the Prison Forum over recent weeks, including republican and loyalist prisoners as well as prison management, to agree working methods. </p>  <p>  Strip searching, controlled movement, and detention in the Care and Supervision Unit (CSU) of Maghaberry Prison continue as points of difference and tension between prisoners and prison management.  Balances are required to be found between vindicating the rights of prisoners in very restrictive imprisonment with the duty on management to ensure an environment where the health and safety of staff and inmates are protected.  There are differences in emphasis between management and prisoners in where that balance lies, complicated by the differing responsibilities of the Department of Justice and the Northern Ireland Office on these matters.</p>  <p>  The effective address of strip searching, controlled movement, and the vindication of the rights of those in the CSU features in my regular discussions with Minister Ford and Secretary of State Villiers.  In addition, my officials actively follow-up with the relevant Departments, with the NI Prison Service, and with the Prisoner Ombudsman on these and other matters.  I am aware also that the independent chair of the Prison Forum is seized of the importance of these issues. </p></reply>

In the Government&rsquo;s recent review of foreign policy, <i>The Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World</i>, we re-affirmed our commitment to the universality, indivisibility and interrelatedness of all human rights, to accountability for human rights violations and abuses, and to the protection of those who are most vulnerable and marginalised.  Ireland attaches great importance to combating all forms of discrimination, including that based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  We firmly believe in tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.  It is of deep concern that freedom of religion and belief is in danger in many places worldwide.  Members of minority religious communities, including those of Christian, Muslim and Baha&rsquo;i faith, have been subjected to appalling levels of violence, discrimination, and harassment.  The recent rise in the number of anti-Semitic attacks worldwide is also of serious concern. Ireland works within and alongside the EU to address<i></i>the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, notably with the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief adopted during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013. These Guidelines provide EU officials with an overview of the legal and policy framework within which the right to freedom of religion or belief is protected. They also elaborate an EU strategy on how to engage with third countries on the right to freedom of religion or belief, a strategy which we hope to see bear fruit as we assess the implementation of the Guidelines.</p><p>The EU Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy 2015-2019 will be adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) on 20 July 2015.  The Action Plan forms part of the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy which was adopted by the FAC in June 2012.  Its purpose is to improve the effectiveness and consistency of the EU&rsquo;s policy and commits the EU to promoting human rights in all areas of its external action.  Responsibility for the implementation of the Action Plan is shared between the EEAS, European Commission and EU Member States.</p><p>Within the EU, Ireland pressed for the promotion of freedom of religion or belief to be included in the Action Plan, and this is now reflected as a stand-alone point with the following actions:</p><p>Ensure that freedom of religion or belief remains high on the agenda of relations with third countries, as well as in multilateral fora, in close cooperation with relevant stakeholders; promote the exchange of best practices, and deepen awareness on the various components of freedom of religion or belief at Headquarters, EU delegations and Member State embassies.</p><p>Encourage and support relevant partner countries and other stakeholders&rsquo; initiatives on freedom of religion or belief in particular those aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of persons belonging to religious minorities, enabling them to manifest their religion or belief without fear of violence, discrimination, political pressure, censorship or persecution.</p><p>Promote inter-cultural and inter-religious dialogue and the role of religious and other leaders in ensuring freedom of religion or belief.</p><p>Ireland also raises the issue of the safety of religious minorities through its official bilateral contacts with the countries in question, stressing the responsibility of the government to protect all citizens and minorities. We consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora, including the EU and UN.  I personally highlighted the issue when I addressed the UN General Assembly in New York on 29 September 2014.  I also raised it during my meetings with the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, in September 2014 and June 2015.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to actively support freedom of religion or belief across our foreign policy.</p></reply>

My concern is both about the conviction of this individual for activities which would be widely regarded here as the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of opinion and expression, and about the nature of the sentence, which included corporal punishment. Concerns about this case have been raised by the European Union on behalf of its Member States, including Ireland, with the Saudi authorities. They have also been conveyed directly to representatives of the Embassy of Saudi Arabia by my Department, most recently in June of this year.  The spokesperson of EU High Representative Mogherini issued a statement on this case in January 2015. This called on the Saudi authorities to suspend the flogging of this individual, a call which was echoed later in January by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra&rsquo;ad Al Hussein. </p><p>I have repeatedly expressed my hope that the Saudi authorities will answer these calls for this individual to be pardoned and for this harsh form of punishment to be urgently reviewed. While the flogging of this individual has thankfully not recommenced, the reports in June that his punishment has been confirmed by the Supreme Court are worrying. It remains my sincere hope that this individual will be pardoned. </p><p>Promotion of human rights and trade are important Irish foreign policy priorities pursued by the Government on behalf of our people. As with many countries, these are two aspects of a multi-faceted and positive relationship with Saudi Arabia. These economic exchanges and other contacts help create a context where we can get a hearing for our concerns.  There are very many countries around the world with whom we would have serious human rights concerns.</p><p>Ireland does not shy away from addressing human rights<font color="#004080"> </font>concerns and is very active on these issues at the UN and within the EU.

Officials from my Department have met with representatives from a number of religious and ethnic minorities since the start of the Syrian conflict. Concerns for the well-being of religious and ethnic minorities, as well as women and members of the LGBTI community, have grown in light of ISIS&rsquo;s campaigns, which pose a threat to the survival of ethnic and sectarian minorities.  I raised these concerns during my address to the UN General Assembly in New York and condemned all forms of persecution or discrimination based on religion or belief, and specifically highlighted the persecution of religious minorities in the Middle East as well as the rise of anti-Semitic attacks in European countries. Ireland also condemned the threats to religious minorities in a recent Security Council debate at the UN. </p>  <p>  While Ireland does offer resettlement to vulnerable persons though the UNHCR, asylum in Ireland or in Europe cannot provide the solution to this problem, because the numbers are too great, because there are others also at risk, and because this would bring the life of these ancient communities in their homeland to an irreversible end.

In the Government&rsquo;s recent review of foreign policy, <i>The Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World</i>, we re-affirmed our commitment to the universality, indivisibility and interrelatedness of all human rights, to accountability for human rights violations and abuses, and to the protection of those who are most vulnerable and marginalised.  Together with our EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world. We do this on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official channels and non-governmental/civil society organisations. Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.  We do this bilaterally, through the EU or via the positions we take at the UN General Assembly and in the UN Human Rights Council.  We support the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses.  This includes support for the role of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, the Special Procedure Mandate Holders and for the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council. The EU regularly makes statements at these bodies on the human rights situations in individual countries and Ireland is fully associated with these statements. The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.</p><p>Since March 2006, when the UN Human Rights Council was formed, Ireland has engaged proactively with the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism initiated by the Council. The UPR mechanism allows for the review of the domestic human rights records of all 193 UN Member States approximately every four and a half years, based on human rights obligations under UN human rights and other instruments. Any UN Member State can take part in the interactive dialogue (i.e. the actual examination of the State under review) and submit written questions in advance. Ireland was itself examined under the UPR process on 6 October 2011. </p><p>The process enables UN Member States to raise issues, some of which would have been identified by members of the public and civil society, and to make recommendations about the protection and promotion of human rights in the State concerned.  Ireland has engaged fully with the UPR process and welcomes the open and constructive dialogue associated with it. We have also made numerous interventions during the UPR examination of other states, raising issues of concern such as gender-based violence, freedom of expression, religious freedom, freedom of assembly, and the protection of human rights defenders within the State under review.</p><p>The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law.  In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.  In June 2012 the EU adopted a Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy.</p><p>Ireland and its EU partners have been strong and consistent supporters of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. The Court&rsquo;s Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of country situations and we will continue to monitor this work closely.</p><p>Ireland has also consistently taken the lead in negotiating resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly and in the Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015, on the promotion and protection of human rights defenders, as well as on the implementation of EU Guidelines in relation to human rights defenders in third countries, the aim being to ensure that the latter can operate in an environment free from hindrance and insecurity.</p><p>The promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms has always been a cornerstone of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme. Ireland&rsquo;s new policy on international development, &lsquo;One World One Future&rsquo;, reaffirms the centrality of human rights to Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and aid programme, and commits to ensuring that human rights principles and standards are promoted, protected and integrated in all of our development efforts. The Government&rsquo;s development cooperation programme, Irish Aid, addresses the root causes of poverty and exclusion by focussing on the most vulnerable and promoting their participation, representation, and the means to realise their rights.  This includes investing in the improvement and expansion of essential services, and support to organisations that promote human rights, governance, and democracy in developing countries, including civil society and the UN office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.  Mindful that the risk of human rights violations is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak, Irish Aid promotes access to justice and supports the strengthening of government institutions, parliaments, and independent media, and national human rights institutions.  </p><p>The Government will continue to avail of all the above-mentioned mechanisms and instruments with a view to highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.</p></reply>

Ireland's humanitarian response is underpinned a strong commitment to the humanitarian principles of independence, neutrality, impartiality and humanity. The international community is currently challenged by an unprecedented scale of humanitarian need globally, with 80 per cent of those in need of humanitarian assistance living in situations of conflict.  Ireland&rsquo;s Official Development Assistance budget includes specific funding to enable Irish Aid to respond to emergencies.  Last year, we dedicated &euro;85 million to provide lifesaving humanitarian aid to vulnerable people across the world, including those affected by conflict.  In March, Ireland pledged further funding of &euro;12 million to help meet the urgent needs of those affected by the Syria conflict in 2015. <i>This will bring the total value of the Government&rsquo;s response to the crisis in Syria to over &euro;41 million</i>.  This year we have also provided humanitarian funding in response to the needs of conflict-affected people Libya and Yemen. In addition, we are responding to the humanitarian situation in Northern Nigeria, where conflict has displaced civilian populations and has affected neighbouring countries, Chad and Cameroon.  We will continue to respond to the effects of conflict in other regions, including South Sudan and Central African Republic.</p><p>At a global level, Ireland is a major supporter of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which is often the best placed to provide assistance in conflict situations and where other organisations cannot operate, such as Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan. Last year, Ireland provided over &euro;9 million to the ICRC to support its global operations in conflict contexts and we intend to maintain this level of support in 2015. </p><p>On 2 July, I addressed the first ever Irish Humanitarian Summit, which took place in UCD and was opened by President Higgins. One of the key themes which emerged was the importance of serving the needs of people affected by conflict.  Ireland will continue to highlight this issue in the lead up to the World Humanitarian Summit, an initiative of the UN Secretary General, which will be held in Istanbul in May 2016.  </p></reply>

In that context, it is unsurprising that public confidence in the EU should have fallen. This, of course, is a concern for those who support the European project and something which, alongside the Governments of fellow EU Member States and the leaders of the EU institutions, we are working to address. The growth of Euroscepticism must be taken seriously, but it should not be overstated. In last year&rsquo;s European elections, the vast majority of the European electorate endorsed pro-European parties and candidates, while Eurosceptics recorded significant gains in several larger Member States they made little impact in many others, losing a share of the vote in several cases.  Since the election, a new European Commission has been appointed, headed by President Jean Claude Juncker, as well as a new High Representative and a new President of the European Council. The &lsquo;&lsquo;refresh&rsquo;&rsquo; of the institutions has presented an opportunity to refocus the work of the EU and to strengthen engagement with the public. To date, the new institutions appear to be doing just that, with President Juncker making good on his commitment to develop a Commission which is &lsquo;&rsquo;more ambitious on big things and more modest on little things&rsquo;&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  It is encouraging to note that the latest Eurobaromoter surveys report public confidence and trust in the EU to be rising. It is particularly welcome that, according to the study, Ireland has registered the most significant increases in positive public assessment of the EU.     </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to building public understanding and knowledge about Ireland&rsquo;s EU membership.  </p>  <p>  The Department of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Estimates include an allocation of &euro;250,000 for supporting EU engagement. These funds support the activities of local community groups and non-governmental organisations through the Communicating Europe Initiative, contribute to the activities of European Movement Ireland and finance the very successful Blue Star EU Education Programme. </p>  <p>  The Department also works closely with the Representation of the European Commission Representation and the European Parliament Information Office in Dublin to improve communications on EU issues in Ireland and promote greater understanding of the EU.  </p></reply>

Restrictive measures taken in response to the illegal annexation of Crimea have also been extended for another year, until June 2016.The package of measures agreed in Minsk remains the best opportunity for a sustainable and lasting peace. The EU continues to press for a genuine and complete ceasefire, the removal of heavy weapons and progress on the political elements of the Minsk Agreements, including arrangements for local elections in eastern Ukraine.

This Conflict Resolution Unit works closely with our Permanent Missions to the United Nations, the European Union, the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe as well as with the relevant departments of those bodies to prevent and resolve conflicts, including many conflicts in which religion may be a factor.The Conflict Resolution Unit supports the work of a number of international non-governmental organisations dedicated to the promotion of peaceful co-existence of groups from different traditions, and to the resolution of conflicts in various parts of the world.  The Unit is also committed to advancing the peaceful resolution of conflicts through the sharing of lessons learned from the experience of conflict resolution on the island of Ireland. An important element of such lesson-sharing is related to the experience of the Good Friday Agreement in promoting respect for different traditions as an essential element of fostering dialogue, tolerance and peace. I am strongly of the view, which I believe is widely shared in this house, that religion should be a factor in promoting peaceful co-existence and social harmony rather than a source of divisions. Ireland is a consistent supporter of freedom of religion and belief in international bodies and sees the legitimate exercise of such rights as a tool for the promotion of understanding and mutual respect.</p></reply>

Local Market Teams were established in each of these, chaired by the local Ambassador and consisting of representatives of the Embassy and the relevant State agencies present on the ground. These market teams submit annual market plans that are reviewed by the Export Trade Council, which I chair, and which encourages cooperation between all Government Departments and State agencies that work on trade, tourism, investment and education promotion.</p><p>In the Review of the Government Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy, published in February last year, seven additional high potential and exploratory markets were identified as part of a &lsquo;new market approach&rsquo;, aimed at increasing our engagement with high growth markets in Asia, Latin America and Africa. The markets in question are as follows; Turkey, Indonesia, Nigeria, Mexico, Vietnam, Thailand and Chile.</p><p>Ireland now has a presence in all but one of the above markets. Guided by the Review, new Embassies have been opened in Bangkok (Thailand), Jakarta (Indonesia), Nairobi (Kenya) and Zagreb (Croatia), alongside the reopening of Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy to the Holy See. Consulates-General have also been opened in Hong Kong (China), Austin (Texas, USA) and in Sao Paulo (Brazil). These new Embassies and Consulates will strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to take advantage of emerging opportunities in these important markets, as well as complementing the existing trade promotion work of our Embassy network. </p><p>Notable examples of successful Local Market Teams&rsquo; efforts to push for greater international market access for Irish products include Ireland being granted access for its beef in both the US and Chinese markets. In the context of enhanced air access, my Department and the Embassy network was to the fore in delivering the recent announcement of Ethiopian Airlines&rsquo; new service from Addis Ababa to Los Angeles, via Dublin. This is the first direct flight between Ireland and the African continent and represents a significant opportunity for Ireland.</p><p>Both at home and abroad, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to work in cooperation with other Government Departments in promoting Ireland&rsquo;s trade, tourism, investment and education efforts. In addition to supporting the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s 2025 Agrifood Strategy, my Department is also closely involved in the implementation of the International Financial Services Strategy, launched in March this year. </p><p>The Embassy network plays a crucial role in proactively addressing market access issues, supporting Irish businesses seeking to grow overseas, holding promotional events for, and in association with, State agencies and actively contributing to the organisation and conduct of Enterprise Ireland Ministerial-led trade missions and events overseas.</p><p>In terms of the level of Irish trade with overseas markets, the Central Statistics Office maintains a website, , on which the most recent trade statistics are made available to the public. </p></reply>

We believe that the prospect of Union membership encourages countries to work together for a more prosperous and stable future, and helps to overcome the bitter legacies of past conflicts. The European Union has Delegations to the countries of the Western Balkans, and Member States receive regular updates from them on a variety of local and regional issues.  The countries of the Western Balkans feature regularly on the agendas of the Council, and of its working groups. The annual Progress Reports produced by the European Commission in the early autumn provide an invaluable assessment of the progress within individual countries in respect of the aquis, and allow Member States an opportunity to examine in a systematic way the areas where greater work is needed, as well as where real progress has been demonstrated. </p></reply>

The long Israeli election campaign was one factor in this hiatus, but the formation of a new Government in May has not imparted any new momentum.</p>  <p>  It is only fair to recognize that the EU, and other international players, has been deeply engaged also in a succession of other crises in the Middle East and elsewhere. Nonetheless, I have argued consistently at EU level that we cannot leave the MEPP to one side: the situation is highly unstable and continuing to deteriorate on the ground, such that the very feasibility of the two state solution we have so long worked for is now in doubt. The destructive war in Gaza last summer illustrated clearly that a political vacuum will be filled by other, more dangerous forces.</p>  <p>  I believe therefore that the international community needs again to press the parties to come together in a genuine process to end the conflict. To that end, starting at EU level, I have urged the EU to re-examine its policies on the MEPP and seek to make them more effective. That discussion began at the Foreign Affairs Council in May, but it needs to continue.</p></reply>

This requires a wide range of actions including security responses to deny ISIS the freedom to attack civilians, action by the Iraqi Government to promote inclusivity and ensure real Sunni representation within Iraq&rsquo;s political system and Government, as well as achieving a political resolution to the Syrian conflict. Humanitarian relief is also a critical component of the response to mass displacement of civilians fleeing the threat from ISIS and other terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq.</p>  <p>  Following a special meeting of the European Council in February 2015, EU Heads of State and Government set out a range of priorities to guide further work by the Foreign Affairs and Justice and Home Affairs Councils.  These priorities were set out under three headings: ensuring the security of citizens, preventing radicalisation and safeguarding values, and cooperating with our international partners.  </p>  <p>  The approach being taken by the European Union is consistent with the provisions of UN Security Council Resolution 2178 (2014) on foreign terrorist fighters which was adopted unanimously on 24 September 2014.  Ireland co-sponsored the Resolution along with 103 other States, including all other EU member states. </p>  <p>  UN Security Council Resolutions, including 1373, 2170 and 2178 provide a comprehensive framework of measures to address the threat of terrorism including through taking active steps to prevent travel by persons suspected of planning or intending to participate in terrorist acts; cooperation in exchanging information on actions and movement of terrorists; prevention of recruitment and radicalisation of possible members of such groups, and denying financial transfers to individual terrorists and terrorist groups. </p>  <p>  Ireland supports the comprehensive approach being taken at UN and EU levels to preventing and countering terrorism.  We support the need for measures to be human rights-compliant and in accordance with international law and have stressed the need to tackle underlying factors that contribute to radicalisation and terrorism and in particular the importance of the link between security and development.  </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support all international efforts, including by the EU and UN, to promote a political resolution of the current conflict in both Syria and Iraq. We will also continue to address the humanitarian consequences of the conflict and provide urgent assistance and support to the civilian populations within Syria and Iraq who have been displaced or suffered violations of their rights at the hands of ISIS and other extremists.  </p></reply>

This has had a catastrophic impact on the people of Libya, with the number of internally displaced persons having doubled since September 2014. Libya has been discussed by the EU Foreign Affairs Council on eight occasions since the elections which took place in 2014.  The EU has repeatedly called for all parties to end the conflict and give their support to the UN-led negotiations process led by Mr Bernardino Leon, the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General for Libya. The EU has also addressed the serious humanitarian consequences of the conflict and its appalling impact on the Libyan people.  While Leon has reported slow but steady progress in the talks process, a political deal remains elusive and violence continues to plague the country. Reports last week of escalating violence in the city of Benghazi are deeply concerning. </p>  <p>  I reiterate Ireland&rsquo;s full support for the UN brokered talks. I hope that, with the full participation of all relevant actors, these negotiations will lead to an agreement on a government of national unity and a sustainable ceasefire. I believe that such a political agreement achieved through dialogue is the best hope for restoring effective governance, and law and order to Libya. </p></reply>

We are therefore monitoring developments very closely, engaging with our British counterparts and doing all we can to help to ensure that the UK remains in the EU. For my part and that of my Department, this includes regular engagement at political level with the British Foreign Secretary and ongoing diplomatic engagement through our Embassy in London, Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels and across the member states of the European Union and beyond. At home and abroad, we also engage with a large cross-section of opinion leaders and members of civil society engaged in this debate.  I met in Dublin with the British Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond MP, on 19 June. Building on the regular exchanges we have had since last year, we discussed the current negotiations in the light of the re-appointment of Prime Minister Cameron in May and I outlined the Irish approach in detail. </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach met with Prime Minister Cameron in London on 18 June. Both my meeting with the Foreign Secretary and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s meeting with the Prime Minister were very positive and constructive. We have made clear to our UK colleagues how much value we attach to the fact that both our countries are members of the EU. We have said that without necessarily agreeing on all points, Ireland will be as helpful in the negotiations as we can be.  </p>  <p>  The issue is also of importance to our partners in the EU, and indeed to the EU as a whole.  It arises frequently in discussions with my EU counterparts, not just at Council meetings but also in bilateral encounters.  Furthermore, it is of obvious interest to governments outside of the EU and the matter is raised with me regularly by my counterparts around the world. </p>  <p>  At the European Council on 25 to 26 June, Prime Minister Cameron presented a brief outline of his proposals for possible changes to EU policy and legislation. A lengthy debate did not take place at that meeting but partners agreed that consultations would be undertaken to see how the proposals might be taken forward. The outcome of that process will be reviewed by the European Council in December. </p>  <p>  The government welcomes the recent publication by the Joint Committee on EU Affairs on the subject of the EU-UK relationship. It acknowledges that British membership is important not just for Ireland, but for the EU as a whole. The report makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of the issues at stake and is a powerful symbol of the cross-party consensus that Ireland is best served by our closest neighbour and friend remaining in the Union. </p>  <p>  The Government fully recognises that the economic dimension to this issue is particularly significant. Regular contact is maintained with business groups who also understand how crucial common EU membership is for the Irish-British bilateral economic relationship. Further work is being undertaken to enhance that understanding, including research that the Department of Finance has commissioned from the Economic and Social Research Institute on macro-economic links between the UK and Ireland in the context of joint membership of the EU.</p>  <p>  More widely, Government Departments are also very much engaged on the matter and have been so for some time. Preparatory work has already been undertaken on the issues that might arise for Ireland. This has included an examination of the policy areas that might be affected by a change in the nature of the EU-UK relationship, including a possible British exit from the Union. I want to emphasise, however, that the main focus of our work has been on examining how to secure British membership of the Union. That will continue to be the case.</p></reply>

Ongoing political instability and dysfunction as demonstrated by the boycott of parliament by the opposition since December 2012 and the wire-tapping scandal have been a cause for concern, and violent clashes in May between police and an alleged terrorist group brought the overall situation to international attention.  Talks between the leaders of the political parties have been facilitated variously by MEPS, the EU and US Ambassadors, and Commissioner Hahn, who brokered an initial agreement on 2 June. We view this agreement as a first step to addressing the political crisis: it sets out commitments by the leaders of the four main political parties to democratic principles, good neighbourly relations and good inter-ethnic relations, as well as to tackling rule of law issues. </p>  <p>  The EU has urged the political leaders of Macedonia to implement the agreement, and to address breaches of fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>  <p>  In the interests of Macedonia and the wider Western Balkan region, Ireland continues to support the country on its accession path and we urge the four leaders of the main political parties to continue engaging constructively to resolve outstanding issues. We fully support the EU&rsquo;s efforts, and welcome the fact that regular reporting on progress is expected.</p>  <p>  We feel that the engagement of the EU is particularly important at this time, and welcome the work of Commissioner Hahn and the MEPs in brokering the agreement of 2 June. We continue to work with our European partners to seek a resolution to these outstanding issues, and to monitor the situation closely.</p>  <p>  It is the view of the European Union that the European perspective granted to the countries of the Western Balkans, including Macedonia, by the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003 is an important factor in maintaining local and regional stability. Macedonia is a candidate country for EU membership, and as such, the prevailing domestic political climate is of direct relevance to the EU, which maintains close contact with the country, including through its delegation office in Skopje. </p></reply>

That strategy is based on two clear objectives: firstly to see this individual released by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland and, secondly, to provide consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention.  The Government has already formally supported applications by the citizen&rsquo;s legal team for both release on bail and release under the Presidential decree on foreign prisoners. However, any decision to release him will ultimately be taken by the Egyptian authorities. </p>  <p>  I am aware of various submissions that have been made to the Department and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade by NGOs and law firms, advocating a more adversarial and legalistic approach. My Department has always been cognisant of the international legal framework that may be relevant to this case. While the legal submissions received will of course be considered, all action taken by the Department will be guided by our ongoing consideration of what stands the best chance of contributing to positive progress for the Irish citizen at the earliest possible time.</p>  <p>  It is the Government's considered view, supported by decades of diplomatic experience in other consular cases and extensive consultation with states which have had citizens in similar circumstances, that the firm and measured diplomatic approach we are taking remains, at this time, this individual&rsquo;s best hope for return to Ireland at the earliest possible date.

The main purpose of this measurement is to identify the distance that a child resides from their nearest school and to assess if they meet the distance eligibility criterion for school transport.  In the interests of equity, this is applied on a consistent standard basis across the country.  </p><p>A minimum number of 10 eligible children residing in a distinct locality, as determined by Bus &Eacute;ireann, are required before consideration may be given to the establishment or retention of school transport services, provided this can be done within reasonable cost limits. </p><p>Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that, to date, the number of applicants for school transport, to the school in question, for the 2015/16 school year has fallen below the minimum number required to retain the existing service.</p><p>Families of eligible children, for whom there is no school transport service available, are eligible for the remote area grant towards the cost of making private transport arrangements.</p><p>Children who are not eligible for school transport, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only, which is subject to a number of conditions including the availability of spare seats on an existing service and payment of the annual charge.</p></reply>

The measures schools take in this regard are required to be stated in the school plan. It is the duty of the Board of Management to ensure that appropriate education services are made available to such students. </p><p>Schools at both primary and second level use strategies such as curriculum differentiation, curriculum enrichment and acceleration to facilitate the development of pupils who are exceptionally able.</p><p>Syllabi and curricula for second-level schools have been designed in such a way to enable teachers cater for the wide range of pupil ability. The revised primary curriculum recognises the importance of developing the full potential of the child and caters for pupil diversity, including meeting the needs of exceptionally able pupils. </p><p>Enabling children to learn how to learn is stressed and facilitated. The development of language skills, investigatory and problem-solving skills, higher-order thinking skills and working individually, and as a member of a group, are all encouraged at both levels. </p><p>Support for teachers to assist them in meeting the needs of all pupils with special educational needs, including those pupils who are exceptionally able, is available through the Special Education Support Service (SESS) and the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST).</p><p>Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that the allocation of a child to a particular class in a school is a matter for the authorities of the school following consultation, as appropriate, with the child's parents. A decision to allocate a child to a class out of normal sequence may be made by the school following detailed consultation with the parents and following careful consideration of the child's age and their educational and social needs. The level of provision available should enable pupils to make progress in keeping with their needs and abilities and to move consecutively through the different class levels in the school along with their peers.</p><p>The criteria for entry to Post Primary school are set out in the Rules and Programmes for Secondary Schools. If any part of the criteria are not met, the matter would be referred to my Department's Inspectorate for investigation and recommendation. </p></reply>

One aspect of this Agreement relates to supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and as both Unions that represent SNAs namely, SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to the Haddington Road Agreement, my Department has implemented supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs. </p><p>The first part of the LRC proposals for supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs outlines that the supplementary assignment arrangements only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant.  Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school/ETB.</p><p>The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for the 2015/2016 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0041/2015 which issued on 12 June 2015 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address: </p><p>Once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service (Service in a substitute capacity i.e. covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job-sharing etc. does not count) is notified by his/her employer that s/he is to be made redundant then s/he shall be deemed to be a member of a supplementary assignment panel for SNAs. </p><p>The operation of this panel is described and outlined in Circular 0041/2015 and it is designed to be as flexible as possible which enables all eligible SNAs, who have the requisite Panel Form 1 completed by their former employer, to apply for any SNA position that is advertised by a school or an ETB with no sectoral, diocesan or geographical limitations imposed.  It does not work on a list basis.  Every eligible SNA will remain on the panel for two years with a view to getting further employment.  If they are not successful over that period of time in obtaining a further SNA position then they will be eligible for a Redundancy payment.  Furthermore, an SNA may opt out of this supplementary assignment panel at any point in time triggering the processing of his/her redundancy payment in line with the terms set out in the SNA redundancy scheme (DES Circular 58/06) or any revision of same that is applicable at that time.</p><p>It is important to note that when an employer has a vacancy to fill, they must undertake the recruitment process in accordance with the provisions outlined in paragraphs 15-22 of Circular 41/2015.</p><p>Finally, my Department has set up a dedicated e-mail address to deal with all queries in relation to the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel and any queries in respect of the operation of the Panel can be directed to this dedicated e-mail address: snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie</p></reply>

In reaching this decision, the Patron and schools had available to them an independent technical report that reviewed the curricular capacity of both school buildings and sites. A separate technical report completed by my Department has also been made available that supports the Patron's decision. Whilst deficits of accommodation in both buildings were identified, the independent report recommended that one of the school buildings was the location that "requires the least amount of re-modelling of the existing structure and has the potential for expansion to accommodate a combined curriculum and additional teaching spaces". The Patron has advised my Department that they accept the report's recommendations.</p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that funding for a significant extension project has been approved in principle in recent days to facilitate the proposed amalgamation of the schools concerned, which are proposing to amalgamate from September 2016. This extension includes for the provision of a science laboratory, business studies/commerce room, technology room with associated preparation areas and three interlinked standard classrooms. This extension is expected to significantly enhance the accommodation available to the amalgamated school. The position of the prefabs, referred to by the Deputy, which are on the site in question will be addressed as part of the extension project.</p>  <p>  To also facilitate the amalgamation, a site extension to the existing site in question has been agreed under a lease agreement at a nominal rate and this arrangement will be reviewed in 5 years. This site extension includes the gardens, referred to, and significantly enhances the school site in question.</p>  <p>  The Department is aware that the amalgamated school will not have access to a PE hall. As the Deputy will appreciate, due to the competing demands on my Department's capital budget imposed by the need to prioritise available funding for the provision of essential school classroom accommodation, it is not possible at this point to provide an indicative timeframe for the provision of funding towards a PE hall for the school concerned. However I understand that the school concerned will continue to have access for PE purposes to a swimming pool, the rowing club and a local hall.</p>  <p>  In relation to the future use of the remaining building, the Patron has advised that they have not formulated proposals for its future use, but consider that the buildings would be suitable for alternative education use.</p>  <p>  Finally, I understand that a Steering Group has been established to support the amalgamation process.  It is understood that this Group has nominees of parents, teachers and members of the Boards of Management of both schools. It is also understood that from September next, both schools will cooperate closely in terms of curricular provision.</p></reply>

When state monies were provided to facilitate building works to school property owned by a third party, a legal mechanism had to be put in place in order to protect the State's interest. This was known as a Charging Lease or Declaration of Trust. These leases protect the Minister's capital investment in the school property and require that the property be used as a school for a set period.</p><p>As a result of negotiations in the late 1990's on the reconstitution of Boards of Management, an agreement was reached whereby patrons agreed to cede representatives on the Boards of Management in lieu of the Department agreeing to insert a Deed of Variation into the existing property lease. The Deed of Variation refers to a change in the terms of a charging lease or Declaration of Trust. The objective of this Deed of Variation is to provide security for the denominational ethos of a school in cases where a patron or trustee owns the property. Discussions have taken place with the relevant patron bodies over the years to obtain a mutually acceptable solution which meets this objective and these discussions are ongoing. </p><p>Section 15 of the Education Act, 1998 provides that a board of management shall manage the school on behalf of the patron and uphold, and be accountable to the patron for so upholding, the characteristic spirit of the school as determined by the cultural, educational, moral, religious, social, linguistic and spiritual values and traditions which inform and are characteristic of the objectives and conduct of the school.</p><p>In relation to school admissions, parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p><p>Schools are not permitted to discriminate against an applicant for admission on any of the grounds set out in the Equal Status Act, 2000.  However, the Equal Status Act provides that an educational establishment does not discriminate where the establishment is a school providing primary or post-primary education to students and the objective of the school is to provide education in an environment which promotes certain religious values, it admits persons of a particular religious denomination in preference to others or it refuses to admit as a student a person who is not of that denomination and, in the case of a refusal, it is proved that the refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school. Schools that comply with the requirements of the equality legislation do not therefore discriminate on religious grounds.</p><p>The recently published Education (Admission to Schools) Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation. However, the Bill provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion while including provision for single sex schools and denominational schools to reflect, in their admission policy, the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation.</p><p>The Bill also provides for schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.</p><p>Furthermore, the patronage determination process for new schools requires prospective patrons to commit to enrolling pupils from the area to be served by the new school.</p></reply>

An appeals process is available to small schools in the event that they can show that their projected enrolments are sufficient to allow them to retain their classroom teacher in the longer term.

Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. The Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations.  Guidance counsellors have two distinct functions. The first is general career guidance and guidance on the educational opportunities a child or young person might pursue, while the second involves support for students' well-being. The principal and leadership of a school have the best knowledge and experience to determine how exactly guidance resources and teaching resources should be allocated.</p>  <p>  The representative organisations for school principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation. This approach puts a greater emphasis on group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle and maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support.</p>  <p>  There are also a range of other supports available to promote and support the wellbeing of students. NEPS psychologists are available to offer their advice and support to schools in establishing and developing School Support Teams. The extension of the NEPS service to all mainstream schools since September 2013 also puts it in a good position to provide advice to the Teams in regard to students with particular difficulties and on onward referral or liaison with other community based services that also have a role in providing service to schools. Student Support Teams in Post-Primary Schools (DES 2014) is a NEPS booklet to promote the well-being of pupils in post-primary schools.</p>  <p>  Wellbeing Guidelines for Post-Primary and more recently for Primary Schools have been produced by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research. They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. </p>  <p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the proposals on the reform of the junior cycle envisage a new subject on "wellbeing" being studied by all pupils.</p>  <p>  I have repeatedly argued that improvements to the staffing and funding of our schools must be a priority as the economic recovery takes hold. The last Budget included an increase in spending on education for the first time in recent years, amounting to additional funding of &euro;60m during 2015. </p></reply>

I would however like to inform the Deputy that my Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting the work of schools in promoting positive mental health and to supporting those with the broad range of problems, behavioural, emotional and social who might be considered within the broad term of mental health difficulties.</p>  <p>  The processes span the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional development for teachers. It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance and counselling services, and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally. Schools also engage in a wide range of sport and cultural co-curricular activities which provide an important opportunity for students to experience success and personal growth. </p>  <p>  Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory part of the curriculum in primary schools and in junior cycle since 2003 and is designed to promote positive mental health. It is supported by comprehensive teacher guidelines and curriculum support services which provide training and advice for schools and a resource directory. My Department has also issued guidelines to schools on the development of whole-school policies in areas such as anti-bullying, relationship and sexuality education, substance misuse, managing critical incidents, whole-school guidance planning etc. which are also important in promoting positive mental health.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that I and my colleague, Minister of State Kathleen Lynch, launched "Well-being in primary schools - Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion" on 29th January 2015. The 'Well-Being in Post-Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention' were published by my Department in 2013. Both guidelines provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated whole school way.</p>  <p>  In 2011 responsibility for the School Completion Programme (SCP) transferred to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. Since January 2014 the School Completion Programme has been administered by TUSLA on behalf of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA).</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with other Government Departments in relation to the delivery of services to children in schools. </p></reply>

Commentary and correspondence on the examination from teachers, professional bodies and other interested parties is considered by the Chief Examiner in developing the draft marking scheme. </p>  <p>  The State Examinations Commission has assured me that, as is normal practice, prior to finalising the marking scheme, it will initially apply the draft marking scheme to a random sample of scripts so as to test the effectiveness of the examination paper and the scheme in setting and maintaining standards year on year. The outcomes of the random sampling will be analysed and if the outcomes indicate that the paper and/or the marking scheme is too hard or too easy the marking scheme will be adjusted to take account of this. This will ensure consistency in the marking of the examination and fairness to all candidates.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that there is no intention to set an examination paper that is not suitable to the mathematics curriculum which ordinary level students have studied. The paper is devised specifically for the needs of ordinary level students and reflects the content in the ordinary level syllabus.</p></reply>

The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.  </p><p>The Circular sets out the role of medical/other professional reports and recommendations by medical/other professionals in the context of consideration of applications for SNA support by the NCSE. The Circular explains that, while professional reports provide valuable assistance to education providers in identifying a diagnosis or identifying appropriate interventions, responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational supports and resources to be allocated to schools to support pupils with special educational needs resides with the NCSE through the SENO.</p><p>Professional reports are provided to the NCSE as part of the application process through multiple channels including my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), Department of Health/HSE practitioners as well as private practitioners. As SNAs are allocated on the basis of meeting the qualifying criteria, which includes provision of professional reports, it is not possible to state whether or if there are waiting lists for such assessments.</p><p>However, should the parents of the child, the subject of this question, have specific concerns about his/her educational progress I would advise in the first instance that they speak to the Principal of the school with a view to raising these concerns with the school's assigned NEPS psychologist.</p><p>All schools were asked to apply for SNA support for the 2015/16 school year by 18th March 2015. The NCSE also continued to accept applications after this date in recognition that enrolments may not have been completed or where assessments were not completed. </p><p>The NCSE has now published details of SNA allocations for schools for September 2015 on its website. The NCSE will have some capacity to consider applications from schools throughout the school year for new assessments of disability, new entrants, or emergency or late applications, in accordance with the terms of the SNA scheme. </p><p>All schools have the contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

The criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school managements annually and are available on the Department website. </p><p>The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school authority, subject to procedures agreed under Section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998 (as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012). The deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the school management authorities. </p><p>The Statistics Section of my Department's website contains extensive data relating to schools at primary and post-primary level, including teacher numbers. The most recent published information relates to the 2014/15 school year.</p><p>240 surplus permanent/CID holding teachers were redeployed through the primary redeployment panels for the 2015/16 school year.  Over 2,000 fixed term (temporary/substitute) and part-time teachers were placed on the supplementary redeployment panels at primary level. At post primary level 86 post primary teachers were redeployed for the 2015/16 school year including those redeployed under a voluntary pilot scheme in Munster. </p><p>After the redeployment process has transacted, each school is permitted to fill any remaining vacancies through open recruitment. This is managed and organised at individual school level.</p><p>The policy of my Department is to ensure, as far as possible, that the Managerial Authorities of schools give priority to unemployed registered teachers who are fully qualified when filling vacant teaching posts. My Department has issued a number of Circulars addressing this issue in recent years. </p><p>Information on the number of teachers who are graduating in 2015 who will have no post in September 2015 is not available in my Department. </p><p>We have a growing population of young people in this country and despite the difficult financial circumstances we face as a country, we prioritised education so that the number of teachers we have in the system has also grown in order to protect pupil teacher ratios. There were a thousand more teachers employed in schools around the country in the last school year, than there was the year before. There will be a further increase of circa 1,300 teachers in the current school year. This is a very significant investment at a time of scarce resources.</p><p>My focus in Budget 2015 was on obtaining the additional funding that was necessary to provide for demographic growth. The last Budget included an increase in spending on education for the first time in recent years, amounting to additional funding of &euro;60m during 2015. This funding will be used to provide 1,700 additional teachers and SNAs for our schools, as well as to fund prioritised reforms, such as implementation of the literacy and numeracy strategy, reform of junior cycle, and the introduction of education focussed pre-school inspections. The improvements in the Primary Staffing Schedule for small schools which I announced in February last are the only changes that I will be making to the staffing arrangements for schools for the 2015/16 school year.</p><p>While there has been a moratorium on recruitment across other sectors in the public service, this has not applied to teaching and shows the commitment this Government has to educating our future generations. The main priority for any additional resources for the foreseeable future will be to cater for the continuing increase in demographics at all levels in the education system. I am determined that education should be prioritised for investment as our economy recovers and I will be seeking to agree a set of priorities for such increased investment into the future. </p><p>The challenge for all schools is to ensure that they utilise their allocated resources to best effect to maximise teaching and learning outcomes.</p></reply>

The Code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years.The publishers have also given assurances that they will sell textbooks to schools at discounts so that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock book rental schemes.Book rental schemes are the most effective method of reducing the costs of school books for parents across the country.In total, we have invested &euro;15.6m specifically on expanding book rental schemes in primary schools.This is on top of the &euro;15m spent annually on book grants for all schools, which can be used for the maintenance and upkeep of book rental stock.</p>  <p>  The National Parents' Council surveyed the views of their members in relation to currently operating book rental schemes. Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools.Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child. This Government has shown a clear commitment to investing in book rental schemes. </p>  <p>  School uniforms are a more challenging area for Government to tackle, as the type of approach we are taking in relation to book rental schemes cannot be replicated for school uniforms. Nevertheless, I strongly believe that lowering costs should be the primary factor in school uniform policies.It is of course up to each individual school to decide their own policy.However, I want to see greater consultation and great involvement of parents in these decisions.And so that is my focus in this area &ndash; giving parents a greater say in school policies that affect them.</p>  <p>  In relation to voluntary contributions, these are requested by many, but not all, schools in Ireland.There is the clear need for parents to know that such contributions must be voluntary &ndash; there can be no compunction involved.  However, I acknowledge that capitation reductions in recent years have impacted on the extent of voluntary contributions.</p>  <p>  The funding of our schools, along with class sizes, are two of the areas I have been very clear in saying that additional investment is needed.</p>  <p>  These are the areas I will be pursuing relentlessly in the coming months as we prepare for the Budget.</p></reply>

Under the patronage divestment process, what is more usually involved is the reorganisation of existing schools which can free up provision to facilitate the opening of a new school under alternative patronage, either in an existing or an alternative school premises. </p><p>  There are two cases of actual changes of patronage for existing schools since 2011.  In 2011, with the death of the Earl of Dunraven, patronage of St Nicholas Church of Ireland School, Adare, Co. Limerick passed to the Countess of Dunraven and Mount Earl, Geraldine Dunraven.  In 2014, patronage of Newtownwhite National School, in Ballina, Co. Mayo, was divested to &quot;Educate Together&quot; from the Church of Ireland Bishop of Tuam, Killala and Achonry.  The divested school is now known as &quot;Newtownwhite Educate Together NS&quot;.</p><p>  Nine schools have opened under the patronage divesting process to date.  In 2013, an Educate Together school opened in temporary premises in Dublin 2 and then moved to a former Edmund Rice School building in Basin Lane, Dublin 8 in September 2014.</p><p>  Also in 2014, four schools commenced operation under the patronage of Educate Together.  These schools are located in Trim, Co. Meath, Tramore, Co. Waterford, Malahide/Portmarnock, Co. Dublin and Newtownwhite, County Mayo.  The latter resulted from the transfer of patronage from the Church of Ireland, as mentioned above.  </p><p>Four new multi-denominational primary schools are expected to open in September 2015 under the patronage divestment process.  The first three of these schools will operate under the patronage of Educate Together in Tuam, Co. Galway, Castlebar, Co. Mayo and New Ross, Co. Wexford.  The fourth school will be a Gaelscoil operating under the patronage of An Foras Patr&uacute;nachta and will be located in Birr, Co. Offaly. </p><p>  This process has been underway since the publication of the &quot;Report on the surveys regarding parental preferences on primary school patronage&quot; in April 2013.</p></reply>

My Department identifies the requirement to establish new schools based on demographic requirements.  When my Department identifies the requirement for a new school in an area, the requirement is publicised and applications are invited from prospective patron bodies.  A prospective patron body does not have to be on a list of recognised patrons to apply for patronage of a school.</p><p>  A prospective patron needs to have sufficient structure, continuity and reliability to conduct the responsible functions of patron, such as:</p><p>-appointment of the board of management</p><p>-suspension, if necessary, of the board of management</p><p>-responsibility for the school's characteristic spirit, for which the board of </p><p>management is accountable to the patron</p><p>-ultimate responsibility/liability for industrial relations</p><p>-responsibility for school property (and insurance)</p><p>-financial matters &mdash; annual budgets and reports</p><p>-decisions on school status, such as extension, amalgamation, closure</p><p>-the responsibilities agreed in the covenant with the Minister for Education </p><p>and Skills</p><p>  A prospective patron needs to be able to demonstrate that it is capable of conducting the patron responsibilities in an ongoing way.  For a group that is not a statutory body and wishes to be established as patron of a school, the group needs to establish itself as a corporate entity or as some other acceptable legal entity.  In this process the group should articulate its educational philosophy and educational objectives in the memorandum and articles of association.  The group should name three members as directors/trustees.  The prospective patron should have charitable status.</p><p>  Existing or prospective patrons may apply for patronage of any new school.  A major criterion for the selection of a patron body is the extent to which it can demonstrate that a school under its patronage would extend or strengthen diversity of provision in the area, having regard to the views of parents.</p><p>A patron body must also satisfy my Department's requirements for establishing a new school set out in the document &quot;New Arrangements for Patronage of New Schools&quot; on my Department's website &ndash; see link hereunder:</p></reply>

Recruitment to apprenticeship is undertaken by employers.  As apprenticeship is concentrated in construction, motor and engineering, areas where employment is largely male, female participation in apprenticeship is low.  There are efforts to increase female participation in the current trades, including a bursary scheme, but significant progress will require the broadening of apprenticeship to cover new sectors where the pattern of employment is more balanced.</p><p>In this context, I have recently received a report from the Apprenticeship Council in relation to the response to their call fro proposals for new apprenticeships.  The Council received 86 separate submissions for new apprenticeships from 48 different organisations.  The Council are recommending the priority development of 25 proposals into new apprenticeships and they are across a wide range of sectors.  I expect that development work will begin on these proposals in the near future with the bulk of new apprenticeships, subject to the availability of resources, becoming available in 2016.</p></reply>

The ban proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels in Dublin.  As well as bringing air quality levels into compliance with the then EU standards, the ban also had the effect of significantly improving human health in the capital.  Research indicates that the ban in Dublin has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths.  In August 2012, following a public consultation process, new solid fuel regulations, the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012, were introduced with the aim of ensuring that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of certain residential solid fuels.  The ban now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide, including all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people, bringing the ban areas broadly into line with national EPA air quality management zones. </p>  <p>  Under the auspices of the North South Ministerial Council, and in conjunction with the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, my Department has commissioned a study on emissions from residential solid fuel use on an all-island basis.  The study includes:</p>  <p>-     an assessment of the solid fuel market and barriers to the use of cleaner fuels;</p>  <p>  -  consideration of the role and impacts of biomass (primarily wood and wood-based products) and the links to climate policy; and</p>  <p>-  an economic analysis addressing the potential positive and negative effects on the consumer, for example, resulting from potential fuel switching, the availability of smokeless fuels to supply an all-island market and job creation opportunities in   the manufacture and supply of smokeless fuels. </p>  <p>  A final report is expected to be presented to the North South Ministerial Council later this year, and this report will inform a discussion on future policy options in this area.</p></reply>

These documents set out the Government&rsquo;s broad framework for the delivery of housing for people with disabilities through mainstream housing policy.  They were developed as part of a coherent framework, in conjunction with the Government&rsquo;s mental health policy, <i>A Vision for Change</i>, the <i>Report of the Working Group on Congregated Settings </i>and the Value for Money Review of Disability Services, to support people with disabilities within community based living with maximum independence and choice.  Implementation of the Strategy is being driven primarily by the Housing Agency which has a key role in overseeing the rollout of the Implementation Framework and ensuring uniformity of approach at local level.  A dedicated Housing Subgroup chaired by the Housing Agency was established in 2012 to progress implementation.  The Subgroup <i>includes representatives from my Department, the HSE, Department of Health, local authorities, the Irish Council for Social Housing and various disability organisations.  As regards 2015 priorities, work is ongoing to progress the transitioning of individuals from congregated settings.  Two task groups, reporting to and overseen by the main Subgroup, have been established to progress the priority actions of the NHSPWD, one in relation to mental health and one relating to actions for individuals with a disability living in the community.</i></p><p>In line with the priority action to achieve a coordinated approach to service delivery, housing authorities are required to establish Housing and Disability Steering Groups (HDSGs) in each county/city council area to facilitate integrated and timely responses to the housing needs of people with disabilities.  The Steering Groups are chaired by Directors of Housing Services and include representation from the HSE and key disability sectors.  The majority of housing authorities have now established HDSGs, with support and guidance provided by the Housing Agency.  It is expected that all HDSGs will be up and running in the coming months.</p><p>The preparation and delivery of a Strategic Plan in each county/city area is a key task for the Steering Groups.  As part of the priority action to ensure equitable access for people with disabilities, housing authorities must develop specific local strategies to meet the identified needs of people with disabilities.  The 5-year Strategic Plans will be informed by the identified housing needs and by broader formalised consultation with relevant statutory agencies, service user groups and disability organisations.  The strategies will form an integral part of the local authority Housing Service Plans and will promote and support the delivery of accommodation for people with disabilities using all appropriate housing supply mechanisms.  Around two thirds of the Strategic Plans have been received to date and are currently being collated by the Housing Agency into a draft National Plan.

As part of this process, my Department wrote to the Department of Health in September 2013 inviting any input that they might have on the health aspects, if any, of wind farms.  Preliminary feedback was received from a Deputy Chief Medical Officer (<b>CMO</b>) of the Department of Health which indicated that wind turbines do not represent a threat to public health.  This feedback was based on a 2009 literature review conducted by the Australian Government&rsquo;s National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).</p><p>The Deputy <b>CMO</b>subsequently wrote to my Department in April 2014 to advise that Australia&rsquo;s National Health and Medical Research Council had updated their evidence in relation to this matter.  In that letter, the Deputy <b>CMO</b>stated &lsquo;<i>This review again supports previous advice that there is no reliable or consistent evidence that wind farms directly cause adverse health effects in humans.</i>&rsquo;  The Deputy <b>CMO</b>also referred to the limited number of peer reviewed articles and research in this area and that Australia&rsquo;s National Health and Medical Research Council may recommend further high quality research.  Australia&rsquo;s National Health and Medical Research Council released a further statement in February 2015 stating that &lsquo;After careful consideration and deliberation of the body of evidence, NHMRC concludes that there is currently no consistent evidence that wind farms cause adverse health effects in humans.&rsquo;</p><p>My Department will continue to liaise with the Department of Health, particularly in relation to the findings of any further international peer reviewed research on this subject.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has also been made aware of this ongoing dialogue in the context of the implementation of their renewable energy policy (including wind energy).</p><p>It is intended that the revisions to the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines will be finalised as soon as possible.</p></reply>

National Lottery funding channelled through my Department&rsquo;s Vote currently supports a wide range of other worthy causes, including community groups and voluntary organisations.  National Lottery funding is also distributed by other Departments to groups working in areas such as disability, health, and sport.</p><p>It is important to note that should National Lottery funding be provided for the natural environment, corresponding reductions would be required in other areas which are currently in receipt of such funding, within my own Department and also potentially within other beneficiary Departments.  Accordingly, re-allocation of funding to support the natural environment at the expense of one or more of these other sectors can only be undertaken following very careful reflection.  However, I intend to keep this matter under review as the budgetary situation improves in the years ahead.</p><p>In taking this view, I am conscious that the natural environment, uniquely amongst the broad range of areas funded by my Department, also receives funding from the Environment Fund, which was established with effect from 17 July 2001 by the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001.  The Environment Fund comprises of the revenues from the environmental levy on the supply of plastic bags, collected by the Revenue Commissioners, and the environmental levy on the landfilling of waste, collected by local authorities.</p><p>The Environment Fund is hypothecated for environmental purposes, and is used for activities or initiatives in a range of areas such as, <i>inter alia:</i></p><p>- schemes to prevent/reduce waste and waste recovery activities;</p><p>- research and development into waste management;</p><p>- production, distribution or sale of products deemed to be less harmful to the environment than other similar products;</p><p>- development of producer initiatives to prevent/reduce waste arising from their activities;</p><p>- promotion of awareness of the need to protect the environment, including national and regional campaigns;</p><p>- promotion/support of education and training to assist achievement of campaign objectives;</p><p>- initiatives undertaken by community groups and others for protection of the environment;</p><p>- initiatives undertaken by international organisations and others for protection of the environment and/or sustainable development; and</p><p>- such other purposes for the protection of the environment as may be prescribed by the Minister in regulations.</p><p>Since 2011, some &euro;259 million has been disbursed to the environment sector from the Environment Fund.  This is in addition to some &euro;146 million provided to the environment sector by way of Exchequer Voted expenditure by my Department.</p><p>Given the prevailing challenging budgetary context in which the Government and my own Department has been required to operate over this period, I believe that the allocation of such a considerable amount of funding to environmental initiatives represents a fair and reasonable level of support for the environment sector in the circumstances, and I am committed to continuing to allocate and prioritise funding across my broad area of responsibility, including the environment, in as equitable a manner as possible within budgetary constraints.</p></reply>

Planning authorities have substantial enforcement powers under the Planning and Development Act 2000.  A planning authority may issue an enforcement notice, non-compliance with which is an offence, in connection with an unauthorised development, requiring such steps as the authority considers necessary to be taken within a specified period.  If an enforcement notice is not complied with the planning authority may itself take the specified steps and recover the expense incurred in doing so.  A planning authority may also seek a court order requiring any particular action to be done or not to be done.</p>  <p>  The Planning and Development Act 2000 also places clear statutory obligations on planning authorities in relation to unauthorised development.  A planning authority must issue a warning letter in relation to written complaints regarding unauthorised development, or other unauthorised development it becomes aware of (except in the case of trivial or minor development).</p>  <p>  There is also a statutory obligation to carry out an investigation and expeditiously decide whether an enforcement notice should be issued or a court order should be sought, under section 160 of the 2000 Act.  Where a planning authority establishes, following an investigation, that unauthorised development (other than development that is of a trivial or minor nature) has been or is being carried out, and the person who has carried out the development has not proceeded to remedy the position, then the planning authority must issue an enforcement notice or seek a court order, unless there are compelling reasons for not doing so.</p>  <p>  Under section 30 of the 2000 Act, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case, including a matter of planning enforcement, with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned.</p></reply>

The HAP scheme will bring all social housing supports provided by the State under the aegis of local authorities.  The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment.  HAP will also improve regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.  Further to the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 on 28 July 2014, the first phase of the HAP statutory pilot commenced with effect from 15 September 2014 in Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council and Cork County Council.  HAP commenced in Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan County Councils from 1 October 2014.  Subsequently, Dublin City Council became part of the statutory HAP pilot, with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households.  Dublin City Council is implementing the HAP pilot for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all 4 Dublin local authorities, which became operational on 18 February 2015.  A review of the Homeless HAP Pilot (Dublin) will begin shortly and preparation of data for this report has now begun.</p><p>The second phase of the HAP statutory pilot has recently commenced with the HAP scheme becoming operational in Donegal County Council on 25 May 2015, in Offaly County Council on 15 June 2015 and in Carlow, Clare and Tipperary County Councils and Cork City Council on the 29 June 2015.  There are now over 2,500 households in receipt of HAP across the local authority areas taking part in the statutory pilot scheme and consideration is currently being given to the sequencing of a further cohort of local authorities to commence HAP on an incremental basis this year.</p><p>The operation of the Rent Supplement scheme is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.  The Department of Social Protection published a review of the maximum rent limits under the Rent Supplement scheme on 27 March 2015 and this review is available on that Department&rsquo;s website.  In the context of the implementation of HAP, my Department works closely with the Department of Social Protection, and closely monitors data gathered by HAP pilot authorities.  This data is important in the context of the further roll out of HAP and the maximum rent limits that may apply in local authorities where HAP is operating will be kept under review in this context.</p><p>A range of measures are being taken to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households and mobilise the necessary supports in order to deliver on the Government's target of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.  These measures have been identified in the Government's <i>Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness</i>(May 2014) and in the <i>Action Plan to Address Homelessness</i>(December 2014).</p><p>Progress in implementing these plans is reported through the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.  The plans and progress reports are available on my Department's website at the following link:.</p></reply>

The Garda may request photographic or other identification.  Where the applicant establishes in writing that he is unable to progress the application in this way, the form can be signed by the applicant in the presence of an official of the registration authority who is satisfied as to his or her identity.  Again, photographic or other identification may be required.  If neither option is viable due to physical illness or physical disability, the application form must be accompanied by a medical certificate.  Most applications for entry on the supplement are made in a relatively short period of time close to a polling event.  Registration authorities have less opportunity therefore than they have at the annual revision of the register to make the necessary enquiries about an application.  The provisions regarding verification of applications for entry on the supplement to the register of electors are in place to strengthen the security aspects of the supplement procedures.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the provisions in the Electoral Act 1992 serve to assist registration authorities in processing applications for entry in the supplement.  I do not think that a requirement on an applicant to state in writing the reason why they are unable to get the application form signed by a Garda is unreasonable in the circumstances.  I consider that the current arrangements strike a reasonable balance between facilitating voter registration and ensuring that there are adequate measures in place to counteract any possible abuse.</p></reply>

Within that framework, local returning officers are responsible for all matters in connection with the actual conduct of elections and referendums.  This includes, in accordance with section 94 of the Electoral Act 1992, the provision of a sufficient number of polling stations, conveniently distributed for the accommodation of the electors entitled to vote there.  Guidance issued to Returning Officers by my Department in advance of electoral events advises that when schools are used as polling stations, every step should be taken to ensure that schools are not closed unnecessarily and that disruption of school work should be kept to a minimum.  The Guidance advises that, where possible, school halls should be used instead of classrooms and that voting compartments and other equipment should be fitted up and dismantled after school hours.  The Guidance also advises that it is open to returning officers to hire a hall or other premises if they consider it to be appropriate.  Electoral law provides that a returning officer may, for the purposes of taking a poll and counting the votes, use a school or any room in a school free of charge.</p></reply>

To this end, local authorities have been given substantial powers under the Act in relation to any such sites, including powers to require specified measures to be taken in relation to a derelict site, to impose a levy on derelict sites, or to compulsorily acquire any derelict site.  The definition of a derelict site in Section 3 of the Act refers to &ldquo;any land which detracts, or is likely to detract, to a material degree from the amenity, character or appearance of land in the neighbourhood in question&rdquo;, including structures which are in ruinous, derelict or dangerous condition.</p>  <p>  The administration of the Derelict Sites legislation at a local level is a matter for the relevant local authority.

The City Council are now proposing to allocate a further &euro;5.1m from their own resources with further proportionate amounts to be provided by the other Dublin authorities.  My Department will continue to engage with the Dublin authorities regarding the extent of their requirement for possible further Exchequer funding, which will be addressed towards the end of Quarter 3 in the light of expenditure actually incurred at that stage.</p>  <p>  My Department meets with the Dublin City Council executive on a regular basis to discuss a range of housing issues, including funding and costs in relation to homelessness.  I am satisfied that these meetings provide an appropriate mechanism for engagement on the issues involved but I will keep the matter under review.</p></reply>

The HAP scheme will bring all social housing supports provided by the State under the aegis of local authorities.  The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment.  HAP will also improve regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.  Further to the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 on 28 July 2014, the first phase of the HAP statutory pilot commenced with effect from 15 September 2014 in Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council and Cork County Council.  HAP commenced in Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan County Councils from 1 October 2014.  Subsequently, on 18 December 2014, Dublin City Council became part of the statutory HAP pilot, with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households.

Building on this, I issued ambitious targets to all local authorities out to 2017, the delivery of which will have a strong impact for those homeless and on the housing waiting lists.  The target for County Kildare is 1,283 social housing units; this includes 433 units for delivery under capital programmes, with a provisional funding allocation of &euro;80m to support this.  With funding and targets in place out to 2017, it is a matter for Kildare County Council to identify its area&rsquo;s social housing need and to respond as required, including planning and undertaking new social housing developments and acquiring suitable built properties to meet this need.  The provisional funding allocation of &euro;80m will support the <i>development of new social housing units and also the purchase of units that may be privately owned.  A similar approach applies to funding sanctioned by local authorities to approved housing bodies, which can be for either new build or the acquisition of existing housing units.</i></p><p><i>In relation to building proposals for new social housing, </i>I announced a major social housing construction programme on 5<sup></sup>May covering all 31 local authorities, with &euro;312m investment and over 1,700 housing units to be built across some 100 separate projects.

My Department is leading on a range of measures under <i>Construction 2020</i>to support increased housing delivery.  In particular, the Urban Regeneration and Housing Bill 2015 provides for changes in development contributions, revisions to Part V arrangements and a new vacant site levy.  The Bill is currently before the Seanad and I expect it to complete its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas before the summer recess.</p><p>Social housing is a key priority for the Government, evidenced by the additional &euro;2.2 billion in funding announced for it in Budget 2015 and the publication of the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020 </i>in November 2014, itself an action under <i>Construction 2020</i>.  The total targeted provision under the Strategy of 110,000 social housing units includes the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units through Pillar 1.  The private rental sector, through Pillar 2 of the Strategy, will accommodate up to 75,000 eligible low-income households primarily through the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme.  Importantly, the Strategy restores the State to a central role in the provision of social housing.</p><p>Since the Strategy was published, details of over &euro;1.5 billion for building, purchasing and leasing schemes, to accommodate 25% of the housing list by 2017, has been announced, with <b>&euro;312m</b>approved for the first tranche of building <b>1,700</b>social housing units.

At the time of their commencement, my Department made clear to the industry that the 2007 Tyre Regulations were the last opportunity for the tyre industry to address, in a comprehensive manner, issues associated with waste tyres.  That opportunity was not taken and the structure introduced by the 2007 Regulations has not worked as a result. </p>  <p>  The Producer Responsibility Initiative (PRI) review report on Tyres and Waste Tyres published by my Department concluded that the current system for dealing with waste tyres is not functioning as intended, with a lack of basic information, poor structure, poor environmental outcomes in the form of large stockpiles of waste tyres, and somewhere between 24% and 50% of waste tyres unaccounted for.  The report also identified significant non-compliance among those with responsibilities under the current Waste Tyre Regulations.   </p>  <p>  In February 2015, I announced a move to a full Producer Responsibility Initiative (PRI) for tyres which will aim to rectify the deficiencies which have been identified in the current system.  The new PRI scheme for tyres will comprise the following main features:</p>  <p>  - A single compliance scheme for end-of-life tyres to be operated by Repak,</p>  <p>  - The ending of the option to &ldquo;self-comply&rdquo; under the Regulations,</p>  <p>  - Formalisation of the existing recycling charge charged by tyre retailers into a visible environmental management charge,</p>  <p>  - The level of this visible environmental charge would be set by my Department and reviewed in two years,</p>  <p>  - As part of the detailed design of the scheme, consideration by my Department, in consultation with the tyres and waste industry, as to whether the funding model is predicated upon a front-loaded or back-loaded model,</p>  <p>  - A full audit and registration and reporting component (&lsquo;black box&rsquo;) with a role for the WEEE Register Society, and</p>  <p>  - An underpinning of the new regime, including enforcement and compliance measures, by a robust legislative base, including fixed penalty notices for certain breaches.</p>  <p>  The new arrangements that I am proposing and developing in conjunction with tyre industry representatives through the Tyres Working Group will ensure that all of the financial contribution by the consumer will go towards the environmental management of waste tyres.  It will also provide greater clarity, which is not currently available, around where the funding goes.  The proposed charge is therefore a formalisation of an existing charge into a visible environmental management charge.

It is in this context that Minister Kelly and I jointly wrote to the Chief Executives of each of the four Dublin local authorities on 10 June 2015 urging that the process for making development plans, underway in each authority at present, should focus around practical measures that can be adopted to boost housing supply and to ensure that good quality housing in suitable locations is available at affordable prices.  The letter highlights the impacts of development plan requirements on the viability of new development and advises rigorous regulatory impact assessment of any new or existing development plan standards that are above relevant national minimum requirements.  Floor size is one such example.  The critical need for viable housing development will be central to my Department&rsquo;s exercise of its statutory role in the development plan process.</p></reply>

In order to get the most accurate data relating to the numbers applying for social housing support, the Strategy also includes a commitment to increase the regularity of the summary of social housing assessments by undertaking it on an annual basis from 2016 onwards.  With regard to social housing provision, the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>sets out ambitious targets for delivery to 2020, with delivery in the Dublin area being driven by a dedicated Dublin Social Housing Delivery Taskforce.  On 1 April, I announced provisional funding allocations totalling &euro;1.5 billion for all local authorities, to meet an ambitious delivery target of 22,883 social housing units out to 2017.  Within this, the combined funding total for the Dublin local authorities comes to over &euro;500 million.  As part of the delivery under this &euro;500 million programme for Dublin, &euro;117 million was allocated to the four Dublin local authorities on 5 May in respect of 19 build projects, which will see the development of 566 new units of accommodation.  Further announcements of new unit delivery under the Capital Assistance Scheme and the broader social housing investment programmes will be made in the coming weeks and months.  The implementation of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is also progressing at pace, with over 2,500 households now in receipt of HAP across the local authority areas taking part in the statutory pilot scheme.</p><p>With regard to supports for homeless households, a range of measures is being taken to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation and mobilise the necessary supports in order to deliver on the Government's target of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.  These measures have been identified in the Government's <i>Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness</i>(May 2014) and in the <i>Action Plan to Address Homelessness</i>(December 2014).  </p><p>Progress in implementing these plans is reported through the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.  The plans and progress reports are available on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p>Furthermore, a Task Force and Unit are in place to identify and secure properties which could potentially be used to accommodate homeless families in the Dublin Region.  The Unit is comprised of representatives from my Department, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, Dublin City Council and the Housing Agency.  It is linking with NAMA, the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality, OPW and the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills to determine potential State-owned properties.  The Unit is overseen by a Task Force, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and also comprising other senior officials of my Department, the Chief Executive and Assistant Chief Executive (Housing) of Dublin City Council, the Chief Valuer of Dublin City Council, the Director of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and the Chief Executive and a Senior Executive of the Housing Agency.</p></reply>

The Cost Benefit Analysis showed that, in addition to the project yielding a positive in Net Present Value to both the State and Private Sector, it would also bring about a wide range of other benefits including:</p><p>- facilitating the accurate location of all addresses in the State, including the 35% of Irish addresses that are &lsquo;non-unique&rsquo;;</p><p>- making it easier for consumers to shop online, and assist the development of Irish online commerce;</p><p>- improving the efficiency and accuracy of internal business processes as a result of improved accuracy and consistency of databases across public and private sectors;</p><p>- making it quicker and easier for emergency services to locate addresses, particularly in rural areas;</p><p>- delivering improved efficiencies with regards to logistics;</p><p>- providing better planning and analysis capabilities across public and private sectors;</p><p>- enabling organisations to improve existing services and/or develop new service offerings;</p><p>- facilitating improved efficiencies in the mails sector.</p><p>In addition, during the development of the postcode system, my Department conducted extensive consultation with major public and private sector stakeholders who highlighted the benefits of Eircodes to their operations.</p><p>Once public and private sector organisations start to use Eircodes, I am satisfied that their use will help underpin competitiveness and, in turn, support jobs.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.  The proposed State intervention under the National Broadband Plan (NBP) represents a potentially very significant capital investment project for the State and the Government is firmly committed to delivering this investment, as evidenced in the National Broadband Plan itself and in the Programme for Government, the Action Plan for Jobs and the Statement of Government Priorities.</p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services.  These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016.  This map is available at .  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>The AMBER areas show the target areas for the State intervention.  The premises within the AMBER areas will be included in the State's intervention, subject to any further commercial plans by operators. </p><p>The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises/home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. </p><p>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will be also delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.</p><p>More generally, I can confirm that next generation broadband services have been rolled out to over 123,000 premises to date in the Mid West and Kerry region comprising Limerick, Clare, Tipperary and Kerry with a further 56,000 premises expected to be served by commercial operators.  The remaining 160,000 premises in the Mid West and Kerry Region are the target for the proposed State intervention under the National Broadband Plan. </p><p>I intend to publish the draft Intervention Strategy for public consultation later this week.  Following the consultation process over the summer, I hope to move to formal procurement phase towards the end of this year in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders. </p><p>I expect the physical build of the network to begin in late 2016, and it will take 3-5 years to fully complete &ndash; depending on the details of the bid or bids selected.</p></reply>

Since 2009, the two schemes have supported the renovation of 263,636 homes in Ireland.  In late 2014, my Department, working with the SEAI, reviewed the supports available under the Better Energy Homes scheme in conjunction with the financial resources available for the scheme.  This review concluded that the most efficient ways of using the limited resources available to the scheme were (i) to increase the existing grant levels whose value had been eroded by inflation, (ii) to introduce a new bonus payment that encourages householders to engage in deeper renovations that could lead to more significant energy savings and (iii) to abolish the minimum grant threshold.  These changes were made and announced in March of this year. </p>  <p>  Under the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme, energy efficiency upgrades are provided free of charge to those households who meet the application criteria.  Measures are provided under the scheme on an as needed basis. </p>  <p>  Window and door insulation is not currently supported under the Better Energy Programme due to the need to balance the limited resources available with the demand for these schemes.  Therefore, the measures currently supported are those that can deliver the most energy savings at the lowest cost.  While window and door insulation does improve the energy efficiency of a home, the cost of such measures is high in relation to the energy efficiency gains made.</p></reply>

In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources.  Currently, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid is 2,700 MW approx. of which just under 2,400 MW is wind.  EirGrid has forecasted in its &ldquo;All-Island Generation Capacity Statement 2015-2024&rdquo; that between 3,200 and 3,800 MW of wind generating capacity will be required to allow Ireland to achieve 40% renewable electricity.  This figure does not include Northern Ireland.  A separate section of the document deals with other sources of renewable generation such as Combined Heat and Power (CHP), biofuels, small scale hydro and ocean energy.  The assumptions made for other renewable generation will have a bearing on how much wind energy needs to be generated to reach the 40% target.  Currently the REFIT schemes are the primary means through which electricity from renewable sources is supported in Ireland.  These schemes support electricity generated from a range of renewable sources including biomass and are paid for by electricity customers through the Public Service Obligation.</p>  <p>  To date, onshore wind energy has been the most cost effective renewable technology in the Irish electricity market, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target.  The cost effectiveness of support for renewables is a key consideration in the work now underway in my Department to consider the appropriateness and design of any new support scheme for renewable electricity.  Any scheme would be subject to EU rules on State Aid.  Taking account of developments in EU electricity market integration, my Department will be engaging with stakeholders in this work, a key component of which will be consideration of the available technologies, their cost effectiveness and the level of any support required.</p></reply>

It is charged to all customers and is designed to compensate suppliers for the additional costs they incur by meeting obligations to purchase electricity from indigenous (i.e. peat), sustainable and renewable sources.  The legal basis and method of calculation for the PSO levy are set out in the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (Section 39) and its operation is outlined in S.I. 217 of 2002.  The Communications and Postal sectors use the Universal Service Obligation concept.  The European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Universal Service and Users&rsquo; Rights) Regulations 2011 (SI 337/2011) confer a statutory authority on the Commission for Communication Regulation (ComReg) to designate one or more electronic communications service providers as a Universal Service Provider/s (USP/s).  The designation of a USP/s ensures public access to basic telephony services, including voice, fax and functional internet access, at any fixed location and associated support services including access to directory services and geographically averaged pricing.  Additional USP obligations apply to provide equivalence of access to these basic services for disabled users.  Eircom is the currently designated universal service provider.</p>  <p>Under section 17 (1) of the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011, An Post is designated as the universal postal service provider in Ireland for a period of 12 years.</p></reply>

I did however introduce a fixed charge notice for cycling without reasonable consideration.  This would include cyclists cycling recklessly on footpaths.  The introduction of a fixed charge notice for this and other cycling offences is intended to give An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na an additional enforcement measure in assisting them to enforce road traffic law and so that these offence may be dealt with swiftly without recourse to the courts.  </p>  <p>  The aim in the long term is not to penalise, but to change the culture and spread awareness that road traffic law applies to all and exists for the safety of all.</p></reply>

Its scope is currently confined to flights operating between EU/EEA airports.  While such regional schemes are not intrinsically linked to the current ICAO process to develop a global scheme with the aim of covering a greater level of international aviation activity, the issue of ensuring environmental integrity in a global scheme is a key objective for the EU, a position that Ireland strongly supports.  It is not possible at this stage to indicate the nature and scope of the mechanism that will ultimately emerge from the current ICAO process, but it would be the basic expectation of Ireland and the EU generally that it would deliver an enhancement to the prevailing situation.</p></reply>

The law requires that new cars registered in the EU must not emit more than an average of 130 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre by 2015.  By 2021, phased in from 2020, the fleet average to be achieved by all new cars is 95 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre.  In Ireland, the impact of these standards has been reinforced through the implementation of an emissions-based motor taxation system for cars, which was first introduced in 2008.</p>  <p>  The effectiveness of the combined national and European measures is very evident from the profile of the new private car fleet in Ireland.  In 2007, 1.5% of all new cars were in the A emissions band, while 17.7% were in the combined bands A and B, which are the most efficient bands.  In comparison, for the first half of 2014, 67.2% of all new cars were in the A band and 94.8% were in the combined A and B bands.  The average emissions of new cars by the end of 2014 was expected to be less than 120 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre, which is well below the 2015 target.</p>  <p>  Consequently, from an emissions perspective, there would seem to be significant validity in proposals to introduce more stringent efficiency targets for cars and vans by 2025.  Ireland, as a technology taker, would welcome any measures that would seek to stimulate innovation in the car manufacturing sector.  Encouraging the development of very low or zero emitting vehicles also has additional clean air and noise reduction co-benefits.</p>  <p>  EU-wide action has the capacity to generate much greater change than Member States acting alone.  Measures generated at a national level tend to have very high marginal costs.  I would be supportive of introducing reduced emissions targets for cars and vans by 2025.  I would welcome an examination of the impacts of implementing similar standards for heavy vehicles.</p></reply>

The meeting was constructive in that my officials outlined a clear path to the group to assist in bringing the project to the next step.  </p>  <p>  At that stage no detailed design work had been done on the project.  My officials undertook to arrange for the group to meet the National Transport Authority to pursue NTA funding for the design works through Meath County Council.  I understand that a meeting took place with the NTA, which subsequently visited the project site and agreed to provide design and planning funding of &euro;40,000.</p>  <p>  This funding, which was drawn down in April or May, will bring the project to a stage where Meath County Council can make a decision on the feasibility of the project and whether they will back the project through an application to the Department for Greenway funding in the normal way.</p>  <p>  The NTA is keeping in touch with the project on the design spend and will update the Department on progress.  Until this work is complete, there is no viable project backed by the County Council to consider for funding.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility for traffic management rests with the relevant local authority.  Following An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision not to give development consent for the Slane bypass, Meath County Council in liaison with the NRA has been responsible for evaluating traffic management options.  The most recent study - the Slane Traffic Management Review - was undertaken by Halcrow Barry on behalf of the Council and published in February this year.</p>  <p>  Since I became Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have been at a number of meetings attended by Meath County Council and on two occasions by the NRA to discuss the position in relation to traffic in Slane.</p>  <p>  At this point it is a matter for Meath County Council to liaise with the NRA in relation to how best to proceed.  The Roads Act 2015 provides for pre-planning consultation with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Given the board's previous decision to refuse permission, it would seem to make sense for Meath County Council to initiate such discussions. </p>  <p>  There is no escaping the reality of limited resources.  The indications are that funding will remain tight for the next number of years.  While I hope I have stabilised the funding position, the scope for any new improvement projects depends on the availability of additional capital funding in the future.  Once the new capital plan is published, I will assess what can be done to address particular bottlenecks taking into account development consent requirements.</p></reply>

The 1987 Act sets out statutory provisions regarding the general use of metal detectors to search for archaeological objects on any lands and the particular requirements applying to their use or possession on protected monuments and archaeological sites.  My Department, in co-operation with the National Museum of Ireland, has published guidelines setting out advice to the public on the use of detection devices and their impact on our archaeological heritage. The guidelines are available on my Department&rsquo;s website and are also available in museums, libraries and local authority offices.  The guidelines explain both the provisions of the relevant legislation and the reasons it was enacted in 1987.  The 1987 Act does not prohibit the use of metal detectors for archaeological purposes, rather it ensures such use takes place in a regulated manner, subject to appropriate safeguards. </p><p>The National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994 implemented in statute law the ruling of the Supreme Court in Webb <i>v</i>. Ireland that archaeological objects found in the State which have no known owner are State property.  The 1994 Act, also in line with the findings of the Supreme Court, established a statutory scheme for payment of rewards to finders of archaeological objects, at the discretion of the Director of the National Museum of Ireland.  It has been a legal requirement since the enactment of the National Monuments Act 1930 that finds of archaeological objects must be reported to the Director of the National Museum.</p><p>I am satisfied that the current legislation is reasonable, proportionate and effective and I do not propose to establish a working group of the kind referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

This will entail the phasing out of turf-cutting on certain natural heritage areas by 1 January 2017 and the partial or complete de-designation of certain natural heritage areas.</p>  <p>  Some 46 natural heritage areas (including parts of 7 natural heritage areas) are scheduled for de-designation.</p>  <p>  Regulatory change will be required to give full effect to the de-designation of the sites.
