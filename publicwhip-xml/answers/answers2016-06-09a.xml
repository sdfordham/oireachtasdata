It is a time bound co-funding arrangement with resources of &euro;29.7m from 2013 to 2017.  The aim of the ABC Programme is to test and evaluate prevention and early intervention approaches to improve outcomes for children and families living in poverty in 13 areas of disadvantage.</p>  <p>  The ABC programme was preceded by the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) (2007-2013) in which three sites participated: Youngballymun, the Childhood Development Initiative Tallaght and the Preparing for Life Programme, Darndale.  Youngballymun received &euro;15m as a participant in the Prevention and Early Intervention programme.  The total funding for Youngballymun under the ABC programme is &euro;5m bringing the total funding received by Youngballymun under both programmes to &euro;20m.</p>  <p>  The current contract for Youngballymun is due to conclude in July 2016. My aim is to extend the duration of the Youngballymun programme, together with that of two other sites, to July 2017. This will bring them in line with the other 10 ABC sites.   To ensure continued provision, my Department and The Atlantic Philanthropies have sanctioned an additional &euro;400k to each of the three original sites.  We are seeking to further supplement this base level of funding to each of the three sites, based on the prioritisation of the most effective interventions within their service agreements.</p>  <p>  My Department is working to ensure that we take full account of the learning from all the interventions across the 13 ABC sites.  This will offer a clear illustration of the interventions that work best, and will inform our plans to embed prevention and early intervention in services for children.  The future of any individual project cannot be considered in isolation.  Officials are working at a number of levels and through a number of initiatives to capture the learning to further advise me and Government.</p>  <p>  I look forward to the continued engagement of Youngballymun with my Department. I want to ensure the implementation of quality prevention and early intervention initiatives in order to achieve our shared goal of improving the lives of children and families in Ballymun and throughout the country.   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-09a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900045#WRA00900"><p>A range of educational approaches  are offered in preschool services including the Montessori method, HighScope, Steiner-Waldorf and the play-based approach. My Department does not take the view that any particular method is preferable to another, and therefore has no plans to roll-out any particular educational approach nationally.  While I have actually co authored a manual for early childhood education incorporating highscope as part of its approach, we also incorporated insights from montessori and a wider play based approach.  So I am personally aware of the power and effectiveness of the highscope model, I am also aware that an eclectic model has the potential to be equally effective.</p>  <p>  Whichever curricular method is chosen by a service, every service is required to adhere to the principles of S&iacute;olta, the  National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education, and Aistear,  the Early Childhood Curriculum Framework.  These frameworks, which are the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, specify broad learning goals for children but respect the diversity of pedagogical approaches taken to achieve these goals.  </p>  <p>  The Early Years Inspectorates in Tusla and in the Department of Education and Skills carry out inspections on services regardless of which curricular method is used but with regard to S&iacute;olta and Aistear.  The Department of Education and Skills's focused inspections in early years settings commenced in April 2016 and will evaluate all pedagogical practice. The first reports of these inspections will be published by end of June.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that Better Start, the National Early Years Quality Development Initiative has been established by my Department to support services in applying S&iacute;olta and Aistear, and to co-ordinate the work of existing State-funded supports for quality in early years settings. My Department is always open to engagement with the HighScope Ireland Institute on matters of mutual concern.</p></reply>

As part of its Business Plan for this year, Tusla has committed to a number of key targets to achieve by the end of 2016.  These targets include a 60% decrease of cases awaiting allocation; reducing the number of high priority cases awaiting allocation to less than 5% of the total number of unallocated cases; and ensuring that all children in foster care and residential care have an allocated social worker.</p>  <p>  Tusla has made progress in its targets.  In March 2016, there were 5,579 open cases awaiting allocation, down by 17% since December 2015.</p>  <p>  Key to reducing the number of cases awaiting allocation to a social worker, and the associated risk, is the recruitment of staff, including additional social workers and support personnel.  Tusla has been provided with additional resources to do this. Tusla has set a target to recruit an additional 168 WTE additional social workers this year. Since the beginning of 2016, the number of social workers has increased by 133 WTEs. </p>  <p>  In addition, the issue of addressing  heavy caseloads can also be impacted positively by an agencies caseload management approach.  Tusla's approach to social work services was developed and piloted in 2013 and rolled out across the country in 2014.  It was agreed at the time that a detailed review would be undertaken in 2015 to review methodology and recommend any changes required.  It is anticipated the report will be completed in the very near future.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department meet with the Tusla senior management team on a monthly basis and review progress in the recruitment and retention of social workers and other key personnel.  My Department has already commenced discussions regarding Tusla's budget requirements for 2017.  I will be meeting with the Board of Tusla shortly during which I will discuss key service priorities and anticipated financial requirements for next year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-09a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900045#WRA01500"><p>I completely agree with the Deputy that grandparents can play many important roles in their grandchildren's lives, mine did.  They can be loving companions, caregivers, mentors, historians and sources of various other forms of support including, sometimes, parenting in partnership with their children.  I am witnessing  many of my friends and colleagues play that role.  What an extraordinary contribution they offer to their grandchildren, their families and the State.  I want to put on public record my deep appreciation for their contribution.</p><p>Grandparents may either be ordinary caregivers, acting &quot;<i>in loco parentis</i>&quot; or they may be appointed as formal foster carers. Grandparents acting in loco parentis should not be confused with relative foster carers.  Those acting in loco parentis are doing so under a private family agreement, and the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, is not involved. The same universal services such as those provided in the community or health sectors, which are available for parents are also available for grandparents, including more targeted services such as family support.</p><p>Wherever possible, Tusla considers relative foster care in the first instance in order to lessen the impact of being in care for the child.  Where relative foster care is not possible, children are placed in general foster care.  A key element of the support to be provide to foster children include; allocation of a dedicated social worker for children in care, access to a link social worker for supervision and support to the foster carers; onward referral and advocacy for access to specialist services to meet the child's identified needs such as speech and language therapy, counselling and psychotherapy services.</p><p>A foster care allowance of &euro;325 for children under 12 and &euro;352 for children aged 12 years and over is provided to support the care and welfare of the child.</p><p>A child may be received into care on a voluntary basis or by order of the Courts.  Decisions on the variation or discharge of a care order are also a matter for the relevant Court and lie outside the powers of Tusla.  The development of a statutory care plan will set out what is in the best interests of the child. Where a placement is not meeting the needs of the child to an optimum level, Tusla will seek an alternative placement that can provide the necessary care.  This process may also include an order from the Court in approving the change of placement.</p></reply>

The Agency has responsibility for a range of services, including</p><p>- child welfare and protection services, including family support services previously delivered by the HSE</p><p>- services provided by the former Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board;</p><p>- pre-school inspection services;</p><p>- domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services; and</p><p>- community-based services related to the psychological welfare of children and families.</p><p>In accordance with the Agency's establishing legislation, each year a detailed Performance Statement is prepared by myself as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs for the Agency with specific policy guidance, direction, prioritisation and resource parameters to inform the preparation of its annual business plan. This Statement also sets out the key priorities that are required of Tusla.  The content of the Performance Statement for 2016 was informed by the 2016 Budget allocation and took account of Government priorities and a number of important issues for children, young people and families which emerged during 2015.</p><p>Under the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013 there are powers conferred on me as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, which allow for additional written policy direction and/or guidelines to be given to the Agency. This is covered by Section 47 and Section 48 of the Act.</p><p>My Department works very closely with Tusla and closely monitors delivery of its annual Business Plan, prepared in response to the detailed policy guidance provided in the Performance Statement which issues to Tusla under the 2013 Act. The need for any additional policy guidance is kept under review. </p></reply>

The elements of the Children Act relating to the operation of the Garda Youth Diversion Programme, matters relating to criminal proceedings against children, criminal law issues and the operation of the Children Court under the Act come within the remit of the Tanaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.  The operation of the children detention school system under Part 10 of the Act is under the remit of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The Irish Youth Justice Service, based in my Department and staffed by officials from both Departments concerned, oversee the operation of the Act and all relevant policies and programmes. </p>  <p>  There is significant investment in community based programmes which are directed at diverting young people from further involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour.  In 2016, just under &euro;17 million has been allocated by the Department of Justice and Equality to the Irish Youth Justice Service to administer Garda Youth Diversion Projects and Young Persons Probation Projects.  These projects also benefit from support under the European Social Fund.</p>  <p>  Overall funding of almost &euro;900,000 is being provided this year to support these important initiatives in the Dublin north inner city area. In particular, the Garda Diversion projects provided support and services to over 140 young people who were referred in 2015.  I welcome this allocation of funding for 2016.  Each project works in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop a youth crime profile of the catchment area and the young people living there so that services are targeted effectively.  I will continue to engage with the Tanaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality on the operation of the Garda Youth Diversion Projects, through the cross - agency structure of the Irish Youth Justice Service.</p></reply>

A similar recommendation was made to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in January 2016. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, Minister Fitzgerald committed in principle to amending legislation to allow the Ombudsman for Children and the Ombudsman to deal with issues relating to direct provision.  Both issued press statements welcoming this commitment. </p>  <p>  It is not yet clear what legislative change, if any, would be required to give effect to this expansion of remit. Following the enactment of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012, the remit of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children have been largely aligned.  Discussions of such an expansion are likely to involve a number of Government Departments including the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my own Department.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that if legislative change is required, my Department will cooperate fully to ensure the necessary legislation is advanced in an appropriate and timely manner.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people.  The voluntary youth sector involves approximately 1,400 paid staff, including youth workers and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that Budget 2016 provided an additional &euro;1.1m in current youth funding to my Department bringing the total allocation for the youth services to &euro;51m in 2016.  This additional funding will be used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services.</p>  <p>  In addition &euro;2.6m in capital funding, also provided in Budget 2016, will be used to support small scale projects, including refurbishment, health and safety fit-outs and accessibility improvements in local youth services.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to building on these developments for young people and to the implementation of the National Youth Strategy 2015 to 2020 to secure improved outcomes for them in key aspects of their lives.  I will shortly announce details of the successful applications that are to be funded under the new Youth Employability Initiative.  The Initiative which is funded under the Dormant Accounts scheme will target those young people aged 15 to 24 years who are most at risk of unemployment and who are not in education, employment or training.  Under the Initiative, &euro;600,000 will be provided to the voluntary youth services, to support the provision of innovative programmes for these young people to enhance their employability skills and competencies.  My priorities include the further development of this type of initiative, as well as other support programmes for vulnerable young people.  The options for additional investment in these supports will be considered  in the context of the annual Estimates and Budgetary processes and the implementation of the National Youth Strategy in line with the Programme for Government. </p></reply>

Children living in direct provision are in the care of their parent(s). Concerns about the welfare, safety or well-being of a child in direct provision are reported to the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, in line with Children First guidelines. Tusla has been working closely with the Child and Family Services Unit within the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of the Department of Justice and Equality, which has responsibility for direct provision. </p>  <p>  The needs of children in direct provision include education, preschool, medical and health issues. Tusla provides a range of services that offer advice and support to families. This includes the services of family support workers, social workers, youth workers, family resource centres, support groups and counselling services. </p>  <p>  Children, separated from their parents, who arrive in this jurisdiction and are seeking asylum, are placed in the care of the State.  The majority of separated children are placed with foster carers around the country. Tusla has a dedicated Social Work Team which deals with separated children seeking asylum. Separated children are a vulnerable group and the State is duty bound by international and domestic law to protect and provide for them in the same way as it does for children normally resident in the State. </p>  <p>  Under Tusla's 'Equity of Care Policy', all separated children are allocated a social worker, who is responsible for the development and implementation of an individual statutory care plan for the child. Tusla maintains the equity and equality of services to separated children vis a vis other children in state care and ensures that there is no differentiation of standard care provision, care practices, care priorities, standards or protocols. All foster care organisations and residential centres are inspected against national standards. </p></reply>

Responsibility for children&rsquo;s welfare arises in all settings where children are, and attaches to all responsible adults who come in contact with children.  The primary responsibility for protecting children rests with their parents, but parents are supported in this role by range of service providers, state agencies, schools and professionals working with children and young people. There is a range of services which can assist children and young people in coping with bullying situations. </p><p>- For example, &ndash; an initiative of the Department of Education and Skills &ndash; provides information and advice for parents and teachers about risks and how to protect children against cyberbullying. </p><p>- At community level, many of the voluntary youth services funded by my Department provide education programmes, run awareness campaigns about bullying and provide programmes for young people to give them the knowledge and skills to build supportive links and counter bullying behaviours.  Specifically, my Department supports the National Youth Health Programme which is in partnership with the HSE and the National Youth Council of Ireland.  The programme's aims are to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion-education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings, and includes programmes aimed at exploring bullying and cyberbullying with young people.  </p><p>- Schools are also strengthening collaboration and interaction with youth services and promote the active participation by pupils in youth focused services within their local communities. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware of the Action Plan on Bullying led by my colleague the Minister for Education.  While the report deals with bullying in schools, it acknowledges that bullying is a complex social issue and can take place anywhere children and young people are together, including, as we know, on social media. The report highlights the need for parents and young people to understand how to use modern technologies safely and to know how to protect themselves in school, at home and in their communities. </p><p>With regard to cyberbullying, the Office for Internet Safety, under the Department of Justice and Equality, takes a lead responsibility for internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children.  As part of its work it holds an annual Safer Internet Day, which has included a roll-out of a social marketing campaign specifically targeted at young people. In 2013, the then Minister of  Communications established an Internet Content Governance Advisory Group to ensure our national policy represents best practice in offering the same online protections to our citizens as those available in the offline world.  The Group&rsquo;s report published in May 2014 made several recommendations aimed at protecting children and young people without unduly limiting their opportunities and rights online.  I hope to advance these issues in conjunction with my colleagues the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Communications as part of the Programme for Government's specific commitment in relation to ensuring that robust protections are in place to fully protect children while on line.</p></reply>

The elements of the Children Act relating to the operation of the Garda Youth Diversion Programme, matters relating to criminal proceedings against children, criminal law issues and the operation of the Children Court under the Act come within the remit of the Tanaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.  The operation of the children detention school system under Part 10 of the Act is under the remit of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.   The Irish Youth Justice Service, based in my Department and staffed by officials working on an interagency basis from both Departments concerned, oversee the operation of the Act, youth crime policy and all relevant projects and programmes.  A Youth Justice Action Plan was agreed in 2014 for the period up to 2018 and this is implemented by the Irish Youth Justice Service in conjunction with all relevant agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service, the Oberstown Detention Campus, the Irish Prison Service and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  The aim of the Action Plan is to create a safer society by working in partnership to reduce youth offending through appropriate interventions and linkages to services. </p>  <p>  I assume the context of the Deputy's question refers to the recent report issued by the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice, entitled "Developing Inside - Transforming prison for young adults".  This report makes a range of recommendations in relation to the operation of prison and custodial regimes for young adults in the age range of 18 - 24 years.  These recommendations include assigning responsibility for this age cohort to the Irish Youth Justice Service, achieving a significant reduction in the number imprisoned, accommodating such persons in separate facilities from older prisoners, ending the use of restricted prison regimes and enhanced training for prison staff.  All of these recommendations have implications for the operation of the adult prison system and some of them have implications for the wider criminal justice system, which is under the remit of the Tanaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  At the moment my political priority in this field must continue to be the ending of the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities.  A programme of investment in the Oberstown campus, combined with necessary legal and operational reforms, has been underway in recent years to this end.  It is my aim to assign responsibility for 17 year old boys who are serving a sentence of detention to the Oberstown campus at the earliest date possible this year, subject to the progress of a recruitment programme which is ongoing at present.  This will end the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities, which has been called for since at least the 1980s.</p>  <p>  When this review is complete, I will review with careful discernment the recommendations of the report issued by the Joint Committee, as well as reports by other respected bodies or independent bodies such as the IHREC.</p></reply>

Children under 16 who present as being homeless to emergency services are taken into care.  Children aged 16 and 17 may be taken into care, or provided a service under section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991 (accommodation for homeless children).  Care planning is an integral part of the care process.  The specific needs of any child and the services and supports that they might need to achieve their potential are assessed and planned for.  For young people who were formerly in the care of the State, aftercare services are also put in place in respect of the specific needs of a child, including accommodation and educational supports. </p>  <p>  Family homelessness is managed by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and the local authorities.  Currently, for many families, this means being accommodated on an emergency basis in hotel accommodation.  Living in such accommodation on an extended basis is simply not conducive to normal family life for parents or their children.  This includes the practical difficulties of no cooking facilities; accommodating a family's belongings in hotel room accommodation; being away from the community services and facilities, including schools that the family are familiar with; as well as the inevitable stresses on relationships on living in confined spaces.  Families who are housed outside of their communities may well have little or no access to their social networks and these are most at risk of faring poorly.  The priority of local authorities is to move families, as soon as possible, from emergency accommodation into a more suitable family-friendly setting.</p>  <p>  Within my own remit, Tusla &ndash; the Child and Family Agency provides family support and works with relevant services to maximise the supports available to children and families who are homeless.  Tusla and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive are shortly to sign off on a joint protocol which includes guidance on working with families where child protection concerns arise within emergency homeless accommodation.  I anticipate that the protocol will be in full operation this month.  Additionally, Tusla has appointed a Homelessness Liaison Officer to lead on its engagement with homeless services, particularly in relation to child protection issues.  Tusla has also established links with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive around access for children and families to Family Resource Centres.  Regarding Tusla&rsquo;s educational welfare services, guidance has issued to Home School Community Liaison and School Completion staff on assisting children and families experiencing homelessness to maintain regular school attendance.  Additionally, School Completion Programmes have been asked to prioritise homeless children for services such as breakfast and after-school clubs.  </p>  <p>  In recent weeks, I have been meeting with representatives from a range of homelessness and other children advocacy organisations.  Those meetings provided me an insight into the key issues facing children who are in emergency accommodation with their families.  In conjunction with my Cabinet colleagues, I am seeking to define a set of measures to better support children with their families in emergency homeless accommodation.  There continues to be on-going communication and cooperation between my Department and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on the issue of homelessness as part of a wider Government response to addressing this issue.</p></reply>

These children are cared for by staff who deserve to have a safe working environment.  </p>  <p>  In Oberstown, there is an emphasis on training in behaviour management programmes that de-escalate and, where possible, avoid crises involving the behaviour of children. I condemn any and all incidents resulting in assault and injury to staff. There is no acceptable level of violent behaviour in a children detention school. </p>  <p>  Children are assessed daily for all forms of risk and in the light of such assessments the residential care plans for children are reviewed accordingly. The Oberstown Campus has in place a published bespoke behaviour management policy which has been developed in conjunction with the Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI) of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA who are internationally recognised for their expertise in this area. Oberstown staff are provided with formal training in the policy with the object of providing staff with the skills to manage the behaviour of children. Policies and procedures are continually reviewed with the aim of ensuring safe and secure custody for children and the safety of staff. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the risk of injury cannot be excluded completely given the nature of a children detention school. A specific employee assistance programme is in place to assist members of staff on foot of any such incident where required. Staff are fully supported where incidents have to be investigated by the Garda authorities.</p>  <p>  I also understand that the issues of staff safety and training supports are currently the subject of discussion between Oberstown management and staff representatives.  I welcome the fact that this engagement is taking place and intend to continue to monitor the progress of this discussions, in conjunction with the Oberstown board of management.</p></reply>

The report of the Interdepartmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare found that au pairs or nannies comprise a small percentage of childcare arrangements.  The 'Growing Up in Ireland' longitudinal study indicated in December 2011 that one percent of nine-month-olds, and one percent of three-year-olds are cared for by au pairs or nannies.</p>  <p>  I encourage parents who are impacted by the Workplace Relations Commission decision to make contact with their local City or County Childcare Committee (CCC) if they require advice or support with childcare choices or indeed for information on subsidies to which they may be entitled. CCCs are available in 30 locations across Ireland. Childminding Ireland may also be able to assist in finding a registered childminder.</p>  <p>  My Department operates a number of schemes that provided subsidised childcare.

This includes children from 9 months of age to 36 months, and children who need care after school.

Preliminary screening is aimed at establishing the appropriateness of the referral to Tusla services and, if necessary, is followed by an initial assessment of the concern to determine the best course of action for the child and their family.  Over half of all referrals received by Tusla are welfare concerns and Tusla's policy is to refer these to relevant family and community support services. </p>  <p>  At any stage, if a determination is made that there is abuse or the risk of abuse, whether physical, emotional, sexual or neglect, the child protection pathway is followed.  A social worker works with the parent/s to support them to provide safe care for their child.  In a minority of cases this may lead to the child being placed on the Child Protection Notification System (CPNS) or the child being received into care.  I wish to assure the Deputy that Tusla deals immediately with emergency cases, including for instance, if a child has been abandoned or is in immediate physical danger or at immediate risk of sexual abuse.  Social work duty teams keep high priority cases under review by regularly checking to ascertain risk to the child, and where necessary will reprioritise the case.  </p>  <p>  Provisional figures for 2015 show that there were 25,361 child welfare concerns and 18,235 child protection concerns received by Tusla.

The Act is primarily concerned with aftercare &ndash; the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him or her in making the transition to independent living.  The Act obliges the Child and Family Agency, following an assessment of need, to prepare an aftercare plan identifying relevant aftercare supports for an eligible child or eligible young person.</p>  <p>  The Act builds on the existing provisions of section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991 and obliges the Agency:</p>  <p>  (i) to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child before they reach the age of 18,</p>  <p>  (ii) to prepare an aftercare plan, on request, for an eligible adult aged 18, 19 or 20, and	</p>  <p>  (iii) in relation to an eligible adult, to review the operation of an aftercare plan where there has been a change in that adult&rsquo;s circumstances or additional needs have arisen.</p>  <p>  An eligible child means a child aged 16 years or over who has spent at least 12 months in the care of the State between the ages of 13 and (up to) 18 years old.  An eligible adult means a young person aged 18, 19 or 20 who has spent at least 12 months in the care of the State between the ages of 13 and 18 years old. </p>  <p>  The Act also provides that where a child or adult has been in care (for any period of time between the ages of 13 and 18) and has also been accommodated under section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991 (accommodation for homeless children), then, any periods of time spent in such accommodation and that spent in care can be combined to meet the 12 month threshold for eligibility for an aftercare plan.</p>  <p>  Overall, the Act underpins significant initiatives and reforms that have taken place in recent years, which have been developed with the goal of improving aftercare services so as to deliver better outcomes for young people leaving the care of the State.</p>  <p>  At this point in time, I have no plans to amend the aftercare provisions contained in the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015.</p></reply>

These programmes are predominantly available through formal childcare settings such as cr&egrave;ches or preschools, some of which are run by community/not-for profit organisations, and some by private providers. In some instances programmes are also available through Tusla notified childminders who meet contract requirements.</p>  <p>  The largest scheme operated by my Department is the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, which from September 2016, will make free preschool available for 15 hours per week for 38 weeks per annum to all children from the time they turn three, until they go to school, entering at three points in the year: September, January and April. On average, from September 2016, children will benefit from 61 weeks, up from the current provision of 38 weeks. Access to the average 61 weeks of ECCE can reduce the cost of childcare by &euro;4000 per child. </p>  <p>  My Department also operates the Community Childcare Supplement (CCS), the After-School Childcare (ASCC), the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS), and the Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programmes which subsidise childcare for eligible parents. In 2017 my Department plans to replace these with a single and simplified programme that will be available through community (not for profit) and private childcare providers.  This programme, when developed, will provide an infrastructure through which any further investment in the subsidisation of childcare can be delivered.  Some subsidised childcare places through the Community Childcare Supplement (CCS) programme remain available and I encourage low income parents to make enquiries regarding their possible eligibility for CCS with their local City and County Childcare Committee.</p>  <p>  My Department has long-standing relationships with community/not-for-profit childcare providers, and recognises the important role that this sector has to play in childcare provision.  As demand for childcare continues to grow with, for example, the ECCE scheme set to increase from 67,000 children last year to approximately 127,000 in 2017, it is essential to support both community and private childcare provision to meet this demand.  An extra &euro;16m was allocated in Budget 2016 to provide for the expansion of the CCS Programme to eligible families. As these families do not always live in areas served by community/not-for-profit services, the programme was expended to private providers.  Irrespective of who the service provider is, I am determined to ensure that high-quality education and care is provided to all children. To that end, new Child Care Regulations will come into effect on a phased basis from 30 June 2016.</p></reply>

The assessment of a person suitable to adopt as per section 34 of the Adoption Act 2010 states that an adoption order shall not be made unless the Authority is satisfied that the applicant is a suitable person to have rights and duties in respect of the child, is of good moral character, in good health and of an age that he or she has a reasonable expectation of being capable throughout the child&rsquo;s childhood of fulfilling his or her parental duties in respect of the child.  In addition, the applicant needs to demonstrate an ability to promote and support the child&rsquo;s development and well being, providing the necessary health, social, educational and other interventions for the child, and valuing and supporting the child needs in relation to his or her identity and ethnic religious and cultural background.  The assessment includes ensuring that the applicant has adequate means to support the child.</p>  <p>  Section 22 of the Adoption Act 2010, provides that the Child and Family Agency may contribute towards the expenses incurred by a person in connection with an application to adopt.  I am advised by the Child and Family Agency that this may occur when dealing with the issue of dispensing with consent.  Section 26 of the Act provides that an adoption order cannot be granted unless consent has been given by a child&rsquo;s mother, a guardian or person having charge of the child. In cases where the mother cannot give consent or is unwilling to do so and it is deemed that adoption is in the child&rsquo;s best interest, the case will be referred to the High Court where the dispensing of the mothers consent will be considered.  These cases are often associated with children in long term care who are being adopted by their foster carers. In such cases the Agency may meet the High Court costs if the applicants, as identified through the assessment do not have the means to meet these costs.  The Agency may also meet the cost of supplementary assessments such as DNA testing in order to determine parentage and/or psychological tests where the costs cannot be met by the person required to undergo the assessment.  </p></reply>

These children are cared for by staff who deserve to have a safe working environment.  </p>  <p>  In recent years it has been Government policy to end the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities.  This policy has found cross-party support.  In moving towards this goal a series of developments have been put in place.  These have included a substantial capital development to provide new and modern facilities at Oberstown and also a range of operational improvements including measures to integrate and standardise procedures on the Campus, legislative reform under the Children (Amendment) Act 2015 and the first programme of staff recruitment in over ten years.  I acknowledge the contribution of the staff and managers in Oberstown on the progress that has been made in this area.  They have played a key role in delivering this change.</p>  <p>  I understand that the issues of staff safety and training supports are currently the subject of discussion between Oberstown management and staff representatives at the Workplace Relations Commission, following the industrial action which took place on Tuesday 31 May.  </p>  <p>  In Oberstown, there is an emphasis on training in behaviour management programmes that de-escalate and, where possible, avoid crises involving the behaviour of children . I condemn any and all incidents resulting in assault and injury to staff. There is no acceptable level of violent behaviour in a children detention school.  I am advised that children are assessed daily for all forms of risk and in the light of such assessments the residential care plans for children are reviewed accordingly.  The Oberstown Campus has in place a published bespoke behaviour management policy which has been developed in conjunction with the Crisis Prevention Institute of Wisconsin, USA who are internationally recognised for their expertise in this area. Oberstown staff are provided with formal training in the policy with the object of providing staff with the skills to manage the behaviour of children. Policies and procedures are continually reviewed with the aim of ensuring safe and secure custody for children and the safety of staff. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the risk of injury cannot be excluded completely given the nature of a children detention school.  A specific employee assistance programme is in place to assist members of staff on foot of any such incident where required.  Staff are fully supported where incidents have to be investigated by the Garda authorities.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the engagement between Oberstown management and staff is now taking place at the Workplace Relations Commission and understand that industrual action has been suspended during this process.  I intend to continue to monitor the progress of these discussions, in conjunction with the Oberstown board of management.  </p></reply>

Special care is used to address the risk of harm that may be caused to a child's life, health, safety, development or welfare by their behaviour.  Children are admitted to Special Care following a successful application to the Child and Family Agency's Special Care Admissions Committee and then to the High Court for a Special Care Order, in line with the provisions of the Child Care Act 1991, as amended. </p>  <p>  The criteria for admission to a special care unit are the age of the child, the concerns and risk assessment of the child, and a risk management plan.  The age range for admission is 11 to 17 years.  The concern and risk assessment must show evidence of the risk of harm that is posed by the child's behaviour.  The risk management plan must show that the admission to special care will benefit the child and is being sought as other interventions or alternate placements are not able to meet the specific needs of the child.  Documentation to support and provide evidence for the application are also considered and includes a special care application form, views of the child and the parents/guardians, the history leading to the application, the child's social history and details of previous placements.  The current capacity of the three special care units is 17 places and as of the end of March 2016, 15 children were in special care placements. </p>  <p>  The National Standards for Special Care Units ensures that the rights and diversity of children residing in Special Care units are respected and promoted.  This includes the rights as prescribed in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Therefore procedures are put in place for all children whose first language is not English, not only in Special Care Units, but within all care placements nationally.  To facilitate communication between social workers and children and their families, interpretive services are arranged as required by social workers within care and placement planning and social care staff in Special Care Units.</p></reply>

Using savings from 2015, my Department was able to announce additional CCS places in late 2015. Under Budget 2016, my Department lifted the previous restrictions as part of a major package of strategic investment in affordable, quality and accessible childcare. This allowed existing Community Services to provide for more families eligible for CCS, and it allowed Community Services who had not been able to provide CCS to offer this programme for the first time. The Budget 2016 package included a further &euro;16m investment in the expansion of the CCS Programme in a targeted manner, providing support for 8,000 additional places at current usage patterns. These new childcare places will be available through community/not-for-profit childcare providers and, for the first time, through private childcare providers. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the significant barriers childcare presents to parents wanting to take up employment, education or training, and the complexities of working through the different childcare programmes funded by my Department, the Budget 2016 package also funded the establishment of a dedicated Project Team to develop a Single Affordable Childcare Programme to provide for a more streamlined eligibility criteria that will assist families to avail of good quality childcare at a cost they can afford. Work on the Affordable Childcare Programme has begun and it is expected to be in place by the end of 2017. This single programme will replace the existing CCS, along with the Training and Employment Childcare programmes, comprising the After-School Childcare, Childcare Education and Training Support, and Community Employment Childcare. It will provide a new simplified subsidy programme, available through both community/not-for-profit and private childcare providers. The programme will also provide a robust platform for future investment through which a number of commitments in the Programme for Government can be delivered, while ensuring that childcare is more affordable for those who are most in need.</p></reply>

The service have been contacted and informed of their right to appeal this decision.</p>  <p>  For a childcare service to be approved for the higher capitation rate in respect of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme in 2015-2016 they were required to satisfy criteria regarding qualifications and ratios, which applied to all ECCE rooms/sessions in the service.  All pre-schools had to satisfy the minimum qualification requirements as approved on the published list of my Department's Early Years Recognised Qualifications (level 7 or equivalent) and have at least three years' experience working in the early years sector.  All pre-school assistants were required to be qualified to level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications.  Services also had to ensure that they had enough appropriately qualified staff present for each ECCE session to cover the amount of children present at that time.  While it is recognised that there may be challenges in securing staff qualified to Level 7 (or equivalent) in all pre-school rooms, the aim of the significant Government investment in free pre-school is to ensure that children have access to the best quality care and education in their early years. </p>  <p>  Following the announcement of the expansion of ECCE in Budget 2016, and the efforts being made by the pre-school sector to provide sufficient additional capacity, my Department decided to make two changes to policy to encourage capacity development: From September 2016, the rules regarding qualifying for higher capitation rate are to change, to allow for Higher Capitation to be paid per room in a service, rather than all rooms being required to meet the criteria.  As a result, this particular service will qualify for the Higher Capitation rate for rooms led by level 7 qualified room leaders from September 2016.  It was also decided after Budget 2016 that some leniency would be given during compliance visits (for the 2015-16 programme year only) to pre-school providers in receipt of higher capitation that can prove that a that a fully qualified room leader with a minimum level 7 qualification (or equivalent) had been recruited, but was unable to commence employment immediately due to delays experienced with Garda vetting.  It is my understanding that this was not the case with this particular service.</p></reply>

The TSG papers outline the advantages of imposing a volumetric tax, rather than an ad valorem tax of 20% as initially proposed by the Irish Heart Foundation.  A volumetric tax is imposed as a specific amount per litre of product, as opposed to an ad valorem rate imposed on the final retail price of product.  As a volumetric tax would be based on the volume of the actual product rather than its price, it is applied evenly to multipacks, large volume SSD bottles and cheaper 'own-brand' SSD products, as it is to more expensive branded products, and therefore is more effective from a public health point of view.  France, Hungary, Finland and Belgium all impose volumetric taxes on SSD, and the UK proposes to introduce a volumetric tax on sugar sweetened drinks from April 2018.</p>  <p>  The revenue raised by such a tax will depend on, among other things, the rate at which it is set, and the types of drinks included within its scope.  These issues are budgetary matters which will be determined through the budgetary process.</p></reply>

Vacancies currently existing within the current sanctioned limit of 173 WTE psychologists are currently being pursued by my Department with the Public Appointments Service with a view to appointing suitably qualified personnel from the current recruitment panel formed for this purpose.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits that we will invest additional resources in the National Educational Psychological Service to ensure earlier intervention and access for young children and teenagers and to offer immediate support to schools in cases of critical incidents.  The Programme commits to bring the total number of NEPS psychologists to 238 from the current sanctioned limit of 173.</p>  <p>  NEPS does not maintain waiting lists but, in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.</p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  I would advise if there are concerns in relation to the educational development of any student that these should be raised, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he/she is attending, with a view to the Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist.</p></reply>

My Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide. The system uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and information from my own Department's databases. With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.</p><p>When it is decided that a new school is required to meet demographic needs in an area, the Department runs a separate patronage process to decide who will operate the school. The criteria used in relation to patronage of the new schools place a particular emphasis on parental demand for plurality and diversity of patronage, with parental preferences at the centre of the process.  In this regard, patron bodies and prospective patrons applying for the patronage of a new school announced by the Department must collect and demonstrate evidence of parental demand for the model of provision proposed as part of their application under the patronage process.</p><p>As part of this process, a New Schools Establishment Group was put in place to advise the Minister on the patronage of the new schools following its consideration of an assessment report which is prepared by the Department on the applications that are received from patron bodies.</p><p>It is open to all patrons and prospective patrons to apply for patronage of the school under this process and parental preferences for each patron are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process.

However, eligible students can still qualify for limited fee support.</p>  <p>  Those who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme are eligible to have their post graduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270. Alternatively, a postgraduate student may qualify to have a &euro;2,000 contribution made towards the cost of his/her fees. The income threshold for this payment is &euro;31,500 for the 2016/17 academic year, increasing relative to the number of family dependents.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to "increase financial supports for post graduate students with a particular focus on those from low income households". All proposals made in relation to education expenditure, including changes to post graduate student grants, will be considered in the context of the Budget 2017.</p></reply>

Legal advice indicates that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p><p>The NCSE has published a Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act. This report, which was published in 2006, made recommendations which suggested that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act.</p><p>My Department's opinion is that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. However, a total estimate of this amount has not been quantified.</p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act have not recently been conducted. The level of additional expenditure required would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis.</p><p>Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who might currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.</p><p>The Children's Rights Alliance Report 2016 recommended that an audit of laws, judicial, administrative practice and polices, services and supports for children with special educational needs should be conducted.</p><p>I wish to advise that the NCSE has a statutory function under the EPSEN Act to advise me in relation to matters concerning the education of children with special educational needs.</p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has published a number of policy advice papers.</p><p>These reports include the NCSE Report on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools (2013) and the Report of the NCSE Working Group: Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for Students with Special Educational Needs (2014). The NCSE has also published an Information booklet for Parents of Children with Special Educational Needs.</p><p>These reports are available at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p><p>The policy advice paper 'Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools' included an assessment of the legislative and administrative practices underpinning the provision of special educational needs supports and also the current polices and manner of providing supports for children with special educational needs in schools.</p><p>The report also made a number of recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.</p><p>Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, I have also committed to consulting with stakeholders to see how best to progress sections of the EPSEN Act that were introduced on a non-statutory basis.</p></reply>

The scheme is administered by NEPS from a panel of private practitioners maintained for this purpose.</p><p>The Scheme for Commissioning was created in 2001 as a temporary measure to provide service to schools (assessment only) in advance of full provision of NEPS personnel and where a NEPS psychologist was not available to provide the full NEPS model of service. Historically service was provided to schools either by a NEPS psychologist or through SCPA.</p><p>From the start of the 2013/14 academic year and based on a planned staffing complement of 173 w.t.e., NEPS assigned a psychologist to all mainstream schools in order to provide the full advisory &amp;amp; support service. This has meant that NEPS psychologists have taken on additional schools and pupil numbers which is supported by the use of SCPA where the psychologist deems appropriate. SCPA is used in the main to provide assessment service to school whose NEPS psychologist is not available due to for example maternity or sick leave or in advance of NEPS achieving its sanctioned staffing limit of 173 whole-time-equivalent psychologist numbers.  For the Deputy's information, the following table sets out the number of assessments commissioned under SCPA for each of the last ten year and their cost.</p><p><b>Service provided to school via the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA</b><table><tr><th>Calendar Year</th><th>Number of Assessments</th><th>Cost &euro;</th></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>4,561</td><td>1,505,130</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>4,372</td><td>1,444,146</td></tr><tr><td>2009 (*)</td><td>2,335</td><td>761,106</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>2,818</td><td>856,892</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>2,456</td><td>746,320</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>2,113</td><td>642,073</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>2,061</td><td>626,254</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>1,595</td><td>491,872</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>1,744</td><td>531,088</td></tr><tr><td>2016 (to date)</td><td>895</td><td>272,080</td></tr></table></p><p>(*) the rise from 2009 to 2010 is attributable to a late commencement of the scheme at the start of the 2009/10 academic year which caused a bulge of activity/cost in early 2010 which would normally have been experienced in 2009. The overall diminution in SCPA reflects directly the growth in NEPS employed psychologist numbers.</p></reply>

My Department, over the course of recent economic difficulties, has not only maintained psychologist staffing levels within NEPS, but has increased them by some 10% since late 2008, to 162 whole time equivalent psychologists currently employed.  My Department is actively engaged with the Public Appointments Service to recruit nine further psychologists to NEPS from an existing panel of qualified professionals developed for this purpose and it is envisaged that most of these posts will be filled in the immediate future.</p><p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits that we will invest additional resources in the National Educational Psychological Service to ensure earlier intervention and access for young children and teenagers and to offer immediate support to schools in cases of critical incidents.  The Programme commits to bring the total number of NEPS psychologists to 238 from the current sanctioned limit of 173.</p><p>  Based on current years' enrolment I can inform the Deputy that to provide for a 1:5,000 ratio of NEPS psychologists to pupil would require some 185 whole-time-equivalent psychologist staff taking into account the existing management structures.</p></reply>

It provides up to 92% of the market value of a property purchased up to a maximum loan amount of &euro;285,000.  The loan is a normal capital and interest bearing mortgage. It is offered at a single, competitive variable interest rate.

In respect of payments my Department provides two main options for payment methods for its customers: payments direct to customer accounts in financial institutions or payments in cash at post offices.  </p>  <p>  In 2015 my department made over 38 million cash payments at Post Offices at a cost of &euro;54 million.  These welfare payments through post offices are across all of the department&rsquo;s major schemes: state pension, jobseekers, one parent family payments, widow/ers or survivors pensions, carers payments, disability payments and child benefit.  </p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that for the vast majority of my department&rsquo;s schemes the department&rsquo;s customers are given the choice of what payment method they wish to receive their social welfare payment.  The vast majority of new customers choose to have payments made directly into their accounts in financial institutions which reflects a societal trend towards payment by electronic funds transfer.  For example, 83% of new Child Benefit customers and 70% of new State Pension customers chose this option in 2015.  </p>  <p>  Many of my department&rsquo;s customers are in employment.  My department&rsquo;s focus must be on our customers and to this end my department&rsquo;s policy is to make payments to in-work customers directly to accounts rather than customers being inconvenienced by two separate payment methods.  </p>  <p>  My department has a cohort of jobseeker customers who are classified as casual jobseekers.  These are in-work customers who can claim a jobseekers payment for 2 to 3 days per week or who work week on/week-off.  These customers were paid by cheque each week.</p>  <p>  Those customers were paid by cheque due to the changing nature of their work/claiming patterns and the short turn-around time to issue payments.  It is important to note that they were not paid via post offices under the department&rsquo;s existing cash payments contract with An Post.  </p>  <p>  My department has developed its payment capacity in respect of changing work and claiming patterns and is offering payments direct to accounts in financial institutions for casual Jobseeker customers thereby increasing customer convenience.  This is in line with wider departmental policy where the focus is on ensuring that in-work customers are paid by the most convenient method possible.</p>  <p>  My department has written to all of these casual jobseekers offering the option of a payment to an account.  The vast majority have responded and opted for payment to an account.</p>  <p>  If customers wish to continue to be paid by cheque they can make their preference known to their local social welfare office which handles their claim.</p>  <p>  The recent &ldquo;Kerr Report&rdquo; sets out the challenges that An Post and Postmasters face as they seek to ensure that the post office network remains relevant in the context of the inexorable shift towards electronic payments.</p>  <p>  My department is engaging as appropriate with the Departments of Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources and Public, Expenditure and Reform in addressing the recommendations of the report.</p></reply>

The latter scheme is only payable to widow/er&rsquo;s and surviving civil partners under 66 years of age with no children &ndash; claimants aged 66 and over can apply for the non-contributory state pension and claimants aged under 66 with children can apply for the one-parent family payment.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s allocation for 2016 is &euro;1.4 billion for expenditure on the contributory pension for 2016, &euro;7.5 million for the (contributory) death benefit pension and a further &euro;15.8 million for the non-contributory pension.  This represents 7.25% of the Department&rsquo;s overall expenditure for 2016.  At the end of April 2016, there were almost 120,000 recipients of the widow/er&rsquo;s and surviving civil partner&rsquo;s contributory pension.</p>  <p>  The rates of payment on these schemes differ depending on the age of the recipient.  For those aged 66 and over, the maximum rate is &euro;233.30 per week for recipients of the widow/er&rsquo;s and surviving civil partner&rsquo;s contributory pension and &euro;237.70 for recipients of the widow/er&rsquo;s and surviving civil partner&rsquo;s death benefit pension, while for those under 66 of age, the maximum rates are &euro;193.50 and &euro;218.50 per week for the contributory and death benefit pensions, respectively.  The widow/er&rsquo;s and surviving civil partner&rsquo;s non-contributory pension has a rate of &euro;188 per week.</p>  <p>  Recipients of these schemes aged 66 and over may also benefit from the living alone allowance, the household benefits package, fuel allowance and the free travel scheme.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to increase the rate of pensions and the living alone allowance above the rate of inflation.  The appropriate level of supports for widows, widowers and surviving civil partners will be considered in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

This amelioration of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR), which subsequently became law under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015, provides for changes to occur in three phases, on 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018.</p>  <p>  On 1 January 2016, increases in the exemption thresholds for PSPR application were activated. These exemption threshold increases fully removed PSPR from a significant number of pensions with relatively lower values, while those pensions which continue to be impacted by PSPR received a boost of &euro;400 per year.</p>  <p>  On 1 January 2017, additional PSPR amelioration, acting principally via further exemption threshold increases, will fully remove PSPR from another significant tranche of public service pensioners, while at the same time boosting those pensions which remain affected by PSPR by &euro;500 per year. </p>  <p>  On 1 January 2018, the third phase of PSPR amelioration will ensure that all PSPR-impacted pensions with values up to &euro;34,132 will be fully restored, meaning that PSPR will no longer affect such pensions, while those pensions which continue to be impacted by PSPR will get a boost of, in most cases, &euro;780 per year.</p>  <p>  These phased PSPR changes across the public service will cost an estimated &euro;90 million on an annual basis and, when fully implemented, will ensure that only the top 20% higher value public service pensions will continue to be impacted by the PSPR. I have no plans to propose alterations to the dates on which these phased changes to the PSPR are to occur, as provided for under FEMPI 2015.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I am required to undertake an annual review of the necessity of the FEMPI legislation and report to the Houses of the Oireachtas. That report is currently being prepared and will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas later this month.</p></reply>

Any further consideration of remuneration for any group of public servants, including issues relating to more recently recruited public servants, will fall to be examined within the provisions of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013 -2018 (Lansdowne Road Agreement).  Any such considertion  will also of course have to comply with the terms of the Financial Emergency in the Public Interest Acts 2009 - 2013 (FEMPI), as well as its affordability being underpinned through delivering enhanced work place practices and productivity. </p>  <p>  It is particularly worth noting that under the Lansdowne Road Agreement (LRA) the process of restoring public service pay is commencing.  An important feature of this process is the flat rate increases which are  being implemented and which are proportionately more valuable to those public servants including Teachers who are at an early stage in their careers.  Furthermore and specifically in respect of Teachers the restoration of the Supervision and Substitution payment is also provided for under the LRA subject to there being  compliance on the part of the relevant unions with the provisions of that Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also states that Government will establish a Public Service Pay Commission to examine pay levels across the public service.  The precise structure of such a commission and the technical aspects as to how it would operate have yet to be decided upon and would require broad consultation, including engagement with staff representatives as was committed to in the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  My officials have begun to review international best practice in respect of public service pay determination models.  This will help frame the Government's thinking on how to establish a fair, transparent and accountable process for determining public service pay, taking into account the views of all stakeholders.  </p></reply>

It was undertaken by my Department&rsquo;s Evaluation Unit under the guidance of an expert Steering Committee chaired by Dr. John O&rsquo;Hagan, Professor of Economics at Trinity College.  The Value for Money Policy Review recommended the establishment of a set of 11 performance indicators, linked to the objectives of the Arts Council, to assess the results of the Arts Council&rsquo;s annual programme.  A subset of these include the number of arts projects that involve groups identified in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion and the number of participants as a percentage of all Art Council funded programme participants, as well as the percentage of the Arts Council&rsquo;s annual programme funding allocated to social inclusion projects.</p><p>The recommendations of the VFM report are reflected in the Arts Council&rsquo;s ten-year strategy <i>Making Great Art Work</i>(2016-2025) which set outs how it will lead the development of all aspects of the arts in Ireland over the next decade.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-09a.313.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900054#WRK00500"><p>In 2014, the National Registry for Deliberate Self-Harm recorded 11,126 presentations to hospital due to self-harm, involving 8,708 individuals.  The self-harm rate, 200 per 100,000 of the population, was essentially unchanged from 2013.  This levelling off follows three successive decreases in the rate of persons presenting to hospital following self-harm from 2011 &ndash; 2013.  The only significant change in the rate of hospital-treated self-harm by age was among boys aged 10-14 years, where the self-harm rate increased by 44% from 34 to 49 per 100,000.  The upward trend in self-harm among young boys is concerning.  In this regard, the HSE in its National Service Plan for 2016 has prioritised the development of early intervention and prevention services for children and young people.  Funding is also being provided this year for the provision of new Jigsaw youth mental health services in Cork, Dublin and Limerick.</p><p>The HSE Mental Health Division has a multifaceted response to people at risk of self-harm and includes referral by GP to Community Mental Health Teams, liaison psychiatry services on-site in Model 3 and 4 and acute hospitals, a comprehensive mental health on-call service in Emergency Departments for people presenting in crisis during the on-call period, and self-harm clinical specialist nurses in a number of Emergency Departments.  In addition, a HSE initiative enables GPs to refer directly to a Suicide Crisis Assessment Nurse for assessment and advice on management of their patients who present with suicidal ideation.  In each of these settings, a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment is carried out together with an assessment of mental state and a risk assessment for suicide.  On the basis of this, a care plan is drawn up.  Next steps depend on the psychosocial stresses identified along with the presence or absence of a mental illness such as depression.</p><p>Community Child and Adolescent Mental Health teams are the first line of specialist mental health services for children and young people.  There are currently 67 such teams and 3 liaison services nationally.  The multi-disciplinary team, under the clinical direction of a Consultant Child and Adolescent psychiatrist, includes junior medical staff, psychologists, social workers, nurses, speech &amp;amp; language therapist, occupational therapist and child care workers.  The assessment and intervention provided by such teams is determined by the severity and complexity of the presenting problem(s).  This range of disciplines and skills offer a care and treatment package geared to individual needs.  The HSE&rsquo;s National Office for Suicide Prevention supports a range of services for teenagers, young people and their families, including Pieta House, SpunOut.ie, ReachOut.com/Inspire Ireland and BeLongTo.  They also fund the 24-hour call services provided by the Samaritans and 'Childline'.  The National Office also works closely with the Department of Education and Skills in the application of the Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Well-Being in Primary and Post Primary Schools  <i>.</i></p></reply>

Funding for mental health in 2016 will increase from the 2015 outturn of &euro;785m, to a projected budget of &euro;826m in the 2016 National Service Plan, an increase of &euro;41m or 5.2%, including &euro;35m ring-fenced for new developments this year.</p><p>All aspects of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services are being developed, <i>A Vision For Change</i>recommends 80 additional child and adolescent psychiatric inpatient beds nationally.  The HSE Operational Plan for Mental Health 2016 indicates that there are 76  Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service beds in the system, of which 66 are operational at present.  As recruitment issues are addressed, the potential exists to further increase bed capacity.</p><p>The HSE National Service Plan objective for this year aims for 78% or greater of accepted referrals to Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams to be seen within three months.  A priority target is to address the needs of those waiting over 12 months, while maintaining targets for first appointments and seeing individuals within three months.  In addition, the Executive aims to improve the delivery of services in a more consistent and transparent manner, reflecting the identified clinical needs of the child.  Additional resources and facilities mean that we now have 67 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service Teams, and 3 Paediatric Liaison Teams, with further teams planned.</p><p>Other initiatives being progressed include the new Jigsaw mental health services in Cork, Dublin and Limerick; new early intervention counselling services for under 18s via Primary Care; improved 24/7 response and Liaison Services; improved Perinatal Mental Health, and two new mental health Clinical Programmes, specifically relating ADHD in Adults and Children, and Dual Diagnosis of those with Mental Illness and Substance Misuse.</p><p>In light of the Government's additional funding allocation for mental health in 2016, I am satisfied that the HSE is committed to further improving its child psychiatric services.</p></reply>

Under the Scheme 1,000 Intern places were provided for Health Care Assistants (HCA), Multi Task Attendants (MTA) and Support Grades.  The grade of MTA is a generic grade that covers staff working as porters, in catering or as HCAs.  Therefore a new grade of Intern MTA was introduced under the Public Service Agreements (PSA).  These were 2 year contracts with a starting salary of 85% of the normal starting salary in Year 1 and 90% in Year 2.  This Intern grade was considered to be outside of the normal employment level restrictions.  When discussion took place once again on this grade under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, it was agreed to provide that where Interns had completed 18 months of satisfactory service, they would be regularised into permanent positions.</p>  <p>  Separately and outside of the PSA process, the National Recruitment Service for the HSE in Manorhamilton resumed the process of filling a number of vacancies on a permanent basis from panels that had been in place for some time.  It is possible that given the timeframes involved in the Intern scheme that there could be interns who have not yet completed their 18 months satisfactory service working alongside new recruits to these support grades recently employed by the HSE.  I am advised that this situation is unusual and the issues involved are being examined by the HSE.</p></reply>

Prior to deciding whether to reimburse a medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available.</p><p>The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) of pharmaceutical products for the HSE, and can make recommendations on reimbursement to assist the HSE in its decision-making process.  The NCPE used a decision framework to systematically assess whether the drug  is cost-effective as a health intervention</p><p>I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier submitted in March 2016 on the cost effectiveness of lumacaftor/ivacaftor (Orkambi).  This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets including hospitalisation, disease management costs, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising in patients not taking Orkambi.</p><p>The NCPE has completed its HTA and submitted it to the HSE.  The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug.  The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis.</p><p>A summary of the HTA has been published on the NCPE website and is available at:<i><font color="#2F2F2F"> .</font></i></p><p>The HSE will now enter into negotiations with the manufacturer, to seek very significant price reductions.  The HSE will then consider the outcome of these negotiations, together with the NCPE recommendation, in making a final decision on reimbursement.</p></reply>

The 2016 HSE Service Plan undertakes to maintain 2015 levels of service in respect of scheduled care and to continue to address waiting times as part of the regular performance and accountability process.  The HSE seeks to ensure that those whose clinical needs are most urgent are prioritised accordingly, whilst managing the needs of those who have been waiting longest for routine treatment in chronological order.  As of 31 May 2016 there were 10,634 people on the waiting list for Orthopaedic procedures.  38.5% (4094) are waiting less than 3 months. 62.1% (6605) people are waiting less than 6 months.  5.3% (561) are waiting in excess of 15 months which is the maximum waiting time determined by the previous Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  A Scheduled Care Governance Group has been established in the HSE to coordinate key initiatives to reduce waiting times and the number of patients awaiting treatment.  Actions overseen by this Group include driving greater adherence to chronological scheduling, relocation of low complexity surgical procedures to smaller hospitals and administrative and clinical validation procedures to ensure that patients are available for treatment.</p>  <p>  Each Hospital Group has been mandated to designate a key person to lead and support waiting list management improvements, so as to advance towards compliance with maximum waiting times.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to provide &euro;15m to the NTPF in 2017 to address waiting lists and my Department will engage with the NTPF and the HSE regarding the development of this initiative.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific question raised, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly. If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and my officials will follow the matter up.</p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to increasing funding for home care packages and home help year on year.  I am pleased to say that yesterday&rsquo;s announcement, by my colleague the Minister for Health, of the Government's approval of  a revised health estimate includes funding for the winter initiative to address overcrowding in Emergency Departments and increased resources for home care.</p>  <p>  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme, with a net budget of &euro;940m is expected to support 23,450 clients on average per week, representing an increase of 649 clients per week on the 2015 outturn.

In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold.  Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs.</p>  <p>  The Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) payment is made by the Minister for Social Protection to carers in respect of a child at home under 16 years of age with a severe disability, where it has been determined that the child requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government states "We will extend the entitlement to a medical card for all children in receipt of the Domiciliary Care Allowance in Budget 2017.  Approximately 10,000 children would benefit from this initiative."   This a matter which I intend to consider in the context of the implementation of the Health commitments in the Programme for Government and having regard to the funding available to facilitate such measures.  Detailed financial analysis will be required in order to establish as accurately as possible the expected costs to the Exchequer in each case.</p></reply>

No. 171 of 2009) set out payments in respect of services rendered by a registered dentist to or on behalf of the Health Service Executive under the Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS), including restorations (fillings) and prophylaxis (scale and polish).  The fee payable for an amalgam restoration is &euro;50.06 and &euro;51.88 for a composite restoration.  The fee for prophylaxis is &euro;31.00. Fees for other procedures, for which there had previously been regional variations, are set out in the Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to Dentists) Regulations 2011.  These Regulations provide for payments for Protracted Periodontal Treatment Services of &euro;26.36 per visit.</p>  <p>  The cost of restoring treatments which had been provided before 2010 to all medical card holders would depend on a number of factors, including the underlying oral health of the population and the likely level of take-up of such services.  The HSE continues to monitor the operation of the DTSS to ensure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of available resources.</p>  <p>  The Primary Care Reimbursement Service of the HSE regularly publishes detailed reports on expenditure.  These reports are available on the following website, www.hse.ie/eng/staff/PCRS/PCRS_Publications.</p></reply>

This estimate included costs related to the provision of the service to children under six 6 years of age and to all persons over 70 years of age. However, the basis of that estimate was made prior to the fees being set for the new enhanced services to be provided in accordance with the under 6s GP contract, which includes age-based preventive checks focused on health and well-being and the prevention of disease, including asthma care.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding by the Health Service Executive, the Department of Health and the Irish Medical Organisation in 2015, the parties are currently engaged in a comprehensive review of the General Medical Services (GMS) and other publicly funded health sector contracts involving GPs.  Depending on the outcome of these negotiations, and their implications for the future scope and content of the service and the relevant fees and payments to GPs, the actual costs of extending free GP care to all citizens may vary from any estimates previously provided, as these are produced on the basis of current costs at a given point in time.</p></reply>

I have been advised by the Saolta Health Care Group that the bone-density scanning service has been impacted by a shortage of radiographers. As a result, a waiting list has built up.</p>  <p>  Galway University Hospitals are currently actively working to recruit radiographers in order to fill a number of vacancies.  One successful candidate will commence work in early July. An additional five individuals have been offered posts and are currently in the process of appointment. Recruitment to three further posts is ongoing. </p>  <p>  Saolta has advised that GUH plans to treat all patients booked into the bone density scanner service up to the end of June 2016.  </p>  <p>  The Saolta Group and the HSE are working to put the necessary arrangements in place to ensure the continuity of services from July . In the interim period until the newly-recruited radiographers have taken up their posts, the Hospital Group is progressing a range of options, including staff overtime and outsourcing in order to ensure service continuity for patients. </p>  <p>  It is also important to note that major developments are ongoing and planned for Galway University Hospitals. The Programme for a Partnership Government has committed to progressing a new Emergency Department facility.  Also construction work is ongoing on the new 75 bed ward block as well as a new acute mental health department at the Hospital.</p></reply>

This is particularly true when looking at a small population area, such as Cobh, relative to the national population.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing a new National Cancer Strategy 2016 - 2025 which is likely to focus on prevention, early diagnosis, further improvements in treatment, rare cancers, survivorship and high quality, patient-centred care.

I do not have a role in setting prices or the details of commercial arrangements in the food supply chain but I am concerned about fairness and sustainability.  The Grocery Goods Undertakings Regulations, 2016 which entered into force on 30 April 2016 provide for statutory regulation of certain practices, sanctions, investigation and enforcement.  The Regulations apply to dealings between grocery goods retailers or wholesalers in the State with an annual worldwide turnover of more than &euro;50 million, and their suppliers. They provide for written contracts to be in place, for payment to suppliers for their goods within 30 days except where otherwise provided in a contract, for retention of records and for submission of an annual compliance report to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, which operates under the auspices of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The Regulations also prohibit certain specific practices including the compelling of payments for the allocation and retention of shelf space and compelling a supplier to obtain any goods or services from particular third parties.  </p>  <p>  At EU level the European Commission has examined relationships in the food chain and unfair trading practices but has not to date proposed any legislative measures other than encouraging the formation of producer groups.  An agricultural markets task force has also been established by DG AGRI and is due to report by the end of this year.     </p>  <p>  Sustainable food production requires access to a wide range of markets, competitiveness, adding value and innovation.  The resources of my Department and its agencies are deployed to support and develop quality production systems, market insight, understanding of buyer and consumer needs and facilitating varied routes to market.  </p>  <p>  I believe that operators along the supply chain need to acknowledge their interdependence and work together to develop a supply chain model which sustains agricultural production and positions Ireland to grow the value and volume of agri-food exports.  However, as I have indicated, I have no powers to set or directly influence prices or to engage with supermarkets to do so.  </p></reply>

The research funded through these programmes is undertaken, often collaboratively, by Irish research performing organisations e.g. Higher Education Institutes and Teagasc.  Industry can participate in such proposals on a non-funded basis through in-kind contributions.</p><p>My Department publicises research calls widely, through, <i>inter alia</i>, advertising in the national press and all information relating to the call is made available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  In addition, research performing organisations and relevant groups such as the CoFoRD Council for forestry and the industry-led National Advisory Group on Agri-Food Research and Innovation (NAFRI) are contacted directly.</p><p>Horizon 2020, which is the European financial instrument supporting research and innovation, is directed nationally by Enterprise Ireland and is supported by a network of 32 advisors.

Under Horizon 2020 my Department provides funding for Irish research performing organisations to compete in calls under the European Research Area Networks (ERA-NETS) and Joint Programme Initiatives and research performing organisations are contacted directly by my Department when funding opportunities arise.  In addition, my Department and the Marine Institute endeavour to ensure that all the relevant stakeholders such as businesses, community groups and Local Government, including County Councils, Local Enterprise Offices and LEADER organisations are made aware of the research funding opportunities.  Also my Department works in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland, which has a very strong outreach to all industries including agriculture and aquaculture.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-09a.562.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900063#WRT00600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 207 and 208 together.</p>  <p>  The UK is by far our largest single trading partner. According to CSO figures, in 2015 we exported almost &euro;5.1 billion worth of agricultural products, and imports from the UK were worth &euro;3.8 billion. The prospect of a UK vote to leave the EU therefore has serious implications for the agri-food sector. </p>  <p>  This is borne out in the reports that have been produced in recent months on the potential impact of a UK exit on Ireland. An ESRI report last year estimated that the potential reduction in bilateral trade flows could be as high as 20%, with an even higher impact on agriculture, food and beverages. Teagasc, at the request of my Department, has carried out a deeper analysis, which found that, depending on the assumptions made, the minimum impact could be a reduction of 1.4% or &euro;150 million per annum in the value of Irish agri-food exports, with a possible worst-case scenario involving a reduction of over 7%, or &euro;800 million, per annum. </p>  <p>However, it is important to note that there would be no dramatic change straight away,   and that the actual impact of a UK exit would depend on the post-exit relationship that will have to be negotiated between the EU and the UK. The Treaty on European Union provides for a period of two years of negotiations, with extensions possible if agreement is not reached in this period. </p>  <p>  There are four main areas in which concerns arise from an agri-food perspective. These are tariffs and trade arrangements, the EU budget, standards and customs controls. </p>  <p>Potential differences in tariffs after a UK exit could restrict trade in both directions and affect traditional supply practices, particularly for raw materials. Once the exit negotiations have been completed, the UK would be free to negotiate free trade agreements with other third countries. This is particularly relevant in relation to meat imports from South America. This could present a competitiveness challenge for third country suppliers, such as Ireland. However, negotiating such agreements could be a lengthy process.   </p>  <p>  The UK is a net contributor to the EU budget. A UK exit could result in a loss of its contribution of between 5 and 10%. Given that the CAP accounts for some 37% of the EU budget, we could expect additional pressure for further contraction in CAP funding in the years ahead. </p>  <p>  Currently the EU operates a common regulatory regime, and the rules of the single market allow free movement of goods between Member States. While the EU and the UK may wish to keep such arrangements in place for as long as possible, deviations between UK and EU standards could give rise to trading difficulties and additional costs. </p>  <p>  Under most scenarios, a British exit from the EU would see the return of some sort of border controls, customs or administrative procedures that would replace the current free movement of goods. This would add to administrative costs. Similarly, and even with a constructive approach from the UK on market access terms and veterinary certificates, the administrative burden in relation to veterinary and health certification could be considerable.</p>  <p>  Finally, the possibility of UK exit poses a serious and complex situation for our fisheries sector. While the negative impact on trade could be significant - the UK is our second largest market for seafood after France - the most complex fisheries issues are those related to the possibility of restricted access to fishing grounds and resources. We would face a very uncertain situation related to the management and sharing of large numbers of different fish stocks that we currently share with the UK and other Member States under the Common Fisheries Policy Framework.</p>  <p>  I and my Department are continuing to reflect on these matters so that we are prepared, if the UK decision is to exit, to establish our priorities for the negotiations in the agri-food and fisheries sectors, and to engage in these negotiations at an early date. We are also in ongoing consultation with our Government colleagues to ensure that there is a coherent, whole-of-Government approach to the issue.</p></reply>

One key measure is the design of a new Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) support scheme for a range of renewable generation technologies in the heating sector. The initial phase of the public consultations on the RHI closed in September 2015 and was designed to review the technology options that may be supported by any new scheme. </p>  <p>  In the last month my Department has awarded a contract for an economic assessment on the costs of introducing an RHI scheme across a range of individual renewable technologies, including Anaerobic Digestion, Combined Heat and Power. This economic analysis will form an integral part of the next public consultation phase due later this year. </p>  <p>  Before a final decision is taken on introducing an RHI, the new scheme will be subject to Government approval and State aid clearance from the European Commission.  If it is decided that Anaerobic Digestion, Combined Heat and Power is one of the technologies to be supported under the RHI scheme then the project identified by the Deputy would be eligible to apply for support.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently examining correspondence received from the Deputy in relation to this facility and a substantive reply will issue shortly.</p></reply>

Following a competitive process a contract was signed with the preferred provider in November 2015.  The Employment Permits Online System (EPOS) is envisaged to provide the user with a seamless, end to end online application and payment process.</p>  <p>  Access to this system will be available through a dedicated web address or via the Department's website and will be compatible with a multitude of mobile devices and browsers.  Employment Permits applications, payments and submission of supporting documentation will be made via the Employment Permits Online System (EPOS) and with Credit/Debit Cards.  There will still be an option to apply for a permit on a hard copy application form but it is anticipated that the majority of business users will opt for the ease and speed of the online system. </p>  <p>  This project is significantly advanced and entering the user acceptance testing phase later this month.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-09a.614.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1247" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900064#WRU02100"><p>Following extensive and positive engagement with social partners, significant work over the past few years has resulted in key legislative developments that significantly enhance the rights of employees to collectively bargain with their employer and to access the State&rsquo;s workplace relations machinery in order to vindicate their rights.  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 provides for a number of significant reforms, which alongside the strengthening of the statutory code on victimisation to explicitly prohibit inducement to forego trade union representation, reaffirm compliance with recent judgements of the European Court of Human Rights and addresses the issues raised by the ILO Committee of Freedom of Association in the context of a complaint arising from the Supreme Court Ryanair case.</p><p>The Act significantly improves the position of workers and trade unions working to improve the terms and conditions of members in instances where collective bargaining is not engaged in by their employer.  In such situations, it ensures that workers, aided by their trade union, can advance claims about pay, terms and conditions and have those determined by the Labour Court based on comparisons with similar companies.</p><p>Concerning the issue of collective bargaining rights for freelance workers, you will be aware of the investigation conducted in 2004 by the then Competition Authority (now the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission) regarding possible price fixing among self-employed actors and advertising agencies.  The Competition Authority was the statutorily independent authority in Ireland with responsibility to enforce both Irish and EU competition law at the time.</p><p>The Authority found that an agreement between Irish Actors Equity SIPTU, on behalf of the actors, and the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland, on behalf of advertising agencies, was in breach of competition law in that it set the fees for services rendered.  The self-employed workers in this case were deemed to be &ldquo;undertakings&quot;.  Such setting of prices by an association of undertakings runs counter to EU and national competition law.</p><p>The decision of the Competition Authority stated that while it was perfectly legal for a trade union to represent employees in collective bargaining with their employers, its trade union mantle could not exempt its conduct when it acts as a trade association for self-employed contractors in the area of price setting.  However, this does not preclude, nor has it ever precluded, anybody representing the self-employed workers on other working conditions apart from price setting.</p><p>Under both Irish and EU Competition law, self-employed persons, including professionals who are not employees, are regarded as &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo;.  There is ample EU case law in the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) which has determined that professionals are regarded as undertakings from an EU Competition law perspective.</p><p>It is recognised that there can be instances where self-employed workers could be regarded as being in a comparable situation to employment, often referred to as false self-employment.  A CJEU ruling in December 2014 in the case of FNV Kunsten Informatie en Media v Staat de Netherlanden relates to self-employed substitute orchestral musicians in the Netherlands.  The CJEU ruling emphasised that self-employed service providers are, in principle, &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo; and are therefore subject to competition law.  However, importantly the CJEU also acknowledged that it is important to examine, in each case, whether individuals who appear to be self-employed service providers should, in fact, be categorised as &ldquo;false self-employed&rdquo; because they are, in reality, employees who should not be subject to the provisions of Competition law.  The Court made it clear that it is for National courts to examine the facts of particular cases in order to determine whether an individual should be classified as a &ldquo;false self-employed&rdquo; person - and therefore be deemed to be an employee for competition law purposes &ndash; or as a genuinely self-employed independent contractor.</p><p>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the then Minister for Business and Employment asked that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission<s><font color="#FF0000"> </font></s>review its 2004 decision in light of the aforementioned decision. he Commission has carefully considered this case and is of the view that the analysis and conclusions of the former Competition Authority in 2004 remain valid in light of the relevant principles of EU Competition law set out in the CJEU<b></b>ruling.  It also has acknowledged that had the undertakings in the 2004 case been proven to be &ldquo;false self-employed&rdquo;, then a different conclusion would have emerged.</p><p>It is important to state that there are a range of wider considerations that would require detailed examination and consultation to ensure that the basic tenets of both Irish Competition law and EU Competition law and the Treaty of the European Union from which Irish Competition law is derived, are not compromised and that there are no unintended consequences which could have implications for the economy and the State.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-09a.629.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1247" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900065#WRV01500"><p>I understand that the increase in baggage fees applied by one of the Irish airlines is not a new price rise as such but rather an increase in baggage fees that applies annually during the peak summer holiday period.  The other Irish airline has revised its fee structure for baggage replacing a large number of different fees with seasonal variations with six year-round fee bands based on the destination and duration of flights and the weight of the baggage.  While the airline claims that the revised fee structure will lead to reduced baggage charges for most passengers, I am aware that other commentators have questioned this claim.  As the Deputy will be aware, no Government in recent decades has pursued a policy of price control other than for a very small number of regulated sectors where normal competitive conditions do not obtain.  I do not propose to depart from this policy.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission&rsquo;s role is to ensure that markets are competitive and not to regulate prices.  According to the most recent Consumer Price Index figures released by the Central Statistics Office, air fares fell by 8.4 per cent in the year to April 2016. While increases in baggage charges will clearly affect some passengers, they should also be viewed in the light of the overall reduction in air fares over the past year.</p></reply>

This is because UK membership of the Union is hugely important both to Ireland&rsquo;s interests, and to the interests of a stable, successful and prosperous EU as a whole.  The Government&rsquo;s overriding focus has been, and remains, on helping to keep the UK in the Union, not preparing for its departure.  Work has been underway across Government Departments, including my own, for some time to ensure we best understand the range of issues at stake.</p>  <p>  The Department of the Taoiseach also plays a leading role, given the whole-of-government dimension that is essential in this work. In this context, in May of last year, a unit was established in the Department of the Taoiseach, specifically dealing with British-Irish and Northern Ireland affairs.</p>  <p>  The Department of Finance, for example, commissioned the research published last November by the Economic and Social Research Institute on Irish-British macroeconomic links in the context of our joint EU membership.</p>  <p>  We know from this and various other published assessments that there are very significant strategic and economic risks for Ireland if the UK were to leave the EU.  In order to mitigate these risks, the Government played a constructive role in the negotiations that took place at EU level, including in the context of the discussions leading up to the European Council in February, working with the British Government and all our EU partners towards a consensual basis for the UK&rsquo;s continued membership of the Union.</p>  <p>  Given the importance to the enterprise sector of this issue, both IDA and Enterprise Ireland are factoring this issue into their own contingency planning and continue to track where potential impacts may arise.</p>  <p>  Clearly, the pace at which any potential exit was achieved, and the terms which the UK might negotiate with the EU across a wide range of domains will be a key determinant of the impact on the economy, and on jobs and trade in particular sectors.  My Department would of course continue to work closely with colleagues in the UK and EU Member States to ensure that any potential disruption to trade and investment is minimised.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland already has a significant number of programmes available to companies who face competitive threats from various sources.  There include Lean Programmes, Market Diversification, Innovation and Management Development.  These will be the tools available to assist companies with planning and preparation.</p>  <p>  Further, a key policy priority in recent years both for my Department and for Enterprise Ireland has been to support geographic market diversification, so that Irish owned exports to non-UK markets increase by 50% to reach exports of between &euro;5 and &euro;6 billion by 2020.</p>  <p>  As a result, both Service and Manufacturing firms exports have shown a clear reduction in dependency on the UK market.  A growing number of Enterprise Ireland supported exporters are exporting to more than five countries - an indication of a strengthening resilience in market diversity terms.  In 2014, 41.8% of EI assisted exporting firms exported to more than five countries compared to 33% in 2009.</p></reply>

This investment has sought to increase the availability of risk capital for SMEs to support economic growth through the continued development of the Seed and Venture Capital industry in Ireland, thereby achieving a more robust, commercially viable and sustainable sector.</p><p>As part of Budget 2013 the Government committed &euro;175 million to the Seed and Venture Capital Scheme 2013-2018, with a target to leverage a further &euro;525 million from the private sector making &euro;700 million in additional capital available to high growth SMEs. Following the conclusion of an extensive and in-depth evaluation, the first call for expressions of interest under this scheme has concluded and commitments of &euro;109.5m were made to a number of funds in the technology and life science sectors.  This includes an investment of &euro;10m towards the Business Angels co-investment between Enterprise Ireland and the European Investment Fund announced today.  The successful funds have closed, completed fundraising and commenced investing in companies.  All investment activity for 2015 will be reported in the Enterprise Ireland Annual Seed and Venture Capital Report 2015. </p><p>In June 2015, a second call was announced for expressions of interest focused on early stage with a strategy of investing in Irish start-ups.  The specific objective is to ensure there is sufficient seed capital in the Irish market to meet demand and to support company creation and commercialisation of research.  The deadline for expressions of interest for this process is 31 July 2015. Enterprise Ireland evaluated the expressions of interest received against the published criteria and has made total commitments of &euro;65m to 7 fund managers with a number of funds expected to launch in the near-term.</p><p>In addition, funds in receipt of investment under the Seed and Venture Capital Scheme 2007-2012 are still actively investing. A third call for expressions of interest under the Seed and Venture Capital Scheme 2007-2012 was issued in July 2012. As a result of this call the &euro;50 million Frontline Ventures Fund I, &euro;20m SOSventures Fund and the &euro;6m Hoxton Ventures Fund were established and each of these funds are active in the market and actively investing. </p><p>Under these Schemes a minimum of double Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s commitment must be invested in Irish companies over the lifetime of each fund. </p><p>Since inception, the funds supported under this Scheme have drawn down the following amounts from Enterprise Ireland;<table><tr><th>2006</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>&euro;3.3m</td><td>&euro;6.3m</td><td>&euro;7.5m</td><td>&euro;12.5m</td><td>&euro;13.4m</td><td>&euro;18.5m</td><td>&euro;24.9m</td><td>&euro;21.0m</td><td>&euro;16.3m</td><td>&euro;16.1m</td></tr></table></p><p>The following table outlines the economic profile of the companies in receipt of investment as of the year end 2015.<table><tr><th>Type</th><th>Direct IRL Employment (FTE)</th><th>Turnover</th><th>Exports</th></tr><tr><td>Main VC Funds</td><td>1,163</td><td>&euro;150.9m</td><td>&euro;142.9m</td></tr><tr><td>Seed VC Funds</td><td>1,167</td><td>&euro;239.7m</td><td>&euro;110.4m</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>2,330</td><td>&euro;390.6m</td><td>&euro;253.3m</td></tr></table></p><p>The annual Enterprise Ireland Seed &amp;amp; Venture Capital Report will be launched on 14<sup>th</sup>June 2016. The report highlights that under the 2007&ndash;2012 Programme, Enterprise Ireland committed &euro;175 million to continue to develop the seed and venture capital market in Ireland. Up to December 2015, fourteen new funds were launched with an Enterprise Ireland commitment of &euro;174 million. It further noted that in 2015, venture capital funds in receipt of commitments under the Enterprise Ireland Seed and Venture Capital Schemes made 144 investments in Irish based companies, with a total investment value of &euro;54 million.</p><p>The report will be available on the Enterprise Ireland Website on publication.</p></reply>

Innovation Fund Ireland funding involved Enterprise Ireland and NPRF investing together and separately. The NPRF has now been reconstituted as the Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF). The dual mandate of the ISIF &ndash; investment return and Irish economic impact &ndash; represents a new &ldquo;double bottom line&rdquo; approach to investing and will require all transactions to generate both risk adjusted commercial returns and economic impact in Ireland.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland and ISIF have committed up to &euro;125m each to make commitments to international Venture Fund Managers.  These funds commit to establishing a presence in the Irish market and agree to invest, at a minimum, the equivalent of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s contribution, over the lifetime of the fund in Irish companies or companies with significant operations in Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland issued two open competitive calls for proposals. To receive an investment through Innovation Fund Ireland, venture capital fund managers must meet, at a minimum, the following criteria to be considered for investment:</p><p>-  An established global profile and network with a reputation for market leadership in venture capital investment.</p><p>-  A proven track record of raising funds and generating superior returns for investors.</p><p>-  A capacity to access high potential international investment opportunities with an investment team capable of attracting world-class entrepreneurs.</p><p>-  An intention to establish a new and substantial presence in the venture capital market in Ireland and a willingness to invest a meaningful proportion of their venture capital fund in Irish companies or companies with significant Irish operations.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland alongside the ISIF/NPRF has made commitments to four Venture Capital funds including Sofinnova, Highland Venture Capital Europe and Lightstone Ventures. Two of these funds have ceased investing in new opportunities (having met their commitments to invest in Ireland) while the remaining two funds are activity looking for opportunities.</p><p>Separately the NPRF/ISIF made a number of commitments to other funds including Polaris and DFJ Esprit. The ISIF report to the Department of Finance and not my Department. Separately, the ISIF issued their economic impact report. </p><p>Table 1 below outlines the levels of investment in Irish companies to the end of 2015. <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>No of investments (IRL)</th><th>Amount</th><th>No. Companies</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>2</td><td>&euro;7,447,620</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>3</td><td>&euro;32,169,146</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>12</td><td>&euro;13,637,101</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>17</td><td>&euro;53,253,866</td><td>8</td></tr></table></p><p>Table 2 below outlines the economic profile of the companies in recent of investment as of the year end 2015. <table><tr><th>Type</th><th>Direct IRL Employment (FTE)</th><th>Turnover</th><th>Exports</th></tr><tr><td>IFI</td><td>139</td><td>&euro;43.3m</td><td>&euro;39.2m</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>139</td><td>&euro;43.3m</td><td>&euro;39.2m</td></tr></table></p><p>Economic Impact Data 2015- IFI</p></reply>

The report stated that, overall, HIQA found standards across all three areas of residential, foster care and child protection to be good.  There was good social work practice with children and families in foster care and the child welfare and protection services.  HIQA identified that Tusla required more social workers and needed to increase standardisation of services around the country to ensure that all children received an equitable provision of care. The report also noted the need for continuing development of national policies and ICT projects. </p>  <p>  HIQA identified a shortage of social workers across many inspections. The level of funding provided to Tusla for 2016 has significantly strengthened Tusla&rsquo;s capacity to recruit more social workers and to deliver a high level of care for children. The Government has provided Tusla with funding of over &euro;676 million in 2016 - this is an increase of &euro;38 million on the provision for 2015 and this increase was widely acknowledged as representing a significant strengthening of Tusla&rsquo;s base funding level. The additional resources provided gives the Agency greater capacity to respond to identified risk and to address areas of unmet need.</p>  <p>  It is a positive sign that HIQA inspectors found that staff responded to the needs of children and focussed on their rights and welfare.  Children were encouraged to take part in decisions on their care, had access to advocates and were helped to keep positive attachments with their families.  Children told inspectors that their lives had improved through contact with child protection social workers.</p>  <p>  Tusla will continue its recruitment campaign to recruit the social work and social care staff to support families and to protect vulnerable children. The majority of HIQA findings relate to standards that are deemed to require improvement. Tusla reports to my Department on the action plans that they have put in place following each of the inspections to deal with problems and areas needing quality improvement. </p>  <p>  Tusla is engaged in a programme of service reform to ensure that a consistent quality of care is available to children and families across the country. I am confident that this process and the major recruitment campaign currently underway, will see a significant improvement in all child welfare and protection services.</p></reply>

Cyberbullying is just one aspect of bullying, but one which, given the rapid expansion of access to technology by young people, has come much more sharply into focus.  The report highlights the need for parents and young people to understand how to use modern technologies safely and to know how to protect themselves in school, at home and in their communities.  There is a range of services, supported by various Departments and their agencies which can assist children and young people in coping with bullying situations.</p>  <p>  - The parents' role is key in supporting their children who may be victims of bullying - www.webwise.ie &ndash; an initiative of the Department of Education and Skills &ndash; provides information and advice for parents and teachers about risks and how to protect children against cyber bullying.</p>  <p>  - At community level, many of the voluntary youth services funded by my Department provide education programmes, run awareness campaigns about bullying and provide programmes for young people to give them the knowledge and skills to build supportive links and counter bullying behaviours.  Specifically, my Department supports the National Youth Health Programme which is in partnership with the HSE and the National Youth Council of Ireland.  The programme's aims are to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion / education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings, and includes programmes aimed at exploring bullying and cyberbullying with young people.</p>  <p>  - Schools are also strengthening collaboration and interaction with youth services and promote the active participation by pupils in youth focused services within their local communities.</p>  <p>  Bullying in the workplace is a matter for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The Health and Safety Authority provides guidance to employers regarding the requirement for a written Anti Bullying Policy.  The HSA guidance states that the policy should be drawn up in accordance with the Health and Safety Authority's Code of Practice on the Prevention and Resolution of Bullying at Work, the Labour Relations Commission's Code of Practice Detailing Procedures for Addressing Bullying in the Workplace and the Equality Authority's Codes of Practice on Prevention of Workplace Bullying and Harassment, where harassment under the nine grounds identified in the document is the issue.  The guidance states that bullying should also be referred to in the safety statement as a hazard and should state the management ethos and ensure that there is a clear procedure for managing complaints and ensuring that all staff, whether permanent or temporary, should have access to a copy.  Organisations should raise awareness of the issue by inclusion in staff bulletins, training, at recruitment stage and using any other appropriate method.</p>  <p>  With regard to cyber bulling, the Office for Internet Safety, under the Department of Justice and Equality, takes a lead responsibility for internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children.  As part of its work it holds an annual Safer Internet Day, which has included a rollout of a social marketing campaign specifically targeted at young people.  In 2013, the then Minister of Communications established an Internet Content Governance Advisory Group to ensure our national policy represents best practice in offering the same online protections to our citizens as those available in the offline world.  The Group&rsquo;s report published in May 2014 made several recommendations aimed at protecting children and young people without unduly limiting their opportunities and rights online.  I hope to advance these issues in conjunction with my colleagues the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Communications as part of the Programme for Government's specific commitment in relation to ensuring that robust protections are in place to fully protect children while on line.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2016, funding of &euro;51m has been provided to my Department for these schemes.  In addition &euro;2.6m in capital funding, also provided in Budget 2016, will be used to support small scale projects, including refurbishment, health and safety fit-outs and accessibility improvements in local youth services.</p>  <p>  In 2016, an amount of &euro;500,405 has been allocated for the projects and services under Kildare Youth Services, which operates under Youth Work Ireland.  This is an increase of more than &euro;12,000 on the 2015 allocation.  My Department provides funding to Kildare Youth Services under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme in respect of six local youth projects in Athy, Naas, Leixlip, Newbridge, the Curragh and Kildare town and a Youth Information Centre in Naas.</p>  <p>  I, and officials of my Department, have met, and continue to meet, regularly with many voluntary organisations and groups providing services to children and young people to see how we can work together to bring about the best possible outcomes for young people, having regard to resources available to us and to ensure that the programmes and services being provided are relevant and responsive to young people&rsquo;s needs.  Ongoing engagement and dialogue with the youth sector organisations and with young people themselves are priorities in the development of the policies and services to support young people&rsquo;s development and learning.</p>  <p>  At local level, Youth Officers of the Education and Training Boards have an important support role on behalf of my Department, to local youth services.  My Department works closely with them to address issues that arise for local services.  Officials of my Department met Kildare Youth Services and have visited their Kildare Youth Service to hear about their work and their proposals, for the provision of services in County Kildare.  Further investment in the provision of youth services will be considered in the context of the annual Estimates and Budgetary processes and the implementation of the National Youth Strategy 2015-2020.</p></reply>

Dublin, continue to deliver services focused on education and rehabilitation of all young people detained in order to address offending behaviour and to support their early re-integration into the community.  The development project recently completed in Oberstown includes a new purpose-built education, training and recreation unit.  This will ensure sufficient age and ability appropriate facilities to support the delivery, by Dublin and Dun Laoghaire Education and Training Board, of the necessary education and training services to young people in detention.</p>  <p>  The child care model of detention delivered in Oberstown provides for a range of rehabilitative supports for each child as part of an overall programme, with a strong ethos of school attendance, education and training and an emphasis on rehabilitation.  An individual management plan is put in place for each child which includes an assessment to determine the need for more specialist intervention from the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS).  This is a national service that provides clinical services to children in detention and in special care, as well as short term interventions when the child returns to the community.  There are also a number of other therapeutic and education programmes delivered on the Oberstown campus which are aimed at addressing offending behaviour patterns by children.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that earlier community based interventions to divert young people from offending behaviour, such as the Garda Youth Diversions Projects and the Garda Diversion Programme are also in place in the community and come under the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I also wish to note that my Department has recently awarded a contract for a Bail Supervision Scheme for young people.  The scheme is due to commence later this year in the Dublin area, and is intended to provide an option for a court to remand a child on bail but subject to intensive therapeutic supports in the community.</p></reply>

I understand that the purpose of Wardship is to look after the welfare and to protect the property of a person where this is considered necessary.  There are two types of Wardship: one covers adults who may require the Court's protection because of mental incapacity and the second concerns children, i.e. persons under 18 years of age, who require protection for particular reasons.

The study monitors the development of almost 20,000 children.  It examines the factors that contribute to or undermine the well-being of children in contemporary Irish families, and through this, contributes to the setting of effective and responsive policies relating to children and to the design of services for children and families.  Information on causes of concern and stress amongst young persons is collected through a number of questions and validated scales on several aspects of the child&rsquo;s socio-emotional development including behaviour, social skills and interactions with parents.</p><p>My Department has also commissioned a number of research reports which focus on the issues of mental health, feelings, mood, and socio-emotional behaviours and outcomes.  Stressful events for 5 year olds include the death of a family member, moving house, serious illness of a family member and conflict between parents.  The lives of 13 year olds are affected by less positive self-concepts in the areas of 'physical appearance', 'popularity' and 'intellectual/school'.  It is also known that persistent economic vulnerability has negative consequences for the socio-emotional development of children.</p><p>My Department provided funding for a May 2015 report by young people entitled &ldquo;Picture Your Rights &ndash; A Report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child from Children Living in Ireland&rdquo;.  Among other areas, the report focused on the topic of &lsquo;Mind and Body &ndash; Learning to take care of ourselves.&rsquo;  Within this area the spotlight issues of bullying, mental health, and stress were identified.  In that regard the report noted that mental health and physical safety are the two main issues that young people are concerned about in Ireland.  The report identified bullying as the number one issue that worries young people, followed closely by stress and the pressure of school and home life.  Concerns were also expressed about body image and physical health.</p><p>Regarding the wellbeing of children and young people in general, I refer the Deputy to the extensive policy frameworks '<i>Better Outcomes Brighter Futures: </i>the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People (2014-2020)', and 'Healthy Ireland: A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing (2013-2025)'.  Issues of concern and stress impact on the areas of responsibility of a number of Government departments.  There are various strategies and initiatives that are relevant to tackling challenges of the kind identified by young people.  Examples include the Action Plan on Bullying launched by the Minister for Education and Skills; the Prevention, Partnership and Family Support Programme (2015-2018) undertaken by Tusla; Ireland&rsquo;s first National Sexual Health Strategy (2015-2020), launched by the Minister for Health; &lsquo;Connecting for Life&rsquo;, the new national strategy to reduce suicide (2015-2020); Ireland&rsquo;s first National Physical Activity Plan, launched in January 2016; and a new Obesity Policy and Action Plan, under development by the Department of Health.</p><p><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures </i>recognises the importance of good mental health to children and young people, as reflected in the national outcome that children are active and healthy with physical and mental wellbeing.  The framework contains a number of commitments in the area of mental health for progression in 2016.</p><p>In relation to children in detention, the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) is committed to a research programme on youth crime under the Youth Justice Action Plan 2014-2018.  The IYJS and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, have together developed a national clinical service for children in special care and detention, known as the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS), which also engages in short term interventions, when children return to their communities, to support them to re-engage with mainstream services as appropriate.</p><p>Finally, given that exam time can be a very stressful time for children, I want to acknowledge the important role played by parents and teachers in guiding children through this and other challenging periods in their lives.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-09a.700.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900067#WRX01800"><p>A supervision order, granted by the District Court under section 19 of the Child Care Act 1991, as amended, gives Tusla the authority to visit and monitor the health and welfare of the child.  It also allows the Court to give directions as to the care of the child to the parent/s or guardian(s) at the time of the making of the order or at any other time while the order is in place.  Under the Act, it is limited to a period of 12 months or less, but may be renewed.  A supervision order is sought where Tusla believes that, while further action is required, it is not necessary to apply to the Court for a care order.</p><p>I have asked Tusla for information on the number of applications made.  I will revert to the Deputy when the reply has been received.  Tusla has informed me that during 2014, there were 435 children subject to a new supervision order, and on the 31st December 2014 there were 413 children who were subject to a supervision order.  The following table has broken down these two figures by Tusla administrative region and area level for your information:<table><tr><th>Area</th><th>Total no. of children subject to a NEW Supervision Order in 2014</th><th>Total no. of children subject to a Supervision Order on 31/12/2014</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin South Central</td><td>3</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South East Wicklow</td><td>14</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South West Kildare West Wicklow</td><td>6</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>The Midlands</td><td>9</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN MID LEINSTER</td><td>32</td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City North</td><td>21</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North</td><td>4</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Louth Meath</td><td>19</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan Monaghan</td><td>4</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN NORTH EAST</td><td>48</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>127</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>9</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow Kilkenny South Tipperary</td><td>35</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford Wexford</td><td>65</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>SOUTH</td><td>236</td><td>167</td></tr><tr><td>The Midwest</td><td>51</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>Galway Roscommon</td><td>34</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>12</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>8</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo Leitrim West Cavan</td><td>14</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>WEST</td><td>119</td><td>106</td></tr><tr><td>NATIONAL</td><td>435</td><td>413</td></tr></table></p></reply>
