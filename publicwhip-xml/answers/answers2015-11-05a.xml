My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.</p>  <p>  Locally adopted Traveller Accommodation Programmes provide a road map for local authority investment priorities over their 5-year lifespan and also form the basis for the allocation of funding from my Department. Funding for traveller accommodation is provided on foot of proposals received from local authorities and subject to approval by my Department.</p>  <p>  Capital allocations for 2015 in respect of traveller specific accommodation issued to local authorities in May this year. Galway City and County Councils had no schemes under construction or approved to commence construction in 2015, and had no final balances due. Consequently, they did not receive an allocation when allocations were finalised in May.</p>  <p>  Subsequent to the submission and examination of local authority proposals as part of the 2015 allocation process, Galway City Council submitted a post tender report and documentation to my Department proposing the demolition, rebuilding and refurbishment of two houses at Ballinfoyle Park, Galway, following extensive fire damage to the houses. The proposal was approved by my Department in July and payments totalling &euro;62,150 ha ve been made to Galway City Council to date.</p></reply>

The two Galway councils have a combined target of 1,126 units, supported by an allocation of &euro;58.5m, to be invested in a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes designed to accommodate over 25% of those currently on the housing waiting list in the area.</p>  <p>  In line with the targets, I made major new social housing delivery announcements in May and July this year, covering all 31 local authorities, with over &euro;490m investment for the construction and acquisition of over 2,900 housing units. This included over 150 units, supported by investment of &euro;25 million in respect of the Galway councils.</p>  <p>  Given the time-lag between approval and delivery for construction projects, the acquisition by local authorities of properties through turn-key developments and other purchases, and the remediation of vacant units, are important parts of social housing delivery this year.  The Galway local authorities inform me they aim to deliver around 70 new acquisitions this year, while around 90 vacant houses are being brought back to productive use. This is alongside the advancement of the approved construction projects and the use of current-funded mechanisms such as leasing and the Rental Accommodation Scheme.</p>  <p>  My Department does not hold details on individual properties being made available for occupation as this is a matter for the individual local authorities. However, I am confident that by utilising all delivery mechanisms under current and capital expenditure programmes, in line with the targets set and funding available, the Galway local authorities will continue to make significant progress on social housing in line with the Social Housing Strategy.   </p></reply>

The latest figures for new house completions show that 8,914 units were completed to the end of September 2015, up 14% on the corresponding figure for 2014. As announced in Budget 2016, NAMA is aiming to deliver a target of 20,000 residential units before the end of 2020, with 90% of these units to be in the greater Dublin area.</p><p>Social housing has been prioritised by this Government and over &euro;1.7 billion in Exchequer and local authority self-funding was allocated to the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>between the 2015 and 2016 budgets, to support the provision of over 33,000 units. The Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan goes beyond 2016 and commits &euro;2.9 billion in capital funding towards social housing out to 2021.</p><p>A range of measures is being taken to address homelessness by securing a supply of accommodation to house homeless households and mobilise the necessary supports in order to deliver on the Government's target of ending involuntary long-term homelessness. In particular, I would highlight that t he homelessness budget for 2016 will be &euro;70 million, an increase of 32% on the 2015 allocation of &euro;53 million.</p><p>In addition to these measures, I am continuing to work on proposals to address the issue of rising rents. The level of increases in rent, particularly in the greater Dublin area, presents a serious challenge. The regulation of rent,however, raises many complex economic and legal issues and I have to be satisfied that any measures proposed are balanced and have the desired effect on the rental market while being fair to landlords and tenants alike. Ultimately, any decision in relation to this issue is a matter for Government and it is my intention to bring final proposals to Government for decision as soon as possible. </p></reply>

These are being delivered through building, buying and leasing schemes by the local authorities, with an indicative funding provision of &euro;507m. A Dublin Social Housing Delivery Taskforce has also been established to drive the implementation of the Social Housing Strategy in the Dublin region. </p><p>In May and July, I announced major social housing construction programmes valued at almost half a billion euros, covering all 31 local authorities, with 910 units for the Dublin local authorities and &euro;178.6 million allocated. Given the time-lag between approval and delivery in terms of construction projects, a successful programme to remediate vacant units, as well as the acquisition by the local authorities of properties through turn-key developments and other purchases, are important components of the social housing delivery programme this year. I am confident that by utilising all delivery mechanisms, the Dublin local authorities will continue to deliver on their social housing targets in line with the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>.</p><p>The Government has also approved the delivery of 500 units of modular housing for homeless families across Dublin.  The first 150 units are to be delivered as quickly as possible in the Dublin City Council administrative area, with the City Council acting as the contracting authority and aiming to deliver an initial fast-tracked 22 units by December, with the remaining 128 to follow by late Q1 2016.A further 350 units will then be provided across the four Dublin local authorities through a national procurement framework overseen by the Office for Government Procurement, with expected construction on sites by mid-2016.</p><p>My Department will continue to work with the Dublin local Authorities individually and through the Dublin Social Housing Delivery Task Force to accelerate the delivery of social housing in the region.</p></reply>

My Department received submissions from 7,500 organisations and members of the public during this public consultation process.</p><p>It is intended that the revisions to the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines will be finalised as soon as possible. In this regard, account has to be taken of the extensive response to the public consultation in framing the final guidelines. Further work is also advancing to develop technical appendices to assist planning authorities with the practical application of the noise measurement aspects of the WindGuidelines. My Department is advancing work on the finalisation of the Guidelines in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p><p>The revisions to the Wind Energy Development Guidelines 2006, when finalised, will be issued under Section 28 of the <i>Planning and Development Act 2000</i>, as amended.

While electoral law is subject to ongoing review, I have no proposals at present to amend the existing arrangements for voting.</p>  <p>  As regards deadlines for postal vote registration, workers whose occupation is such that it takes them away from their residence on a regular basis - for example those in the fishing industry - and who, consequently, are unlikely to be able to vote in person on polling day may apply to their local authority for inclusion in the postal voters list. The deadline for applying for inclusion as a postal voter in the register of electors to come into force on 15 February next year is 25 November 2015. If this deadline is missed, a person can apply to get on the supplement to the postal voters list for that register by completing the relevant application form and submitting it to their registration authority.</p>  <p>  As regards deadlines for casting a postal ballot, postal voting papers are issued as soon as possible following the close of nominations in order to maximise the time available for voters to return their marked ballot papers to the Returning Officer so as to arrive by post before the close of poll on polling day.   </p></reply>

There are now over 4,500 households in receipt of HAP. Kildare and Meath County Councils commenced HAP on 2 November 2015, and Galway, Mayo and Sligo County Councils will commence the scheme from 16 November 2015. While securing accommodation under HAP can be challenging in areas where there is a shortage of supply, the numbers of households securing accommodation nationally under HAP continues to rise.</p><p>Regulations prescribe the maximum rent limits that apply in each local authority area where HAP has commenced. The limits are generally based on the rent supplement limits set out by the Department of Social Protection. In prescribing these limits, household size and prevailing rents in the relevant areas are also taken into consideration. My Department works closely with the Department of Social Protection and monitors data which it gathers, along with PRTB data, and data gathered through HAP pilot authorities, in relation to the rent limits applying.</p><p>I have recently signed the <i>Housing Assistance Payment (Section 50)(No.3) Regulations 2015</i>introducing HAP in the administrative area of Kildare County Council from 2 November 2015. In recognition of the need for greater flexibility in the challenging Dublin region rental market, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I have also signed the <i>Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment)(No.4) Regulations 2015</i>, which provide for the introduction of HAP in Kildare with maximum rent limits equivalent to current Rent Supplement rates applicable in the neighbouring Dublin area. In recognition of the need for additional discretion in areas of high rental demand, and similar to the approach already taken with regard to South Dublin County Council, the Regulations also provide Kildare County Council with an additional 20% flexibility above the maximum HAP rent limits that apply there.

It is intended to have the first 150 units delivered as quickly as possible in the Dublin City Council administrative area, with the City Council acting as the contracting authority. The Council is aiming to secure the delivery of an initial fast-tracked 22 of these units by mid December, with the remaining 128 units to follow by late Q1 2016. A further 350 units will then be provided across the four local authorities in the Dublin region through a national procurement framework overseen by the Office for Government Procurement, with expected construction on sites by mid-2016.</p>  <p>  This programme of modular housing provision is being implemented to mitigate the issues associated with an increasing volume of homeless families accommodated in inappropriate commercial hotel arrangements. The   units will provide emergency accommodation in the first instance, offering a greater level of stability while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured. Furthermore, such arrangements will facilitate more coordinated needs assessment and support planning for access to all required services, including welfare, health and housing services. Any legal issues which may arise in the procurement of the units will be a matter for the relevant contracting authorities concerned. </p></reply>

In this regard, I believe that the parties responsible for poor workmanship and/or the supply of defective materials should face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate actions to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.</p>  <p>  In the event that the contracting parties cannot reach a settlement by negotiation, the option of seeking redress in the Courts can be considered.  In this context, my Department understands that legal proceedings have been instigated in a number of cases relating to this problem.</p>  <p>  My Department has prepared a technical report for my information in this matter. This report was prepared following my visit, earlier this year, to a number of the affected homes to view first-hand the damage caused and had regard to test reports made available to my Department by a number of homeowners in order to provide a more detailed and scientific insight into the problems that have emerged.  In this regard, the technical report is under consideration and I intend to complete my deliberations in this matter shortly.</p>  <p>  Taxation policy, including issues relevant to the local property tax (LPT), is primarily a matter for the Minister for Finance. The legislation governing the administration of the LPT provides for only a limited number of exemptions from that tax. There is no specific exemption for properties affected by mica and I understand that there are no plans to introduce such an exemption. LPT operates on a self-assessment basis; it is a matter for the property owner, in the first instance, to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property. When making an assessment on the value of a property, issues such as the presence of mica should be taken into account by the property owner.</p></reply>

There are now over 4,500 households in receipt of HAP and the scheme has been rolled out to all categories of households in 15 local authority areas. Kildare and Meath County Councils commenced HAP on 2 November 2015 and Galway, Mayo and Sligo County Councils will commence the scheme from 16 November 2015. While securing accommodation under HAP can be challenging in areas where there is a shortage of supply, the numbers of households securing accommodation nationally under HAP continues to rise.</p><p>The maximum rent limits for different household classes that apply in each local authority where HAP has been commenced are set out in regulations and are generally based on the Rent Supplement limits as set out by the Department of Social Protection (DSP). In prescribing these limits, household size and prevailing rents in the relevant areas are taken into consideration. My Department works closely with the Department of Social Protection and monitors data which it gathers, along with PRTB data, and data gathered through HAP pilot authorities, in relation to the rent limits applying.</p><p>In recognition of the need for greater flexibility in the challenging Dublin region rental market, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I recently signed the Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment)(No.4) Regulations 2015, which provide for the introduction of HAP in Kildare and Meath County Councils with maximum rent limits equivalent to current Rent Supplement rates applicable in the neighboring Dublin areas. In recognition of the need for additional discretion in areas of high rental demand, and similar to the approach followed in South Dublin County Council, these regulations also provide for an additional 20% flexibility above the maximum HAP rent limits that applyin the administrative areas of Cork City Council, Cork County Council, Galway County Council, Kildare County Council and Meath County Council. This increased flexibility will assist a greater number of qualified households secure suitable accommodation under the scheme.</p><p>This approach mirrors the approach already taken by the Department of Social Protection in the operation of the discretion available in the context of the Rent Supplement scheme. My Department is preparing guidance for the relevant local authorities in the appropriate use of this increased flexibility. This matter will be kept under active review in all HAP pilot authority areas.</p><p>The Dublin Region Homelessness Executive (DRHE) is also managing a HAP Homeless Pilot for the four Dublin local authorities. The HAP Homeless Pilot became operational on 18 February 2015 and some 60 households have been housed through the pilot scheme to date.Following a review of the effectiveness of the HAP Homeless Pilot, I recently signed regulations that provide that the HAP rent limits applicable in the 4 Dublin local authority areas have the flexibility to exceed existing rent supplement rent limits by up to 50%, where this is necessary to source suitable accommodation for a homeless household that is qualified for social housing support.</p><p>The phased roll out of the HAP pilot scheme has proved to be an effective approach. In this context, My Department maintains regular contact with the pilot local authorities in order to learn from their experience of the scheme, and to address operational issues as they arise. This engagement is proving invaluable as the roll out of the scheme progresses.</p><p>Budget 2016 has increased the funding for the HAP scheme to &euro;47.7 million in 2016, in order to meet the continuing costs of existing HAP households, and the costs of an additional 10,000 households to be supported by HAP in 2016. I am pleased with the operation of the HAP scheme but will continue to keep its operation under review.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.</p>  <p>  Following the recent tragic loss of life in Carrickmines, my Department&rsquo;s National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management is leading a Programme to Review Fire Safety in Traveller Accommodation. The objective of the review is to take immediate action to ensure that practical and appropriate fire safety measures, which can contribute to preventing loss of life and serious injury in local authority Traveller accommodation, have been applied systematically across the country. This will include community fire safety initiatives. Initial steps have been taken to identify the key issues and consultations with stakeholders at both national and local level, including Traveller Representative Groups, have taken place. </p>  <p>  Practical solutions to the issues that are identified through this engagement will be developed on a collaborative basis over the coming weeks. This collaborative approach will ensure that the review is carried out in a consistent and coordinated manner. The programme to review and enhance fire safety in Traveller accommodation will be rolled out nationally over the coming months and is anticipated to be concluded by the end of Quarter 1,2016. As well as the enhancements that I hope will already be in place at that stage, it will identify or propose further actions to sustain fire safety which will be given appropriate consideration by relevant stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  As provided for under sections 21 and 22 of the aforementioned Act, each local authority has in place a Local Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee (LTACC). The role of the LTACC is to advise local authorities on the provision and management of accommodation for Travellers, and to provide a liaison between Travellers and Members and officials of the appointing authority concerned. At least one quarter of the membership of the LTACC must comprise local Travellers and Traveller groups, with the remaining members comprising elected members and officials of the housing authority. I see the role of these local committees as crucial to resolving local issues, including health and safety issues on sites. </p></reply>

Proposed statutory authority for the plans is set out in the <i>Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015</i>.</p><p>In anticipation of enactment of the planned legislation, work is already underway on developing a low carbon plan, the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and to identify additional measures within the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050. The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020, but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that. In this context, key sectors in the low carbon transition process (electricity, transport, built environment and agriculture) are currently developing sectoral mitigation measures in tandem with Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Appropriate Assessment (AA) processes during which measures will be further developed and prioritised.</p><p>For each year between 2013 and 2020, Ireland has a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction target under the 2009 Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) No. 406/2009/EC. For the year 2020 itself  , the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20 per cent below their value in 2005. This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg. The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020.</p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published in May 2015 new annual emission limits and projected emissions for 2020 which indicate that Ireland&rsquo;s emissions in 2020 could be in the range of 9-14% below 2005 levels. However, even in the worst case scenario (i.e., a 9% reduction), Ireland could be very close to meeting its cumulative compliance obligations for the period 2013-2020 (ESD 2009), which on average require a 12% reduction relative to 2005, given over-compliance in the early years of the 8-year period.</p><p>With regard to energy security considerations, the overarching objective of the Government&rsquo;s energy policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers. The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport power from renewable sources. Provisional figures provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland for 2014 show that 8.6% of Ireland's overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy. </p><p>Electricity generated from renewable sources is playing an increasingly important role as part of our energy mix. In 2014, 22.7% of gross electricity generation was from renewables including hydro, wind, biomass, landfill gas and biogas. While the progress to date is encouraging, significant challenges remain, particularly in the heat and transport sectors. </p><p>The REFIT schemes underpin the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies, including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind. These schemes will be closed to new applications at the end of this year. In terms of renewable heat, in addition to existing measures such as Part L of the Building Regulations, the 2014 Draft Bioenergy Plan recommended the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources. </p><p>On 31 July last, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources launched two separate consultations on new support schemes, one for renewable electricity and one for a proposed Renewable Heat Incentive. While the initial phase of both consultations closed on 18 September 2015, there will be two further opportunities to contribute at key stages in the design of any new scheme. Those consultations will be informative regarding the technologies that will assist in meeting our future renewable energy targets. Subject to Government approval and State Aid clearance from the European Commission, the new schemes would become available in 2016. </p><p>As regards renewable transport, Ireland aims to meet its target mainly through the use of sustainable biofuels. Increasing usage of electric vehicles will also make a contribution. Further increases to the obligation rate in the Biofuels Obligation Scheme will be required in the context of achieving our 2020 target. A public consultation, initiated by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, concluded on 30 October.</p><p>From a planning perspective, proposals for the location of individual wind farms are a matter for the relevant developer, taking account of several criteria, including connectivity to the national grid. When considering individual planning applications for such developments and the appropriateness of their location, planning authorities, including An Bord Plean&aacute;la where relevant, are required to have regard to local area and county development plans, local authority renewable energy strategies, the 2006 <i>Wind Energy Development Guidelines</i>issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and other relevant matters, including existing residential development, existing wind energy developments, the local landscape and the natural and built heritage. </p></reply>

There are now over 4,500 households in receipt of HAP and the scheme has been rolled out to all categories of household in 15 local authority areas. Kildare and Meath County Councils commenced HAP on 2 November 2015 and Galway, Mayo and Sligo County Councils will commence the scheme from 16 November 2015. While securing accommodation under HAP can be challenging in areas where there is a shortage of supply, the numbers of households securing accommodation nationally under HAP continues to rise.  The maximum rent limits for different household classes that apply in each local authority where HAP has been commenced are set out in regulations and are generally based on the Rent Supplement limits as set out by the Department of Social Protection (DSP). In prescribing these limits, household size and prevailing rents in the relevant areas are taken into consideration. My Department works closely with the Department of Social Protection and monitors data which it gathers, along with PRTB data, and data gathered through HAP pilot authorities, in relation to the rent limits applying.</p><p>In recognition of the need for greater flexibility in the challenging Dublin region rental market, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I have signed the Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment)(No.4) Regulations 2015, which provide for the introduction of HAP in Kildare and Meath County Councils with maximum rent limits equivalent to current Rent Supplement rates applicable in the neighboring Dublin areas . In recognition of the need for additional discretion in areas of high rental demand, and similar to the flexibility I have provided for the operation of HAP in South Dublin County Council, these regulations also provide for an additional 20% flexibility above the maximum rent limits that apply for the purposes of HAP in the administrative areas of Cork City Council, Cork County Council, Galway County Council, Kildare County Council and Meath County Council, where this is necessary to source suitable accommodation for a household that is qualified for social housing support.</p><p>This approach mirrors the approach already taken by the Department of Social Protection in the operation of the discretion available in the context of the Rent Supplement scheme. My Department is preparing guidancefor the relevant local authorities in the appropriate use of this increased flexibility. I will continue to keep HAP rent limits under review.</p><p>The Dublin Region Homelessness Executive (DRHE) is also managing a HAP Homeless Pilot for the four Dublin local authorities. The HAP Homeless Pilot became operational on 18 February 2015 and some 60 households have been housed through the pilot scheme to date.Following a review of the effectiveness of the HAP Homeless Pilot, I recently signed regulations that provide that the HAP rent limits applicable in the 4 Dublin local authority areas have the flexibility toexceed existing rent supplement rent limits by up to 50%, where this is necessary to source suitable accommodation for a homeless household that is qualified for social housing support. </p><p>These matters will be kept under active review in all HAP pilot authority areas.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.</p>  <p>  Following the recent tragic loss of life in Carrickmines, my Department&rsquo;s National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management is leading a Programme to Review Fire Safety in Traveller Accommodation. The objective of the review is to take immediate action to ensure that practical and appropriate fire safety measures, which can contribute to preventing loss of life and serious injury in local authority Traveller accommodation, have been applied systematically across the country. This will include community fire safety initiatives. Initial steps have been taken to identify the key issues and consultations with stakeholders at both national and local level, including Traveller Representative Groups, have taken place. </p>  <p>  Practical solutions to the issues that are identified through this engagement will be developed on a collaborative basis over the coming weeks. This collaborative approach will ensure that the review is carried out in a consistent and coordinated manner.  The programme to review and enhance fire safety in Traveller accommodation will be rolled out nationally over the coming months and is anticipated to be concluded by the end of Quarter 1,2016. As well as the enhancements that I hope will already be in place at that stage, it will identify or propose further actions to sustain fire safety which will be given appropriate consideration by relevant stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  As provided for under sections 21 and 22 of the aforementioned Act, each local authority has in place a Local Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee (LTACC). The role of the LTACC is to advise local authorities on the provision and management of accommodation for Travellers, and to provide a liaison between Travellers and Members and officials of the appointing authority concerned. At least one quarter of the membership of the LTACC must comprise local Travellers and Traveller groups, with the remaining members comprising elected members and officials of the housing authority. I see the role of these local committees as crucial to resolving local issues, including health and safety issues on sites. </p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan goes beyond 2016 and commits &euro;2.9 billion in capital funding towards social housing out to 2021.</p><p>Ultimately, the key to addressing upward pressure on rents is through increasing the supply of housing, which is a core focus of the Government&rsquo;s <i>Construction 2020</i>strategy. In 2014 the number of house completions was 11,016 units nationally, an increase of 33% on the 2013 figure. The latest figures for new house completions show that 8,914 units were completed to the end of September 2015, up 14% on the corresponding figure for 2014.  NAMA is aiming to deliver a target of 20,000 residential units before the end of 2020, with 90%of these units to be in the greater Dublin area.</p><p>In addition to these measures, I am continuing to work on proposals to address the issue of rising rents. The level of rent increases, particularly in the greater Dublin area, presents a serious challenge. The regulation of rent,however, raises many complex economic and legal issues and I have to be satisfied that any measures proposed are balanced and have the desired effect on the rental market while being fair to landlords and tenants alike. Ultimately, any decision in relation to this issue is a matter for Government and it is my intention to bring final proposals to Government for decision as soon as possible. </p></reply>

Moreover, the <i>National Waste Report 2012</i>, which sets out the latest annual data and which is available on the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s website, , indicates that 40% of municipal waste was recycled in 2012: this compares with a 20.7% recycling rate ten years previously in 2002. The report further highlights the fact that municipal solid waste (MSW) generation has decreased in the period 2006 to 2012, while the recovery of MSW generated has increased over the same period.</p><p>Government waste policy is predicated on the waste hierarchy as set out in the Waste Framework Directive and seeks to minimise the generation of waste. A number of specific measures have been, and will continue to be, introduced to reduce the volume of waste generated in the State in line with Government policy. Recent examples include the further roll-out of food waste collection services, and the introduction of three Regional Waste Management Plans in May 2015 which have a clear focus on waste prevention and resource efficiency. The introduction of pay by weight as a collection permit condition as of 1 July 2015 and the forthcoming introduction of mandatory pay by weight charging for household waste in July 2016 and for commercial waste later in 2016 will be a game changer, providing clear pricing incentives to households and businesses to prevent and segregate their waste to the greatest possible extent.</p><p><i>Towards a Resource Efficient Ireland</i><i>- A National Strategy to 2020</i><i>,</i>available at , incorporates Ireland&rsquo;s National Waste Prevention Programme and sets out priorities for preventing waste generation and the unnecessary consumption of materials, energy and water.  The title of this document reflects the shift in emphasis at national and EU level towards resource efficiency, as opposed to focussing purely on waste prevention. In this regard, I intend to publish a consultation paper shortly on how the State can best maximise the value we extract from the waste we cannot prevent, especially in terms of maximising the job creation and energy potential of waste,while minimising our impact on the environment.</p><p>The above measures are among the many actions being undertaken to ensure that Ireland will be well positioned to meet the requirements of the new European Commission proposal on the Circular Economy, which is expected to be published in December 2015.</p></reply>

An additional 440 properties are to be further appraised. I expect that this process, once complete, will deliver in excess of 2,000 units for social housing purposes in total. </p></reply>

In November 2014, I launched the Government&rsquo;s Social Housing Strategy 2020.  This six-year strategy sets out to provide 35,000 new social housing units at a cost of &euro;3.8 billion and restores the State to a central role in the provision of social housing through, inter alia, a resumption of direct building on a significant scale by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies.</p><p>A significant number of other measures are being taken to address homelessness by securing a supply of accommodation to house homeless households and mobilise the necessary supports in order to deliver on the Government's target of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.  These measures have been identified in the Government's Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness (May 2014) and in the <i>Action Plan to Address Homelessness</i>(December 2014).  Substantial progress has been made in implementing these plans. Progress in implementing these plans is reported through the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.  The plans and progress reports are available on my Department's website at the following link:.  </p><p>These Plans represent a whole-of-Government approach to dealing with homelessness and the implementation of measures identified in these plans is being overseen by a group of senior officials drawn from key State agencies concerned including my Department, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Health Service Executive, Tusla the Child and Family Agency, the Irish Prison Service and housing authorities.</p><p>Data on individuals in emergency accommodation is provided through the Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System (PASS).

These monthly reports are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the link provided above.  Housing authorities have no function with regard to asylum seekers in direct provision and accordingly such individuals are not recorded by housing authorities.</p><p>With regard to funding for homeless services, as confirmed in the Budget announcement, I have secured funding of &euro;70 million for homeless services in 2016.  This is an increase of approximately 32% on the 2015 allocation and a 55% increase on the 2014 allocation.</p><p>This, together with the significant resources being devoted to support the implementation of the Social Housing Strategy, provide clear evidence of the urgency which the Government attaches to addressing issues in relation to homelessness, and the clear prioritisation of the resources required.</p></reply>

If the required improvement did not happen, it was made clear to the tyre industry that the system would be reviewed and replaced with a full Producer Responsibility Initiative (PRI) model.  As part of a wider review of producer responsibility arrangements completed in 2014, the structural and environmental effectiveness of all aspects of the current system for managing waste tyres was assessed.    The results of this examination were stark. The report, published for consultation in November 2013 and in final form in April 2014, found:</p>  <p>- a   non-compliance rate with the Tyre Regulations of 46%,</p>  <p>- a lack of consistent and accurate data,   </p>  <p>- that the current system was not tracking data flows well, and   </p>  <p>- between 25% and 50% of waste tyres were not accounted for with widespread illegal dumping.</p>  <p>  Following extensive discussions with the tyre industry, I announced my decision to establish a full PRI scheme for Tyres and Waste Tyres in Ireland on 30 January 2015. Since my decision, significant progress has been made in discussions with the tyre industry.</p>  <p>  The new scheme will be operated by Repak with a registration and reporting role for the WEEE Register Society. Both organisations have long and successful track records under existing producer responsibility arrangements in the packaging, battery and waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) areas and have been instrumental in making Ireland a top EU performer in these waste streams.</p>  <p>  Operators based in other jurisdictions but bringing tyres onto the Irish market or distance sellers will have exactly the same obligations as any operator based in Ireland, so the suggestion that operators based outside the jurisdiction will have a competitive advantage over their Irish counterparts is unfounded. The distance seller approach has been very successfully used under existing arrangements for distance sellers of electrical and electronic equipment.</p>  <p>  There will be no new tyre tax under the new system. Consumers already pay a disposal fee to their tyre retailer whenever they buy a new tyre. The model that I am proposing will formalise a charge that tyre retailers already apply but which does not currently go towards the cost of managing the waste in all cases, as it is supposed to. It is absolutely right and fair to provide a system that ensures it is properly directed in the future so that the consumer does not pay twice: once at the point of purchase and again when the taxpayer has to meet costs incurred by local authorities for the clean-up of illegally dumped tyres.</p>  <p>  My Department is proceeding with the introduction of a full PRI scheme for tyres which mirrors those arrangements which are in place in twenty other Member States and which from the outset will, I am confident, enjoy the full support of all members of the European Tyre and Rubber Manufacturers Association who make up approximately 50% of the Irish tyre market. The Tyre Working Group that I established last year continues to operate and will be tasked now with the detailed design of the scheme based around the overarching principles that have been announced. The scheme will respect the producer responsibility approach and be based on the polluter pays principle.</p></reply>

In November 2014, I launched the Government&rsquo;s Social Housing Strategy 2020. This six-year strategy sets out to provide 35,000 new social housing units at a cost of &euro;3.8 billion and restores the State to a central role in the provision of social housing through, inter alia, a resumption of direct building on a significant scale by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies.</p><p>A significant number of other measures are being taken to address homelessness by securing a supply of accommodation to house homeless households and mobilise the necessary supports in order to deliver on the Government's target of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.

Rents for houses were 6.4% higher, while apartment rents were 7.6% higher than in the same quarter of 2014.</p>  <p>  These annual rates of increase were driven mainly by the Dublin market. Overall, in the 12 months to the end of Q2 2015, rents were higher by 9.2% in Dublin.  Annual growth in rents for the market outside Dublin was more subdued where, in the 12 months to the end of Q2 2015, rents were higher by 5.8%.</p>  <p>  A shortage of supply is at the heart of rising rents and the Government is addressing this on a number of fronts. Construction 2020: A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector, published last year, is aimed at addressing issues in the property and construction sectors and ensuring that any bottlenecks that might impede the sector in meeting residential and non-residential demand are addressed.</p>  <p>  Social housing has been prioritised by this Government and over &euro;1.7 billion in Exchequer and self-funding was allocated to the Social Housing Strategy 2020 between the 2015 and 2016 budgets, to support the provision of over 33,000 units. The Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan goes beyond 2016 and commits &euro;2.9 billion in capital funding towards social housing out to 2021.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, the key to addressing upward pressure on rents is through increasing the supply of housing. In 2014 the number of house completions was 11,016 units nationally, an increase of 33% on the 2013 figure. The latest figures for new house completions show that 8,914 units were completed to the end of September 2015, up 14% on the corresponding figure for 2014.  NAMA is aiming to deliver a target of 20,000 residential units before the end of 2020, with 90% of these units to be in the greater Dublin area.</p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, I am continuing to work on proposals to address the issue of rising rents. The level of rent increases, particularly in the greater Dublin area, presents a serious challenge. The regulation of rent, however, raises many complex economic and legal issues and I have to be satisfied that any measures proposed are balanced and have the desired effect on the rental market while being fair to landlords and tenants alike. Ultimately, any decision in relation to this issue is a matter for Government and so I have had discussions with the Minister for Finance and other Cabinet colleagues on this issue. It is my intention to bring final proposals to Government for decision as soon as possible.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.</p>  <p>  Following the recent tragic loss of life in Carrickmines, my Department&rsquo;s National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management is leading a Programme to Review Fire Safety in Traveller Accommodation. The objective of the review is to take immediate action to ensure that practical and appropriate fire safety measures, which can contribute to preventing loss of life and serious injury in local authority Traveller accommodation, have been applied systematically across the country. This will include community fire safety initiatives. Initial steps have been taken to identify the key issues and consultations with stakeholders at both national and local level, including Traveller Representative Groups, have taken place. </p>  <p>  Practical solutions to the issues that are identified through this engagement will be developed on a collaborative basis over the coming weeks. This collaborative approach will ensure that the review is carried out in a consistent and coordinated manner.  The programme to review and enhance fire safety in Traveller accommodation will be rolled out nationally over the coming months and is anticipated to be concluded by the end of Quarter 1, 2016. As well as the enhancements that I hope will already be in place at that stage, it will identify or propose further actions to sustain fire safety which will be given appropriate consideration by relevant stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  As provided for under sections 21 and 22 of the aforementioned Act, each local authority has in place a Local Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee (LTACC). The role of the LTACC is to advise local authorities on the provision and management of accommodation for Travellers, and to provide a liaison between Travellers and Members and officials of the appointing authority concerned. At least one quarter of the membership of the LTACC must comprise local Travellers and Traveller groups, with the remaining members comprising elected members and officials of the housing authority. I see the role of these local committees as crucial to resolving local issues, including health and safety issues on sites.</p></reply>

Rents for houses were 6.4% higher, while apartment rents were 7.6% higher than in the same quarter of 2014.</p><p>These annual rates of increase were driven mainly by the Dublin market. Overall, in the 12 months to the end of Q2 2015, rents were higher by 9.2% in Dublin. Annual growth in rents for the market outside Dublin was more subdued where, in the 12 months to the end of Q2 2015, rents were higher by 5.8%.</p><p>A shortage of supply is at the heart of rising rents and the Government is addressing this on a number of fronts. <i>Construction 2020: A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector</i>, published last year, is aimed at addressing issues in the property and construction sectors and ensuring that any bottlenecks that might impede the sector in meeting residential and non-residential demand are addressed.</p><p>Social housing has been prioritised by this Government and over &euro;1.7 billion in Exchequer and self-funding was allocated to the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>between the 2015 and 2016 budgets, to support the provision of over 33,000 units. The Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan goes beyond 2016 and commits &euro;2.9 billion in capital funding towards social housing out to 2021.</p><p>Ultimately, the key to addressing upward pressure on rents is through increasing the supply of housing. In 2014 the number of house completions was 11,016 units nationally, an increase of 33% on the 2013 figure. The latest figures for new house completions show that 8,914 units were completed to the end of September 2015, up 14% on the corresponding figure for 2014.  NAMA is aiming to deliver a target of 20,000 residential units before the end of 2020, with 90% of these units to be in the greater Dublin area.</p><p>In addition to these measures, I am continuing to work on proposals to address the issue of rising rents. The level of rent increases, particularly in the greater Dublin area, presents a serious challenge. The regulation of rent, however, raises many complex economic and legal issues and I have to be satisfied that any measures proposed are balanced and have the desired effect on the rental market while being fair to landlords and tenants alike. Ultimately, any decision in relation to this issue is a matter for Government and, in that context, I have had discussions with the Minister for Finance and other Cabinet colleagues on this issue, and my Department has engaged in discussions with other relevant Departments. It is my intention to bring final proposals to Government for decision as soon as possible.</p><p>Matters in relation to rent supplement fall within the remit of my colleague, the Tanaiste and Minister for Social Protection.</p></reply>

If awarded, PCB will allow them to continue to receive, in addition to their earnings from employment, a percentage of their illness benefit or invalidity pension payment while working.</p>  <p>  The wage subsidy scheme (WSS) is an employment support to private sector employers, the objective of which is to encourage employers to employ people with disabilities and thereby increase the numbers of people with disabilities participating in the open labour market.

It is open to staff in any Department to apply to be included on the Department&rsquo;s Clerical Officer and Staff Officer transfer lists.</p><p>The Department also maintains lists of Executive Officer and Higher Executive Officer grades who have expressed an interest in transferring to another location. However, with the exception of CAF locations, these lists are informal and the assignment of staff is a matter for management.</p><p>Where a position is to be filled by way of transfer, the relevant list is considered in order of date of application. A number of factors are considered e.g. is the person suitable in terms of sick leave, attendance and performance, are they tied to their current location for a defined period of time, are they willing to resume full-time duty if necessary.</p><p>A person may move up a list where those ahead of them refuse a transfer or withdraw their interest in a particular location. A person who avails of a career break may move down the list as their date of application would be amended to take account of the period on career break.</p><p>The attached tables show the number of names recorded on each of the Department&rsquo;s lists for the grades of Higher Executive Officer, Executive Officer, Staff Officer and Clerical Officer.  It should be noted that a person may appear on a number of lists.</p></reply>

Class A employees with weekly earnings of &euro;352.01 or more make a 4% contribution charged on all of their earnings. This creates a &ldquo;step effect&rdquo; as net income reduces immediately by the full 4% PRSI charge applied to all earnings.  </p>  <p>  The new PRSI Credit I am now introducing will reduce the amount of PRSI paid for those with weekly gross earnings between &euro;352.01 and &euro;424. The maximum weekly PRSI Credit of &euro;12 applies at weekly earnings of &euro;352.01 - this will reduce the current weekly PRSI charge from &euro;14.08 to &euro;2.08.  Where weekly earnings exceed &euro;352.01 and are less than &euro;424.01 per week, the maximum weekly PRSI Credit applying is reduced on a tapered basis. The new arrangements will ensure that all employees earning between &euro;352 and &euro;424 per week will see their PRSI contribution reduce from January next and the employee will always be better off as earnings increase. </p>  <p>  Participants of community employment, gateway and T&uacute;s schemes receive a weekly payment which is equivalent to the social welfare payment appropriate to their family size, plus a top up of &euro;20, subject to a minimum payment of &euro;208 per week.  This payment is treated in the same manner as earnings from employment for PRSI purposes and accordingly is subject to Class A PRSI.  Accordingly, all participants in these schemes earning between &euro;352 and &euro;424 per week will benefit from the new measure. The payment of Class A PRSI entitles these participants to establish entitlement to the full range of long and short term social insurance benefits.</p>  <p>  I was also pleased in the recent Budget to announce an increase of &euro;2.50 per week from January in the top up payable to participants of the various employment schemes such as community employment operated by the Department. It should also be noted that all participants on these schemes who have children aged 17 or under will benefit next year from the &euro;5 per month increase in Child Benefit.</p></reply>

The Department for Work and Pensions has publicly refuted these claims and advised the UK&rsquo;s Public Accounts Committee that it has investigated the claims and found no wrongdoing. </p>  <p>  The potential for inflating figures has been taken into consideration in the design of JobPath.

If the Deputy has no such evidence, I question his basis for this line of enquiry into the Project Arrow sale.   </p>  <p>  I reiterate that I am not aware of any investigations in any jurisdictions into NAMA in respect of the Project Eagle sale. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that Cerberus previously provided confirmation that it acted within all applicable laws within all jurisdictions relevant to this sale and that no fee was paid to any party connected with NAMA.  Cerberus also has outlined its understanding that any investigations that are ongoing relate to third parties not affiliated to Cerberus. Furthermore, the NAMA Chair has confirmed at the recent PAC appearance on 1 October 2015, that the investigations are not focused on the conduct of NAMA.  </p>  <p>  Given this, there is absolutely no basis for intervening in the sale of Project Arrow which has been conducted by NAMA in line with the highest international standards and which will generate the best available return to the Irish taxpayer.</p>  <p>  NAMA has put huge effort into preparing for, bringing to market and completing loan and asset sales processes, which include some of the largest portfolios to come to market in Europe. These sales significantly contribute to NAMA's debt redemption targets and its obligation to achieve maximum return to the State. </p>  <p>  The Oireachtas, in framing the NAMA Act, ensured that NAMA would be independent in its decision making so as to avoid a position where persons would seek to influence decision-making in a way that would serve only certain vested interests. By extension, such interference would be detrimental to the interests of Irish taxpayers.</p></reply>

Public calls for applications were published on the Department of Finance, Central Bank and Public Appointments Service websites, as well as an advertisement being placed in the Financial Times.

As such it was vital that the search and selection process was wide-ranging and rigorous, so as to employ the best candidate in this key role.

That figure includes a retention payment element which is designed to ensure that NAMA retains key staff, and the expertise they hold, within the organisation for as long as they are needed.  As set out in my Department's Section 227 Review of NAMA in July 2014, the ability of NAMA to obtain the best achievable financial return for the State is heavily dependent on its retention of expertise.  That view has been strongly endorsed by the NAMA Board.  Given that, I agreed with the NAMA Board in the context of NAMA's accelerated senior debt redemption target and its ancillary residential and commercial development funding activities, that a redundancy programme reflecting public sector norms and also comprising a retention payment element would be introduced to enable NAMA retain key staff.  The retention payment for individual staff is dependent on NAMA achieving its targets and on satisfactory individual performance ratings and will only be paid in the year the staff member leaves the organisation.  I should add that the retention payment is subject to normal employment taxes and levies.  The overall cost of NAMA's redundancy programme of &euro;20 million should be read in the context of projected cash generation by NAMA over its life of &euro;40 billion.</p></reply>

The relevant reference rate set by the European Commission annually is a 10 year average of the potential growth of the economy less a convergence margin.  This is applicable in cases, such as Ireland's, where the medium term budgetary objective set under the balanced budget fiscal rule has yet to be achieved.  In short, the Expenditure Benchmark adjusts the expenditure based on the previous year and only takes account of discretionary revenue measures.</p>  <p>  Therefore additional tax revenue generated due to buoyancy, via growth in the economy or otherwise, has no impact on future available fiscal space.  However, additional revenue generated via discretionary policy measures increases fiscal space but decisions which lead to a decrease in revenue reduce the overall fiscal space.</p>  <p>  The carryover effect of Budget 2016 tax measures was taken into account when estimating the fiscal space available in 2017 included in Tables A8 and A9.  It should also be noted that there is provision for indexation of the tax system included in the baseline Budget figures and the potential additional revenue that would be generated from a political decision not to proceed with indexation is included as a discretionary revenue measure in the fiscal space calculations in Tables A8 and A9.  The final choice of measures will be a matter for decision by the next government.</p></reply>

This is demonstrated by Ireland's exit from the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) at the end of this year and its transition to the preventive arm which will set the context for the delivery of our fiscal targets from 2016 onwards.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the core of these fiscal rules is the Medium Term  Objective (MTO) which is to achieve a balanced budget in structural terms (i.e. once allowances are made for once-off temporary factors and the  impact of the economic cycle on the public finances estimated using the agreed EU methodology).  Compliance with the MTO will require an improvement in the structural budget at a rate greater than 0.5% of GDP each year until the MTO is met.</p><p>The second pillar of the fiscal rules relates to the Expenditure Benchmark which supports the achievement of the MTO by explicitly setting the rate - aligned to the estimated potential growth rate of the economy - at which aggregate public expenditure can grow other than when the relevant expenditure is funded by discretionary revenue measures.</p><p>Ministerial Expenditure Ceilings within which Departments should deliver the services for which they are responsible were set out in the Expenditure Report.  These are consistent with our obligations under the <font color="#2F2F2F">fiscal framework set by the preventive arm of the SGP and the need to maintain hard-won fiscal stability.</font>Under the EU fiscal rules additional resources in excess of those ceilings may only be allocated in a manner that is consistent with our obligations under the preventive arm of the SGP.  For example from 2016 onwards any supplementary estimates needed to meet unplanned additional spending would need to be funded through expenditure savings and efficiencies elsewhere or via discretionary revenue measures.</p><p>The Ministerial Expenditure Ceilings for the period to 2018 set out in the Expenditure Report 2016, take into account a range of expected expenditure developments including demographic pressures in Health, Education and Social Protection, the carry-over impact of certain Budget 2016 measures, expected lower numbers on the Live Register and the revised capital envelope set out in the Capital Plan.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that as set out by my colleague the Minister for Finance in his response to Parliamentary Question No. 146 of 22 October 2015, the amounts set out in the Budget 2016 documentation in relation to gross and net fiscal space for the period 2017 to 2021 are not final for the reasons set out in the reply.</p><p>Actual aggregate expenditure beyond 2016 will ultimately be a matter for Government decision-making, in light of the available fiscal space determined under SGP obligations at that time and its allocation  between tax and expenditure measures as determined by Government.</p><p>I am satisfied that the Government decision-making which underpinned Budget 2016 demonstrated how an appropriate balance can be struck operating strictly within the fiscal rules of achieving budgetary sustainability and directing available public resources to areas of greatest need.</p></reply>

At present the PSPR, which was introduced in 2011, reduces most public service pensions whose value, on a pre-PSPR basis, is above &euro;12,000.  While not a part of the Lansdowne Road Agreement this proposed PSPR amelioration is incorporated into the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2015, which is currently before the D&aacute;il, and as such forms part of the wider set of proposed public service pay and pension restoration measures in that Bill. </p>  <p>  The PSPR amelioration provisions in the 2015 Bill give priority to the lower-pensioned persons impacted by PSPR, in line with my stated commitments. In specific terms, those provisions will deliver the part-restoration of the PSPR cuts in three stages effective from 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018.  When fully rolled-out from 1 January 2018, this means that all public service pensions in payment with pre-PSPR values of up to &euro;34,132 will be fully exempt from PSPR, while those pensioners not fully removed from the reach of PSPR will, in general, benefit by &euro;1,680 per year.  The cost of these proposed changes is estimated at about &euro;90 million on a full-year basis from 2018.  This represents a major amelioration of the PSPR burden over a multi-year time horizon, at the end of which the great majority of public service pensioners, with the exception of those on the higher levels of pension income, will no longer be affected by PSPR. </p>  <p>  Under section 12 of the FEMPI Act 2013, I am required to review the necessity of FEMPI legislation annually and cause a written report of my findings to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  In that context, economic progress and fiscal consolidation in the years ahead will determine the scope and timing of the possible further scale-back or elimination of the financial emergency measures, including the PSPR.</p>  <p>  I have no plans at this time to link the pensions of public service pensioners generally to the Consumer Price Index</p></reply>

Phase 1 of the overall Scheme was completed in 2011 and works on Phases 2, 3 and 4 is expected to be completed in the first half of 2016.</p>  <p>  The response to the Scheme from the public has been positive and it has already proven itself to be effective and has protected multiple properties during flood events since the first phase was completed in 2011. </p>  <p>  A unique feature of the Scheme is the use of glass in a small section of the flood defence walls mainly along the main quay at the marinas with the remainder used in small sections in prominent areas.  While the use of glass enhances the visual amenity of and connectivity with the river, it is only suitable for use as part of a flood defence scheme in very particular areas and its use is limited also by the significant additional cost of using glass compared with concrete walls. </p></reply>

The objective of the staff mobility policy operating within the Department is to help staff develop their full potential in a systematic way while also meeting the business needs of the Department.  Staff transfer requests from one location of my Department to another location of my Department are noted by grade in date order and facilitated through my Department's HR Section in line with this policy.</p><p>In line with centrally agreed Department of Public Expenditure and Reform processes, staff at Clerical Officer and Staff Officer grades may apply to transfer to another Department in an established provincial location through the Central Transfer List.  For the staff of my Department, their participation in this process is managed by the HR Section in my Department.  Staff can make application to the HR Section outlining their location preferences and are facilitated as much as possible.  However, this is dependent on the business needs of the Department and availability of posts within the other Departments at any given time.</p><p>A staff member at any grade up to Principal Officer who wishes to transfer to another Government Department must identify an officer of the same grade in the other Department who is willing to exchange positions, i.e. the &ldquo;head-to-head&rdquo; mechanism.

It is widely recognised that encouraging businesses to invest in good quality design as a key component of innovation and competitiveness will maximise opportunities for success in today&rsquo;s competitive marketplace and ultimately create additional jobs here in Ireland.  ID2015 will enjoin all parts of the Irish design economy in a concerted effort to promote design as a key business differentiator and employment generator.  Primarily, ID2015 will aim to generate:</p><p>1,800 additional jobs in the design sector over 2015-2019;</p><p>200 new design enterprises established in 2015 and registered with DCCoI;</p><p>&euro;10m (5%) growth in design-related exports in 2015;</p><p>Participation of 300+ SMEs in international trade missions and design-based trade events over 2015/16.</p><p>50+ SMEs involved in a &lsquo;Design for Growth&rsquo; Programme (2015/16);</p><p>In July 2015, an interim report was published on ID2015.  Highlights of the programme at that stage included: </p><p>33 companies supported through the International Trade Fund, to participate in 50 international trade events, generating new market penetration and export opportunities.

There have been no lying-in facilities utilised for Defence Forces personnel in St Bricin&rsquo;s since December 2012.The closure of St. Bricin&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin and other military establishments was announced as part of the Budget in October, 2008. The decision was linked to the decentralisation programme. As part of the implementation of the Government decision to relocate the Defence Forces HQ under decentralisation, it was proposed that services being provided by St Bricin&rsquo;s would transfer to The Curragh. It was anticipated at the time that St. Bricin&rsquo;s would be disposed of, taking account of market conditions, so as to maximise the return to the Defence Forces and generate funding for reinvestment in Defence Forces equipment and infrastructure in accordance with Government policy. That decision included a provision that St Bricin&rsquo;s would remain in operation as a military medical facility pending the provision of suitable alternative facilities. As I have previously advised, to date it has not proved possible to provide alternative facilities within available resources and the Defence Forces priorities in relation to infrastructure investment.</p><p>The Department is engaged in an ongoing capital building programme designed to modernise and enhance the training, operational and accommodation facilities available to members of the Defence Forces.

It is a shared priority with the authorities in Northern Ireland and there is extensive cross-border co-operation in place to tackle smuggling and other border-focused criminal activities.  This work involves the police and customs services and other law enforcement agencies from both jurisdictions.  The interagency cross-border groups on fuel and tobacco fraud are two examples of this joint working in action.</p>  <p>  I met recently with the North&rsquo;s Justice Minister, David Ford, to discuss what more can be done to tackle cross-border crime.  I jointly hosted with Minister Ford the Annual Cross Border Organised Crime Seminar in Sligo on 30 September/1 October last with over 100 delegates from all the relevant agencies attending from North and South.  It is one demonstration of the close and ongoing co-operation between the two jurisdictions in this regard.</p>  <p>  I am examining, in co-operation with my counterparts in the North, ways to build on the excellent co-operation that already takes place in this area and we want an enhanced overarching structure put in place to support it.  The Government wants to see agreement forged in respect of proposals to establish enhanced cross-Border structures to tackle organised crime within the current talks process at Stormont. </p>  <p>  Joint working of all the law enforcement agencies involved on both sides of the Border will be crucial to combating criminality successfully.

(1) of the Constitution allows for the establishment of special courts in accordance with the law in cases where it is considered that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice. Section 38 of the Offences against the State Act 1939 provides for the establishment of Special Criminal Courts. Section 38 of the 1939 Act as amended also provides that the Government may, whenever they consider it necessary or desirable to do so, establish additional Special Criminal Courts as they think fit. It also provides that whenever two or more Special Criminal Courts are in existence the Government may, if and so often as they think fit, reduce the number of such Courts and abolish those existing Courts that appear to be redundant.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that last week the Government appointed seven serving judges to the bench of the second Special Criminal Court that was established by Government Order on 14 December 2004, thereby bringing the second Court into existence. </p>  <p>  There is a backlog of cases in the existing Special Criminal Court with delays of approximately twenty months in cases coming to trial.

There are a range of different reasons for such a transfer request, one of which is based on geographic location. </p><p>I have set out information below on how staff of my Department can seek transfers which may be of assistance to the Deputy. </p><p>The main avenues that staff can follow if they are seeking a transfer are as follows:</p><p>- Staff can submit a formal request to Human Resources Division for a transfer within the Department.</p><p>- Staff can submit a formal request to Human Resources Division for a transfer to a specific location. Such requests are forwarded to all Civil Service Departments with offices in the location;</p><p>- Staff can respond to requests from  Human Resources Division for expressions of interest for specific posts.</p><p>- Staff can seek to identify a head to head transfer with other staff of the same grade across the Civil Service. In such cases both Departments must be satisfied as to the suitability of the transferees, with particular reference to their respective performance and attendance records.</p><p>For requests which are forwarded to Civil Service Departments with offices in other locations, it is then the responsibility of that Department to administer their transfer list and consider candidates as and when suitable vacancies arise. The primary factor determining the member of staff's position on any transfer list is linked to the date they applied for a transfer. In all cases staff would be required to be suitable on sick leave and conduct grounds to be eligible for transfer. </p><p>Due to the large variation in the range and circumstances of staff transfers each year, it is not possible to readily isolate the numbers and breakdown sought by the Deputy and attempting to retrieve this information would involve a disproportionate dedication of staff resources.</p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that where possible my Department will facilitate such transfer requests however the priority will always be to maintain a balanced and appropriate level of staff resources in priority areas and to match people with the most relevant skills to the requirements of posts.</p></reply>

To facilitate a focussed discussion, 4 national-level Travellers NGOs agreed a formal statement of what they are seeking and what they envisage such recognition will achieve in practical terms as well as in terms of the status and position of Travellers in Irish society and on 15 July 2015 hosted a round-table discussion with relevant Government Departments and Traveller representatives with a view to clarifying any remaining issues.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that there is a consultation process underway led by the Department of Justice and Equality to develop a new National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy.  Phase 1 (identification of key themes for the new Strategy) has been completed, and Phase 2 (identification and agreement of high-level objectives under each agreed theme) will commence shortly.

The Garda pay scale does not include any allowances and does not reflect the full earnings of a Garda.

Insofar as my Department is concerned, however, I can inform the Deputy that the gross expenditure associated with the operation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Prisons and Courts Services as well as other services related to crime and criminal justice was in the region of &euro;2bn in 2014.  This figure does not include the cost to the State of other response services, for example in the area of health and social services, or the direct cost to the State of theft or of losses arising from customs and other fraud, nor does it include the wider costs to society, which are undoubtedly substantial.</p>  <p>  Insofar as alcohol related crime is concerned, it is widely accepted that alcohol plays a part in many crime situations, including road traffic offences and the Deputy will be aware of the extensive awareness raising and enforcement activities which are pursued in this regard.  Alcohol can also be a contributing factor in many assault and public order offences and a range of legislative provisions are available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in order to address such criminal and anti-social behaviour, and to bring criminal proceedings where appropriate.  These include measures under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  In particular, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 gave particular powers to Garda&iacute; to tackle misuse of alcohol, including the power to seize alcohol in the possession of persons under 18 years of age of to forestall public disorder or damage to property.  Garda&iacute; may also issue fixed charge notices for the offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place.  Where young offenders are involved Garda&iacute; may employ a range of options including the incremental system of warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour provided under the Criminal Justice Act 2006, as well as the diversionary measures provided under the Children Act 2001.</p>  <p>  More generally, Garda management employ relevant policing strategies to take account of the incidence of crime, including alcohol related crimes.  In this context Garda&iacute; also engage extensively with many community and business groups in relation to issues of local concern as well as participating in formal consultative structures such as Joint Policing Committees.</p></reply>

The task of the ICLVR is to facilitate the location of the remains of a number of people who were killed and buried secretly by paramilitary organisations during the troubles.  They have become known as the Disappeared.</p>  <p>  The families of the Disappeared have had to face a very particular tragedy in not only having lost a loved one, but having been denied for so long information about the burial places of their loved ones.</p>  <p>  With the support of the two Governments, the ICLVR has worked and continues to work tirelessly in pursuit of its task.  Its only aim is to locate the victims' remains in order that they may be returned to their families to receive a decent burial.  In this way the families will then have a grave at which to grieve and to remember.</p>  <p>  Twelve of the victims on the ICLVR's list of the disappeared have been located, the most recent being S&eacute;amus Wright and Kevin McKee, whose remains were found by the ICLVR last June in Co. Meath.  The ICLVR is continuing its inquiries in relation to the remaining four cases &ndash; Joe Lynskey, Columba McVeigh, Robert Nairac and Seamus Ruddy &ndash; and I can assure the families of my and the Government's continued full support for this ongoing humanitarian work.</p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy that the ICLVR's investigation team has the resources it requires to conduct its work.  It employs a wide range of techniques in this regard and, indeed, is considered a world leader in the field.  However, as the Deputy will know the ICLVR's work is fundamentally driven by information, and this is the key resource for their efforts.</p>  <p>  I would encourage anyone with information that could help to locate those still missing to give that information to the ICLVR without delay &ndash; contact details are on the ICLVR's website www.iclvr.ie.  I would emphasise that all information provided to the ICLVR is treated as strictly confidential and, by law, can only be used to locate and identify the remains of victims.</p></reply>

These childcare support programmes include the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme; three Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) programmes (i.e. Childcare Education and Training programme (CETS), Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme and After-school Childcare (ASCC) programme) and  the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme. The ECCE programme and the TEC programmes are provided through both private and community/ not-for-profit services while the CCS programme is currently provided through community/ not-for-profit services only. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2016,  I announced an &euro;85 million package of additional investment for childcare. This includes funding for:</p>  <p>  - An extension to the ECCE programme, which will now allow children to avail of the free pre-school provision from age three until they make the transition to primary school;</p>  <p>  - A suite of supports, which will ensure children with a disability can meaningfully participate in, and fully reap the benefits of the ECCE programme;</p>  <p>  - An extension of the CCS programme by up to 8,000 places and, for the first time, making this programme available through private service throughout the country; and</p>  <p>  - A resource which will allow important work to commence on consolidating existing targeted childcare support programmes, including the CCS and TEC programmes. It is envisaged that a new simplified targeted childcare support programme will be available through private and community/ not-for-profit and private services from 2017. </p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding under the Annual Early Years Capital Programme.</p>  <p>  - In 2012, capital funding of &euro;6m was provided to fund a maintenance programme for services (i.e. to address remedial, maintenance and renovation work and to purchase equipment). This funding, which provided grants up to a maximum of &euro;50,000, was available to private and community/ not-for-profit services.</p>  <p>  - In 2013, capital funding of &euro;2.75m was provided to support the on-going improvement of services.  Both private and community/not-for-profit services participating in one of the national childcare programmes implemented by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs were eligible to apply for a grant under the Programme.</p>  <p>  - In 2014, capital funding of &euro;2.5 million for the maintenance and upgrade of community/not-for-profit services.  The objective of this funding was to ensure that previously-funded community/not-for-profit services remained fit-for-purpose thus protecting State investment.</p>  <p>  - In 2015, capital funding of &euro;7 million was provided. Of this funding, &euro;5 million was made available for grants specifically for community/not-for-profit services.  This funding provided for the allocation of capital grant aid in the region of &euro;500,000 for significant upgrades of services such as major refurbishment or relocation to new premises. Grants of up to &euro;50,000 for essential maintenance, or works undertaken to improve the energy performance of community/not-for-profit services were also provided. The remaining &euro;2 million was made available for both private and community/not-for-profit services to access grants of up to &euro;500 for quality improvement measures, specifically in the area of upgrading IT facilities.</p>  <p>  Funding will also be provided in 2016 as part of the Early Years Capital Programme. I am currently considered how best this funding can be targeted.</p></reply>

From September 2016, I am expanding the ECCE programme to allow children to access free pre-school from the time they are 3 years of age until they start primary school. </p>  <p>  This extended free pre-school provision was first recommended by the Expert Advisory Group on the Early Years Strategy in 2013. It was also one of a series of recommendations of the recent Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare which I established in January last.  The Group consulted widely with a range of stakeholders, including the early years sector, during the course of its work through an Open Policy Debate and two online consultation processes, the reports of which are available on my Department's website. The recommendation was included in the Report of the Inter-Departmental Group, which I published in July this to facilitate a further debate on how best to meet the needs of parents and children.</p>  <p>  I have recently met with senior representatives from the early years sector to discuss this and other improvements that were announced as part of the &euro;85 million investment package in Budget 2016. The meeting was positive and constructive, with all parties expressing commitment to work together on the issues of capacity and high quality pre-school provision. My Department will be working closely with the early years sector to build capacity in time for the intakes in September 2016, and for subsequent increased availability in January and April 2017.</p></reply>

This means, for example, that children born between 2 February 2011 and 30 June 2012 qualified for free pre-school from September 2015. Children who turn 3 from 1 July  2012 are below the age range for eligibility for ECCE in the 2015/2016 programme year but will qualify for the 2016/17 programme year. </p>  <p>  The recent Budget decisions, which introduced an extended provision under the ECCE programme that allows children to access the free pre-school programme from the time they are 3 years of age until they start primary school, come into effect from September 2016. This extended provision, when fully rolled out, will mean that children will have access to free education - either in pre-school or primary school - from the age of three.  The start up date for the introduction of this new measure was decided so as to allow pre-school providers an adequate timeframe to make any necessary infrastructural or service changes and to put in place extra staff resources to accommodate the additional numbers benefiting from the programme, which is estimated to increase from 67,000 to 127,000 in a given programme year.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that, depending on their date of birth, some children enrolling in the ECCE programme in September 2016 will not benefit from this extended free pre-school provision. I am also aware that, when the programme is fully in place (i.e. from 2017), there will be some children who will benefit for a shorter extra period of free pre-school than others. Again, this will depend on the child's date of birth and the age at which they make the transition to primary school. Ultimately however, when this extended programme is fully in place, all children will be better off than in the present programme. Indeed, the net effect of the improvements for children overall will be an increase of an average of 23 weeks over the current programme.  I think that this is a significant step forward for children and their families.</p></reply>

I have recently brought legislation to the Oireachtas to put this entitlement to an aftercare plan, with some improvements to the eligibility criteria, on a statutory footing to make it an explicit duty to assess a young person's needs on leaving care.  </p>  <p>  The planning for the transition from care to independent adulthood relies on a collaboration with the young person, their carers and partner agencies to generate a plan that is specific to the individual young person's needs.  The aftercare preparation includes an Individual Financial Support Plan, which takes into account the aftercare allowance and all sources of financial support for a young adult that is available from Government Departments or statutory agencies. </p>  <p>  Tusla became aware that a situation had evolved historically where there were uneven and different rates of financial supports being made available for young people leaving care around the country.  As part of the implementation of its national policy, Tusla addressed this inequitable approach and has introduced a standardised national aftercare allowance of &euro;300 per week.  This ensures equality for young adults after leaving care who are engaged in training and education.  The introduction of this standardised allowance has meant that young people leaving care who remain in their foster care placement or who are living independently, and who are in education or training, are now receiving the same financial support from Tusla.  Many young people in independent living have benefited from an increase in their allowance as a result of this measure.  Practices in relation to additional discretionary allowances remain in place.  Tusla is aware that some young people due to their vulnerability and level of need, require additional supports both from Tusla services and financially.  </p>  <p>  Advice, guidance, support and signposting are key elements of the supports available to care leavers.  For those young people who are not in training or education, aftercare services have a key role in providing support to them in liaising with the relevant departments and agencies in accessing financial assistance, employment opportunities, training or supporting them to return to education.</p></reply>

While certain flexibilities had been built in to the Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability  the <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>children and young people's policy framework contained a commitment to develop a plan to facilitate the full participation of such children in the ECCE Programme.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has lead responsibility for the implementation of this commitment and has concluded an intensive process of deliberation and consultation on the matter in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Education and Skills and has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.</p><p>As part of Budget 2016, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has announced the necessary funding to implement the new model of ECCE supports for children with a disability.  The new model will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of &euro;15m has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33m from 2017 onwards.</p><p>Just to add, in relation to the specific information sought by the Deputy that while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such pre-school assistant supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.</p><p>Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the information that he has sought insofar as it is available.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them. </p></reply>

These Guidelines were developed by the HSE and State Claims Agency, incorporating the learning from a two year open disclosure pilot programme. They were informed by feedback following wide consultation of the document nationally across health and social care departments and services, patient representatives, patient representative/advocacy groups, trade unions, regulatory bodies and indemnifying bodies.

If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office who will follow up the matter with them.</p><p>The <i>Report of the National Substance Misuse Steering Group, 2012 </i>reported that alcohol is associated with 2,000 beds being occupied every night in Irish acute hospitals, one quarter of injuries presenting to emergency departments and over half of attendances to specialised addition centres.  The report further noted that the harms caused by the misuse of alcohol were estimated to cost the Exchequer &euro;3.7 billion euros in 2007, with alcohol-related illness costing the healthcare system &euro;1.2 billion.  The figure is taken from the report, &quot;Costs to Society of Problem Alcohol Use in Ireland&quot;, 2011.  The estimate is based on the methods used in similar reports from other developed countries including the United Kingdom and used data from surveys and surveillance systems.  The costs are broken down as follows:<table><tr><th>-</th><th>&euro; million</th><th>% of Total Cost</th></tr><tr><td>Cost to the healthcare system of alcohol-related illnesses</td><td>1,200</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of alcohol-related crime</td><td>1,189</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of alcohol-related road accidents</td><td>526</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of output lost due to alcohol-related absence from work</td><td>330</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of alcohol-related accidents at work</td><td>197</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of alcohol-related suicides</td><td>167</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of alcohol-related premature mortality</td><td>110</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>3,719</td><td>100</td></tr></table></p><p>I hope the above clarifies the cost of financial resources spent. </p><p>The General Scheme of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill was approved by Government on the 3 February 2015.  The Scheme includes provisions for minimum unit pricing, health labelling on products that contain alcohol, restrictions on the advertising and marketing of alcohol and the regulation of sports sponsorship.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill will also provide for the making of regulations to restrict promotions including price based promotions.  As part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, the measures were debated in detail by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children.  The JOCH report was published in June 2015.  The Department of Health is continuing to work on the preparation of the legislation.  The Bill is due to be published shortly.</p></reply>

There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland (Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>).  Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme.  The vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.</p><p>As of 9 October the HPRA has received 921 reports of suspected adverse reactions or events notified in association with the use of HPV vaccines.  The vast majority have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccines, as described in the product information, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, malaise, headache, dizziness and injection site reactions.</p><p>While no medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised nationally and at EU level.  This is done by monitoring both individual adverse reaction reports received by competent authorities across Europe and Periodic Safety Update Reports submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder for the vaccine on a regular basis.</p><p>As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.</p><p>The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has commenced a review of the HPV vaccine <i>&quot;to further clarify aspects of their safety profile,&quot;</i>although the agency points out that this review <i>&quot;does not question that the benefits of HPV vaccines outweigh their risks.&quot;</i>The Health Products Regulatory Authority is participating in the review which aims to clarify aspects of their safety profile and is specifically focusing on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.  Reports of these conditions in young women who have received a HPV vaccine have been previously considered during routine safety monitoring by the Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) but a causal link between them and the vaccines was not established.  Both conditions can occur in non vaccinated individuals and it is considered important to further review if the number of cases reported with HPV vaccine is greater than would be expected.  The outcome of the PRAC review is anticipated before the end of this year.</p><p>The HPRA is participating in the PRAC review of HPV vaccines to clarify aspects of their safety profile.  As for all licensed medicines, the safety of these vaccines is monitored by the PRAC (an EU level drug safety committee) where the HPRA is actively represented and contributes.  Data from all Member States, including Ireland, is being comprehensively analysed, in line with usual ongoing referrals.</p><p>While the review is ongoing the European Medicines Agency has advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines.  Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using them in accordance with the current product information.  Any changes to this advice will be made following the outcome of the review, by the EMA.</p></reply>

The tendering process facilitates openness, transparency and allows freedom of access for all interested parties.  </p><p>  All of the contractors procured are required to satisfy the statutory obligations that pertain to each licensed transport operator in the State.  This includes an obligation to keep and provide evidence that all statutory vehicle, driver and company certificates and licences are kept current and in order.  Nominated drivers are obliged to satisfy medical examination, must be licensed to drive the size of vehicle used, and are subject to vetting procedures arranged by Bus &Eacute;ireann and conducted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit. </p><p>  Contractors who are successful in the competition for existing work that is opened to tender are awarded a five-year contract which provides security for the duration of the contract to the contractor, provided of course that obligations continue to be satisfied, as well as stability in terms of familiarity with transport arrangements for the families, schools, and children concerned.</p><p>  It is a matter for each tenderer to decide what price they wish to quote for the work concerned taking into consideration their operating costs over the course of the contract period, and in common with every citizen of the State a tenderer is entitled to seek redress through the Courts in the event that they wish to appeal a procurement decision.  It is not my intention to establish an oversight/appeals body to oversee the tendering process.</p></reply>

Each school year, services, routes, pick-up points, vehicle size etc. are designed around the eligible children presenting for school transport.</p><p>The Company strives to accommodate as many children as possible, always within the guidelines of the schemes, and to provide a good standard of service that is consistent nationally.  To assist families with queries on aspects of the scheme, a series of frequently asked questions is available on the Bus &Eacute;ireann and my Department's websites. </p><p>  In advance of any given school year, a diverse rang e of specific queries are raised by Deputies and parents, including this year.  There is no discretion in the application of these guidelines nationally which can sometimes be taken as presenting a negative attitude to requests received.  I have asked Bus &Eacute;ireann to review the experience this year with a view to putting any appropriate further measures in place to assist with improving communication with families availing of the service.  </p><p>  In relation to the current procurement arrangements for the operation of the school bus services raised in the submission made to Oireachtas members by the Federation of Transport Operators Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised as follows:  </p><p>The Bus Eireann tender processes for school transport services are conducted in a transparent manner which is in accordance with applicable law, including public procurement requirements, and facilitates equality of treatment.  School transport contractors who are selected for re-tendering are notified that the contracts are being tendered in line with Government policy where expenditure of public funds is concerned.  They are subsequently provided with the full suite of tender documents clearly outlining the process, the procedure, and the selection and award criteria for contract award.  The tendering process facilitates openness, transparency and allows freedom of access for all interested parties.  </p><p>  All of the contractors procured are required to satisfy the statutory obligations that pertain to each licensed transport operator in the State.  This includes an obligation to keep and provide evidence that all statutory vehicle, driver and company certificates and licences are kept current and in order.  Nominated drivers are obliged to satisfy medical examination, must be licensed to drive the size of vehicle used, and are subject to vetting procedures arranged by Bus &Eacute;ireann and conducted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit.</p><p>Contractors who are successful in the competition for existing work that is opened to tender are awarded a five-year contract which provides security for the duration of the contract to the contractor, provided of course that obligations continue to be satisfied, as well as stability in terms of familiarity with transport arrangements for the families, schools, and children concerned.</p><p>  It is a matter for each tenderer to decide what price they wish to quote for the work concerned taking into consideration their operating costs over the course of the contract period, and in common with every citizen of the State a tenderer is entitled to seek redress through the Courts in the event that they wish to appeal a procurement decision.  The procurement of school transport services through competitive tendering procedures is aimed at maximising value for money for the exchequer in the delivery of school transport services.  Some 90% of current school transport routes have been procured through competitive tendering. In the four consecutive years between 2010 and 2013, the cost to the Department for the element of the School Transport Schemes administered by Bus &Eacute;ireann was reduced/maintained each year, while over the same period more than 1,000 new school transport services and some 2,600 service enhancements were approved by the Department and introduced by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  </p><p>The value of savings achieved and other cost efficiency measures served to offset the otherwise significant additional  cost that would have been incurred to meet this level of new demand.  </p><p>  The cost of the element of the School Transport Schemes administered by Bus &Eacute;ireann to the Department in 2014 remained less than it was in 2010, as the following table indicates, and this will continue to be the case in 2015.</p><p>  Customer research was undertaken earlier this year by Ipsos MRBI on behalf of the Company in connection with how their new online school transport portal and service had improved over 2014/15 and to identify further scope for improvements.  The helpful attitude of Bus &Eacute;ireann staff was noted in this research.  Four focus groups were established in different parts of Ireland from a cross section of school transport scheme customers.  The findings of this research were positive, indicating that the new system allows more parental control of the process, provides reassurance that information has been sent/received, and provides a more convenient method to apply, to obtain an eligibility assessment, and to pay/submit medical card details.</p><p>Details of the scheme are available at www.buseireann.ie and at www.education.ie.</p><p><i>Cost of the School Transport Scheme 2010-2014 - PQ</i><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total net chargeable by BE to DES</th><th>Parental Charges Collected</th><th>Total combined net amount chargeable including parental charges</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>&euro;000m</td><td>&euro;000m</td><td>&euro;000m</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>154,026</td><td>11,651</td><td>165,677</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>151,804</td><td>11,486</td><td>163,290</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>149,477</td><td>12,570</td><td>162,047</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>149,825</td><td>12,772</td><td>162,597</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>150,467</td><td>13,057</td><td>163,524</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This map will be up-dated over the course of the Social Housing Strategy to record the development and use of these lands.  Accordingly, both lands that have been transferred to the Housing Agency under the Land Aggregation Scheme and other local authority held lands suitable for housing development will be among the first sites considered in order to support the implementation of the Strategy.   </p>  <p>  With regard to the delivery of modular housing for homeless families across Dublin, Government has approved the delivery of 500 such units, the sites for which were selected by the relevant housing authorities on the basis of access to community infrastructure and services. It is intended to have the first 150 units delivered as quickly as possible in the Dublin City Council administrative area, with the City Council acting as the contracting authority.  The City Council expects the delivery of an initial 22 units by December, with a further 128 units to follow by late Quarter 1 2016 through a fast-tracked procurement process.  A further 350 units will then be provided across the four local authorities in the Dublin region through a national procurement framework overseen by the Office for Government Procurement, with expected construction on sites.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in 2014, my Department, in conjunction with Local Authority Planning Departments, carried out a national survey of all lands zoned for residential development in statutory local authority development plans and local area plans across Ireland. This exercise, The Residential Land Availability Study, determined the location and quantity of lands that may be regarded as being undeveloped and available for residential development purposes at 31st March 2014. The results of the survey indicated that there was 17,434 hectares of residential zoned lands nationally which could theoretically enable the construction of over 414,000 dwellings. Servicing of housing lands in terms of providing water services, energy and communications, transport, schools and community facilities and amenities involves a range of both public sector organisations and private sector companies. The Residential Land Availability Study operated at a national scale did not examine this level of detail. However, where infrastructure deficiencies exist, the local authority development plan or local area plans provide a framework for addressing such deficiencies through collaboration between the relevant authority, local communities, housing developers and relevant infrastructure providers.</p>  <p>  In relation to housing in the Dublin Region the Government published Construction 2020 &ndash; A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector (May, 2014) which included a commitment to establishing a Housing Supply Coordination Taskforce for Dublin with an immediate focus on addressing supply-related issues (Action 2 of the Strategy). This Task Force was convened by my Department and includes representatives of the four Dublin local authorities. The First Report of the Task Force undertook an analysis of planning applications for 20 housing units or more and concluded that across the four Dublin authorities there is land immediately available with planning permission for development of 12,785 houses and 7,925 apartments, equating to circa. 3 years supply. A further 25,507 units were deemed permissible in the immediate to short term.</p>  <p>  A further study of these zoned residential lands by the Task Force has examined infrastructural constraints and has identified specific infrastructural interventions possible to facilitate additional housing supply in the Dublin Region. These identified infrastructural requirements are intended to form the basis of future investments by Governmental and other infrastructure providers.</p>  <p>  I issued a draft Ministerial policy directive under section 29 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, to the four Dublin planning authorities on 29 October 2015 suggesting that they utilise all powers available to them under the provisions of section 179 of the Act, as appropriate, relating to local authority own development for the purpose of finding solutions to the urgent social housing situation presently faced and accelerating the delivery of social housing developments to address the urgent and increasing need for social housing accommodation in the region. This directive will come into effect following approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas. Thereafter, I will keep the operation of the Directive under review.   </p></reply>

The financial vehicle will be established to facilitate the aggregation of private investment into a fund for subsequent lending as project finance.  Work on the development of this new funding model is being progressed under the oversight of a group which has been put in place to develop the financial aspects of the Social Housing Strategy. This group - the Finance Work Stream - comprises a range of key stakeholders including the Housing Finance Agency, the National Development Finance Agency and the Departments of Finance and of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  Arising from the opportunity offered by the Strategy, a range of developers, investors, financiers and others expressed interest in being involved in the provision of social housing. A protocol was put in place in March 2015 under the auspices of the Finance Work Stream to facilitate individuals and entities seeking to engage with the State to provide investment for the delivery of social housing.  A single point of contact for submitting proposals was established - the Social Housing Proposals Clearing House Group - which operates through my Department, under the oversight of the Finance Work Stream.</p>  <p>  To date 24 different proposals have been received and 20 of the proposers have presented their ideas to the Clearing Housing Group.

Under the ESD, EU-wide emissions in the year 2013 should be no more than the average of those same emissions in the years 2008 to 2010.  Emissions in those three years were on average 4.5% below emissions in 2005.  In the year 2020, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20 per cent below their value in 2005.  This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.  The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020. </p><p>Taking account of methodological changes underpinning the GHG emissions inventories and projections (in line with evolutions in the accounting rules under the Kyoto Protocol second commitment period), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published in May 2015 new annual emission limits and projected emissions for 2020 compared to our target.  These calculations and projections indicate that Ireland&rsquo;s emissions in 2020 could be in the range of 9-14% below 2005 levels by 2020.  However, even in the worst case scenario (i.e. a 9% reduction), Ireland could be very close to meeting its cumulative compliance obligations for the period 2013-2020 (ESD 2009), which on average required a 12% reduction relative to 2005, given over-compliance in the early years of the 8-year period.</p><p>The projections infer that the likely cumulative outcome for the period will range between a small deficit (4Mt) and a small surplus (6Mt) of units for the period. In the event of a deficit arising , then compliance with the targets would be demonstrated by the use of the flexible mechanisms allowed for under the Effort Sharing Decision.  Having already demonstrated compliance with the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, Ireland holds in excess of 5Mt of units which are allowable for such purposes.</p><p>Furthermore, in October 2014, the European Council agreed on the 2030 climate and energy policy framework for the European Union.  The European Council endorsed a binding EU target of an at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990.  The target will be delivered collectively by the EU in the most cost-effective manner possible, with the reductions in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and non-ETS sectors amounting to 43% and 30%, respectively, by 2030 compared to 2005.</p><p>All Member States within the Union will participate in this effort, balancing considerations of fairness and solidarity.  While Member State targets for 2030 are yet to be agreed, it is known that targets will be in the range of a 0% to 40% reduction relative to 2005, and that targets for Member States whose GDP per capita isabove average should be adjusted to reflect cost effectiveness in a fair and balanced manner.  A Commission proposal on this matter is expected towards the end of the second quarter of 2016.</p><p>The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU commitments, is well understood by Government, as reflected in the <i>National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development</i>, published in April 2014, and in the <i>Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015,</i>recently passed by the D&aacute;il and currently at Committee Stage in the Seanad.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050.  Proposed statutory authority for the plans is set out in the <i>Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015</i>.</p><p>In anticipation of enactment of the planned legislation, work is already underway on developing a low carbon plan, the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.  The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020 but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that.  In this context, key sectors in the low carbon transition process (electricity, transport, built environment and agriculture) are currently developing sectoral mitigation measures in tandem with Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Appropriate Assessment (AA) processes during which measures will be further developed and prioritised.</p><p>To ensure a continued transparent and inclusive process, the <i>Strategic Environmental Assessment Scoping Report on the National Mitigation Plan</i>is currently out for consultation to both the general public and statutory consultees and the input received from these consultations willfurther inform the SEA process.</p></reply>

The Directive requires that certain minimum levels of monitoring are conducted for the purpose of assessment and management of air quality.  The EPA has responsibility for the monitoring of air quality in Ireland, and monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants, based on data obtained from the 31 monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network.</p><p>The EPA publishes an annual report on air quality, based primarily on the monitoring requirements of the CAFE Directive.  The most recent report, <i>Air Quality in Ireland 2014&ndash; Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality</i>, was published in September 2015 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2014, compared to the CAFE Directive standards, as well as assessments in relation to more stringent World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines for the protection of human health and the European Environment Agency (EEA) estimated reference levels.</p><p>I welcome the fact that no levels above the EU limit value were recorded at any of the ambient air quality network monitoring sites in Ireland in 2014, while noting that Ireland exceeds WHO air quality guideline values for particulate matter (PM) in some areas.  Particulate matter levels are of concern, particularly during the winter heating season in some areas where the sale of smoky coal is permitted.  Because of this, levels of particulate matter in smaller towns can often be similar to, or higher than, those in cities where the sale and use of smoky coal is banned.  To help protect our good air quality, consumers must become more aware of their choice in home heating fuel and the potential impact that this choice can have on air quality in their locality and on human health.</p><p>In respect of monitoring of water quality, the EPA, local authorities, Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Marine Institute all monitor rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters, and groundwater quality under the Water Framework Directive.  This extensive monitoring programme provides a good overview of current water quality and trends as they develop.</p><p>In its recently published <i>Water Quality in Ireland 2010-2012 report</i>, the EPA outlines the most recent results from this monitoring programme.  The report shows an improvement in the quality of Ireland&rsquo;s waters over the period in question.  However, the report also points out the key pressures which must be addressed in the context of the Water Framework Directive.  A copy of this report and other comprehensive reports on water quality compiled by the EPA are available for download at .</p><p>In accordance with the Water Framework Directive, these challenges are being addressed by the development of River Basin Management Plans.  Ireland is now preparing its second round of Plans which will be in place by the end of 2017.  A public consultation process which seeks views on what are the significant water management issues to be addressed in the second cycle of Plans will conclude on 18 December 2015.  Submissions received in response to this consultation, and further consultation in 2016 on draft River Basin Management Plans, will be taken into account in the preparation of the final Plans.</p></reply>

Moreover, the <i>National Waste Report 2012</i>, which sets out the latest annual data and which is available on the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s website, indicates that 40% of municipal waste was recycled in 2012: this compares with a 20.7% recycling rate ten years previously in 2002.  The report further highlights the fact that municipal solid waste (MSW) generation has decreased in the period 2006 to 2012, while the recovery of MSW generated has increased over the same period.</p><p>Government waste policy is predicated on the waste hierarchy as set out in the Waste Framework Directive and seeks to minimise the generation of waste.  A number of specific measures have been, and will continue to be, introduced to reduce the volume of waste generated in the State in line with Government policy.  Recent examples include the further roll-out of food waste collection services, and the introduction of three Regional Waste Management Plans in May 2015 which have a clear focus on waste prevention and resource efficiency.</p><p><i>Towards a Resource Efficient Ireland</i><i>- A National Strategy to 2020</i>, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following web link, , incorporates Ireland&rsquo;s National Waste Prevention Programme and sets out prio rities for preventing waste generation and the unnecessary consumption of materials, energy and water.  The title of this document reflects the shift in emphasis at national and EU level towards resource efficiency, as opposed to focussing purely on waste prevention.  In this regard, I intend to publish a consultation paper shortly on how the State can best maximise the value we extract from the waste we cannot prevent, especially in terms of maximising the job creation and energy potential of waste, while minimising our impact on the environment.</p><p>In relation to supporting higher rates of household recycling of various waste streams t he introduction of pay-by- weight as a collection permit condition as of 1 July 2015 and the forthcoming introduction of mandatory pay-by- weight charging for household waste in July 2016 and for commercial waste later in 2016 will be of central importance.  Pay-by- weight charging will provide clear continuous pricing incentives to households and businesses to not only prevent, but also to segregate their waste to the greatest possible extent, which will further stimulate the collection and processing of recyclables materials.  The additional availability of such material, such as food waste and recyclable plastic, provides an opportunity to the business sector and investors to exploit the potential of these resources.  In addition, pay-by-weight charging will not be applied to the separate collection of glass, further encouraging this type of collection.</p><p>Considerable progress is being made towards the virtual phasing out of landfill for municipal waste. 28 landfills were accepting municipal waste for disposal in 2009 but only 7 landfills are now accepting such waste in 2015.  While Ireland remains significantly reliant on export of our waste for treatment elsewhere, other domestic treatment facilities are coming on stream.  The active and expected capacity for the thermal recovery of municipal solid waste is set out in the three recently launched Regional Waste Management Plans for the 2015-2021.  The Plans support the development of up to another 300,000 tonnes of additional thermal recovery capacity in the State, including through the use of Solid Recovered Fuel in cement kilns; waste to energy; and pyrolysis.  Currently, there is one waste-to-energy facility operating in the State at Carranstown Co. Meath, with an active capacity of 220,000 tonnes.  The Dublin Waste-to-Energy plant under construction in Poolbeg has a pending capacity of 600,000 tonnes and is due to be fully operational in the second half of 2017.  Information regarding the management of residues from waste to energy facilities is set out in each individual plant&rsquo;s EPA licence, available on the EPA &rsquo;s website, .</p><p>As I have previously stated, Government policy is geared towards preventing waste in the first instance and then managing waste which cannot be prevented as a resource.  In this regard, the above measures I have outlined are among the many actions being undertaken to ensure that Ireland will be well positioned to meet the requirements of the new European Commission proposal on the Circular Economy, which is expected to be published in December 2015.</p></reply>

These draft revisions proposed:</p>  <p>-  the setting of a more stringent day and night noise limit of 40 decibels for future wind energy developments;</p>  <p>-  a mandatory minimum setback of 500 metres between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations; and</p>  <p>-  the complete elimination of shadow flicker between wind turbines and neighbouring dwellings.</p>  <p>A public consultation process was initiated on these proposed draft revisions to the Guidelines, which ran until February 21 2014.  My Department received submissions from 7,500 organisations and members of the public during this public consultation process. It is intended that the revisions to the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines will be finalised as soon as possible.  In this regard, account has to be taken of the extensive response to the public consultation in framing the final guidelines.  Further work is also advancing to develop technical appendices to assist planning authorities with the practical application of the noise measurement aspects of the Wind Guidelines.  My Department is advancing work on the Guidelines in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. </p>  <p>  The revisions to the Wind Energy Development Guidelines 2006, when finalised, will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.

The response of the Irish authorities to the case has two main elements - a general response addressing the structural or administrative deficiencies highlighted by the ECJ and, secondly, a response to the site-specific cases themselves.  In addition, certain other complaints or issues which had been taken against or raised with Ireland by the European Commission were subsumed under the case and were therefore part of a broader response which was required by Ireland to bring finality to the case.  This response has been delivered successfully leading to the recent closure of the case by the European Commission.  Remediation of the C-494/01 case sites was a requirement for the recent closure of the infringement proceedings.  Accordingly, several legacy licensed and unlicensed landfill sites have required remediation since the judgment and some others that have arisen in the interim which must be remediated over the course of the next few years for environmental, economic and reputational reasons. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s total expenditure to end 2014 on landfill remediation is &euro;71 million with a further allocation of &euro;8.5 million in Exchequer funding for 2015.  A significant proportion of this amount will go towards the remediation of the illegal landfill at Kerdiffstown, County Kildare. </p>  <p>  To prevent future recurrence of illegal dumping activities, my Department has introduced a series of measures in recent years that have improved and modernised Ireland&rsquo;s waste infrastructure and services.  These include the centralisation of the waste collection permitting system and trans-frontier waste shipment into single local authorities, the establishment of the Office for Environmental Enforcement (OEE) within the EPA, and the provision of dedicated funding from the Environment Fund for enforcement staff within local authorities. </p>  <p>  These reforms have been key to strengthening the Government&rsquo;s efforts to combat illegal dumping activity.  In addition, Cork County Council, Dublin City Council and Leitrim and Donegal County Councils (jointly) were recently announced as the new Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities.  They will be tasked with driving further performance improvements by individual local authorities in carrying out their waste enforcement functions and with ensuring consistency between local authorities.  Their work will be overseen by a National Steering Committee that will involve other regulatory bodies with a link to waste crime, including the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda Sioch&aacute;na.</p></reply>

My Department, together with other Government Departments have brought forward a number of measures and initiatives to incentivise urban development and renewal to assist in economic recovery, and these have been set out for the Deputy in replies to previous questions, including Question No. 37 of 23 April 2015.  Of most recent note is the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, which was commenced in September of this year, and provides for the introduction of a vacant site levy to encourage the development of vacant, underutilised sites in designated urban areas with a view to breathing life back into such areas, thereby addressing urban decay and bringing vacant sites forward for residential or regeneration use.</p><p>Supplementary to the vacant site levy, the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 amends Section 10(2) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, to provide that the current objective incorporated in local authority development plans for the &ldquo;development and renewal of areas in need of regeneration&rdquo; is broadened to provide that such objective should in future be for the explicit purposes of preventing:</p><p>- adverse effects on existing amenities in such areas;</p><p>- urban blight and decay;</p><p>- anti-social behaviour; or</p><p>- a shortage of habitable houses or land suitable for residential use or a mixture of residential or other uses.</p><p>This is intended to stimulate local authorities to adopt a more holistic approach in relation to urban decay and regeneration in the adoption of local development plans.</p><p>The management of stalled development in Naas is a matter for Kildare County Council in the first instance.  To this end, I am aware that Kildare County Council has recently joined in an urban partnership on the European <i>CityCentreDoctor</i>Project, involving an engagement with other European urban centres through URBACT <i>(a European exchange and learning programme which promotes sustainable urban development)</i>.  The broad aim of the project is to explore urban innovation from a creative evidence-based approach.  The project will allow local role players to benchmark Naas and investigate and prototype interventions and initiatives used in other towns throughout Europe.</p><p>This project is a key learning and participatory planning platform for Naas, and has the potential to play an important role in supporting the town&rsquo;s renewal.</p></reply>

To this end, local authorities have been given substantial powers under the Act in relation to any such sites, including powers to require specified measures to be taken in relation to a derelict site, to impose a levy on derelict sites, or to compulsorily acquire any derelict site.</p>  <p>  The administration of the Derelict Sites legislation at a local level is a matter for the relevant local authority.  While my Department updates, on an annual basis, a Schedule of Urban Areas in line with sections 4 and 21 of the Act, it is a matter for the relevant local authority to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas.  According to the most recent information held by my Department, which relates to 2013, there were 1,711 derelict sites on registers across the State.  Of these, 359 sites had been levied during 2013.  Information relating to 2014 is currently being collated by my Department.</p>  <p>  In terms of incentivising the development of empty and underutilised sites in central urban areas, the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 was enacted in September 2015.  Under the provisions of this Act, a levy will be charged on the registered owners of vacant sites in urban areas with a housing or a regeneration need.  The derelict site levy shall not be payable in respect of any land on which the vacant site levy will be payable. I anticipate that this levy will facilitate the achievement of the primary objective of bringing sites of this nature forward for residential or regeneration development.</p></reply>

In this regard, advice was sought on the possibility of legislative provision being made whereby a person substantially deprived of the enjoyment of their property, such as the deprivation of light caused by high trees on a neighbouring property, could apply to the Courts for an order, and that the Courts could make an order as they see fit, e.g. to cut the trees back to an appropriate height.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice responded in July 2012 suggesting that disputes of this nature between neighbours could perhaps be more appropriately dealt with through mediation &ndash; which is being increasingly used internationally as a tool for the resolution of civil disputes - rather than through the Courts.  In this regard, I understand that the Minister for Justice proposes to publish a Mediation Bill in due course.  Such mechanism, when introduced, should assist in speeding up the resolution of civil disputes of this nature, reduce legal costs and ameliorate the stress of contested court proceedings.</p></reply>

The current standards are contained in the 2008 Clean Air for Europe (CAFE) Directive (Directive 2008/50/EC) and the Fourth Daughter Directive (Directive 2004/107/EC of 15 December 2004).  These Directives also include rules on how Member States should monitor, assess and manage ambient air quality.</p><p>The EPA is tasked with co-ordinating and managing the monitoring programme.  Under the Directives, EU Member States must designate &quot;Zones&quot; for the purpose of managing air quality.  For Ireland, four zones were defined in the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2011.  The zones in place in Ireland in 2015 are Zone A: the Dublin conurbation, Zone B: the Cork conurbation, Zone C: comprising 23 large towns in Ireland with a population of more than 15,000 and Zone D: the remaining area of Ireland. Zones are amended primarily to take account of population trends emerging from census results.  The zones were last amended on 1 January 2013 to take account of results from the 2011 CSO Census and to align with the coal restricted areas set out in Regulations in 2012.</p><p>Ireland has a nationwide network of 31 monitoring stations which measure levels of air pollutants in the four zones.  This information is delivered to the public in near real-time at .</p><p>The numbers and locations of the monitoring equipment for each pollutant, including particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), are determined by the requirements of the Directives for ambient air monitoring in each zone.  Particulate matter is harmful to health and it is accepted among health officials that exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 should be reduced.  In cities, traffic emissions are the main source of particulate matter while in smaller towns, emissions from domestic solid fuel combustion are often the primary source.  The air quality in cities benefits from the ban on smoky coal, as well as the increased use of gas for residential heating.  The monitoring of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) is carried out at a representative number of monitoring locations in each of the four zones and meets the requirements of the CAFE Directive - it is not considered necessary to monitor for particulates at all 31 stations.</p><p>In April 2013, the EPA launched Ireland&rsquo;s new <i>Air Quality Index for Health</i>(AQIH).  This web-based index, developed in conjunction with the Health Service Executive and my Department (including Met Eireann), displays the current air quality across Ireland, by means of a coloured scale of 1 &ndash; 10, divided into four bands (good, fair, poor and very poor) with health advice provided for each band.  The AQIH is calculated hourly and is represented on a colour-coded map of Ireland, from which the public can easily assess information about current air quality in their area.  The Air Quality Index for Health can be viewed at .  The pollutants included in the index are: ozone; nitrogen dioxide; sulphur dioxide; PM10; and PM2.5.  To coincide with the launch of the Air Quality Index for Health, the EPA also launched a Twitter channel @EPAAirQuality, through which the public can receive tweets on the status of air quality in their region every day.</p><p>The EPA has commenced preparation of a draft national ambient air monitoring programme under Section 65 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (as amended) which will provide the basis and options for the continued development and expansion of the national ambient air monitoring network.  The development of the national ambient air monitoring programme will include a review of the adequacy of the current network for both determining compliance with European and national standards for air quality and for the provision of information to the public about local air quality.  Stakeholder consultation on the draft national ambient air monitoring programme will commence in April 2016.</p></reply>

It is intended to have the first 150 units delivered as quickly as possible in the Dublin City Council administrative area, with the City Council acting as the contracting authority.  The City Council expects the delivery of an initial 22 units by December and has issued a tender notice on this basis , with a further 128 units to follow by late Quarter 1 2016 through a fast-tracked procurement process.  A further 350 units will then be provided across the four local authorities in the Dublin region through a national procurement framework overseen by the Office for Government Procurement, with expected construction on sites by mid-2016.  This programme of modular housing provision is being implemented to mitigate the issues associated with an increasing volume of homeless families accommodated in inappropriate commercial hotel arrangements.  These units will provide emergency accommodation in the first instance, with each unit providing accommodation for a single household at a given time.  While the placement of individual households in these units is intended to be on a temporary basis, such placements will offer a greater level of stability than is possible in hotel accommodation, while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured.  Furthermore, such arrangements will facilitate more coordinated needs assessment and support planning for access to all required services, including welfare, health and housing services.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level.  Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities.  Accordingly, it will be a matter for the relevant housing authorities to ensure, as with any form of development, that the development of modular housing units comply with all regulatory obligations, including building control, fire safety requirements and planning.</p></reply>

Wood Mackenzie furnished their Final Report at end May 2014.</p><p>The principal recommendations made by Wood Mackenzie were as follows:</p><p>- For now Ireland should maintain a concession system, with industry rather than the State bearing the risk associated with investing in exploration;</p><p>- Going forward a form of production profit tax should continue to apply in Ireland, but for discoveries made under future licences the form of this tax should be revised;</p><p>- The tax should be charged on a field-by-field basis with the rate varying according to the profitability of the field and charged on each field&rsquo;s net profits;</p><p>- That the revised tax should include a minimum payment at a rate of 5% which would function like a royalty and would result in the State receiving a share of revenue in every year that a field is selling production;</p><p>- That the revised tax rates should be higher than the Profit Resource Rent Tax currently in place, thereby ensuring a higher share for the State from the most profitable fields. This would result in a maximum rate of 55% applying in the case of new licences, compared with a maximum rate of 40% under the current fiscal regime;</p><p>- That the corporation tax rate applying to petroleum production should remain at 25%; and</p><p>- there should be no retroactive change to the fiscal terms applying to existing authorisations.</p><p>Having received and considered Wood Mackenzie&rsquo;s comprehensive and detailed report the Government agreed that Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas fiscal terms should be revised along the lines recommended and implemented by way of the Finance Bill 2015. </p><p>The Bill introduces a new tax called the Petroleum Production Tax (PPT) which will apply in the case of petroleum authorisations first awarded after 18 June 2014 and replaces the Profit Resource Rent Tax introduced in the Finance Act 2008 in respect of such authorisations. </p><p>The PPT will apply on a field by field basis, calculated on a field&rsquo;s net income at a rate that is determined by reference to the profit ratio of the oil or gas field having regard to cumulative gross field revenues and field costs. </p><p>The legislation provides that:</p><p>- The PPT will be payable in addition to the existing 25% rate of corporation tax that applies to the profits from oil and gas production;</p><p>- The PPT payments will be deductible for the purposes of calculating the amount of corporation tax due;</p><p>- The operation of the PPT regime will result in a maximum marginal tax take on a producing field (combining the corporation tax and petroleum production tax) of 55%;</p><p>- Once a field starts producing oil or gas, a minimum PPT payment of 5% will be payable in each year of production on the gross revenue (net of transportation costs) of a field;</p><p>- The ultimate PPT amount due on each field will be determined on a sliding scale depending on the profitability of the field.</p><p>For future prospective licence holders a clear regime is being set out and the rationale for that regime has been explained.  This should further engender industry confidence in the stability and predictability of Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas fiscal terms and allow the industry to focus on effective and timely exploration effort.</p><p>Whilst we hope for more commercial discoveries, there is little point in speculating about potential revenues from commercial oil or gas fields that have yet to be discovered.</p></reply>

As I explained in my reply to the Deputy on the same issue (224 of 8 October 2015), decisions on the transport elements of the Capital Plan were framed by the conclusions reached in my Department&rsquo;s Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport.  Based on the findings in that report maintenance and renewal of the road network will continue to be the main priority over the next period and the bulk of the roads capital budget, over &euro;4 billion, is earmarked for such essential work with a further &euro;600 million allocated for implementation of the PPP road programme which is already underway.</p>  <p>  So while I recognised the need for some investment in new projects, the Ardee bypass was one of the projects that it was not possible to include given the overall funding envelope available.  Over the period of the Capital Plan funding for land transport, including roads, will be built up towards the levels needed to support adequate maintenance and development.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  While in the past it was possible to seek grant funding for road improvements under a Specific Grant Scheme, given the challenging financial climate, this grants scheme was curtailed from 2014 in order to maximise the funding available for repair and strengthening work on the existing road network.  In this context, it is important to reiterate that the purpose of Exchequer funding is to supplement local authorities' own resources.  In this context &euro;7.2 million in grant funding was provided to Monaghan County Council at the start of the year and an additional &euro;629,000 was provided in July.  There is sufficient flexibility within the grant programme for local authorities to focus expenditure on drainage works if they wish to do so. </p>  <p>  I have also been emphasising to local authorities the importance of prioritising expenditure on roads when allocating own resources, including revenue from Local Property Tax receipts.</p></reply>

Accordingly, funding will be made available under the new Capital Plan (2016-2022) for planning, design and construction of a new Metro North scheme, as detailed in the Fingal/North Dublin Transport Study, with a view to delivering the link by 2026/2027.</p><p>The NTA has recently published a draft Transport Strategy for Greater Dublin Area (GDA) which provides a framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services in the GDA for the next two decades.  For the purposes of the NTA transport strategy, Swords and Drumcondra are both located within a wider transport corridor which also includes Drogheda and Balbriggan in North Dublin.  In addition to the new Metro North project the eastern part of this transport corridor will benefit from the extension of the Dart to Balbriggan, which will also progress to construction stage under the new Capital Plan.</p><p>Given the demand projections in the corridor overall, I have requested the NTA to keep the capacity issues on the Swords/Airport/City Centre route under review.  In the draft GDA strategy the NTA indicates that bus-based measures will be considered for this part of the corridor with any final arrangement designed to be complementary to the new Metro North Project.  The question of funding does not arise until the proposed solution has been fully considered and decided on.​</p><p>The draft transport strategy for the GDA is subject to a statutory public consultation and all interested parties are invited to review the proposals, and the supporting documentation, on the NTA's website () and to make submissions to the Authority, before the deadline of Friday November 13 2015.</p></reply>

This decision demonstrates and acknowledges the historical importance of the site in a clear and substantive way and ensures that the long-term future of this historical landmark will be preserved and safeguarded. Bringing the monument into public ownership will also allow the development of a 1916 Commemorative Centre on the site.</p>  <p>  The legal steps to bring the national monument into my ownership as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht have been completed.  The issue of a compulsory purchase order did not arise. The purchase from the previous owner was effected with the assistance of NAMA and the consideration of &euro;4m was arrived at in the normal commercial manner.</p>  <p>  I am pressing ahead as a priority with arrangements to implement the Government&rsquo;s decision in full and I expect to make a further statement on the progress of the project in the coming days.</p></reply>
