    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-11a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101100070#WRA00600"><p>Since Ryanair announced that it had made a commercial decision to cancel or suspend flights on a number of routes across it European-wide network, officials from my Department have been in regular contact with all the relevant entities including Ryanair, the Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) and the Irish Aviation Authority.</p>  <p>  I have also been in direct contact with the airline&rsquo;s CEO and have expressed the Government&rsquo;s concerns at the disruption caused to passengers by these cancellations, and I will continue to engage with the CAR and the airline to ensure that all Irish passengers&rsquo; rights are upheld and that any possible impact upon them is minimised.</p>  <p>  The legal framework in relation to protection of air passenger rights in the event of cancellation, denied boarding and delay is set at European level and is governed by the provisions of EU Regulation 261 of 2004. This regulation provides for consumer protections which may include, depending on the circumstances arising, refund of airfares, re-routing either as soon as possible or at a later date at the passengers convenience, care and assistance and compensation. </p>  <p>  The Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) is the independent regulator for the enforcement of air passenger rights for flights out of Ireland, functioning as the national enforcement body for such matters. The CAR has been working directly with Ryanair since the announcements were made to ensure that the provisions of the regulation were correctly applied in respect of the passengers affected.  </p>  <p>  On Friday 29 September, CAR announced that it has secured agreement from Ryanair that it will comply with the regulations and directly provide affected customers with the necessary information on refunds, rerouting, care and assistance and compensation. Ryanair has also issued a public statement explaining to customers how and when they will be re-accommodated on other Ryanair flights or other airline flights as necessary. It is understood that Ryanair has also committed to provide weekly updates to CAR on the number of passengers entitled to compensation and expenses, the number of claims submitted and the number of claims closed-out.</p>  <p>  The Commission for Aviation Regulation is part of a close network of national enforcement bodies across the EU, including the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in UK. It is noted that Ryanair has also recently replied to the UK CAA agreeing to meet its requirement for customer clarification on Ryanair&rsquo;s obligations under regulation 261, which are in line with those requested by the CAR. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Commission for Aviation Regulation is working to ensure that passengers are dealt with efficiently and effectively to minimise disruption to affected customers and to ensure that their consumer rights are fully protected.</p>  <p>  As to the cause of the cancellations, that is a matter for Ryanair to clarify and it would not be appropriate to comment on commercial or operational decisions of a private company. Matters concerning staff relations, recruitment, remuneration and other terms of employment are a matter for the company and its employees. </p>  <p>  The cause of a flight cancellation is only subject to investigation by a national enforcement body where compensation is requested by passengers but contested by the air carrier. However where compensation is either non-applicable or the air carrier has agreed to pay same in compliance with its obligations, as is the case in this instance, further investigation is not undertaken by a national enforcement body as there is no legal basis to do so.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

I am aware of industrial disputes involving the company and workers at a rail franchise it holds in the UK.</p>  <p>  The Labour Relations Commission (LRC) recommendation of May 2015, accepted by all parties at that time, set out that in the event Dublin Bus were unsuccessful in the tendering competition that workers&rsquo; rights would be protected and that the NTA would ensure these were built into the contract with the winning bidder. Similarly, the NTA requires any transport operator who operates public transport services to act within the law, including relevant employment legislation. </p>  <p>  It was also made clear at the LRC discussions that over a 2 to 3 year period there would be sufficient growth within Dublin Bus to absorb any drivers affected by the loss of tendered routes if Dublin Bus were unsuccessful in the competition.  Due to this anticipated growth there will be no compulsory transfer of staff associated with the result of this tender competition.</p>  <p>  However, under the EC (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 (known as "TUPE") Dublin Bus employees may choose to automatically become employees of Go-Ahead on the same terms and conditions. It will be as if their contracts of employment had originally been made with the Go-Ahead. Thus employees&rsquo; continuity of employment would be preserved, as would their terms and conditions of employment under their contracts of employment. </p></reply>

Based on the findings in that report it is envisaged that maintenance and renewal of the road network will continue to be the main priority and the bulk of the roads capital budget, approximately &euro;4.4 billion, is earmarked for such essential work with a further &euro;600 million allocated for implementation of the PPP road programme which is already underway. Within the overall funding envelope there is, therefore, limited funding for road upgrade projects and it was not possible to include a range of projects in the Plan. </p>  <p>  As regards the possibility of funding as part of the Capital Plan Review, my Department made a strong case for additional funding, including for the further development of a project pipeline for national road schemes.  As Minister I have to work within the budget available to my Department.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the strategic and financial constraints outlined above, TII provided an allocation of &euro;1 million to Donegal County Council this year to progress planning work on priority national road improvement projects that were identified in a 2016 Needs Study Report on the TEN-T (Trans-European Transport Networks) Comprehensive Network in County Donegal. The comprehensive network includes the N14 Letterkenny to Lifford road, of which the Letterkenny Inner Relief Road, also known as Bonagee Link Road, is part. Based on the allocation provided in the Review as announced, I am pleased to say the Bonagee Link Road is now being progressed to design stage.  The question of funding for construction will be considered in the context of the ten year investment framework which is to be developed with the National Planning Framework. </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

For projects that fall within the parameters of the upcoming Greenways Strategy, I anticipate that recommendations regarding funding criteria will be set out in the Strategy when it is finalised.</p>  <p>  There is likely to be some cross-over in relation to Greenway projects within the Greater Dublin Area and the Regional Cities.  However this has yet to be determined and will form a crucial part of the work in finalising the Greenways Strategy.</p>  <p>  The East Coast Trail forms part of the Greenway Network of the Greater Dublin Area Cycle Network Plan, which was published by the National Transport Authority in 2014. The East Coast Trail includes an indicative route for a Greenway from Drogheda to Arklow, including a section from Balbriggan to Sutton. To date the only application made for funding to my Department for the route in Fingal has been for the Broadmeadow Estuary Greenway that would link Malahide to Donabate and Newbridge House. </p>  <p>  That application was not funded due to the cost of the project exceeding the funding available at that time. I understand that Fingal County Council has subsequently progressed their work on this project with funding from the National Transport Authority and expects to be in a position to submit an application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the coming months.</p>  <p>  Once the Greenways Strategy has been completed I expect to be in a position to announce a new round of funding for Greenways, which will be based on the criteria set out in the Strategy. Those projects that have planning permission in place will benefit from their ability to commence work quickly.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

Of course I recognise that subvention levels were reduced during the recession; most areas of public expenditure were. But PSO subvention is now increasing - last year Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann got 13% more than 2015. This year it will increase by a further 10%.  Overall Exchequer funding (PSO and capital investment) for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann this year will be over &euro;300m. But let me be equally clear, that in always focussing on the incremental increases in Budget lines, we can easily forget about the sheer size of taxpayers' money we're talking about. Between 2008 and 2016 the taxpayer has made over &euro;5 Billion available to the three CI&Eacute; companies across both PSO and Capital investment programmes. As taxpayers we need to be certain of the value for money for that level of expenditure.</p>  <p>  Just last week, my Department received the NTA's report about the submissions it received as part of the public consultation on the Rail Review Report 2016. As I have already stated, I will now consider the consultation report and I will then bring it to Government. It is my intention that the consultation report should be published by the NTA following consideration by Government. In advance of that, no decisions have been taken regarding matters such as the future of individual rail lines or investment in the company and its relevant infrastructure.</p></reply>

I am reflecting on the issues raised and whether there are reasonable measures within my power that could ameliorate the concerns expressed to me without causing adverse consequences to the tax payer or local communities.</p>  <p>  The statutory position which I as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport have is responsibility for overall policy in relation to roads.  The statutory powers to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors are vested in Transport Infrastructure Ireland or TII and as such there is no provision under legislation by which I, as Minister, could review toll charges, such as those on the M1.</p>  <p>  I am advised that in 2012, TII conducted a study of the implications of the removal of the tolls at the north-facing slip roads at M1 junction 9.  Two scenarios were considered. The first involved removing ramp tolls only and the second involved removing ramp tolls and increasing the mainline toll.</p>  <p>  The study concluded that significant levels of additional traffic would divert to local routes and that for both Scenarios there would be significant financial implications for TII through increased payments to the PPP company of up to &euro;7 million and that mainline tolls would have to be increased by up to 60%.  An update of the study in 2017 concluded that the findings are still valid and would increase in line with growth in traffic demand, year-on-year.</p>  <p>  TII is not in a position to underwrite the loss in income that would arise from a TII instruction for the removal of the ramp tolling at Donore interchange.  Given the need for ongoing investment in our transport infrastructure, I would not consider it reasonable for the State to pay this and the only possible course of action available to TII would be to increase mainline tolls.</p>  <p>  I would also point out that the aim of the Donore ramp toll plazas was to mitigate possible rat-running through local communities by those seeking to avoid the tolls on the M1 main line.  It is also important to recall that the toll scheme allows vehicles to exit and re-enter within three hours, with no further charge.</p></reply>

However, the persistent decline in the numbers visiting from Great Britain continues to be a concern. Growth from North America, Mainland Europe and other markets has allowed us to maintain upward momentum.</p>  <p>  Overseas marketing is vital for tourism. While recent tourism performance has been strong, research in our key overseas markets has indicated that Ireland&rsquo;s share of voice needs to be strengthened.   To that end, I have secured &euro;2m in Budget 2018 for digital investment in tourism marketing, both to help restore Ireland&rsquo;s share of voice vis-&agrave;-vis its competitors and also to develop growth from alternative markets. This is critical in the context of Brexit and the decline in visitors from Britain.</p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland and industry partners, working in collaboration with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, have implemented a series of actions in the GB market to address the implications of Brexit and the fall in the value of sterling.  For example, a greater focus has been placed on &lsquo;culturally curious&rsquo; visitors, who are less impacted by currency fluctuations and highlighting off-season breaks and value offers.  As well as this, Tourism Ireland is continuing its market diversification strategy. This aims to attract more visitors from markets which deliver longer stays and, therefore, higher revenue returns. The market diversification strategy, amongst other possible factors, has led to a significant increase in visitors from North America and other markets thus far in 2017. </p>  <p>  While my Department provides funding to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for investment in the provision of business and training supports, it is not directly involved in developing or managing these supports. This is a matter for the Board and Management of F&aacute;ilte Ireland. However, I am pleased to also have secured an increase in F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s current expenditure budget for 2018 and I am asking F&aacute;ilte Ireland to allocate some of this budget towards Brexit-related activities. </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland recently launched a new 'Get Brexit Ready' programme to provide tailored support to help Irish tourism businesses meet specific Brexit-related challenges.  The programme offers a suite of industry supports, designed to help businesses to respond to the loss of trade created by Brexit. It allows individual businesses to self-assess their exposures and risks and provides a range of interventions to match their needs.</p></reply>

This regulation provides for consumer protections which may include, depending on the circumstances arising, refund of airfares, re-routing either as soon as possible or at a later date at the passengers convenience, care and assistance and compensation. </p>  <p>  The Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) is the independent regulator for the enforcement of air passenger rights for flights out of Ireland, functioning as the national enforcement body for such matters. The CAR has been working directly with Ryanair since the announcements were made to ensure that the provisions of the regulation were correctly applied in respect of the passengers affected.  </p>  <p>  On Friday 29 September, CAR announced that it has secured agreement from Ryanair that it will comply with the regulations and directly provide affected customers with the necessary information on refunds, rerouting, care and assistance and compensation. Ryanair has also issued a public statement explaining to customers how and when they will be re-accommodated on other Ryanair flights or other airline flights as necessary. It is understood that Ryanair has also committed to provide weekly updates to CAR on the number of passengers entitled to compensation and expenses, the number of claims submitted and the number of claims closed-out.</p>  <p>  The Commission for Aviation Regulation is part of a close network of national enforcement bodies across the EU, including the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in UK. It is noted that Ryanair has also recently replied to the UK CAA agreeing to meet its requirement for customer clarification on Ryanair&rsquo;s obligations under regulation 261, which are in line with those requested by the CAR. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Commission for Aviation Regulation is working to ensure that passengers are dealt with efficiently and effectively to minimise disruption to affected customers and to ensure that their consumer rights are fully protected.</p>  <p>  As to the cause of the cancellations, that is a matter for Ryanair to clarify and it would not be appropriate to comment on commercial or operational decisions of a private company. Matters concerning staff relations, recruitment, remuneration and other terms of employment are a matter for the company and its employees. </p>  <p>  The cause of a flight cancellation is only subject to investigation by a national enforcement body where compensation is requested by passengers but contested by the air carrier. However where compensation is either non-applicable or the air carrier has agreed to pay same in compliance with its obligations, as is the case in this instance, further investigation is not undertaken by a national enforcement body as there is no legal basis to do so.</p></reply>

Estimates of expenditure 2018 are still being considered by Government in advance of the publication of the Abridged Estimates along with Budget 2018. </p>  <p>  On Budget Day last year, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced that a review of day-to-day Government spending would take place in advance of Budget 2018. The 2017 Spending Review is the first in a series of rolling selective reviews, which will cover the totality of Government spending over a three year period to 2019.  The results of the first year of this new approach were published with Mid-Year Expenditure Review and can be found on the www.per.gov.ie site.  My Department also provided a comprehensive and prioritised analysis of capital expenditure needs in the areas for which I have responsibility and this can be found on that site also. A new 10-year National Capital Plan which will complement the National</p>  <p>  Planning Framework Ireland 2040 will include both public consultation and input from my Department on infrastructure investment beyond the period of the current Capital Plan.</p>  <p>  Clearly as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I will endeavour to achieve the greatest level of funding to support continued and necessary investment. However, I am conscious that all members of Government should be prudent and operate within the State's existing financial constraints. Of course I also need to balance considerations like the need to spend in order to maintain the integrity of our transport infrastructure. Such maintenance expenditure is in itself an example of prudent financial management.  </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

A major overlay of the main runway is also well underway and is expected to be completed in Q2 2018.</p>  <p>  Work commenced on the North Runway project in late 2016 and substantial works have taken place to prepare the site and to realign and build new roads in the vicinity of Forrest Little and St. Margaret&rsquo;s Bypass. The procurement process for the main construction works is now underway. It is expected that the North Runway will be operational early in the next decade.</p>  <p>  The daa is also currently preparing a new Dublin Airport Masterplan which will establish a comprehensive planning framework to guide medium and longer term development of the airport campus. I understand that the Masterplan will be completed by the end of 2017. Preparations for daa&rsquo;s next Capital Investment Programme from 2020 to 2024 will be informed by the completed Masterplan.</p>  <p>  To ensure that Dublin Airport is prepared for the longer term, a Review of the Capacity Needs of Ireland's State Airports is now underway. The review will examine the capacity requirements to meet forecasted passenger throughput at the three airports to 2050 and identify priorities for infrastructure provision. In the case of Dublin Airport only, the study is expected to recommend the time frame for the development of new terminal capacity &ndash; Terminal 3 &ndash; and its appropriate design and optimum location as well as an assessment of the relative advantages and disadvantages of the funding and operation of Terminal 3 by the existing airport operator in comparison to being operated on an independent basis. </p>  <p>  I expect the review to be completed in early 2018 at which stage the longer-term future infrastructure needs of our three State Airports will be clearer.</p></reply>

Thus employees&rsquo; continuity of employment would be preserved, as would their terms and conditions of employment under their contracts of employment. </p></reply>

This regulation provides for consumer protections which may include, depending on the circumstances arising, refund of airfares, re-routing either as soon as possible or at a later date at the passengers convenience, care and assistance and compensation. </p>  <p>  The Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) is the independent regulator for the enforcement of air passenger rights for flights out of Ireland, functioning as the national enforcement body for such matters. The CAR has been working directly with Ryanair since the announcements were made to ensure that the provisions of the regulation were correctly applied in respect of the passengers affected.  </p>  <p>  On Friday 29 September, CAR announced that it has secured agreement from Ryanair that it will comply with the regulations and directly provide affected customers with the necessary information on refunds, rerouting, care and assistance and compensation. Ryanair has also issued a public statement explaining to customers how and when they will be re-accommodated on other Ryanair flights or other airline flights as necessary. It is understood that Ryanair has also committed to provide weekly updates to CAR on the number of passengers entitled to compensation and expenses, the number of claims submitted and the number of claims closed-out.</p>  <p>  The Commission for Aviation Regulation is part of a close network of national enforcement bodies across the EU, including the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in UK. It is noted that Ryanair has also recently replied to the UK CAA agreeing to meet its requirement for customer clarification on Ryanair&rsquo;s obligations under regulation 261, which are in line with those requested by the CAR. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Commission for Aviation Regulation is working to ensure that passengers are dealt with efficiently and effectively to minimise disruption to affected customers and to ensure that their consumer rights are fully protected.</p>  <p>  As to the cause of the cancellations, that is a matter for Ryanair to clarify and it would not be appropriate to comment on commercial or operational decisions of a private company. Matters concerning staff relations, recruitment, remuneration and other terms of employment are a matter for the company and its employees. </p>  <p>  The cause of a flight cancellation is only subject to investigation by a national enforcement body where compensation is requested by passengers but contested by the air carrier. However where compensation is either non-applicable or the air carrier has agreed to pay same in compliance with its obligations, as is the case in this instance, further investigation is not undertaken by a national enforcement body as there is no legal basis to do so.</p></reply>

We have jointly convened an interdepartmental Low-Emitting Vehicles (LEV) Task Force to consider a suite of potential measures to expedite the deployment of low carbon transport technologies.  We have also worked closely on the National Mitigation Plan, recently published by Minister Naughten which establishes a clear pathway towards Ireland's objective of a low-carbon and climate resilient economy by 2050.  Transport is one of the four key sectors identified for sectoral mitigation programmes.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, Ireland&rsquo;s international commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% below 2005 levels by 2020 is a national target, and not sectoral by nature.  Penalties for Member States failing to meet national carbon emission targets are under consideration at EU level and no determination has been made to date.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the transport sector must and will continue to play a strong role in contributing to our national emissions reduction effort. Our welcome return to economic growth has brought with it an increase in transport demand and, without intervention, transport emissions will unquestionably continue to rise. The transport sector is faced with the challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions without hindering social improvement or financial recovery.</p>  <p>  To decarbonise transport a diverse range of measures is required, key among them being increasing public transport capacity, promoting sustainable travel and modal shift, and encouraging the uptake and deployment of cleaner alternative fuels and technologies. This is reflected in the wide-ranging set of transport mitigation measures included in the National Mitigation Plan and it is anticipated that these measures will develop further as climate research and technological innovations progress.</p>  <p>  In suitable urban areas I am strongly committed to meeting increasing travel demand through enhanced public transport capacity and encouraging more cycling and walking journeys and, within the context of the Government's budgetary policy and competing expenditure needs, I am working to be able to invest more in such infrastructure and services over time. </p>  <p>  The Deputy might note that in relation to public transport fare setting, the powers afforded to the National Transport Authority are statutory in nature and, as Minister, I do not have any function in fare determinations. </p>  <p>  Outside urban areas - where dependence on private cars is strongest and where systems of public transport and active travel offer less realistic potential to addressing travel needs effectively and efficiently - a different solution must be sought, and here alternative fuels and technologies currently offer the most feasible and cost-effective answer. </p></reply>

This regulation provides for consumer protections which may include, depending on the circumstances arising, refund of airfares, re-routing either as soon as possible or at a later date at the passengers convenience, care and assistance and compensation. </p>  <p>  The Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) is the independent regulator for the enforcement of air passenger rights for flights out of Ireland, functioning as the national enforcement body for such matters. The CAR has been working directly with Ryanair since the announcements were made to ensure that the provisions of the regulation were correctly applied in respect of the passengers affected.  </p>  <p>  On Friday 29 September, CAR announced that it has secured agreement from Ryanair that it will comply with the regulations and directly provide affected customers with the necessary information on refunds, rerouting, care and assistance and compensation. Ryanair has also issued a public statement explaining to customers how and when they will be re-accommodated on other Ryanair flights or other airline flights as necessary. It is understood that Ryanair has also committed to provide weekly updates to CAR on the number of passengers entitled to compensation and expenses, the number of claims submitted and the number of claims closed-out.</p>  <p>  The Commission for Aviation Regulation is part of a close network of national enforcement bodies across the EU, including the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in UK. It is noted that Ryanair has also recently replied to the UK CAA agreeing to meet its requirement for customer clarification on Ryanair&rsquo;s obligations under regulation 261, which are in line with those requested by the CAR. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Commission for Aviation Regulation is working to ensure that passengers are dealt with efficiently and effectively to minimise disruption to affected customers and to ensure that their consumer rights are fully protected.</p>  <p>  As to the cause of the cancellations, that is a matter for Ryanair to clarify and it would not be appropriate to comment on commercial or operational decisions of a private company. Matters concerning staff relations, recruitment, remuneration and other terms of employment are a matter for the company and its employees. </p>  <p>  The cause of a flight cancellation is only subject to investigation by a national enforcement body where compensation is requested by passengers but contested by the air carrier. However where compensation is either non-applicable or the air carrier has agreed to pay same in compliance with its obligations, as is the case in this instance, further investigation is not undertaken by a national enforcement body as there is no legal basis to do so.</p></reply>

There is however a need for the OCI to continue progress on its corporate governance reform agenda in the months ahead, and to address, as much as is possible, the legacy issues arising from the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. To that end, I have requested Sport Ireland to commence an engagement with the OCI. My Department will be keeping abreast of developments in this matter over the coming months.</p></reply>

This means that over &euro;285 million will be allocated via the National Transport Authority (NTA) in 2018 to support the continued delivery of these socially necessary but financially unviable services that have grown in recent years, and to facilitate some further expansion including the commencement next year of the planned roll-out of bus market opening.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has asked about the proposed 2018 PSO allocations to individual companies.  As is normal, the precise allocations to the companies will be decided by the NTA in exercise of its statutory mandate and in accordance with the various contract arrangements that it has in place with PSO service providers.</p>  <p>  Finally, I am sure the Deputy will agree that the PSO is a large expenditure area, and one which requires careful scrutiny to ensure the taxpayer receives value for money in respect of the services delivered given the considerable expenditure incurred.</p></reply>

Going down the secondary legislation route &ndash; which as I have said before is how EU regulations are normally implemented &ndash; is evidently no longer appropriate or sensible in this instance.  </p>  <p>  I have already instructed my Department to re-engage with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, as a matter of urgency.  There are a number of options.  I will talk to my two Cabinet colleagues, and once there is a decision on an alternative I will advise the Deputy and the House.  </p>  <p>  In light of this advice, I am now of the view that the best interests of all stakeholders - including the IAA, Dublin Airport and the local residents - that responsibility for the Regulation is better housed elsewhere.  I intend to consult further on this matter and will advise the Deputy and the House as soon as I have come to a decision.</p></reply>

The second is the Brexit Start to Plan Voucher, which offers up to &euro;2,000 towards professional advice in relation to Brexit matters.  </p>  <p>  In Tuesday's Budget, I announced a new Brexit Loan Scheme which will provide affordable working capital financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit, or will be in the future. The new Scheme will be delivered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) through commercial lenders to get much needed working capital into Irish businesses. </p>  <p>  The new Brexit Loan Scheme aims to make up to &euro;300 million available to businesses of up to 499 employees. The scheme will be open both to development agency clients and those businesses that do not have any relationship with State Agencies.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also exploring the development of a longer-term Business Development Loan Scheme which would assist firms in long term investing for a post-Brexit environment. </p>  <p>  The 2017 Action Plan for Jobs has also identified a range of actions to facilitate the resilience of Irish businesses in anticipation of Brexit.  Seventeen actions are aimed at promoting market diversification, improving competitiveness, realising opportunities in foreign markets and attracting research and innovation talent to Ireland.  Three actions focus on the specific sectors of agri-food and tourism which is a very important aspect of cross border trade. All twenty actions will be of benefit to the border region with one of them (Action 13) focusing on delivering economic growth and jobs through the North-South Council and outreach activities.</p>  <p>   The North East/North West Regional Action Plan for Jobs is a key policy response, in the context of Brexit, for supporting employment growth in the Border region. The Plan aims to deliver 28,000 extra jobs in the counties of Cavan, Monaghan, Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal and Louth by 2020. The Plan is stimulating job creation across the region by facilitating collaborative initiatives between the public and private sector. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland also continues to support companies, including their many clients in the border counties, on a one to one basis to enhance their competitiveness and capability and build on their success in existing and new markets. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo;, a new interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit, is available on www.prepareforbrexit.ie.  This tool is a starting point for SME management teams looking to develop an action plan to help mitigate risks and leverage opportunities which may arise from Brexit. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Local Enterprise Offices the LEOs are hosting information events around the country for core and non-core clients. These sessions enable companies learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit, and to engage in a process of strategic planning to ensure their companies have a robust strategy in place. </p>  <p>  The LEOs are also now offering a Technical Assistance for Micro-exporters (TAME) grant, designed to help LEO clients to find new markets and exports by part-funding expenditure incurred investigating and researching export markets.</p>  <p>  The six LEOs in the Border region are also working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme.  The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradable services sectors in the regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Lean4Micro programme was designed to encourage clients to adopt Lean business principles in their organisation to increase performance and competitiveness. </p></reply>

Revenue obtains the information relating to the amount of tax that is &lsquo;held under appeal&rsquo; from its IT systems. Outstanding tax liabilities are automatically identified by the presence of an appeal stop marker that is input to suspend the collection of the disputed tax pending the determination of the appeal. This information is contained in Revenue&rsquo;s &lsquo;stop 16&rsquo; database. However, not all appeals involve an outstanding tax liability requiring the input of an appeal stop marker. A second &lsquo;non-stop 16&rsquo; database contains such appeals. The information on this second database must be entered manually by Revenue caseworkers. In addition to the outstanding tax balance obtained from Revenue&rsquo;s IT systems, caseworkers are also required to enter on both databases what they consider to be the amount in dispute in a particular appeal. This may differ from the outstanding tax liability where an appellant has made a &lsquo;protective&rsquo; payment in case he or she loses the appeal. This disputed amount figure may not be an outstanding tax liability as such but could be the amount that Revenue may potentially have to repay or forgo should it lose the appeal. </p><p>The information contained in the databases is captured at a particular point in time and is not retrospective or cumulative. It is constantly changing as appeals are finalised either by determination by the Tax Appeals Commission or the Courts or by agreement with Revenue, and as new appeals are received.</p><p>An appeal against an appealable matter may relate to a number of tax periods in respect of the same issue.  Each of these is counted as an individual appeal in the tables below.</p><p>In relation to the number and value of tax appeals in each tax district and division, Revenue has provided this information at a divisional level and not the much more detailed tax district level as it was not possible to do so in the limited time available.  The following table shows the number of appeals with an outstanding tax liability (&lsquo;stop 16&rsquo; database) and the amount of that tax liability allocated to the relevant Revenue divisions.  <table><tr><th>Division</th><th>No. of appeals</th><th>Amount held under appeal (&euro;)</th></tr><tr><td>Border Midlands West</td><td>519</td><td>64,685,230</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>829</td><td>166,914,457</td></tr><tr><td>East Southeast</td><td>578</td><td>38,249,260</td></tr><tr><td>Large Cases Division</td><td>900</td><td>840,385,025</td></tr><tr><td>Local Property Tax</td><td>&amp;lt;10</td><td>87</td></tr><tr><td>Southwest</td><td>1,211</td><td>43,214,713</td></tr><tr><td>Totals</td><td>4,040</td><td>1,153,448,772</td></tr></table></p><p>The following table shows the number of appeals with an outstanding tax liability (&lsquo;stop 16&rsquo; database) and the amount of that tax liability broken down by taxhead. <table><tr><th>Taxhead</th><th>No. of appeals  Amount held under appeal (&euro;)</th><th>Amount held under appeal (&euro;)</th></tr><tr><td>CGT</td><td>182</td><td>121,975,064</td></tr><tr><td>CT</td><td>239</td><td>172,655,822</td></tr><tr><td>IT</td><td>3,130</td><td>346,557,489</td></tr><tr><td>PAYE</td><td>188</td><td>233,896,324</td></tr><tr><td>VAT</td><td>202</td><td>174,165,036</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>99</td><td>104,199,037</td></tr><tr><td>Totals</td><td>4,040</td><td>1,153,448,772</td></tr></table></p><p>The amount estimated to be in dispute in relation to these 4,040 appeals is &euro;1,179,006,96.</p><p>In relation to those appeals not involving an outstanding tax liability (&lsquo;non-stop 16&rsquo; database), there are an additional 520 appeals accounting for a disputed amount of &euro;494,134,885. </p><p>The following table contains information relating to all open appeals by taxhead, the year in which an appeal was made and giving the range of tax years for all appeals in that category.

The report is being considered by the OPW and its technical advisers.  The OPW would note that the report addresses the estimated cost of the particular tidal barrier design proposal put forward by &ldquo;savecorkcity&rdquo; rather than being a report by HR Wallingford on its own consideration of the potential for and design of a tidal barrier. </p>  <p>  From a preliminary review of the Wallingford report, the OPW notes that it lacks detail on cost breakdowns and  does not adequately address some fundamental issues such as navigation requirements within Cork harbour or the environmental constraints which would arise due to the proximity of Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) and Special Protection Areas (SPA) in the Harbour and which would be very difficult to overcome.  It is also noted that the report sets out the project costs at &euro;165m rather than the figure of &euro;140m being quoted in the media.</p>  <p>  In addition, the report does not include for any measures to deal with the fluvial flooding problem which exists through the City up to Inniscarra dam, all of which would still be required even if a tidal barrage was constructed. </p>  <p>  As part of the public consultation process on the Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme, the OPW is committed to producing a comprehensive report on the costs surrounding the potential for a tidal barrier in Cork and this report is currently being finalised by our consultants. Its preliminary findings confirm the previously advised position of the OPW that a tidal barrier is not currently viable and would in fact, cost many times the figures being put forward by the &ldquo;savecorkcity&rdquo; group. OPW with its technical advisers will also, as part of this process, undertake a cost estimate of the &ldquo;savecorkcity&rdquo; proposal. </p></reply>

The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans. The catchment area referred to is part of the North Western &ndash; Neagh Bann (NW-NB) CFRAM Study.</p><p>There has been extensive public consultation and people&rsquo;s observations are helping to finalise the Flood Risk Management Plans for Killybegs. Consultation on the maps took place in March 2015, with a further consultation on the options in March 2016 and consultation on the draft plans in October 2016.</p><p>Subject to approval, the preferred measure for Killybegs consists of a series of floodwalls and road raising. These hard defences will provide a Standard of Protection of 1% AEP* for fluvial flood events and 0.5% for coastal flood events, at a total length of 1.3km and an average height of 1m. This option will provide protection to approximately 24 properties at risk of fluvial flooding, 40 properties at risk of coastal flooding and 5 properties at risk of wave overtopping, includes Bridge Street. The Killybegs Flood Relief Scheme will be subject to project-level public consultation and assessment before proceeding.</p><p>These final Plans are currently undergoing an independent review of the strategic level environmental assessments by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Once this independent review of all Plans is completed and observations addressed, the final Plans will be formally submitted to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for approval, in accordance with the statutory requirements.</p><p>I would hope by the end of this year to seek approval for the final Plans developed under the CFRAM process and thereafter to announce the proposed structural measures contained within those Plans that will protect communities and properties assessed.</p><p>Following our conversation in recent days, and as part of my upcoming visit to Donegal,  I would be happy to see the above areas for myself.</p><p>*AEP (Annual Exceedance Probability) </p><p>The probability, typically expressed as a percentage, of a flood event of a given magnitude being equalled or exceeded in any given year.

In the occupied Syrian Golan, as in the West Bank, the introduction and settlement of communities of the occupying power, to alter the demography of the area, is illegal under international law.  The process of establishing settlements inevitably involves violations of the rights of the occupied population, through seizure of their land, discriminatory treatment and other restrictions. Tactics including planning laws, zoning, military use, national parks etc. are used by the Israeli authorities to advance this process under a cloak of legality. None of these measures can alter the fact that the whole process is illegal.   The Government has consistently and repeatedly conveyed these concerns to the Israeli authorities, and highlighted them in our interventions at EU, UN and international level. In addition, I raised these concerns directly in the context of my visit to Israel and Palestine in July, which was the first visit I made outside Europe after taking office. I will continue to avail of every appropriate opportunity to pursue these issues. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns over these policies are most acute in relation to the West Bank, where the continued construction of settlements on occupied land is dangerously undermining the prospects for a peace agreement and the establishment of a Palestinian state, and this has been the focus of my international engagement on the settlements issue.  By contrast, it is generally acknowledged that any comprehensive peace between Israel and the Arab states will involve the return of the Golan area to Syria. This does not lessen the obligation on Israel to treat the community there in accordance with international law so long as the occupation remains in being.</p></reply>

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention.</p>  <p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland. Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification. </p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has reformed Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  </p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and completed Second Stage in February 2017.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).   Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of deprivation of liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015. </p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that ratification of the UNCRPD remains a very high priority for me as Minister. </p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. </p><p>This plan is progressing apace. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware Douglas Garda Station is located in the Togher Garda District which forms part of the Cork City Division. I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Cork City Division, on 31 August 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 656, of whom 115 members are assigned to the Togher Garda District. There are also 44 Garda Reserves and 64 civilians attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner, that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 32 of whom have been assigned to the Cork City Division. I am also informed that another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I was pleased to announce yesterday that I have secured funding to provide for the recruitment of another 800 new Garda recruits in 2018, which will ensure that the planned Garda strength of 15,000 by 2021 remains on course.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Cork City Division in the coming years. </p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.  <b></b></p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the number of Garda&iacute; allocated to Douglas Garda Station in each of the years 2007 to 2016 and as of 31 August 2017, is as set out in the table below.</p><p>Douglas Garda Station 2007 - 2017<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Strength</th></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>2017*</td><td>19</td></tr></table></p><p>*Up to 31 August 2017</p></reply>

In approximately 75% of all cases the ward&rsquo;s committee is a family member or a trusted friend. However, if no suitable or willing relative or friend is available, or if there is a conflict of interest between the ward and the person who would otherwise have been appointed, the President of the High Court can appoint the General Solicitor for Minors and Wards of Court to act as committee. </p>  <p>  The General Solicitor is the committee in the case referred to by the Deputy.  The fact that one is a relative of another person does not, of itself, give one the right to be informed of the financial position of that other person, whether he/she is a ward of court or not. It is, however, open to a family member to apply to be appointed as a committee of a ward by writing to the Office of the General Solicitor.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised that detailed statements providing comprehensive financial information are issued to committees on request and a process of issuing high level financial statements to all committees has now commenced and that such statements will issue automatically on an annual basis. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has also informed me that the committee of a ward is involved with the Office of Wards of Court on an ongoing basis in establishing the expenditure needs of a ward.  A case officer is appointed to manage the affairs of each ward who is available to meet with the committee initially to discuss the needs and financial arrangements for the ward and is available thereafter as required.  Significant purchases or sales such as the sale of a house or lands will not take place without the involvement of the committee. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the legislation governing persons who are wards of court dates back to 1871.  It has been recognised for some time that reforms were needed to update the law in this area and so the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 has been introduced to provide a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. </p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act are brought into operation.  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing.</p></reply>

Ireland has met its commitment to formally pledge for 1,089 people from Greece by 26 September 2017. 587 of the allocation are already in the State. A further 428 have been assessed and are awaiting transport arrangements, with 34 persons due for arrival later this week. Hundreds more are due to arrive in the coming months.  Sufficient missions to fill any quota remaining under this strand of the Programme will be scheduled with the Greek authorities.  </p>  <p>  By early 2018, Ireland will have admitted its entire cohort from Greece under the relocation programme (1,089) and will have admitted double our original commitment of 520 under the European Commission&rsquo;s July 2015 Resettlement scheme (1,040). Relocation from Italy has not proven possible within the two-year timeframe of the relocation programme, due to a refusal by the Italian authorities to allow security assessments of candidates on its soil. </p>  <p>  Ireland is doing everything it can to give effect to the EU relocation Decisions but as can be seen, these Decisions are unlikely to yield the anticipated numbers for reasons entirely outside of Ireland&rsquo;s control. </p>  <p>  The Irish Refugee Protection Programme is working to ensure that all persons selected for relocation and resettlement are transported to Ireland as soon as possible. Officials are currently undertaking a full review of the IRPP to ensure progress continues, with a view to establishing how best Ireland&rsquo;s remaining obligations might be met and through what channels. The IRPP is on target to fulfil its commitments to Greece. Ireland expects to be an active participant in current and future pledges in respect of refugees and other vulnerable persons in need of protection. The determination of the Government to deliver on our targets remains absolute.</p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy of the continued commitment to develop services in both Hospitals, including those for patients with diabetes.</p>  <p>  Adult diabetes services at Letterkenny are currently provided by a consultant endocrinologist, supported by a locum consultant general physician with a diabetic interest.  In order to address waiting lists, additional clinics are provided on a monthly basis.  Further, the Saolta Healthcare Group has advised that it is making applications for approval of a second consultant endocrinologist and an advanced nurse practitioner post in insulin pump therapy, to serve both adult and paediatric patients. </p>  <p>  With regard to paediatric diabetes services, an insulin pump therapy service commenced at Sligo University Hospital in early 2015, with outreach clinics delivered at Letterkenny. However, in mid-April the consultant paediatrician with a special interest in paediatric diabetes post in Sligo became vacant and the Saolta Healthcare Group has advised that it is actively engaged in recruiting a replacement. </p>  <p>  Pending completion of the recruitment process, consultant paediatricians at Sligo and Letterkenny Hospitals have undertaken additional training and development to maintain provision of the paediatric insulin pump therapy services at both Hospitals. Further, additional support to these services has now been arranged with another Consultant, currently practising within the Saolta hospitals.</p>  <p>  Provision of a Diabetes Centre at Sligo Hospital is included in the Capital Plan and HSE Estates advises that planning permission for this Centre has been granted with construction scheduled to commence by year end 2017 and to be completed by Q3 2018.</p>  <p>  I met with the Donegal Branch of Diabetes Ireland, the HSE and the Saolta Healthcare Group on 28 June 2017 to discuss the current challenges and future development of diabetes services in the North West and remain committed to progressing the development of diabetes care in the North West.</p></reply>

Equally, these regulations in no way diminish the responsibility or the importance of people continuing to carry the medicines that they need to manage their own health needs.</p>  <p>  In order for an organisation to avail of an emergency medicine without the need for a prescription, they must first register with the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) and undergo a training course accredited by the Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC). </p>  <p>  This register is publically available through the Emergency Medicines Portal on the HPRA website and can be found at: www.hpra.ie/homepage/medicines/emergency-medicines/emergency-medicines-search/results.</p>  <p>  There is currently a total of 14 organisations, and 21 accountable persons, listed on the register for Emergency Medicines.  Each organisation may register more than one site and more than one accountable person. </p>  <p>  Prescription only medicines (POMs) are so designated because there are safety concerns about these medications. The administration of a POM should not be done lightly and should only occur following appropriate training. A decision to undergo training on the use and administration of an emergency medicine rests with individual organisations.</p>  <p>  Schools can obtain additional information on the management of anaphylaxis from organisations such as the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, which has published guidelines for teachers on its website; one section of these guidelines deals specifically with the management of anaphylaxis at school. The provision of training to teachers is a policy matter for the Department of Education and Skills.</p></reply>

Though petrol and diesel road vehicles have met progressively tighter EU emission limits since the early 1990s, a number of factors, including the increase in road traffic volumes and changes to the ratio of diesel to petrol vehicles, mean that the air pollution impact from road transport still presents a significant challenge.</p>  <p>  The diesel emissions scandal in 2015 highlighted a number of regulatory shortcomings in EU legislation, most notably that the current emissions test cycle in the EU is not representative of actual &ldquo;on road&rdquo; real driving conditions.  To address these issues the EU has adopted a revised emissions test cycle that incorporates elements of real world driving.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is the Type Approval Authority in Ireland and issues approval for a number of vehicle types (including for vehicle emissions) which is valid across the EU. </p>  <p>  There are no plans to ban diesel, but my Department has commenced work on the first ever National Clean Air Strategy which will provide an overarching strategic policy framework within which clean air policies can be formulated and given effect in a manner consistent with national, EU and international policy considerations and priorities.  The Clean Air Strategy will address priority air pollutants in Ireland, including diesel emissions, in an integrated manner. </p></reply>

The Warmer Homes scheme provides energy efficiency upgrades completely free of charge to people who meet the eligibility criteria. Up until my announcement, the scheme focused on relatively shallow interventions such as attic and cavity wall insulation, low energy lightbulbs, lagging jackets and energy advice.     </p>  <p>  Following my announcement in March, every person who applies to the Warmer Homes scheme has their home surveyed by a professional contractor working on behalf of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). When those surveyors find an applicant who is living in a home that is in a particularly poor condition they will recommend the person for a deeper set of measures. When assessing a home for deeper measures the surveyors will look at factors such as the primary heating method, the construction method and the age of the home. For example, homes will be assigned deeper measures where there is no central heating, or only an open fire or a G rated boiler. If the boiler is G rated, the home must also have been constructed with solid wall or hollow block and been built pre-1978. </p>  <p>  I would like to make these deeper renovations available on a wider basis but deep energy efficiency interventions can cost many times that of shallower interventions so I must attempt to find a balance between the depth of the renovations that the scheme can offer and the number of people the scheme can help each year. By the end of this year, SEAI expect to have completed up to 500 of these deeper renovations. </p>  <p>  I also spoke about the Warmth &amp;amp; Wellbeing scheme. The Warmth and Wellbeing scheme is a pilot initiative being delivered under the Government&rsquo;s Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty and the Healthy Ireland Framework. The main aim of the scheme , which began in 2016, is to demonstrate the positive effects that making homes warmer and more energy efficient can have on the health and wellbeing of people in energy poverty who are living with a chronic respiratory condition. An independent research project will assess the impact the scheme is having. At the conclusion of the scheme and with independent evidence on its effectiveness, the potential for a wider rollout will be considered.</p>  <p>  In total, 276 homes have been upgraded so far under the scheme and surveys and works are underway on another 262 homes. Recruitment of participants will continue over the winter months and those people will have their upgrades carried out as early as possible in 2018, as this type of work cannot always take place during the winter. </p>  <p>  I will have allocated at least &euro;20m in funding to this programme by the end of 2018 to provide for the upgrade of at least 1,500 homes. This is the minimum size needed to develop the evidence base on the impact on the health outcomes of participants of making their homes more energy efficient and warmer, and make the business case for a wider rollout of the scheme.   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-11a.466.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101100077#WRH05200"><p>Sections 17 and 18 of the Youth Work Act 2001 provide for the appointment of a National Youth Work Advisory Committee.  The Committee had an advisory and consultative role to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in matters to do with youth work, including the coordination of youth work programmes and services. In line with these provisions, a new National Youth Work Advisory Committee was appointed by the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with a term of office of one year with effect from 28 January 2013.   The Committee had its final meeting on 26 November 2013.  The Committee continued to work with my Department and assisted with the development of the new National Youth Strategy, in particular in identifying in what ways the youth work sector can contribute to shared policy objectives for young people. </p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy 2015-2020 was published in, 2015. The implementation structures established by my Department under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures (BOBF), the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People oversee the roll out of the National Youth Strategy. There is no doubt that the youth work services have a significant contribution to make to realise the goals of the National Youth Strategy as part of a cross sectoral, whole of society approach to supporting young people in their everyday lives.  For this reason, the key youth sector interests are represented on the structures established by my Department to support the implementation of Better Outcomes Brighter Futures. At national level, representatives of the voluntary youth services have been appointed to the Advisory Council of BOBF. At local level, youth sector representatives participate in the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Services Committees. Key Government departments and agencies that have an interest in children and young people and that had served on the National Youth Work Advisory Committee are represented on the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Consortium and on the Sponsors Group that have been established under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures to drive the effective implementation of the policy framework. </p>  <p>  There have been other significant policy and legislative developments that are relevant to the provision of youth services and the role of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee since the 2001 Act was passed. These include the introduction of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 which, inter alia, provides for a statutory function for Education and Training Boards in supporting the provision and assessment of youth work services at local level.  The National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-making 2015-2020, which was published by my Department in June, 2015 is particularly relevant. I am deeply committed to ensuring that young people are involved in the preparation, planning and implementation of policies that impact on their lives. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is fully committed to the reform of the many youth funding schemes. The Deputy will be aware that a number of targeted funding schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review in 2014. The review made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead. Work on the development of a new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department and consultations with youth services are continuing with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the review. The Deputy will also be aware that my Department has commenced a review of the Youth Service Grant Scheme. This review is intended to enhance its accountability, transparency and outcome measurement.  It is also seeking to determine how best to meet the ever evolving needs of young people. </p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the youth work sector, the voluntary youth services, the Education and Training Boards, other government departments and agencies and consults with young people themselves in the development and delivery of policies and services for children and young people. </p>  <p>  For the above reasons, it is not my intention to reconvene the National Youth Work Advisory Committee while the reform process is ongoing. Given the seismic changes which have occurred over the past sixteen years, my Department will be revisiting the Youth Work Act, 2001 on the conclusion of the reform process, to ensure that it fully articulates the needs of young people in Ireland. </p></reply>

Capital Funding is made available by my Department on an annual basis at varying levels for particular projects.</p>  <p>  For example, the Early Years Capital 2017 programme focused on creating new childcare places as well as increasing the quality of existing childcare facilities. To achieve this, &euro;8.4 million was allocated to Early Years Capital funding for 2017. Among other things, Early Years Capital 2017 made available funding for the creation of new childcare places and for the improvement and maintenance of existing childcare facilities, under Strands One and Two respectively of its programme for delivery. The 2017 cycle is well underway with the application deadline of 24th April 2017 and results announced in early July 2017.</p>  <p>  I can inform you that the Early Years Capital 2018 programme is at present under development, the details of which will be announced later this year.

While I cannot commit to funding specific organisations, I would invite all interested and eligible providers to submit an application once the Early Years Capital 2018 programme is launched.</p></reply>

In 2018, Tusla will have available to it some &euro;753 million in funding, representing an increase of &euro;40.6 million, or 5.7%, over 2017.  The precise details of funding for Family Resource Centres will be considered by Tusla in developing its 2018 Business Plan, based on the Performance Statement, which I will issue later this year.</p>  <p>  Tusla provides a financial contribution towards running costs of Family Resource Centres on an annual basis. In 2017, Tusla provided &euro;13.512m for Family Resource Centres. I can confirm that under the 2018 Budget proposed, this will be significantly increased, and will include funding for 11 new Family Resource Centres, in addition to increased funding for the existing 109 centres.</p>  <p>  I very much appreciate the role that Family Resource Centres play in offering early intervention support to vulnerable children and families in demographically diverse communities around the country.

An open case is one which is assessed as needing a dedicated (allocated) social work service.  There were 5,524 open cases awaiting allocation of a social worker.  Of these, 816 were designated as high priority, 3,609 as medium priority and 1,099 as low priority.  </p><p>A high priority case can include children needing further child protection assessment and intervention, children involved with child protection court proceedings, children in care for less than 6 months and children with high risk mental health and anti-social difficulties.  Many children who are deemed medium and low priority have welfare rather than child protection needs and will engage with family support services.</p><p>I am informed by Tusla that a case awaiting allocation may be listed as 'active' on a 'duty ' system. This means that there are actions being undertaken by a dedicated duty team or rotating social workers on a duty roster to progress the protection and welfare of the child.  Examples of actions being undertaken include telephone calls relating to the concern, visits to see the child, completing initial assessments and, where a child is in care, completing child in care reviews or care plans.</p><p>Tusla has provided the following information on the number of cases awaiting allocation to a social worker per administrative area and waiting times.

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability.  Child Benefit is currently paid to almost 622,000 families in respect of some 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of more than &euro;2 billion in 2017.</p><p>Budget 2009 reduced the age for eligibility for Child Benefit from 19 years to less than 18 years.  A value for money review of child income supports, published by the Department of Social Protection in 2010, found that the participation pattern of children in education supports the current age limit for Child Benefit.</p><p>Extending Child Benefit entitlement to parents of full time students in second level education that are over 18 years of age would not be a targeted approach given the universality of Child Benefit.  The adoption of such a proposal would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context.</p><p>Families on low incomes can avail of a number of social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including:</p><p>- qualified child increases (IQCs) with primary social welfare payments;</p><p>- the working family payment (formerly Family Income Supplement) for low-paid employees with children;</p><p>- the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for low income families (paid at the full-time second-level education rate). </p><p>As part of the measures under Budget 2018, the qualified child payment which is paid each week to families with children will increase from &euro;29.80 to &euro;31.80 for each child.  This is an increase of 6.7%, and will benefit over 400,000 children.</p><p>The Working Family Payment earnings thresholds were increased by &euro;10 per week for families with up to three children.  This will particularly benefit low-income working families.</p><p>These schemes provide targeted assistance that is directly linked to household income and thereby support low-income families with older children participating in full-time education. </p></reply>

The average time to process a paper claim is 6 weeks and processing claims by leave commencement date order ensures that those whose maternity or paternity leave is impending or has already started receive priority.</p>  <p>  The Department also facilitates online applications for both maternity and paternity benefit and an automated decision is made where the applicant submits all necessary information and where the detail provided can be validated.  I would encourage applicants who are planning maternity leave or paternity leave to use this channel, if possible, as it provides the most effective method of applying for both maternity and paternity benefit.</p></reply>

This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.  Performance indicators relating to service delivery are set out in detail in the Department&rsquo;s Customer Action Plan, including processing time targets for the main welfare schemes.    The processing times target for the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme is 70% in 12 weeks.  This target reflects the fact that there are many questions which have to be considered before a decision can be made on entitlement to carer&rsquo;s allowance, specifically in relation to habitual residence, the care requirements of the person being cared for, as well as the means of and the level of care being provided by, the carer in each case. </p>  <p>  There has been an annual increase of 14% in the numbers of applications for carer&rsquo;s allowance in recent years. </p>  <p>  At the end of September 2017, the carer&rsquo;s allowance average processing time was 15 weeks and there were 4,844 applications awaiting decision.  The carer&rsquo;s benefit average processing time was 10 weeks and there were 677 awaiting decision. </p>  <p>  Frequently, delays in processing are outside the control of the Department and are caused by the customer failing to fully complete the claim form or failing to attach the supporting documentation that is requested on the application form. </p>  <p>  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Arising from Budget 2018, I am very pleased that over &euro;6 billion in exchequer investment has now been secured to support its implementation and to deliver an increased number of 50,000 social housing homes through build, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing, over the period to 2021. This level of national funding to implement Rebuilding Ireland's targets means that funding is available to all local authorities to advance their housing delivery.  Within the overall 21,000 social housing solutions targeted for delivery this year, some 4,500 of these will be delivered through new builds/acquisitions/refurbishments and a significant proportion of these will involve new construction. </p><p>A comprehensive status report of social housing schemes for all local authority areas, including those referred to by the Deputy, can be accessed at the following link:</p><p><i></i>.</p><p>This status report covers the period up to the end of Quarter 2 of 2017 and lists almost 700 schemes or phases of schemes delivering 11,000 new social homes, their locations and a range of information relating to their advancement, including those delivered during 2016 and to the end of Quarter 2 of 2017.  It also shows those progressing through planning, design and construction. Details in respect of Quarter 3 of 2017 will be published shortly.</p><p>These 700 schemes are funded under a range of different initiatives such as local authority construction, turnkey developments, rapid delivery, regeneration programmes and construction and turnkey developments by Approved Housing Bodies.  The precise timing for the advancement of each of these projects, including completion dates and tenanting, is a matter for the relevant local authority and approved housing body concerned, in the first instance.</p><p>Further project approvals are being added to the construction programme as they are developed by local authorities and approved housing bodies, updated details of which will be published on a regular basis.  I am keen that all local authorities advance their social housing projects as speedily as possible and I have assured them that funding is in place to support their activity in this regard.</p><p>In addition there are also a range of other social housing delivery methods that are being utilised alongside traditional construction, including harnessing vacant properties, purchasing suitable units from the market, and securing new properties under long-term lease agreements, the Rental Accommodation Scheme and the Housing Assistance Payment, all of which will be used to meet the 21,000 social housing solutions targeted for delivery this year.</p></reply>

Full details of the supports offered by the Abhaile Service are available from<i>www.keepingyourhome.ie</i>.  Under the restructuring option, local authorities will arrange where SO borrowers require financial and legal advice outside of that provided via MABS, to pay the cost of these fees to a maximum of &euro;1,000 excluding VAT. </p></reply>

I have furnished the report to those who made the protected disclosures and, before considering any further steps, I will await their views.  In light of this and given that some of the allegations relate to matters that are the subject of litigation, commenced before the protected disclosures were made, it would not be appropriate to comment further.   </p>  <p>  Separately and in parallel to the independent review, following an inspection in 2016, the Air Corps has continued to work with the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) to improve its health and safety regime.  I have been informed by the military authorities that the HSA has formally noted the considerable progress made to-date by the Defence Forces towards implementation of a safety management system for the control of hazardous substances.  Subject to completion of the improvement plan the HSA investigation is closed. However, it must be noted that in the Air Corps health and safety is a matter of ongoing monitoring, supervision and adjustment.   </p></reply>
