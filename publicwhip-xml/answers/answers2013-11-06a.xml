This programme has brought to fourteen the number of barracks closed during that time. To-date nine of these barracks - Clancy (Dublin), Castleblaney, Ballincollig, Fermoy, Naas, Monaghan, Cavan, Castlebar and a large portion of Longford - have been sold. </p><p>  In relation to the remaining barracks agreement has been reached for the sale of Lifford and Rockhill to Donegal County Council. </p><p>  Discussions are ongoing in relation to the possible sale of Clonmel Barracks to South Tipperary County Council and the remaining part of Longford has been reserved by the OPW for the local Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.   Magee Barracks in Kildare and Columb Barracks in Mullingar remain the property of the Department of Defence. </p><p>Regarding the remaining Barracks, in accordance with normal procedure for the disposal of State property my Department has written to Government Departments and other Public Bodies   seeking expressions of interest in acquiring any of the properties to benefit the local community. Negotiations are well advanced with the Department of Education for the purchase of a site in Magee Barracks of around 20 Acres however there has been no interest in the remainder of the site.  No Public Body has expressed an interest in purchasing Columb Barracks in Mullingar.  </p><p>I am of course aware of the possibilities for the use of surplus Defence Buildings and I would be happy to discuss with any interested group proposals they may have for the purchase and development of the site for the benefit of the local community. However any proposal involving the long term retention of the remaining properties by my Department, administering multiple leases and fulfilling the many responsibilities of a landlord would put a significant administrative and financial burden on my Department. Given the current resources available and the need to provide investment funding for the development of the Defence Forces I do not feel that the multiple leasing of the remaining Barracks Barracks is feasible and does not meet the purpose of the property disposal programme as outlined in the White Paper.   </p></reply>

All elements of Defence expenditure were examined for the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in 2011.  In response to these resource constraints, the Defence Organisation has undertaken further significant reorganisation and reform.  These changes will ensure that the Defence Forces organisational structures are configured to maximize required capabilities.</p><p>  The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces remains a focus for me as Minister for Defence and is a matter that is kept under constant review. The budgetary situation, in the context of the current difficult economic situation, will continue to dictate the level of funding available for new equipment, training and upgrades.  </p><p>  Decisions will be made accordingly on a strictly prioritised basis with a view to maintaining the capability of all roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces.</p><p>  Training standards in the Defence Forces are constantly benchmarked against best international practice. Participation in ongoing overseas operations also necessitates multi lateral-training and assessment. This facilitates ongoing review of Defence Forces training methods and standards within an international military context.</p><p>  I am also satisfied that Naval Service training techniques and technologies are up to date in all respects, with the most up to date equipment, including modern technology and IT equipment available to Naval Service personnel. With the forthcoming delivery of two new off shore patrol vessels, combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair on the other vessels in the fleet, the Naval Service will continue to meet the required operational capability.   The  Air Corps will continue to conduct its training in accordance with industry best practices and to the highest standards using the most modern methods and equipment available.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-06a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013110600071#WRA01300"><p>I understand that Secretary General Rasmussen referenced the need for greater cooperation among EU member States when he addressed an Inter-parliamentary Conference hosted by the Lithuanian Presidency in Vilnius on the 6th September 2013.  At the conference, he stated that if European countries are to have access to the full spectrum of capabilities and forces they require for crisis management operations, they must cooperate more closely.  In this regard, he referenced the European Defence Agency&rsquo;s initiative on &ldquo;Pooling and Sharing&rdquo;, which complements the &ldquo;Smart Defence&rdquo; initiative in NATO.  The context of his speech was the significant cuts in the defence budgets of EU member States and the global security challenges faced by Member States against the backdrop of increased investment by countries outside of the EU.  I can recall the NATO Secretary General made a similar call for greater cooperation at European level when he was in Dublin to attend the Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers during Ireland&rsquo;s EU presidency.  As such, this is nothing new and such cooperation is something which Ireland also supports.     Cooperation in the development of defence capabilities is necessary to ensure that the reduced resources available for defence are spent effectively and that there is no duplication of effort either within the Union or between the Union and NATO.  Through cooperative efforts we can achieve greater efficiencies in the delivery of military capabilities for crisis, management operations.  To this end, cooperation between the European Defence Agency and NATO is ongoing in areas such as Counter Improvised Explosive Devices (C-IED), Medical Support and Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) protection projects.    The Agency is also actively engaged in enhancing cooperation with the European Commission in a number of EU policy areas which have civil and military dimensions including, Maritime Surveillance, Cyber, Single European Sky and Radio Spectrum.  This enhanced cooperation will help minimise any duplication of effort or inefficient use of resources across the EU system as a whole. </p><p>  Ireland has been a strong supporter of effective cooperation among member States and with NATO on the development and delivery of military capabilities for crisis management operations.  Our participation in Partnership for Peace, has enhanced both the capability and the interoperability of the Defence Forces when engaged overseas in UN authorised peacekeeping and peace support operations.  </p><p>  During the course of our recent Presidency, a key priority was enhanced cooperation between the Commission and the European Defence Agency in relation to investment in maritime security and surveillance capabilities, cyber security and defence, and countering improvised explosive devices.  Ireland as part of the EDA&rsquo;s cooperative pooling and sharing initiative is also providing a lead role in reviewing Naval training with a view to greater cooperation and sharing of training resources across the Union.  </p><p>  All these projects have the potential to deliver more effective capabilities more economically and I welcome such initiatives and the statement of support from the NATO Secretary General for them.      </p></reply>

Should such a request be received I would, of course, give it due consideration.   The major re-organisation of the RDF currently underway is being overseen by a High Level Implementation Group comprising senior civil and Military Management of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces.  The Group, meets on a regular basis, and has been planning and implementing the recommended changes and a new &ldquo;ngle Force&rdquo; structure is now in place which has dovetailed with the re-organisation of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF).</p><p>  RDFRA has had a significant input into the change process for the Reserve.  A series of bi-lateral meetings of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces commenced, and are continuing, on a regular basis with RDFRA.  These meetings, which are chaired by the Deputy Chief of Staff (Support), are also attended by Military personnel and Departmental staff. The meetings afford RDFRA an opportunity to raise issues they may have in relation to the re-organisation of the Reserve.  milar meetings were held with the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers (RACO) and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA) at which they were afforded the opportunity to raise issues they had in connection with the PDF Cadre support staff in relation to the re-organisation of the Reserve.</p><p>  I am advised by the Military Authorities that the Deputy Chief of Staff (Support) also attended the RDF Special Delegate Conference, in March 2013, at which he addressed a wide variety of issues raised by their members in relation to the re-organisation of the RDF.  Two seminars were also held, on 29 June and 28 September 2013, in the Defence Forces Training Centre, Curragh Camp.  These were held for Unit Commanders and RDF Sub Unit Commanders in order to afford them the opportunity to discuss any concerns they may have had in relation to the re-organisation. </p><p>  In addition, there have been on-going briefings to the Reserve Defence Force by relevant Military Personnel in relation to the re-organisation of the Reserve.  I am satisfied that there are sufficient and robust systems in place within the Defence Organisation to ensure that issues of concern to members of the Reserve Defence Force are brought to my attention, as appropriate.</p></reply>

Their role includes the provision of a Quick Reaction Force which is on standby to assist with on-going operations within the UNDOF Area of Responsibility. The Irish Infantry Group also carries out patrols and convoy escorts as necessary. </p><p>  Initial deployment to UNDOF will be for one (1) year.  This will, of course, be subject to renewal of the UN mandate and a satisfactory review of the mission at that time.  Personnel of the Infantry Group will be rotated on a six-monthly basis. The first rotation of Irish personnel is scheduled for March 2014.</p></reply>

So far this year there have been four meetings of the Task Force and the next meeting is scheduled for Monday, 11 November 2013.  The last meeting took place on Monday, 23 September 2013. </p><p>  While details of matters discussed at meetings of the Task Force and the specific Agenda items are confidential, I can confirm that the Task Force examines current risks and supports coordination arrangements for emergency planning across the whole of Government.  </p><p>  The Task Force is regularly briefed on such matters as the current security threat, which is provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces. It also receives regular updates specifically from the lead Government Departments. An example is the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which chairs the National Steering Group under the Framework for Major Emergency Management, and is the lead Government Department in eleven of the forty two emergency scenarios identified. </p><p>  The Task Force regularly addresses other emergency planning issues ranging from risk assessment to training and exercises as well as receiving regular briefings on current issues from the various lead Government Departments on their specific roles and responsibilities and their associated work programmes. The Task Force establishes Subgroups from time to time to specifically look at particular areas of emergency planning that may need to be addressed.</p><p>  The next meeting of the Task Force, which will take place on Monday, 11 November 2013, will report on the normal standing items but will mainly focus on the launch of the national annual winter preparedness campaign. After that meeting, together with my colleague Phil Hogan, T.D, Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, we will launch the 'Be Winter Ready' information campaign. </p><p>  The purpose of the campaign is to provide information to the public on how best to prepare for winter. The advice is being delivered through the website    and via Aertel page 592, along with the &ldquo;Be Winter Ready&rdquo; booklets.  In addition, a twitter account is being launched and will be tweeting during the winter period to augment the &lsquo;Be Winter Ready&rsquo; campaign, which can be followed through links on the website. </p></reply>

My main purpose in travelling to Lebanon was to visit the Irish troops serving as part of a joint Irish/Finnish battalion with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).  I was accompanied on this trip by the Chief of Staff, three officials from my Department and three officers of the Defence Forces.  The costs incurred amount to &euro;15,309 and primarily relate to commercial flight costs, accommodation and subsistence expenses and do not include the costs of the Ministerial Air Transport Service which are set as fellows.  The Ministerial Air Transport Service provided by the Air Corps was used for the overseas travel programme for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day as follows:  <table><tr><th>Date</th><th>Return Date</th><th>Ministerial  Time On Board (Minutes)</th><th>Route</th><th>Minister</th></tr><tr><td>09/03/2013</td><td>12/03/2013</td><td> 390</td><td>Baldonnel - Beirut &ndash; Tel Aviv - Baldonnel</td><td>Minister for Justice, Equality &amp;amp; Defence</td></tr></table>  My Department follows the normal practice in the aviation business of costing aircraft by reference to the cost per flying hour under either of two headings:</p><p>- The direct cost which includes costs which are additional to those associated with having the aircraft and which only arise when the aircraft is flown including maintenance, fuel and support services such as catering costs, cleaning services and airport handling charges.</p><p>- The total cost which is the direct cost plus the costs associated with having the aircraft and includes depreciation and personnel costs.</p><p>  The average direct cost per hour for the Gulfstream is &euro;3,270.

The analysis concluded that the service provided by the Curragh Families Clinic is an anomaly in that it is a benefit which is only available to a relatively small number of families of enlisted personnel resident within the Curragh Camp and surrounding areas.  Similar services are not provided to families of enlisted military personnel at any other location in the State.  A further anomaly arises in that new personnel deployed to the Curragh in recent times do not receive the benefit of free family care.  The recent analysis of the operation of the Curragh Families Clinic followed on from a number of reviews, undertaken in the period since 1990, all of which recommended that the Clinic be closed.  The decision to discontinue the operation of the clinic had regard to those reviews, equity considerations and the cost of the service. </p><p>  I would like to emphasise that the families affected by the closure of the Clinic will have the same rights of access to public health services as other families of enlisted personnel.  Also, existing services are being maintained for a period until 31 December to allow families make arrangements to transfer to local GP&rsquo;s and apply for medical cards or GP visit cards if required.  If any patient requires assistance in finding a new GP or applying for a medical or GP visit card this can be provided by staff in the clinic during the transition period.</p><p>  I have no plans to change the decision to discontinue the services at the Clinic.</p></reply>

In this regard, the level of remuneration in the Defence sector has maintained relativity with the levels available in other related public sector employments.  I fully appreciate that many of our citizens are facing difficulties in the current environment, including members of the Defence Forces.  The Government is making every effort, within available resources, to support all those who face hardship.  In addition, there are various schemes in place through the Department of Social Protection, including Family Income Supplement, to support those on low incomes. </p><p>  The circumstances surrounding an application for Family Income Supplement, or indeed any other scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection, is a private matter between the applicant and the Department of Social Protection.  I am, therefore, not aware of the eligibility of individual members of the Permanent Defence Force to receive such allowances, or the total numbers of Defence Force members that may be in receipt of this financial support.  Various factors can give rise to such claims.  However, the important thing is that, despite the difficult economic environment, the Government has maintained this important safety net for families who by virtue of their particular circumstances require such financial support.  </p></reply>

Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the tabular statement below.  The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 356 personnel, including the Deputy Force Commander.  The joint Irish/Finnish Battalion is tasked primarily with patrolling, reconnaissance and occupying static posts while operating in close co-ordination and co-operation with the Lebanese Armed Forces in Sector West of UNIFIL&rsquo;s area of operations.</p><p>  Other missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the EU Training Mission (EUTM) Somalia with eight (8) personnel, including the Mission Commander; the EU Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali) with eight (8) personnel; the EUFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina with seven (7) personnel who are based at mission headquarters in Sarajevo; the NATO-led international security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with twelve (12) personnel based in the mission Headquarters; and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan with seven (7) personnel who are based in the mission Headquarters in Kabul.  Ireland also contributes 24 observers and staff to various United Nations and OSCE missions and 16 other personnel to staff appointments at UN, EU and OSCE headquarters.</p><p>  The most recent deployment overseas was in response to a United Nations request and resulted in the deployment of the 43<sup>rd</sup> Infantry Group to United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) on the Golan Heights in Syria.  This deployment was successfully completed on 28 September 2013.  The 43<sup>rd</sup> Infantry Group is tasked primarily to serve as the Force Mobile Reserve within the UNDOF Area of Responsibility.  A total of 118 Defence Forces personnel are currently serving with UNDOF, including four (4) personnel who were deployed to UNDOF earlier this year for service at the Mission Headquarters.  </p><p>  Also, at the request of the United Nations and following Government approval, four (4) members of the Permanent Defence Force were  deployed for service with the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) in South Sudan in August 2013.  Their role is to provide a specialist training team on Conventional Munitions Disposal (CMD), mine and specialist search awareness to South Sudan Police personnel.</p><p>  The current contribution of some 560 personnel to overseas missions reflects the Government's continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security.</p><p>  My Department constantly reviews the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas.

In that regard, a contract was signed in October 2010, with Babcock Marine, part of the Babcock International Group, in the United Kingdom for the provision of two new offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) for the Naval Service.  The cost of the two new ships is &euro;108m, exclusive of VAT.  In addition, the cost of providing a weapons system for the ships, similar to the systems on L.E. Roisin and L.E. Niamh, is &euro;7.8m, exclusive of VAT.  The two new ships are being built by Babcock Marine in Appledore, Devon in the United Kingdom, the same shipyard where both L.E. Roisin and L.E. Niamh were built.  The build programme for the first ship is well advanced and the float out of the ship, to be named LE Samuel Beckett, took place last Sunday evening in Devon.  The ship will replace LE Emer which was decommissioned and sold by public auction late last month in Cork.  The fitting out of the ship and the final build work will be completed over the next two months and it is expected that the ship will be ready for sea trials early in the New Year.  The cutting of steel and the fabrication of units for the second ship is also well advanced and the keel laying ceremony for this ship took place last Monday.  The second new ship will replace LE Aoife when it is delivered in early 2015.</p><p>  This vessel replacement strategy combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair will ensure that the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained at a satisfactory level.  The acquisition of these new vessels with the very latest equipment suites will ensure that the Naval Service will be fully equipped to carry out its day to day roles in enforcing the State&rsquo;s sovereign rights over our waters and our fisheries and meeting Ireland&rsquo;s obligations in the area of maritime safety and security and fisheries protection.<b></b></p></reply>

This SLA was renewed in October, 2011.  There has been a substantial increase in the use of this service with 108 missions being completed in 2012 compared with 78 in 2011 and 69 in 2010.  This year, there have been 87 missions completed up to 31st October last.  In addition to the inter-hospital SLA, a twelve-month pilot Emergency Aeromedical Support (EAS) service, supported by the Air Corps, commenced operating out of Custume Barracks, Athlone on 4th June last year.  This service was established by agreement between my Department and the Department of Health in order to assess the level and type, if any, of dedicated emergency aeromedical support needed to assist the National Ambulance Service, primarily in the west of Ireland, for certain types of patient, particularly in light of the requirements of the HSE Clinical Care Programmes such as Acute Coronary Syndrome and Stroke. </p><p>  Following a review of the pilot service carried out by an inter agency Audit and Evaluation Group established under the agreement, a Report was submitted for consideration by my colleague, the Minister for Health.

However, personnel may be deployed for training, for humanitarian operations and for other such reasons under the authority of the Government in accordance with the provisions of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 2006, which formalised arrangements in this regard.  </p><p>  The White Paper on Defence, which was published in 2000, has provided the policy framework for Defence for the past thirteen years.  In the period since its publication there have been significant changes in the defence and security environment and the defence policy framework has continued to evolve.  In this context, the Government decided that there is a requirement to prepare a new White Paper on Defence. is will provide the policy framework for Defence for the next decade. </p><p>  A Green Paper on Defence, which was published in July of this year, initiated a broad public consultative process, which provided for members of the public and interest groups to input their views as part of the process of developing the new White Paper on Defence.  In this context the Green Paper engendered discussion on all relevant matters including the &quot;triple lock&quot;. </p><p>  The requirement for a UN resolution as part of the &quot;triple lock&quot; reflects the central importance of the UN in granting legitimacy to peace support and crisis management missions.  At the same time, it also constitutes a self imposed, legal constraint on the State's sovereignty in making decisions about the use of its armed forces.  This could prevent the State from participating in a peace support operation.  In 2003, the EU led peace support mission EUFOR Concordia in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was welcomed in UN resolution 1371 in terms that did not conform to the requirements of the Defence Acts at that time.  Accordingly, Ireland could not participate in the mission. </p><p>  The benefits of a formal legislative requirement for UN authorisation must be weighed against the possibility that this constraint may lead to an inability to act on occasions where there is a pressing moral or security imperative and overwhelming international support to do so, but where UN sanction is not forthcoming, in circumstances where a veto is exercised by a permanent member of the Security Council acting in its own national interests. </p><p>  It is acknowledged that there is substantial public support for the triple lock mechanism and that, in practical terms, due to the size of our Defence Forces, the State only has a limited capacity to contribute to UN Missions.  In real terms Ireland has, in the context of its size, punched above its weight and made a valuable, disproportionate contribution and, save for the example of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, has not been excluded from peace keeping engagements by the triple lock.  On balance, the advantages of retaining the mechanism can be seen as outweighing the disadvantages.  Having said that, it is an issue worthy of discussion in advance of the adoption of a new White Paper. </p></reply>

My Department has been providing consular assistance through our Embassy in Egypt and the Consular Assistance Section in Dublin.  Cases of this nature are complicated by the fact that Egypt is not a signatory to the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction, which provides a legal framework for resolving international child abduction cases.    </p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that this case has been raised with the Egyptian authorities at the highest levels on a number of occasions.  In February 2010 former Minister Miche&aacute;l Martin raised this case with the Foreign Minister during a visit to Cairo.  I discussed the case with the Egyptian Foreign Minister at the United National General Assembly in September 2011 and I raised the case when I met with the Egyptian Foreign Minister in February 2012.  The Embassy in Cairo is in contact with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Egypt and our Consular Assistance Section continues to liaise directly with the family on a regular basis. </p><p>  Let me assure you that the Consular Section will remain in contact with the family and, with the Embassy of Ireland in Cairo, will continue to provide all possible consular assistance to this family.  However, it should be noted that the Irish Government cannot force the Egyptian Government or the abducting parent to return a child to Ireland.</p><p>  Officials in my Department are in contact with the Department of Justice, Equality and Defence, which is the lead Department for the negotiation of bilateral agreements on child abduction.  </p></reply>

The FAC adopted Conclusions which, while welcoming the encouraging progress made in recent weeks on the disarmament issue, underlined the need to maintain the momentum behind the &lsquo;Geneva II&rsquo; process and emphasised the overall need for a political solution to the crisis in Syria. The Council made clear that it welcomed the call of UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon for the Geneva II Conference to be held before the end of November and reiterated that the objective of the Conference must be the swift establishment, by mutual consent, of a transitional governing body with full executive powers and control of all governmental and all security institutions. Discussions are due to continue in Geneva this week aimed at agreeing specific dates for the Conference as well as details of who will be invited.</p><p>  The Council, in its Conclusions, also prioritised the alleviation of the humanitarian suffering and called for safe and unhindered humanitarian access to all populations in need of assistance throughout the country. The EU is the largest international donor of assistance to the Syrian people and Ireland, for its part, has contributed a total of &euro;13.8m to date.</p><p>  In my intervention, I voiced Ireland&rsquo;s continuing full support for Joint Special Representative Brahimi and his efforts to convene the Geneva II conference as well as informing partners of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution of &euro;200,000 to the OPCW disarmament efforts.</p><p>  In recognition of the immense burden placed upon, and risks to, neighbouring countries, the Council emphasised the absolute and urgent necessity for all donor countries to ensure the fulfilment of pledges already made. The urgent necessity for all donor countries to continue to provide financial support to enable host countries to respond to the growing humanitarian needs of refugees was also emphasised. I took the opportunity to call for greater efforts to address the humanitarian crisis and, in particular, the need for access across borders. The conflict in Syria will remain a major priority for Ireland at all levels of our international engagement.</p></reply>

The investigative powers available to the Central Bank are governed by the obligations and laws that existed at the time of the alleged activity.  For example, the administrative sanctioning powers available to the Central Bank under Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942, as amended, were introduced by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004.  These powers took effect on 1 August 2004 and, as such, are only available to use in relation to prescribed contraventions suspected to have taken place on or after that date.</p><p>  In the case of alleged inappropriate activity occurring within the allowable period of time, the Central Bank would still use its discretion in determining the value and likelihood of success in investigating matters which date back over a number of years.  Issues such as the likely difficulty in obtaining records and information and identifying relevant individuals would be considered along with any other matters which impact on the likelihood of achieving a successful outcome.</p><p>  It should be noted that the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act, 2013 introduced a new extended limitation period of three years for the institution of proceedings for a relevant offence under financial services law.</p><p>  Where a regulated entity is suspected of having committed a criminal offence, the powers of the Central Bank to pursue such matters may be limited by the statute of limitations.</p></reply>

Let me be clear what is happening, from 1 January 2014, the One-Parent Family Tax Credit is being replaced with a new Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit. The new credit will be of the same value, i.e. &euro;1,650, as the existing One-Parent Family Tax Credit and will also carry the same entitlement to the extended standard rate tax band of &euro;36,800 per annum.  The new credit will be targeted such that it is available only to the primary carer of the child. A maximum of one credit will be available per single carer/claimant, regardless of whether he or she cares for more than one child. This is the same condition that applies to the current One-Parent Family Tax Credit.  </p><p>  The Programme for Government states that &ldquo;as part of the Government&rsquo;s fiscal strategy we will maintain the current rates of income tax together with bands and credits.  We will not increase the top marginal rates of taxes on income&rdquo;. In my view, the credit is being maintained. In a time of limited resources, I am merely targeting the credit to ensure that it can achieve the objectives set for it.     </p><p>  Allocation of childcare responsibilities is primarily for parents to agree. Practical implementation issues, such as those which you have raised, are being considered as part of the Finance Bill process.</p></reply>

The launch of the Report on Pension Charges report in October 2012 was followed by a three month consultation with stakeholders. Following the consultation, it was agreed by Government in April 2013 that the recommendations contained in the report will be implemented, and this work has commenced. Implementation of these recommendations aims to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and enhance the transparency and understanding of pension charges amongst trustees, employers and scheme members with a view to supporting competitive pricing and ultimately limiting erosion to the value of the pension received by the member.</p><p>  On the matter of the pension fund levy, I have held the view since the introduction of the levy that the companies who manage and administer the assets of the pension funds and schemes should generally be in a position to absorb the impact of the levy by reducing the charges and fees which they apply. I have pursued this issue with the representative bodies of these companies but the response has not been positive. I have been told that it would be a matter for individual companies to decide on the question of absorbing the cost of the levy into their existing fees and charges but that the scope for companies to do so is very limited. There have been calls to force the companies through legislation to absorb the levy but I do not consider that this approach, which would ignore the circumstances from case to case, would be appropriate. </p><p>  The levy applies to the market value, on the valuation date (generally 30 June each year), of assets under management in pension funds and pension plans approved under Irish tax legislation, including funded Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution occupational pension schemes. However, the levy does not apply where the trustees of an occupational pension scheme have passed a resolution to wind up the scheme and where the business in respect of which the scheme was established is insolvent.</p></reply>

The development of the Property Register required Revenue to extract and consolidate data from multiple Government and non-Government sources. In the case of jointly assessed spouses, the name of the person registered for Income Tax was used for the purpose of issuing LPT forms and notices.    In the case to which the Deputy refers, the persons involved are jointly assessed under a common PPS number.  The husband is the person registered for issue of forms and correspondence relating to other taxes and the address of the property in question has been used by him for tax purposes since 2006. </p><p>  Revenue has further informed me that it will be necessary for the person in question to seek a separate PPS Number, provided by the Department of Social Protection, in order to change the liable person from her husband to herself.</p><p>  In regard to the application for deferral, unfortunately Revenue&rsquo;s scanning system did not record the application by the person in question correctly.  This may have occurred because there were a number of differing entries on the Return and the system was not able to correctly identify the person&rsquo;s preference. </p><p>  However, direct contact has now been made with the individual concerned by a member of the LPT team and all the issues have been clarified and resolved to the person&rsquo;s satisfaction.  I am advised that the person in question, on the basis of the information supplied, has qualified and availed of the deferral option for 2013 through to 2016 inclusive, should their financial circumstances remain unchanged. </p></reply>

This is the conclusion that the Government came to in deciding on the capital envelope to be made available to the Department for the years 2012 to 2016 in November 2011.  In effect the education capital budget targets addressing the provision of much needed school places due to the extensive demographic growth and extends only to meeting commitments that existed in the higher education sector in November 2011. The exception to this latter position relates to the advancement of the Grangegorman project which is being progressed through the Public Private Partnership process as part of the Economic Stimulus Plan as announced in July 2012.</p></reply>

Results may be subject to further check and alteration, usually through the appeals system. While the difficulties for students awaiting upgraded results in order to access their preferred college course are appreciated by the SEC, they have  ensured that the viewing and appeals processes are delivered to the tightest possible timescales and deadlines.  The need to process the appeal results as early as possible must be balanced with the need to allow appeal examiners sufficient time to carry out a thorough remarking of the students' work.</p><p>  The SEC's objective is to ensure that the process of marking papers is as free from error as possible and that, in addition, there is a transparent, easily accessible and effective appeals process available to all students who feel aggrieved at the result achieved.  I am aware that third level institutions generally make efforts to accommodate students who reach a qualifying standard following re-checks and I support that approach.</p></reply>

QQI makes further education and training awards to a large and diverse range of providers, including large bodies such as SOLAS as well as small private providers of education and training.</p><p>  QQI does not collect statistics centrally on the number of persons enrolled in programmes leading to their awards. That is a matter for the providers themselves. It is therefore impossible to say whether overall enrolments in 2013 are less than 2012. QQI only becomes involved when they are approached to provide awards to learners. Overall statistics on the awards made for 2013 will be available in 2014.</p><p>  Figures for 2012 show that FETAC made awards to approximately 170,000 learners, compared with approximately 180,000 in 2011. However, the number of major awards increased from 37,857 to 42,593 in the same period.</p><p>  With regard to funding, the amount allocated from the National Training Fund has been &euro;362 million for each of the years 2011, 2012 and 2013.

Assessment of short courses, which are also a feature of the new Junior Cycle programme, could also lend itself to the use of ePortfolios.  In view of this potential, my Department is exploring ways in which eportfolios can facilitate the implementation of junior cycle in schools.</p><p>  Officials have met with a number of industry representatives to discuss requirements and also my Department along with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) &ndash; Technology in Education (formerly NCTE) and the State Examinations Commission (SEC), are participating in a European Commission funded eportfolios project.</p><p>  There are six other EU countries (Austria, Cyprus, Slovenia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Spain) involved in the EUfolio project with a view to developing a common specification for the use of ePortfolios in second level education.   As part of the project a number of post primary schools will shortly be invited to participate in a pilot.  The pilot will be useful in informing our thinking on how eportfolios can be used in the junior cycle programme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-06a.145.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1042" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013110600078#WRH00700"><p>Parliamentary questions linked to the substance of the High Court case taken by Student Transport Scheme Ltd against my Department, including the arrangements between my Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann, have been raised on a number of occasions in the House recently.</p><p>  For this reason, I feel it is appropriate to give a background to the conduct of the particular case. In doing this I will not stray into the area of issues that were raised before the Court and which were appropriately dealt with in that forum. Nor will I comment on matters which may be the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court.</p><p>Student Transport Scheme Ltd is a company first incorporated in June 2011; it initiated the legal action against my Department in October 2011.  Bus &Eacute;ireann was joined as a Notice Party in the proceedings at the direction of the High Court. The records with the Companies Registration Office show that the sole shareholders of Student Transport Scheme Ltd are Mr Tim Doyle and Mr Brian Lynch who hold 101 and 99 shares of &euro;1 each respectively, or a paid-up share capital of &euro;200. The company was represented in the legal action by Brian Lynch &amp;amp; Associates, Solicitors.</p><p>  Given the fact that the company had effectively no assets, my Department judged it prudent to seek an Order from the High Court for security for costs. This process preceded the actual hearing of the court case. In January 2012, the High Court gave the Department an order for security of costs. The effect of this was to provide the tax payer with security in the event, as actually occurred, that the Department won the court case and received an order in its favour in respect of its costs. In the absence of such security the taxpayer was at risk in relation to the costs of the action.</p><p>  The essential thrust of the legal action was to seek an Order from the High Court setting aside the existing arrangements for the provision of national school transport services. The case was heard over a six day period in the Commercial High Court spanning the period from 10th July to 18th July 2012. During this period Counsel, on behalf of all parties (the company, the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann) advanced the detail of their respective cases and the legal arguments to the Court. The High Court Judgement was given in October 2012. The detail of this Judgement is available on the Courts Service website and other than to make the point that the Court found decisively in favour of the Department, I do not propose to comment further on the detail of the case.</p><p>  It is worthy of note that the court case was litigated in an unusually belligerent manner by the applicant.  The Department is in receipt of very extensive correspondence accusing the Department of illegality, obstruction of a solicitor, tampering with evidence, perverting the course of justice and drawing purported parallels between my Department and a fiefdom of thugs in Limerick City.  At trial, Senior Counsel for the company apologised for the excessive zeal of this correspondence.</p><p>  Subsequent to the Court Judgement in favour of the Department the company, through their solicitor, Brian Lynch &amp;amp; Associates initiated an appeal to the Supreme Court.  In addition the company, again through their solicitor Brian Lynch &amp;amp; Associates commenced an action against two named officials of the Department, the Chief State Solicitor and a named official of the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  This action alleged contempt and sought committal of the public servants in question. </p><p>The Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann also sought security for the legal costs in relation to the appeal to the Supreme Court. The underlying purpose of seeking this security was to safeguard the taxpayer against the costs to be incurred in defending this appeal. In the event the issues of contempt/committal and security for costs came before the Supreme Court in February 2013. The Supreme Court dismissed the contempt/committal issue. The Supreme Court also awarded the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann security for their costs in an amount to be decided by the Master of the High Court in the event of the appeal against the High Court judgement proceeding.</p><p>  The litigation in this case continues to be conducted in a most unusual, threatening and aggressive manner.  Brian Lynch &amp;amp; Associates on behalf of the company, and Mr. Tim Doyle, as managing director of the company between them have written many hundreds of letters to Ministers, Deputies, the Department, Bus &Eacute;ireann, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and to individual officials and retired officials of the Department.  Elements of this correspondence allege corruption, refer to an ongoing investigation of corruption by Brian Lynch &amp;amp; Associates, and repeatedly raise issues and contentions which were either the subject of the failed High Court challenge and/or are proper to any appeal to the Supreme Court.</p><p>  It should also be pointed out that earlier correspondence to Bus &Eacute;ireann contained references to bias, bribery and bullying and these allegations are now the subject of separate defamation proceedings initiated by Bus &Eacute;ireann against Mr Tim Doyle.</p><p>  I consider it necessary to bring the foregoing information to the attention of Deputies. It is important that litigation be conducted in the appropriate objective forum, namely the Courts, and that Ministers refrain from comment on matters which are the subject of further legal proceedings.  Myself and my officials have sought to respect this principle in our approach to the litigation. The Office of the Chief State Solicitor has corresponded repeatedly with Brian Lynch &amp;amp; Associates pointing out that issues in relation to the proceedings should be dealt with in the appropriate process and will not be debated in the course of correspondence by either my Department or that Office.</p><p>  Subject to provision of the appropriate security for costs as directed by the Supreme Court and as determined by the Master of the High Court, my Department will deal fully with the relevant issues and contentions raised by Brian Lynch &amp;amp; Associates in the context of the Supreme Court appeal.</p></reply>

Significant progress was made during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Union in advancing the dossier with agreement on four of the six regulations. The progress made under the Irish Presidency is facilitating the conclusion of discussions by the Lithuanian Presidency.  It is expected that there is likely to be a vote on the package by the European Parliament later this month, with publication in the Official Journal of the European Union sometime after that.</p><p>  The new proposals are designed to reinforce the strategic dimension of the policy and to ensure that EU investment is targeted on Europe's long-term goals for growth and jobs.  Each Member State must prepare a Partnership Agreement which will constitute a formal agreement with Commission regarding the use of funds.  </p><p>  My Department has overall responsibility for EU Cohesion Policy and primary responsibility for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).  My colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, has primary responsibility for the European Social Fund (ESF).  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has responsibility for the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF).</p><p>  Preparations for the new programming round in Ireland have been underway over the past year including consultation processes, needs analyses and ex-ante evaluations.  The outcome of these processes will inform the preparation of the Partnership Agreement and Operational Programmes through which the Irish allocations will be drawn down.</p><p>  It should be noted that Member States have four months from the entry into force of the regulation to submit their Partnership Agreement to the Commission.</p><p>  The regulations provide for consultation at all stages in the preparation of the Partnership Agreement and the Operations Programmes.  Initial consultations have taken place on the Partnership Agreement with a second consultation process now underway.</p><p>  Community Led Local Development (CLLD) is a method for involving partners at local level in programme delivery.  It is a requirement for the EAFRD under LEADER but may be supported by the other funds also.  The option of using a CCLD delivery mechanism for the ERDF and ESF will be considered following a thorough analysis of the thematic objectives and investment priorities chosen.   </p><p>  As the legal bases have not been finalised, the Commission can only give indicative indications of our allocations over the 2014-2020 period.  We understand that the Irish allocations for Cohesion Policy (ERDF and ESF) and the Rural Development Programme (EAFRD) will be in the order of &euro;1bn and &euro;2bn respectively.</p></reply>

The Department is in the process of introducing a series of reforms to the one-parent family payment (OFP) scheme.  These reforms are predicated on activation and on getting people back into the workforce once their children have reached an appropriate age.  A wide range of supports and services are presently available to lone parents who are clients of the Department and who pro-actively engage with the Department&rsquo;s activation process.  As part of the supports that are available to lone parents my Department has provided funding to One Family for its &lsquo;New Futures&rsquo; programme for the 2011-2012 period.  In 2012, One Family obtained further funding from my Department for its &lsquo;New Futures &ndash; Securing A Career&rsquo; programme for the 2012-2013 period.  The recently introduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) transitional arrangement caters for OFP recipients who lose their entitlement to the OFP payment from July, 2013, onwards, who have a youngest child aged under 14 years, and who are entitled to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) payment.  These customers are exempt from the JA conditionality that requires them to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  They are also exempt from having to prove unemployment and can work part-time without restrictions and still receive the JA transitional arrangement payment &ndash; subject to a means test.  The exemptions from the full JA conditionality will remain in place until a recipient&rsquo;s youngest child reaches the age of 14 years.  At this point, should they continue to claim the JA payment, they will be subjected to the full JA conditionality.</p><p>  Recipients of either the JA payment or the JA transitional arrangement payment may qualify for other social welfare income support benefits at the same time as their primary payment.  They can also avail of a wide range of education, training, and employment supports, and are entitled to apply, subject to qualifying conditions, for subsidised child care through both the community child care subvention (CCS) programme and the child care education and training support (CETS) scheme that are administered by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (D/CYA).  In addition, they can apply for the after-school child care scheme in the event that they take up employment, increase their days of employment, or commence certain employment programmes.  This scheme, which was announced in Budget 2013, and which is also funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs but jointly administered by my Department and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will continue to provide subsidised after-school child care places into 2014.</p><p>  I have also secured the agreement of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on a new strand of child care support for customers of the Department, including lone parents, who are participating in the community employment scheme.  This new child care support will be provided via the CETS scheme.</p><p>  Lone parents can also qualify for the family income supplement (FIS).  FIS is an income support payment for families on low income that incentivises them to retain or increase their hours of employment.</p></reply>

Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the office received 35,484 appeals.  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants. These included the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office. </p><p>  In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation has been undertaken in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.</p><p>  These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  Good progress is also now being made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 15,981 at 1 November, 2013.  </p><p>  The average waiting time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 these times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks while the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  This improvement has continued with the average processing time up to October 2013 reducing to 34.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 26.3 weeks for a summary decision.</p><p>  A similar trend is reflected in processing times for invalidity pension appeals. In 2010 the average processing time for an invalidity pension oral hearing was 59.7 weeks while a decision requiring a summary decision took an average of 40 weeks.  This had improved to 48.7 and 38.8 weeks respectively in 2012 and has further improved (up to October 2013) to 43.1 and 36 weeks respectively. </p><p>  These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.</p><p>  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.  </p><p><b>Invalidity Pension Appeals 2011 to  2013 (to 31 October 2013)</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>-</th><th>-</th><th>-</th><th>Average Processing Times</th><th>Average Processing Times</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Appeals on hand at year beginning </td><td>Appeal Receipts</td><td>Appeals Officers Decisions</td><td>Summary Decision    (in weeks) </td><td>Oral Hearing   (in weeks)</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>   612</td><td>2,285</td><td>   903</td><td>36.4</td><td>58.9</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>1,582</td><td>4,765</td><td>1,465</td><td>38.8</td><td>48.7</td></tr><tr><td>2013 (to 31 October 2013)</td><td>4,356</td><td>4,027</td><td>3,995</td><td>36.0</td><td>43.1</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The primary objective of the report was to gather information on the level of pension charges levied, to assess whether these charges are reasonable and transparent, to report on the findings and to make recommendations.  The report highlights a wide range of issues in relation to pension charges and identifies that there are major challenges to be addressed in the two main areas of reasonableness and transparency of charges.   </p><p>  With our ageing population and with people living longer, planning and saving for retirement is more important than ever.  A key part of this is to know what level of pension you are likely to receive in retirement and for employers, trustees and scheme members to understand the very significant impact pension charges can have on your final pension fund.  The report shows that small percentages can add up to big reductions in a pension fund over time.</p><p>  The launch of the Report on Pension Charges was followed by a three month consultation with stakeholders.  There was a broad range of views expressed in the submissions received as well as a range of suggestions and proposals aimed at improving various aspects of the pension charging environment.  Following the consultation period, it was agreed by Government in April 2013 that the recommendations contained in the report will be implemented, and this work has commenced.  </p><p>  A Pension Charges Working Group is in place to initiate actions that follow up on the recommendations of the report.  This group comprises the Department of Social Protection, the Pensions Board and the Central Bank.   Each has a core role to play in delivering on the recommendations contained within the Report on Pension Charges and work has commenced in this regard.  Joint action undertaken by the group has and will include consultation with other stakeholders as appropriate.   </p><p>  I have also previously signalled a change to the governance structure of the Pensions Board which will be restructured.  Under the new structure, a separate unpaid Pensions Council, with a number of members representing consumer interests, will advise on matters of pensions policy.  The first task I will be giving the new Council is to monitor the implementation of the recommendations in the Report on Pension Charges and advise me if further actions are needed.  Should this prove necessary, a further policy and regulatory response may be brought to Government.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-06a.227.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013110600083#WRN00300"><p>The overall objective of the pension system in Ireland is to provide an adequate and sustainable basic standard of living through direct State supports and to encourage people (through tax reliefs) to make supplementary pension provision so that they may have an adequate replacement income when they retire from work.  </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s State pension has been successful in lifting older people out of poverty. Compared to the rest of the population, older people in Ireland have the lowest consistent poverty rate (at 1.9%) and are least likely to be at risk of poverty, pointing to the adequacy of the State pension.   However, many people retiring from work will have a significant income gap if they do not have supplementary private pension provision. </p><p>  Figures indicate that only half of workers aged between 20 and 69 years have a supplementary pension and this relatively low coverage is of major concern.  It is a priority for the Government to increase supplementary pension coverage, particularly amongst the lower paid and those with gaps in their employment.  Significant reform of our pensions systems is necessary to safeguard future sustainability and adequacy.   The sustainability of the pension system is a particular concern because of the demographic challenges faced by Ireland, the associated increases in pension (and other age related) costs, and the deterioration in the public finances.  This means that the task of financing future increased pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population as demographic projections indicate the ratio of working age to pensioners will decrease from 5.3/1 at present to 2.1/1 by 2060.  Life expectancy in Ireland is also increasing: in the mid-1990s, life expectancy for males was 73 and for females 78.5.  In 2041, it will be 86.5 and 88.3 respectively.  Whilst this is very welcome development, it also presents very real and obvious public policy challenges. </p><p>  In April 2013, the OECD published its Review of the Irish Pension System.  Whilst endorsing pension policy reforms undertaken to date, the report also makes a number of recommendations for future reform.  The OECD&rsquo;s key recommendation is to improve the adequacy of pensions by increasing coverage in the funded part of the pensions system through a universal mandatory or quasi-mandatory employment based pension system.  </p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to reforming the pension system to progressively achieve universal coverage, with particular focus on lower-paid workers.   I have previously stated that a soft-mandatory approach such as that envisaged by an auto-enrolment scheme, using scale to achieve greater cost efficiencies for the member, is a very proactive way in which we can increase supplementary pension coverage, though it is recognised that introduction of such an initiative would be best supported by a more favourable economic environment than is currently the case.</p><p>  International experience has shown that significant increases in coverage can be obtained from such systems. In addition, the significantly larger economies of scale have the capacity to achieve more competitive charging structures, which in turn would lead to improved returns for consumer members.   As was highlighted in the Pensions Charges Report 2012, this type of arrangement could assist in resolving the difficulties inherent in the current Irish scheme structure of a proliferation of small schemes paying considerably higher charges than larger schemes, ultimately eroding the value of the pension received by the member.</p><p>  Analysis of the options available is on-going in my Department and consideration of the recommendations of the OECD review will inform further developments in the area of pension policy. </p></reply>

However, they are not entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  This compares to employees in respect of whom a combined 14.75% rate, under full-rate PRSI Class A, is paid giving entitlement to the full range of social insurance benefits including jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</p><p>  Any person of working age who does not qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit may claim means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Subject to means and other qualifying conditions, self-employed persons may claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or there is reduced demand for their services.  Typically over 80% of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claims from self-employed persons have been awarded over recent years. </p><p>  Previously self-employed persons in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance have access to the full range of activation measures available through the State.  Given the scale of unemployment levels, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.  This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people. </p><p>  However, many services are available to the formerly self-employed who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment. Some employment services, such as assistance with job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status. </p><p>  Unemployed persons, including the previously self-employed, not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through F&Aacute;S training, but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course.  Springboard courses are open to people who were previously self-employed, regardless of their social welfare status.</p><p>  The Live Register includes part-time workers (those who work up to 3 days a week), seasonal and casual workers entitled to jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance.</p></reply>

The Advisory Group is charged with, inter alia, examining and reporting on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  Any proposals for change must be cost neutral. </p><p>  On 6 September 2013 I published the Group&rsquo;s report on the issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons. The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. </p><p>  The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries. To this end, the Group recommended that Class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work because of a long-term illness or incapacity through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for Class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.  This is in line with the estimated level of contributions needed to provide access for the self-employed to invalidity pension contained in the 2010 Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund. </p><p>  In the course of the Group&rsquo;s deliberations, the Group identified a range of issues associated with the subject of social insurance for the self-employed that should be addressed and have made a number of recommendations in this regard.  These include, among others, the means assessment for self-employed income in terms of accessing jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments, credited PRSI contributions, self-employed access to activation and training schemes and the role that information campaigns might play in addressing information deficits, particularly with regard to entitlements to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</p><p>  The question as to whether the present arrangements regarding social insurance for the self-employed are appropriate has increased in prominence over recent years. I welcome the Group&rsquo;s finding that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment. </p><p>  The recommendation concerning long-term sickness or injuries is an important contribution to the policy debate regarding the range of benefits the self-employed might access through their social insurance contributions.  In this regard, the 2010 Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, published last year, determined that the self-employed are obtaining better value for the level of their current social insurance contributions than employees (the Actuarial Review found that the effective annual rate of contributions needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%).</p><p>  This finding was noted by the Advisory Group in its recommendations.  Consequently, the recommendations of the Advisory Group require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the 2010 Actuarial Review relating to the level of contributions levied on Class S contributors and the current shortfall in this regard.</p><p>  My colleagues in Government and I will now carefully reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Commercial decisions by individual private operators in relation to its infrastructure are a matter for the company concerned.  Any regulatory issues surrounding the provision of services are the responsibility of ComReg, which is independent in the exercise of its functions.</p><p>  Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Cork, can be found on ComReg's website at .  The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in County Cork.  This will be achieved by providing: a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  ComReg has put in place a new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and for service bundles, both of which are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by service providers.  ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, completed in 2012, is also enabling the rollout of advanced mobile broadband services.</p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market fails to deliver such services.  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years.  The results of this mapping exercise will inform the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing.  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

The assessment analyses security of electricity supply in Great Britain over the forthcoming five winters.  It shows that the buffer between peak electricity demand and supply could be lower than previously expected and proposed for consultation certain measures to address this issue.</p><p>  In contrast, the most recent All-Island Generation Capacity Statement published in January 2013 forecast that the adequacy situation in Ireland is positive for the next 10 years.  Indeed, there is considerable generation surplus forecast for the Irish electricity system.  These electricity Capacity Statements are required to be published annually by Eirgrid and the Transmission System Operator in Northern Ireland, SONI, and take account of interconnection with Great Britain.</p><p>  Turning to the issue of gas, it is correct to say that currently Ireland is dependent to a large extent on imported gas from Great Britain.  In terms of long term plans for energy security, Ireland's approach is to diversify fuels and supply sources.  The use of indigenous gas and access to Liquefied Natural Gas storage will enhance diversity.</p><p>  Continuing to develop indigenous renewable electricity is also a key strategy in ensuring supply diversity.  Currently over 19% of electricity is generated from renewable sources and supports are in place to ensure we attain our target of increasing this to 40% by 2020.  In addition, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, funded and assisted by my Department has, over the past decade, been proactive in maximising energy efficiency.  Several successful initiatives have been undertaken while new initiatives are also being considered which will further improve the efficiency of energy consumption, thus reducing our consumption (including consumption of imported energy) and contributing to security of supply.  As well as enhancing long term energy security, there are detailed operational plans in place to deal with any unexpected short term disruption to energy supplies.  In the unlikely event of a major disruption, EirGrid and Gaslink would implement their respective emergency plans to deal with the situation. </p><p>  On the issue of prices, electricity and gas costs in Ireland are influenced by various drivers, including wholesale gas prices, the cost of capital, exchange rate fluctuations, the small size of the Irish market, geographical location and low population density.  Wholesale gas prices are by far the most significant factor with prices rising since 2009 driven by events in the Middle East, North Africa and Japan and the significant growth in demand from China and India.  At a national level, the competitive energy market in place helps put downward pressure on prices.  There is an ongoing focus on all possible additional actions to mitigate costs for business and domestic customers, including rigorous regulatory scrutiny of the network costs component of retail prices.</p></reply>

This revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund.  In addition, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing.   </p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised.  The establishment of Irish Water presents local government with significant organisational and financial challenges in 2014 and, in this context, it has been necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority until 2015.  This approach allows maximum flexibility in allocating Local Property Tax in 2014 with the priority to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases.   </p><p>  The 2014 Local Government Fund General Purpose Grants will be announced in due course.  In the context of the Local Government Bill 2013 currently before the House, it is proposed that an annual Budget be adopted by each local authority.  While the draft legislation provides Municipal District members with statutory functions in relation to the Budgetary process, there will be no requirement to adopt a Budget at the level of the Municipal District.  I do not propose therefore to make allocations from the Local Government Fund at Municipal District level.</p></reply>

The Building Control Act 1990 firmly places the statutory responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the building regulations on the owners, designers and builders of such buildings.  Earlier in 2013, I signed the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2013 into law with a view to ensuring that effective administrative arrangements are in place by which those responsible can demonstrate how their statutory obligations have been fulfilled.  These Regulations will usher in a new era of quality and a new culture of compliance in an industry where consumers have in recent times too often found that work on their homes does not comply with the minimum requirements set out in the building regulations. </p><p>  For relevant building projects commencing on and from 1 March 2014, the regulations will require design drawings and particulars, certified by a registered construction professional as having been designed to comply with the requirements of the building regulations, to be lodged with the local building control authority; inspections during construction to be undertaken by a registered construction professional known as the assigned certifier; and certificates of compliance in respect of the works or building as completed, to be signed by the builder and the assigned certifier. </p><p>  The owner will be responsible for ensuring that they appoint a competent builder &ndash; a register of builders, contractors and tradespersons known as the Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI) will be established on a voluntary basis for this purpose on or before 1 March 2014 and placed on a statutory footing by 2015 &ndash; and that they employ a competent registered professional to undertake the roles of designer and assigned certifier. </p><p>  In the case of an existing home, the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2013 will only apply to works involving the addition of an extension which is greater than 40 square metres, or to works to an apartment which would require an application for a Fire Safety Certificate. nor works or works of a repair and maintenance nature do not come within the scope of these regulations. Accordingly, the new obligations to lodge drawings, to inspect during construction or to sign statutory certificates would not apply, although the relevant requirements of the building regulations must be complied with in all cases.   </p><p>  It may also be worth noting that the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2013 came into effect on 1 August 2013 and have implications for construction projects in dwellings which involve more than one tradesperson, which involve a particular risk or which extend beyond 30 days or 500 person days. I have no function in relation to this aspect of the matter but it is relevant to a full understanding of the context in which works are undertaken in existing dwellings.</p></reply>

Investment is continuing on the upgrade of the Ballymore Eustace plant and at the Leixlip water treatment plant.  Work at both of these plants has brought additional capacity into the system and further additional supplies will be available when work is completed at both locations during 2014.  In addition, there is a substantial programme of works in train under the Dublin Region Watermains Rehabilitation Project.  Significant water savings have been made and additional savings are anticipated as this work continues.</p></reply>

In addition, the Act contains provisions relating to the setting of rent and rent reviews and sets out the procedures and notice periods that must be complied with when terminating a tenancy.  In circumstances where a receiver is appointed in respect of a rented dwelling it is important that the rights of tenants under both tenancy agreements and the Residential Tenancies Act are protected.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation for each property determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function. Rates income is a very important contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities such as roads, public lighting, development control, parks and open spaces. Locally elected members adopt the annual rate on valuation they consider necessary in order to provide the required services.</p><p>  I am acutely aware of the pressures on businesses at the present time. Local authorities have been asked by my Department to exercise restraint or, where possible, to reduce commercial rates and local charges for 2013. Local authorities have responded well to such requests in recent years and in 2013, 87 out of the 88 rating authorities have either reduced their ARV or kept it the same as in 2012.</p><p>  Local authorities have a leading role in creating a pro-enterprise supportive environment to generate new jobs and sustain existing ones. They are committed to local economic development, and are best placed to meet many of the needs of businesses, in terms of infrastructure, local promotion and other key enabling measures. Under the <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i>, the local government sector has developed a sectoral strategy, <i><i>Supporting Economic Recovery and Jobs &ndash; Locally</i></i><i>,</i><b></b>to promote employment and support local enterprise, including measures in the area of business charges, local enterprise and business support arrangements, procurement support, local development and community-based initiatives, the Green Economy and participation in employment support schemes.  I will continue to keep the approach to rates by local authorities under active review, and am determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency and contain costs in the local government sector.</p></reply>

The END aims to define a common approach intended to avoid, prevent or reduce on a prioritised basis the harmful effects, including annoyance, due to exposure to environmental noise.</p><p>  The END was transposed into national law by the Environmental Noise Regulations 2006, which set out a two-stage process for addressing environmental noise. Firstly, noise must be assessed through the preparation of strategic noise maps for areas and infrastructure falling within defined criteria. Secondly, based on the results of the mapping process, the Regulations require the preparation of noise action plans for each area concerned. The fundamental objective of noise action plans is the prevention and reduction of environmental noise. Responsibility for noise action planning is assigned to local authorities.  The latest round of noise mapping was undertaken during 2012. Local authorities subsequently prepared <font color="#263137">related</font> noise action plans for the period July 2013 to November 2018. These plans were made available for public consultation before being finalised.</p><p>  The measures proposed by noise action plans may include the designation of &lsquo;quiet areas&rsquo;. The Regulations require that a local authority undertakes consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) before submitting a proposal for quiet area designation to me for approval. Proposed quiet areas should have existing low levels of exposure to environmental noise with naturally occurring sounds being the dominant sound source. The purpose of a quiet area designation is to preserve a location as a public amenity space by protecting it from increased exposure to environmental noise. The designation could affect future development in the vicinity of a quiet area if it has the potential adversely to impact on existing low noise levels.     </p><p>  As part of the noise action plan for the Dublin agglomeration, Dublin City Council proposed 8 locations around the city as being suitable for quiet area designation under the Regulations. These are as follows: Blessington Basin, Blessington Street, Dublin 1; Edenmore Park, Raheny, Dublin 5; Mount Bernard Park, Shandon Park, Phibsborough, Dublin 7; Dollymount SAA, Clontarf, Dublin 3 (terrestrial area only, excluding sloblands); St. Anne&rsquo;s Park Raheny, Dublin 5; Palmerston Park, Dartry, Dublin 6; Ranelagh Gardens, Ranelagh, Dublin 6; and The Cabbage Gardens, Cathedral Lane, Dublin 2.</p><p>  Following consideration of the Dublin City Council proposal, I announced on 7 August 2013 that I had approved these locations as being suitable for quiet area designation.  To date no other local authorities have submitted proposals for quiet areas. If considered appropriate as part of its own noise action planning and management, Cork City Council may identify suitable locations for quiet area designation within Cork City and, following consultation with the EPA, submit a proposal to me for consideration.</p></reply>

Therefore, minors under the age of 16 do not in their own right engage directly with the immigration authorities. Children in care in the State are the responsibility of the HSE who liaise with the Garda authorities in the event that a child goes missing.</p><p>  The HSE also has primary responsibility under the Child Care Act, 1991 for the care of separated or unaccompanied children seeking asylum in the State. In that regard, any persons deemed to be unaccompanied minors by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) are referred to the HSE under Section 8 of the Refugee Act, 1996.</p><p>  On referral by the ORAC, the HSE determines whether it is in the child's interest to have an application for asylum made on their behalf.<i></i>  In the event that an application is made, I am advised that the HSE then assists the minor throughout the asylum process, including accompanying the minor during the course of their asylum interview. </p><p>  I am also advised that the HSE takes all necessary steps to ensure the safety and welfare of these young people. Children who are unaccompanied and are seeking asylum are received into the care of the HSE under the Child Care Act 1991. They are allocated a social worker, their needs are assessed and a Care Plan is developed. These children are generally placed in a foster care family placement, although some older children are placed in regulated residential facilities that cater for small numbers. Younger children are, as a matter of policy, placed with families.  The overall numbers of unaccompanied children seeking asylum has decreased significantly in recent years. There were 26 such applications in 2011, 23 in 2012 and 15 in 2013 (to end September).</p><p>  In relation to unaccompanied asylum seekers who are reported to be missing, I can advise the Deputy that my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs who has overall responsibility in this area. However, for the sake of completeness, figures made available to my Department by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs indicate that in 2011 8 unaccompanied minors were declared missing whereas 5 were declared missing in 2012. The corresponding figures for those found or accounted for over the same period were 2 and 3 respectively. Any further detail or information required should be sought from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. </p></reply>

On 8 April 2011, 9 November 2012 and 23 May 2013 I met with both the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers (RACO) and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA). I also attended the PDFORRA Annual Delegate Conference last month and am scheduled to attend the RACO Biennial Delegate Conference next month. At these meetings the Associations raised with me the issues of concern to their membership. In that regard, <i>inter alia</i>  , we discussed the Public Service Agreements; the major reorganisation of the Defence Forces; the reduction in the numbers serving in the Defence Forces and the importance of on-going targeted recruitment and the filling of vacancies in the command structure so as to maintain essential Defence Forces operations and capabilities; promotions; and, in respect of PDFORRA, their request for affiliation to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. </p><p>  On 6 May 2011, I also met with Reserve Defence Forces Representative Association (RDFRA) who outlined their concerns in relation to recruitment and promotion within the RDF so as to maintain its operational capability. All meetings were conducted in a very positive and constructive manner. I confirmed to the Associations that I was committed to maintaining the essential capabilities of the Defence Forces within the resource envelope available. I also assured them of my commitment to Defence Forces participation in international peace support operations and my understanding of the importance of such operations to maintaining military capability and the professional development of the Defence Forces. I recognised the important contribution which the Associations can continue to make to the ongoing modernisation of the Defence Forces. Despite the difficult circumstances we continue to face, it is important that we continue to engage all stakeholders in the process of reform and transformation and address, as far as we can, the concerns of those affected by the difficult decisions sometimes required. I also advised the Associations that they could seek to meet me at any time on issues of concern to them and assured them that my officials would continue to engage pro-actively with them through the various consultative arrangements already in place.</p><p>  My officials meet with RACO and PDFORRA on a regular basis in relation to work within the framework of the Public Service Agreement 2010 &ndash; 2014 and the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013 &ndash; 2016. They also meet regularly in various Council and Council Sub-committee meetings under the auspices of the Defence Forces Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme. </p><p>  My officials meet with RDFRA as required to discuss matters of concern to their members. In addition my officials have been having a series of bi-lateral meetings with RDFRA in relation to the re-organisation of the RDF which is currently underway.  These meetings, chaired by the Deputy Chief of Staff (Support), attended by Military personnel and Departmental staff afford RDFRA an opportunity to raise issues they may have in relation to the re-organisation of the Reserve.  Similar meetings were held with RACO and PDFORRA at which they were afforded the opportunity to raise issues they had in connection with the PDF Cadre support staff in relation to the re-organisation of the Reserve. In addition to these bi-lateral meetings my officials meet with RDFRA as required </p><p>  Military management also meet regularly with the Associations in Military Forum. I am regularly briefed by my officials and by the Military Authorities in relation to the issues and concerns of the Associations. </p><p>  I remain satisfied that there are sufficient and robust systems in place within the Defence Organisation to ensure that issues of concern to members of the Defence Forces are brought to my attention, as appropriate.</p></reply>

The joint Irish/Finnish Battalion is tasked primarily with patrolling, reconnaissance and occupying static posts while operating in close coordination and cooperation with the Lebanese Armed Forces in Sector West of UNIFIL&rsquo;s area of operations.</p><p>  Other missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the EU Training Mission (EUTM) Somalia with eight (8) personnel, including the Mission Commander; the EU Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali) with eight (8) personnel; the EUFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina with seven (7) personnel who are based at mission headquarters in Sarajevo; the NATO-led international security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with twelve (12) personnel based in the mission Headquarters; and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan with seven (7) personnel who are based in the mission Headquarters in Kabul. Ireland also contributes 24 observers and staff to various United Nations and OSCE missions and 16 other personnel to staff appointments at UN, EU and OSCE headquarters.</p><p>  The most recent deployment overseas was in response to a United Nations request and resulted in the deployment of the 43<sup>rd</sup> Infantry Group to United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) on the Golan Heights in Syria.  This deployment was successfully completed on 28 September 2013.  The 43<sup>rd</sup>   Infantry Group is tasked primarily to serve as the Force Mobile Reserve within the UNDOF Area of Responsibility.   A total of 118 Defence Forces personnel are currently serving with UNDOF, including four (4) personnel who were deployed to UNDOF earlier this year for service at the Mission Headquarters.  </p><p>  Also, at the request of the United Nations and following Government approval, four (4) members of the Permanent Defence Force deployed for service with the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) in South Sudan in August 2013.  Their role is to provide a specialist training team on Conventional Munitions Disposal (CMD), mine and specialist search awareness to South Sudan Police personnel.</p><p>  The current contribution of some 560 personnel to overseas missions reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security.  </p><p>  My Department constantly reviews the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas.  Apart from the recent requests to deploy personnel to UNDOF and UNMAS, no other requests have been received.  </p><p><b><i>MEMBERS OF THE PERMANENT DEFENCE FORCE SERVING OVERSEAS</i></b></p><p><b><i>AS OF 01 NOVEMER 2013</i></b><table><tr><th><div>1</div></th><th>UN MISSIONS</th><th> -</th></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) HQ</td><td><div>16</div></td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>UNIFIL 108th Infantry Battalion</td><td><div>332</div></td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>UNIFIL Sector West HQ</td><td><div>8</div></td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>UNTSO (United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation ) Israel &amp;amp; Syria</td><td><div>13</div></td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>MINURSO (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara)</td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>MONUSCO (United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo)</td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>UNOCI (United Nations Mission in Ivory Coast)</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>UNDOF (United Nations Disengagement Observer Force) Golan Heights Syria</td><td><div>118</div></td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>UNMAS (United Nations Mine Action Service ) South Sudan</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>499</div></td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>UN MANDATED MISSIONS</td><td> -</td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>EUFOR (EU led Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina)</td><td><div>7</div></td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>EUTM Somalia (EU led Training Mission)</td><td><div>8</div></td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>EUTM Mali (EU led Training Mission)</td><td><div>8</div></td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>KFOR (International Security Presence in Kosovo) HQ</td><td><div>12</div></td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>ISAF (International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan)</td><td><div>7</div></td></tr><tr><td>  -                 </td><td> TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONNEL SERVING WITH UN MISSIONS</td><td><div>541</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2</div></td><td>ORGANISATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE (OSCE)</td><td> -</td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>OSCE Mission to Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>OSCE Mission in Belgrade &ndash; Serbia</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>Staff Officer, High Level Planning Group Vienna</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>  -                 </td><td> TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONNEL SERVING OSCE</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>3</div></td><td>EU MILITARY STAFF</td><td> -</td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>Brussels</td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>4</div></td><td>MILITARY REPRESENTATIVES/ADVISERS/STAFF</td><td> -</td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>Military Adviser, Permanent Mission to UN, New York</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>Military Adviser Irish delegation to OSCE, Vienna</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>Military Representative to EU (Brussels)</td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>Liaison Office of Ireland, NATO/PfP (Brussels)</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>EU OHQ Operation Althea, Mons, Belgium</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>Irish Liaison Officer to SHAPE &amp;amp; Military Co-Op Division, Mons, Belgium</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>European Defence Agency (EDA) Brussels</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>  -               </td><td> TOTAL NUMBER OF DEFENCE FORCES PERSONNEL SERVING OVERSEAS</td><td><div>560</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

It was not possible in the time available to provide a detailed breakdown showing the ranks of personnel who left. I will provide this information direct to the Deputy once it becomes available.   As the Permanent Defence Force is currently below the agreed stabilised strength of 9,500, it is my intention that targeted recruitment will continue within the resource envelope allocated to Defence. To this end, general service recruitment recommenced in September 2013, from the existing competition panels, from which it is expected there will be an intake of approximately 400 recruits. In addition 20 Apprentices for the Air Corps and 15 Engine Room Artificers for the Naval Service are due to be recruited from current competitions.

However, it is imperative that the Department and the Defence Forces, similar to all other Government Departments, must take into account the current difficult economic environment we are now operating in. The budgetary situation, in the context of the current difficult economic situation, will continue to dictate the level of funding available for new equipment, training and upgrades.  Decisions will be made accordingly on a strictly prioritised basis with a view to maintaining the capability of all roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces.  The Defence Forces has a robust and comprehensive training system which incorporates a wide variety of modern training methods. </p><p>  Training standards in the Defence Forces are constantly benchmarked against best international practice. Participation in ongoing overseas operations also necessitates multi lateral-training and assessment. This facilitates ongoing review of Defence Forces training methods and standards within an international military context.  I am advised that Defence Forces personnel continue to have the most modern and effective range of equipment and technology available for their training and day-to-day roles.</p><p>  I am satisfied that Naval Service training techniques and technologies are up to date in all respects,  with the most up to date equipment, including modern technology and IT equipment available to Naval Service personnel. Preparations for the construction of two new offshore Patrol Vessels are advancing with the first ship due for delivery in early 2014. These modern new vessels, combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair on the other vessels in the fleet, will ensure the Naval Service continues to meet the required operational capability.   A considerable training effort is also involved with the new ships programme to allow for a smooth entry of the first ship into operational service in 2014 and the second ship in 2015.</p><p>  The Air Corps keeps abreast of all developments in modern aviation.  It will continue to conduct its training in accordance with industry best practices and to the highest standards, referencing European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements, using the most modern methods and equipment available.</p><p>  The budgetary situation, in the context of the current difficult economic situation, will continue to dictate the level of funding available for new equipment, training and upgrades.  Decisions will be made accordingly on a strictly prioritised basis with a view to maintaining the capability of all roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

This programme has brought to fourteen the number of barracks closed during that time. To-date nine of these barracks - Clancy (Dublin), Castleblaney, Ballincollig, Fermoy, Naas, Monaghan, Cavan, Castlebar and a large portion of Longford - have been sold.    In relation to the remaining barracks agreement has been reached for the sale of Lifford and Rockhill to Donegal County Council. Discussions in relation to the possible sale of Clonmel Barracks to South Tipperary County Council are at an advanced stage and the remaining part of Longford has been reserved by the OPW for the local Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>  Magee Barracks in Kildare and Columb Barracks in Mullingar remain the property of the Department of Defence. Columb Barracks is currently used by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service for training purposes and a large part of the barracks has been leased to Westmeath GAA Board for use as a potential centre of excellence. </p><p>  In addition to the main barracks a number of other smaller properties have also been identified as surplus to military requirements in recent years. Some of these have already been disposed of whilst others are in the process of being prepared for disposal. These mainly consist of married quarters and Reserve Defence Force premises.</p></reply>

The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities. Unlike many other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions as regards the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties. All promotions and career courses are open to both genders on merit. The Defence Forces prides itself on providing a gender neutral working environment. Policies on equality are being constantly communicated to all ranks. The military authorities are alert and vigilant to this issue and are committed to addressing this matter in a continuing and proactive manner.</p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the strength figures for the period 2008-2012 include personnel who were on secondment to, and being paid by other organisations, or on career breaks. The September 2013 strength figures have been calculated on the basis of actual numbers serving on that date, excluding those members who are on secondment to, and being paid by other organisations, or on career breaks. All future strength figures will be calculated on this basis.</p><p><b><i>TABULAR STATEMENT</i></b></p><p><b><i>STRENGTH OF FEMALES IN THE PERMANENT DEFENCE

However, the Air Corps has a role in assisting and supporting the civil authorities and, in this regard, both they and the Naval Service provide support to these agencies as the need arises and within their available capabilities.    A Service Level Agreement is in place with the Irish Coast Guard which sets out, inter alia, the search and rescue assistance that the Air Corps and Naval Service can provide to the Coast Guard. The provision of onshore assistance by Air Corps helicopters for mountain rescue operations is also covered in the Agreement, as is provision by Air Corps aircraft of fixed wing &lsquo;top cover&rsquo; to Coast Guard helicopters operating offshore.  </p><p>  The Air Corps Maritime Patrol Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of territorial waters using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.  These aircraft are equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance and communication equipment which offers aerial assistance to the Naval Service in patrolling the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone. </p><p>  A Service Level Agreement is in place between my Department and the Department of Health which formalises the arrangements for the provision of emergency inter-hospital transfers by the Air Corps.  In addition, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between my Department and the Department of Health underpins the Air Corps&rsquo; support to the National Ambulance Service for a pilot Emergency Aeromedical Support service, focussing primarily in the west of Ireland and operating out of Custume Barracks Athlone. Following a review of the pilot service carried out by an Audit and Evaluation Group established under the MOU, a Report was submitted for consideration by my colleague, the Minister for Health. Following a subsequent request from the Minister, I have agreed to extend the Air Corps&rsquo; participation in the pilot in order to allow him an opportunity to give consideration to the Report and to examine the options for the implementation of its recommendations. </p><p>  These matters are kept under review and I am satisfied that the Air Corps has the necessary capabilities in these important areas. </p><p>  In July 2013, following Government approval, I launched a Green Paper on Defence. This initiated a consultative process that will inform the development of a new White Paper on Defence.  When finalised, the new White Paper will provide the defence policy framework for the next ten years. </p></reply>

These inspections are mandatory and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must take place annually. In addition, my Department undertakes Nitrates inspections under the Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) regulations on behalf of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>  Rules regarding the advance notification of inspections are clearly laid down in the governing EU regulations and must be adhered to by officials in my Department. In general, all inspections should be unannounced. However, the regulations allow my Department to give up to 14 days notice for land eligibility and cross-compliance inspections involving SMRs other than those related to animal identification and registration, food, feed, and animal welfare. For checks involving cattle and sheep identification and registration the maximum advance notice is 48 hours. For SMRs dealing with feed, food and animal welfare no advance notice may be given and these inspections must take place on an un-announced basis. Where it is considered that the purpose of any type of inspection may be jeopardised by giving notice, the inspection will take place on an un-announced basis. In determining the type of notice to be given for an inspection a number of factors are considered so as to ensure that the inspection process is not jeopardised.  These notification procedures are in accordance with those outlined in my Department&rsquo;s Farmers&rsquo; Charter and Action Plan. </p><p>  The following table provides a breakdown, by county and by year, of the number of unannounced inspections under the Single Payment and Disadvantaged Areas Schemes and the Nitrates (GAP) inspections for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 to end October. The 793 unannounced inspections for 2013 (to end October) equates to 10.35% of the overall total of 7,665 inspections undertaken to date within the above categories.<table><tr><th>County</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td><div>35</div></td><td><div>34</div></td><td><div>12</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td><div>86</div></td><td><div>52</div></td><td><div>13</div></td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td><div>84</div></td><td><div>60</div></td><td><div>52</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td><div>240</div></td><td><div>153</div></td><td><div>54</div></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td><div>163</div></td><td><div>132</div></td><td><div>50</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td><div>18</div></td><td><div>15</div></td><td><div>7</div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td><div>185</div></td><td><div>164</div></td><td><div>104</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td><div>151</div></td><td><div>85</div></td><td><div>31</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td><div>52</div></td><td><div>44</div></td><td><div>11</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td><div>89</div></td><td><div>50</div></td><td><div>25</div></td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td><div>70</div></td><td><div>74</div></td><td><div>15</div></td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td><div>31</div></td><td><div>76</div></td><td><div>22</div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td><div>80</div></td><td><div>96</div></td><td><div>55</div></td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td><div>46</div></td><td><div>37</div></td><td><div>23</div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td><div>20</div></td><td><div>21</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td><div>191</div></td><td><div>88</div></td><td><div>84</div></td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td><div>74</div></td><td><div>59</div></td><td><div>11</div></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td><div>77</div></td><td><div>65</div></td><td><div>18</div></td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td><div>59</div></td><td><div>39</div></td><td><div>14</div></td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td><div>90</div></td><td><div>55</div></td><td><div>32</div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td><div>51</div></td><td><div>62</div></td><td><div>13</div></td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td><div>150</div></td><td><div>127</div></td><td><div>72</div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td><div>41</div></td><td><div>43</div></td><td><div>23</div></td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td><div>63</div></td><td><div>74</div></td><td><div>11</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td><div>70</div></td><td><div>40</div></td><td><div>23</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td><div>53</div></td><td><div>43</div></td><td><div>12</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The minimum landing size provides some protection to juvenile lobster, allowing some spawning to occur before lobsters enter the fishery.  The v-notch regulation prohibits the landing of v-notched lobsters until the notch is repaired by growth (usually occurs over 2-4 years) thus allowing such lobsters to contribute to spawning.  V-notching is a voluntary conservation measure and v-notching rates vary around the coast.</p><p>Recent stock assessments, and evaluation of the existing conservation measures, indicated that spawning stock is not adequately protected and recruitment to lobster stocks may be impaired.  Having examined the issue with my Department&rsquo;s scientific and technical advisers from the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the SFPA, I initiated a consultation process on 20 August 2013 on proposals to change the current lobster stock management rules.  I proposed two alternative measures; either to introduce a <i>maximum</i> landing size of 127mm or to increase the <i>minimum</i>   landing size from 87mm to 90mm.  The consultation documents I published set out in some detail the pros and cons of each option.  Both options assumed the continuation of v-notching at present rates and further measures would be required in the absence of v-notching.  The deadline for submissions was 25 October 2013 and I am now reviewing the in excess of 200 submissions received. I am encouraged by the high level of response received to the consultation from right around the coast.</p></reply>

In advance of that meeting, I also held bilateral meetings with Commissioner Damanaki, Spanish Fisheries Minister Canete, UK Minister Eustice and Scottish Minister Lochead to press Ireland&rsquo;s case.  At the Council meeting, I sought information from the Commission (who negotiate on behalf of the EU at the Coastal States meetings) on the current state of play in the negotiations, details on the Commissions&rsquo; discussion with Norway, a key partner for the EU on this issue, and confirmation that the Commission were prepared to consider an approach to the negotiations that would protect Ireland&rsquo;s interests and at the same time go some way to meeting the legitimate expectations of Iceland and the Faeroes.</p><p>  I argued strongly against rewarding Iceland and the Faeroe Islands for their unacceptable and irresponsible actions in respect of the shared mackerel stock over the past number of years and outlined what I consider must be the fundamental principles for any agreement with Iceland. Specifically, I expressed my view to the Council that any new offer to Iceland must be jointly agreed with Norway on the basis of equal burden sharing and that Iceland should not be granted access to EU waters as a part of any deal. I made it clear that I was not opposed to a deal and recognized that Iceland should be provided with a fair and justifiable quota share.  However, I also made it absolutely clear that any deal must also protect the interests of EU Member States like Ireland who have relied on this fishery for over 40 years.</p><p>  In this regard, I asked that the Commissioner and my fellow Ministers give serious consideration to a proposal developed by the European Pelagic Industry that would involve a tiered approach with different percentage shares for each of the Coastal States depending upon the level of the Total Allowable Catch advice.  The core concept behind this proposal is to protect those fleets that have developed and now depend upon the mackerel fishery over a long number of years.  I was pleased that the Commissioner and many of the Member States took away this concept for more detailed examination in advance of the Coastal State negotiations in London the following week, and with the positive consideration of all of the points raised by me.</p><p>  At the negotiations in London on 23/24 October, in addition to my officials, Ireland was also represented at industry level.  Unfortunately however, there was little by way of concrete progress.  In large part this was due to the fact that a new Norwegian Fisheries Minister had only been appointed the previous week. One positive aspect was that, again at Ireland&rsquo;s instigation, there was a detailed presentation to, and exchange of views with Member States, from the European Pelagic industry on their proposal. </p><p>  Another round of Coastal State negotiations is now due to take place in Clonakilty from 18-22 November.  Ireland will play a constructive role at those negotiations and will leave no stone unturned in an effort to reach a solution that is balanced and fair to all of the parties.</p></reply>

As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees. This will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees.  The Government is providing new, additional funding of &euro;37 million to meet the cost of this measure. </p><p>  The introduction of a universal GP service constitutes a fundamental element in the Government's health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. A well-functioning health system should provide equal access to health care for its patients on the basis of health needs, rather than ability to pay. The principles of universality and equity of access mean that all residents in Ireland should be entitled to access a GP services that is free at the point of use.</p><p>  It has been agreed that a number of options should be set out with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  As part of this work, consideration is being given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation of this universal health service.  A range of options is under consideration with a view to bringing developed proposals to Government shortly.</p></reply>

The number of premises providing such services throughout Ireland has also greatly increased.   The risks associated with body piercing can range from acute infection to allergic reactions.  There is also a risk of hepatitis B and C and HIV with all piercing.  Oral piercings pose particular risks which include tooth damage, airway obstruction, gum swelling and injury. I would encourage anyone who is experiencing any of those symptoms to visit their dentist or GP.</p><p>  There is no legislation in Ireland specifically regulating body piercing business.  However, these businesses are required to comply with general public health and safety legislation in the same way as any other business.   In addition, under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, a Medical Officer of Health, or an Environmental Health Officer is empowered where there is reason to believe that a suspected case of an infectious disease or a probable source of infection exists, to take such steps as are necessary for investigating the nature and source of such infection.</p><p>  High standards of hygiene are necessary when performing body piercing in order to minimise the risks for both the person carrying out the body piercing and the client.  Standard Infection Control Precautions were developed for the health care setting but they can and should be applied to any settings where there is a potential for persons to be exposed to blood or other body fluids including body piercing premises.  It is also advisable that anyone carrying out body piercing receive the hepatitis B vaccination.</p><p>  My Department is reviewing policy regarding body piercing.  In the first instance, the focus is on the development of &ldquo;good practice&rdquo; guidelines for persons carrying out body piercing rather than legislation.  The main objective of the guidelines is to encourage best hygiene practice by body piercers.</p></reply>

For persons person aged 70 or older who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds that apply,  they may also have their eligibility assessed under the means tested medical card scheme. This assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses and the qualifying income thresholds under this scheme are lower than over 70s gross income thresholds.  If a person is means assessed ineligible for a medical card under the general scheme, and that person has other social, medical or financial circumstances relevant to an assessment of their ability to provide for their medical needs or the medical needs of any dependants they may have, these factors will be considered to decide if a medical card or GP visit card should be approved on discretionary grounds under the &lsquo;undue hardship&rsquo; or &lsquo;undue burden&rsquo; provision of the medical card scheme.</p></reply>

This includes 4 companies providing year round scheduled passenger services between Ireland and the UK and France.  It is important to note that all shipping companies servicing routes to and from Ireland are commercial companies.  Any new initiatives to enhance services must be market driven, as it is not government policy to fund international shipping services.</p><p>  Activity in the sector has proved positive this year. Irish shipping and port activity rose by 11% in the second quarter of 2013 when compared to the corresponding period of 2012,according to the latest figures produced by the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO).  In terms of passengers, figures for the first quarter of 2013 show that  ferry passenger numbers travelling to and from Ireland increased by 4% when compared to the corresponding period last year and tourist car numbers increased by 1%.  Competition in the ferry sector is encouraged and I expect services to develop and expand to meet any increased market demands in the future.  In the past, operators have responded to market developments and increased capacity, when required.  My Department through the IMDO works closely with all existing operators and continues to promote Ireland as a location for new services.  Failte Ireland is also involved in active promotion and marketing of sea access routes to Ireland in their role of promoting Ireland as a high quality and competitive tourist destination.</p></reply>

It should be noted that carriages were only reduced at off-peak times.
