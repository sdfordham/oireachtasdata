The Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan sets out a vision of Ireland&rsquo;s offshore renewable energy resource contributing to economic development and sustainable growth, and generating jobs for our citizens. The Plan highlights the importance of coherent policy, planning and regulation, managed in an integrated and collaborative manner.    To coordinate support across Government, the Offshore Renewable Energy Steering Group has been established with relevant Government departments and agencies overseeing the implementation of the plan, focussing on three main areas namely the Environment, Infrastructure and Job Creation. In addition, the Steering Group will hold plenary sessions with external stakeholders annually.</p><p>  The ocean energy sector is at the pre-commercial stage. A range of policies is required to support developers in bringing their devices from prototype to full scale commercial viability. Exchequer support for ocean research, development and demonstration has been provided to the sector in recent years and is being increased under the OREDP. My Department&rsquo;s multi-annual ocean energy development budget was increased by &euro;16.8 million, covering the period 2013 to 2016, and brought the total cumulative funding to &euro;26.3 million. This funding will support the development of the test sites in counties Mayo, Galway and Cork, the Integrated Maritime Energy Resource Cluster at Ringaskiddy, and the Prototype Development Fund operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  Options for an additional &euro;30 million capital funding in the years 2016 to 2018 are being discussed cross-departmentally. T his funding is expected to facilitate innovative projects, like the ESB led Westwave project, that can meet certain compliance criteria. </p><p>  Finally, I should highlight that the OREDP further proposes, subject to State Aid clearance from the European Commission and further Government approval, an initial market support scheme for wave and tidal energy from 2016, limited to 30MW, to unlock the economic growth and job creation opportunities offered by ocean energy development.</p></reply>

The design for the National Postcode System was approved by Government and the brand &lsquo;Eircode&rsquo; was launched for the National Postcode System in April 2014. Capita launched the website earlier this year. Over the last number of months, Capita have engaged with a number of private and public stakeholders to brief them on the project and prepare them for the launch of Eircodes next year. Overall the response to the project has been very positive. In order to support dissemination of Eircodes, the databases of large public sector bodies are being Eircode enabled. This work is expected to conclude by December which means that public sector bodies with large customer facing databases will be in a position to immediately use the codes on launch.An extensive public information campaign will commence early next year to inform the public about Eircodes and promote their usage. This will include outreach activities to ensure the public and especially the vulnerable and hard to reach obtain information on Eircodes in a timely manner. Eircodes are expected to be launched in the second quarter of next year when every household and business in the country will receive a letter containing their Eircode.<br/><br/>The necessary protections will operate around the use of Eircodes to ensure that data protection legislation is complied with. Holders of personal data are bound by Data Protection legislation in how they store and use this data, and the introduction of Eircodes will not alter this obligation<br/><br/>The cost to the Exchequer of the National Postcode System over the 10 year cycle of the contract is expected to be &euro;26m excluding VAT with costs covering design, database upgrades, media and postcode distribution.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-23a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014102300042#WRA00900"><p>Establishing the average cost of energy production, referred to as the levelised cost, is complex and depends on a number of factors such as capital and operational costs, the fuel used, the cost of carbon, the cost of capital, technology, the project lifetime, efficiency and yield. There are a number of publicly available reports that compare the costs of electricity generation at an aggregate level from the various sources of energy including a 2010 report titled &ldquo;Low Carbon Generation Options for the All Island Market&rdquo; which is available on the EirGrid website. More recently, an interim report, prepared for the European Commission, titled "Subsidies and costs of EU energy" was published by the Commission last week. The interim report evaluates the subsidies and levelised costs of various renewable technologies in aggregate across European Member States and highlights the cost effectiveness of onshore wind energy.    The primary support mechanism for renewable electricity from a range of renewable sources is through the Renewable Energy Feed-in-Tariff schemes. These REFIT schemes are designed to provide renewable electricity generators with the certainty required to finance their projects. Based around Power Purchase Agreements between generators and electricity suppliers, REFIT schemes assure a minimum price for each unit of electricity exported to the grid over a defined period. Specifically, depending on the size of a wind project the REFIT tariff is either &euro;69.581 or &euro;72.023 per megawatt hour of electricity exported to the grid. The costs associated with the REFIT schemes are payable from the Public Service Obligation fund, which is raised by a levy on all electricity consumers. Analysis underpinning these rates would have been undertaken and submitted with the application to the European Commission for State Aid approval. </p><p>Furthermore, tax relief is available on capital investment in wind generation assets under Section 486B of the Tax Consolidation Act and under the Employment and Investment Incentive Scheme. An Accelerated Capital Allowance scheme also allows companies to offset the cost of investment in qualifying renewable energy generation technologies against their tax liabilities in Year 1 rather than over a more prolonged period of years, thus aiding cash flow.  </p></reply>

Ireland has a rich ocean resource and has significant potential in this area. Consequently, in order to take forward the Government's ocean energy strategy, an Ocean Energy Development Unit was established in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland in 2009.The Ocean Energy Development Unit has been facilitating the development of the sector through administration of a Prototype Development Fund of grants for industry. SEAI has to date invested or provided grant aid totalling just over &euro;2.6m to ocean wave energy companies from the Fund.

Under this Act, An Post is statutorily required, as the designated universal service provider, to provide a universal postal service. The essential element of this obligation is the collection and delivery of mail to every address in the State on every working day.</p><p>  The Royal Mail is the designated universal postal service provider for the UK. Two reviews of the Royal Mail&rsquo;s universal postal service in the digital age were carried out by Richard Hooper in 2008 and 2010. Subsequently, Royal Mail plc was privatised in October 2013.</p><p>  There are no plans to commission a similar report into the operation of An Post and there is no consideration being given to introducing a similar restructuring of the company or to put in place an employee shareholding scheme. </p><p>  It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company in a position to provide a high quality, nationwide postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focussed network of post offices in the community.</p><p>  That said, the Deputy should be aware that operational matters and the role of developing commercial strategies for the company are matter for the Board and management of An Post and not one in which I have a statutory function. As a shareholder, however, I have a strong interest in relation to the ongoing commercial position of the company and I regularly liaise with the company in this regard.</p><p>An Post has undertaken a programme of capital investment particularly in the computerisation of the post office network and the automation of all post offices. This leaves the network well positioned to become the front office provider of choice for Government and financial services sector.

The Panel met on several occasions since then to consider and approve the terms of reference for comprehensive, route specific studies and reports of fully undergrounded and overhead options for each of the Grid West and Grid Link projects. The studies and reports are required to include assessments of potential environmental impacts, technical efficacy and cost factors. The terms of reference for the work to be carried out were published in May and are available on my Department's website.    EirGrid will either undertake or commission the necessary work in accordance with those terms of reference set by the Panel. In due course, the Panel will provide an opinion to me on the completeness, objectivity and comparability of the studies and reports and will oversee the publication by EirGrid of the two studies and reports prior to EirGrid proceeding to public consultation on the two projects.</p><p>  The Panel was also asked to provide an opinion on the compatibility of the methodologies to be employed on the Grid West and Grid Link projects with what has already been done on the North South project. In July the Panel announced its unanimous opinion that, in all material respects, what has already been done on the North South project is compatible with the methodologies now being employed on the Grid West and Grid Link projects. </p><p>Grid25 comprises over 100 projects ranging from large projects such as Grid West, Grid Link and North South, to smaller projects, station works or upgrades of existing lines around Ireland. EirGrid reviews all projects at regular intervals and is currently undertaking such a review. The overall Grid25 Strategy was forecast to cost up to &euro;4 billion at its launch in 2007. In 2010, the identification and use of new technologies, together with the re-optimisation of the Grid25 programme, enabled EirGrid to reduce the estimated cost of the programme from &euro;4 billion to &euro;3.2 billion, which would represent an estimated 20% saving. The outcome of the current review is expected in the New Year.  </p></reply>

This represents approximately one sixth of all homes in the country.   While applications for grants under the Better Energy Homes Programme have been falling, this has been somewhat offset by a surge in applications under the Better Energy Areas and Communities Schemes, which provide grant funding for local community-based projects, as well as homes. Funding has been maintained for the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme, which provides energy efficiency upgrades free of charge to households in energy poverty. </p><p>  The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan and the Programme for Government include a commitment to roll out a Better Energy Financing scheme, effectively a Pay-As-You-Save type model, for domestic buildings. The key benefit to homeowners of the Better Energy Financing mechanism would be that it would allow them to secure up-front financing for energy efficiency upgrades to their homes. The up-front funding would be repaid via savings on the customers&rsquo; energy bills arising from the energy efficiency measures. </p><p>  My Department worked with SEAI under the direction of a Project Board representing State and industry stakeholders to consider the range of financing options that may be available. As well as accessing expert technical, legal and financial advice, detailed analysis of similar schemes in other jurisdictions was undertaken and a public consultation carried out. My Department is continuing to work with the SEAI to try to identify a viable and attractive financing mechanism. A pilot programme is planned for 2015 to test the market for a Better Energy Financing scheme, the result of which will inform any wider roll-out options. </p></reply>

The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a binding target of having 16% of its final energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020. Ireland is committed to meeting this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy.    The Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP), published earlier this year, is a key milestone in the development of our offshore energy potential. It sets out clearly the Government&rsquo;s policy in relation to the sustainable development of this abundant resource.</p><p>  The OREDP identifies the sustainable economic opportunity for Ireland in the period to 2030 of realising the potential of our indigenous offshore wind, wave and tidal energy resources. The Strategic Environmental Assessment found that 4,500 MW of offshore wind and 1,500 MW of wave and tidal generation could be sustainably developed in Irish waters.</p><p>  A steering group, which draws on the support of relevant Government departments and agencies, will oversee the implementation of the OREDP via three work streams: (i) Environment, (ii) Infrastructure and (iii) Job Creation. The steering group, established in April this year, will report to me annually on progress. </p><p>  Key implementation objectives include: the introduction of an ocean energy tariff in 2016; the development of the offshore energy supply chain; integration with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland clean tech strategies for investment and job creation; input to the new legislative regime for licensing in the marine area; and exploiting opportunities for international collaboration on device development and deployment. </p><p>Onshore wind energy has proved to be the most commercial wind generation technology in the Irish market and the predominant contributor to renewable electricity. This trend is likely to continue in the period to 2020. Analysis of options for increased use of renewable energy is ongoing, with a view to ensuring that our ambition in this area is sustainable, economical and technically feasible.</p></reply>

Analysis underpinning the draft Plan is that an additional bioenergy-focused measure in the heat sector would represent the most cost effective means of meeting a number of different policy goals. Therefore, the draft Plan recommends the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources including wood pellets and other biomass.

In order to fulfil the functions provided for in Section 66 of the Act, the BAI operate an Ownership and Control Policy (the most recent version of which was published in 2012) which sets out the regulatory approach and the rules enforced regarding ownership and control. The policy is used by the BAI to assess applications for broadcasting contracts and when assessing requests for variations to ownership and control structures for existing licencees. It pays particular attention to &ldquo;the desirability of allowing any person, or group of persons, to have control of, or substantial interests in, an undue number of sound broadcasting services in respect of which a sound broadcasting contract has been awarded under this Part&rdquo;.  Part 4 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2014 updates legislation in regard to media mergers, strengthening protection of the public interest in maintaining a pluralistic media market. The Act recognises the vital role played by the media in our open democratic society. The most significant element of this section of the Act is a new public value test, involving a more thorough definition of media concentration than before and which deals specifically with cross media ownership.<br/><br/>The Act introduces significant new responsibilities for the BAI in relation to protecting the public interest in maintaining media pluralism in the State. This includes new requirements to conduct research on matters relating to plurality of the media and to publish the results of such research. Furthermore the BAI are, if requested, required under the Act to conduct a &lsquo;Phase 2&rsquo; investigation of proposed media mergers in regards to the potential impacts on the public interest in maintaining a pluralistic media market in the state.</p></reply>

The principal benefit to the economy from the offshore oil and gas sector arises from producing fields. These benefits include the direct return to the Exchequer, the significant economic activity that arises from the development stage of a project as recently evidenced by the Corrib gas project, together with a strengthening of Ireland&rsquo;s security of energy supply.  The long-term aim of the sectoral strategy of promoting the opportunity to invest in exploration in the Irish offshore is aimed at increasing the likelihood of new commercial discoveries being made, which would result in the benefits outlined. </p><p>  Exploration activities in the Irish offshore do give rise to some employment opportunities in ancillary supply/support areas such as ports. Until there is a much higher level of exploration activity in the Irish offshore, however, the opportunities will remain relatively limited. </p><p>  Whilst wishing to maximise the employment potential arising we must of course be cognisant of our EU and wider treaty obligations in respect of the free movement of labour.</p></reply>

Owing to this critical role played by the media it is vital to the public interest that the State protect media pluralism as far as is practicable.  In March 2008, an advisory group was established to review the existing legislative framework regarding the public interest aspects of media mergers in Ireland. The Group&rsquo;s recommendations were incorporated in the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014. One key change was the passing of responsibility for the Media Mergers process from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to me in my capacity as the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The Act enhances our ability to pursue the public interest in protecting media pluralism. It provides for a determination to be made on whether a proposed media merger should be permitted or not based on its effect on the plurality of media in the State and on its implications on the concentration of ownership in media. It conveys further powers on the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) to assist in a thorough &lsquo;Phase 2&rsquo; of a proposed merger, if so requested, and gives the BAI further responsibilities to conduct and publish ongoing research into media pluralism in the State.Taken together with our long standing support for public service broadcasting, I am confident that we have a robust and effective set of measures in place to support and encourage a plural and diverse media.  </p></reply>

I have no statutory function in the matters of monitoring or setting of gas and electricity prices.   The CER does not decide the retail prices charged by any of the various suppliers of electricity and gas, including the prices charged by commercial State companies. Competitive and commercial markets offer choice in terms of suppliers, products, and prices and minimise the potential for negative impacts on competitiveness and consumers.</p><p>  Prices are set competitively by suppliers in the electricity and gas retail markets and their pricing decisions are wholly commercial matters for them. The CER carries out statutory market monitoring functions under SI No. 630 of 2011 to ensure the market operates competitively to the benefit of the consumer. The CER also has the power to take whatever action it considers necessary to prevent any restrictions in competition and to ensure that customers benefit from competition in the supply of gas and electricity.</p><p>  Energy efficiency represents a significant opportunity for households to reduce their energy costs. There are energy efficiency measures in place to assist both business and domestic energy consumers, with significant funding allocated to them. Promotion of indigenous sustainable sources of energy also helps to offset the impact of volatile fossil fuel prices. The Government has a target of 40% of electricity being generated from renewable sources by 2020. Steady progress has been made in meeting this target and its realisation will introduce more certainty in the energy fuel mix as well as boosting security of supply. </p><p>  Data on average electricity prices are in the public domain and are published in the SEAI &quot;Electricity and Gas Prices in Ireland&quot; reports and these are available on the SEAI's website.

There is no price control in the oil sector and it is Government policy to encourage price competition and consumer choice.  The Commission for Energy Regulation has no statutory function in the regulation of petrol and diesel prices. The Maximum Prices Order was removed in 1991 and the market was deregulated. Similarly, I have no statutory function in the setting of oil, petrol or diesel prices. The price paid at the pump by consumers is largely determined by taxation levels, the internationally traded price of crude oil and the consequent price at which refined product is traded in Europe, along with the level of competition in the retail market.<br/><br/>Oil has been virtually eliminated from the power sector in Ireland (1% of power was oil generated in 2012) and its main use is in transport and home heating. 100% of oil used in Ireland is imported. Home heating oil prices paid by consumers reflect volatile market prices, transportation costs, trends in exchange rates and other operating costs along with taxation.<br/><br/>The Irish Petroleum Industry Association have noted in their publication <i>What determines pump prices?</i>that while the long-term trend in the price of crude oil has generally had an effect on the price of refined products, the pressures of supply and demand for refined products have tended to lag those of crude oil and can be affected by other forces.<br/><br/>The National Consumer Agency has specific responsibilities for protecting the rights of consumers. In December 2008, the National Consumer Agency published an <i>Investigation into Petrol and Diesel Price Movements</i>which concluded that:<i>&quot;</i>There is little evidence to suggest unwarranted delays in the passing on of wholesale price changes to the consumer at the pump. Direct comparison between fluctuations in crude oil prices and petrol and diesel pump prices is inappropriate and does not reflect the reality of the petrol and diesel supply chain. &hellip;.Examination of the accounts of the larger oil companies in Ireland suggest there is relatively modest profit to be made in the downstream supply of refined oil products<i>.&quot;</i></p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are approximately 73,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million in 2014.  </p><p>  Prospective tenants are finding it increasingly difficult to secure accommodation due to the reduced availability of properties, particularly in areas of high demand.  Raising rent limits may not be the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers, their families and students. I plan to keep the matter under close review.</p><p>  Increasing housing supply and the re-activation of the construction activity is a critical issue for Government and key to restoring stability to the rental market. As part of Budget 2015, Government has announced significant capital investment of over &euro;2.2 billion for social housing for the next three years.  In 2014, over &euro;800 million will be invested in a range of housing programmes which represents the first major investment in housing since 2009.  </p><p>  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Alan Kelly TD, is also due to publish a Social Housing Strategy shortly which will provide a basis for an improved and sustainable approach to the provision of social housing supports in Ireland. </p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience in dealing with customers and make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met, including through the use of their discretionary statutory powers as necessary. A notice reminding staff of their discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy was circulated earlier this year.  The fact that approximately 1,700 people are in receipt of rent supplement in Kerry, of which over 500 were awarded this year, shows that a significant number of persons are being accommodated under the scheme in this region.</p></reply>

It is a condition for receipt of FIS that the claimant must have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them.  A qualified child is one under the age of 18 or one between the ages of 18 and 22 who is attending full-time education by day.  Entitlement to FIS is renewed each year on the anniversary of the original claim.</p><p>  Once the appropriate rate of FIS due is determined it generally continues to be payable at that same rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the person remains in full-time employment.  The two principal exceptions to this are where there is an additional qualified child in the family or (with effect from July 2013) where payment of One-parent Family (OFP) ceases due to the youngest child reaching the OFP age threshold.  The person concerned was originally awarded FIS from October 2008.  Accordingly, her 52 week entitlement period ran from October to October each year.  She ceased to claim OFP in June 2013 for a reason other than her youngest child reaching the OFP age threshold.  This was during her 52 week entitlement period from October 2013 to October 2014.  She was not entitled to an increase in her FIS entitlement at that time.  The legislative provision allowing for a review of FIS is effective only from July 2013 and covers the loss of OFP arising from the youngest child reaching the OFP age threshold and no other reason.</p><p>  The person concerned applied to have her FIS renewed from October 2013.  As her income had reduced due to the fact that she was no longer in receipt of OFP, her FIS rate was increased by &euro;132 per week from the previous year.  Her youngest child reached the age of 22 years in February 2014 however, in accordance with the regulations, FIS continued to be paid at the same rate until her next renewal date (October 2014).  The person concerned applied to have her FIS renewed from October 2014, however, the claim was refused as the person concerned no longer had a qualified child under the age of 22.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-23a.155.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014102300048#WRG01700"><p>With regard to the application of VAT on electricity bills, in accordance with section 37(1) of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010, the amount on which VAT is chargeable is the total consideration receivable by the supplier, "including all taxes, commissions, costs and charges whatsoever", but not including the VAT itself.  This reflects EU VAT law, with which Irish tax law must comply.  In this regard, Article 78 of the EU VAT Directive provides that the taxable amount shall include "taxes, duties, levies and charges, excluding the VAT itself".</p><p>  In this respect, where the charge for a supply of service, such as an electricity bill, includes the Public Service Obligation levy, VAT law dictates that VAT should be calculated on the PSO levy element of the charge as well as the charge for the service.  The same situation applies in the case of other excises, including for example excises on petrol, auto-diesel, tobacco and alcohol products.</p><p>  With regard to the level of the PSO levy, my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy &amp;amp; Natural Resources, informs me that the levy has been in place since 2001 and is the overall support mechanism for electricity generation constructed for security of supply purposes, including peat generation, and for the development of renewable electricity. It is levied on electricity customers only. There is no PSO levy associated with gas bills. The levy is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by PSO funded producers. The PSO levy is vital to enable Ireland to meet its 2020 40% target for electricity generated from renewable sources by 2020, which in turn is important for the achievement of Ireland's 16% EU 2020 target for renewable energy.</p><p>  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources further informs me that the biggest driver for the levy rise for this year is the lower predicted wholesale market electricity price, which is currently estimated to be around 10% lower than last year.  This results in lower predicted market income for the PSO plants and, therefore, a higher levy is required to cover their allowed costs.  The lower wholesale electricity price is currently being driven by lower international gas prices in evidence since spring 2014.  This drives up the proposed PSO levy.  However, if these lower gas and wholesale prices are sustained, it will reduce the wholesale cost of electricity that suppliers pay.  In turn, suppliers should be in a position to reduce their retail prices and potentially offset the PSO levy increase. Increased competition in the retail electricity sector recently should help offset some of this increase.  The Commission for Energy Regulation is tasked with retail market monitoring and executes this role vigorously to ensure competition leads to the fairest prices for customers.</p></reply>

Petrol stretching involves the illegal addition of a low tax commodity to petrol to defraud motorists and the State. The numbers of complaints of this kind received by Revenue in counties Mayo, Roscommon, Galway and Leitrim in the period since July 2014 is 31, comprised of 1 in July, 7 in August, 17 in September and 6 to 21 October 2014. An analysis of the complaints on a county basis is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Complaints Received in Relation to Petrol Stretching </th><th>#</th><th>#</th><th>#</th><th>#</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>July </td><td>August </td><td>September </td><td>October </td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon </td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></table>Revenue investigates all complaints of this kind and fuel samples are taken from filling stations and referred to the State Laboratory for analysis where the investigating officers have reason to suspect excise fraud. To date 48 premises nationwide have been tested with samples referred to the State Laboratory.<br/><br/>Conclusive results have been received in one case which confirms contamination through the presence of kerosene and Revenue are considering the possibility of prosecution in this case.  Final results are awaited in respect of the other samples referred for analysis.  It is understood the State Laboratory is reviewing its existing procedures with a view to expediting testing which, I am informed is quite complex.<br/><br/>Petrol stretching is an offence under section 102 (1A) of the Finance Act 1999. The Deputies can be assured that, if Revenue's investigations and the analysis of fuel samples indicate the presence of illegal stretching agents in petrol, Revenue will take action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.<br/><br/>I understand also that Revenue has been in contact with the motor and fuel trades about the reported problems. Cooperation with the fuel trade has been an important element in the successful work undertaken in recent years to combat fuel fraud, and can play a key role in addressing any further issues that come to light. It is essential, in particular, that petrol distributors report on any reduction in the pattern of legitimate supplies of fuel to the retail trade which may indicate that specific traders are shifting some of their sourcing to illegal fuel.<br/><br/>Motorists themselves should take care about where they source their petrol, and should report any suspicions to Revenue. Revenue has recently launched a dedicated section of its website specifically dealing with the shadow economy and this includes an electronic reporting facility for anyone who has information about shadow economy practices including the adulteration of fuel.<br/><br/>The first point of contact for motorists whose vehicles may have been affected should be their motor insurance companies. Persons affected should also contact the point of purchase of the fuel. If they remain unsatisfied, they may have recourse to civil remedies and should seek legal advice.<br/><br/>All trading entities are obliged to ensure that they are correctly registered for all taxes as required by legislation. In addition, a person engaged in the sale of petrol or diesel is required to hold an auto fuel trader's licence or a marked fuel trader's licence. Revenue enforces this licensing requirement rigorously and also acts to ensure that businesses of this kind are conducted in accordance with licence requirements. Action is taken in any case where unlicensed trading, or failure to comply with a licence's terms and conditions, is encountered. In the period from 2011 to date, more than 130 filling stations were closed, mainly for breaches of licensing conditions.<br/><br/>In summary an extensive range of new measure has been introduced over recent years to tackle fuel fraud, including enhanced supply chain controls and the acquisition of a more effective fuel marker. Key measures include the following:<br/><br/>- The licensing regime for auto fuel traders was strengthened with effect from September 2011 to limit the ability of the fuel criminals to get laundered fuel onto the market;<br/><br/>- A new licensing regime was introduced for marked fuel traders in October 2012, which is designed to limit the ability of criminals to source marked fuel for laundering;<br/><br/>- New requirements in relation to fuel traders' records of stock movements and fuel deliveries were introduced to ensure data are available to assist in supply chain analysis;<br/><br/>- New supply chain controls were introduced from January 2013 following  significant investment in new IT systems. These controls require all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, to make monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions.  Revenue is using this data to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution that will support follow-up enforcement action where necessary, and <br/><br/>- An intensified targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations.<br/><br/>In addition to the measures implemented to date, Revenue has, in partnership with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the UK identified a more effective fuel marker and it is expected that a new marker will be introduced in both jurisdictions early in 2015 following consultation with the oil industry and other stakeholders.<br/><br/>To support further the integrity of the distribution system and minimise the risk of fraud, I introduced a provision in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 that will make a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel for a use connected with excise fraud liable for the duty at the standard rate of tax. This new provision will strengthen Revenue's hand in dealing with those traders supplying rebated fuel recklessly to dubious customers and will provide a further disincentive to such activity. Revenue has published guidelines for mineral oil traders which will assist them in identifying and avoiding such transactions.  I am committed to providing new measures to further assist Revenue in its work against fuel fraud should it be required.<br/><br/>I am advised also that the Revenue Commissioners work in close cooperation with other enforcement authorities, in this jurisdiction and in Northern Ireland, to combat this all-island problem. The Cross Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group, which includes representatives of the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other relevant organisations, was established to facilitate this cooperation, and has proven effective in supporting the identification and targeting of the organised crime gangs, many of whom have links to paramilitaries and former paramilitaries, that are responsible for the bulk of fuel fraud. All enforcement authorities engaged in combatting fuel fraud are committed to working closely together on an on-going basis in this important work.</p></reply>

The list of approved bodies for the purposes of Section 848A, which includes eligible charities, bodies approved for education in the arts and eligible primary, secondary and third-level institutions, is available on the Revenue website at .<br/><br/>For donations made pre-2013, the precise arrangements for allowing tax relief on donations varied depending on whether the donor was a PAYE only taxpayer, a chargeable person subject to self-assessment or a company. For a PAYE only donor, the relief was given on a &quot;grossed up&quot; basis to the eligible charity or approved body, rather than by way of a separate claim to tax relief by the donor. The claim for refund was made by the eligible charity or approved body in respect of the PAYE donor. In the case of a self-assessed donor, that individual claimed the relief and there was no grossing up arrangement. In the case of a company, it would claim a deduction for the donation as if it were a trading expense. For donations made after 1 January 2013, relief in the case of PAYE and self-assessed donors is payable to the charity at a blended rate of 31%. Companies can continue to claim the deduction.<br/><br/>The level of income tax relief on donations to charities and other approved bodies in respect of donations by PAYE, self-employed and corporate donors for 2012 is as shown in the following table. The figures for 2013 are available at the current time in respect of PAYE-only donors.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Estimated Cost of Relief &euro;M</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>24 (PAYE-only donors)</td></tr></table></p></reply>

However, the exemption will only be of benefit to those artists who are liable to income tax in Ireland. The exemption will not apply in their home country. The reason behind this change is to ensure that the scheme is compatible with EU law.

Section 53(10) provides for exclusions from the Board of Directors. These exclusions from membership of the Board are required to avoid conflicts of interest and to ensure division of responsibilities between the executive and the Board. The clear distinction of roles is fundamental to the governance requirements and is essential to ensure that a workable governance structure is created in all credit unions, regardless of nature, scale or complexity, and to ensure the safeguarding of members' savings. </p><p>  The Commission's Report was agreed by all members of the Commission including credit union representative bodies as well as independent individuals, and sought direct engagement from credit unions to ensure that its recommendations took account of a broad range of perspectives.</p></reply>

Share based employee remuneration can significantly reduce fixed labour costs and capital requirements, thereby providing significant cash-flow benefits to an enterprise, particularly a high potential start-up. The extent to which a company can avail of tax efficient share based employee remuneration relief in Ireland, compared to other countries, plays a significant part in this country&rsquo;s attractiveness to both entrepreneurs and multinational corporations.</p><p>  Irish tax legislation allows for many types of schemes which facilitate employers who wish to allocate shares, or grant options to buy shares, to their employees. These include share option schemes, &lsquo;save as you earn&rsquo; share option schemes, approved profit sharing schemes, restricted share schemes and employee share ownership trusts.  It should be noted that there is no charge to Employer PRSI on share-based remuneration.   The Government believes that the aforementioned schemes provide support and encouragement for employees to become involved in Employee Financial Involvement.</p><p>  The recently published National Policy Statement on Entrepreneurship in Ireland contains an action to create a business environment, in terms of company law, taxation, regulation and licensing, which makes it is easy to start and grow a new business and makes Ireland one of the most attractive environments for entrepreneurship in Europe.  My colleagues and I in Government are considering share ownership and other such measures contained in the Report.  This discussion will feed into the Action Plan for Jobs process, which underpins the importance of fostering an environment that supports entrepreneurial activities and assists small businesses to expand, create jobs and contribute to national economic growth.</p></reply>

Details of the number of these site visits during this period are set out in the tabular statement (A).  <br/><br/>The Forfas Annual Employment Survey reports on the number of jobs created and lost in companies that are supported by the enterprise development agencies.  Data is collected on an annualised basis so the latest figures to hand are for 2013.  Figures for 2014 will not be available until year end.  Details of the total number of IDA Ireland supported full time and part time jobs in each year from 2009 to 2013 on a county by county basis, as well as the number of IDA Ireland client companies in each county in each of the years from 2009 to 2013 inclusive are shown in the attached tabular statement (B).  <br/><br/>The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 includes a commitment to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises.  My intention is that the framework will be developed on a pilot basis initially, focusing on the Midlands region, and involving the agencies under the remit of my own Department &ndash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices.  The objective is to enhance synergies between the agencies and their client companies and build on the competitive strengths of the region to maximise the potential for job creation.  The role which other public bodies in the region can play in working towards this objective will also be examined as the project develops.  The aim is that this framework will serve as a model for other regions of the country.<br/><br/><b>TABLE A</b><br/><br/><b>Table showing the number of IDA Ireland sponsored site visits by potential

I am assured that Garda&iacute; are working closely with the community in the areas referred to in relation to these issues.</p><p>  Tallaght District is patrolled by uniform and plain clothes units, Community Policing Units, the Street Crime Unit and the Drugs Unit, supplemented as necessary by the Divisional Traffic Unit and Crime Task Force. The Community Police Units have lead responsibility for policing in this area and have developed a partnership approach to problem solving with the community. Local Garda management has put in place targeted proactive measures, including increased patrols and checkpoints, which will focus patrols on the most vulnerable areas.</p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of all resources, including personnel, among the Garda Regions, Divisions and Districts. Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources. </p><p>  Specifically in relation to the Dublin Metropolitan Division (DMR) South, as of 31 August 2014 there were 556 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Division, of which 172 Garda&iacute; are assigned to Tallaght Garda station.  As of 21 October 2014 the number of vehicles allocated to the Tallaght District is 32.</p><p>  More generally the Deputy will also be aware that I recently announced the intake of 200 new Garda recruits in addition to the 100 who commenced training in September this year. Furthermore the provision of an additional &euro;10 million will support the purchase and fit-out of over 400 new vehicles which will come on stream in 2015.</p><p>  I am advised that Garda management will continue to appraise the policing and administrative strategy employed in the DMR South Division with a view to ensuring an effective Garda service is maintained and when additional resources next become available the needs of the Division will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.</p></reply>

To date no individuals have been charged or files forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are continuing to investigate the complaints and are liaising with the injured parties. Furthermore, contact has also been made with the Revenue's Customs Service who have arranged to have fuel samples analysed for contaminants. <br/><br/>As the Deputy will appreciate, petrol stretching is a matter of serious concern because of the risks to the Exchequer, the threat to legitimate businesses and the damage that can be caused to the vehicles of unsuspecting purchasers of adulterated fuel. Under Section 102 of the Finance Act 1999, it is an offence to sell and/or deliver oil on which Mineral Oil Tax at the appropriate rate has not been paid. <br/><br/>I am informed  that in the normal course of work  Revenue's enforcement staff take samples of fuel, which are sent to the State Laboratory for scientific analysis, from mineral oil suppliers, including filling stations, to ensure compliance with mineral oil regulations. If the results of the analysis reveals the presence of any illegal stretching agents, the Revenue Commissioners will take action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible. <br/><br/>I am further advised that Revenue and the oil sector have cooperated very successfully to tackle diesel laundering and are confident that, with this co-operation and with the supply chain information available to Revenue, the problem of petrol stretching can also be tackled successfully. In this regard it is essential that petrol distributors report on any reduction in the pattern of legitimate supplies of fuel to the retail trade which may indicate that specific retailers are shifting some of their sourcing to laundered or &quot;stretched&quot; fuel. <br/><br/>In addition, motorists themselves should take care with regard to their source of petrol and report any suspicions concerning adulterated fuel which may have damaged their engines to Revenue who will investigate such reports and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible. In that regard Revenue has recently launched a dedicated section of its website at www.revenue.ie specifically on the shadow economy and this includes an electronic reporting facility for anyone who has information about shadow economy practices such as petrol stretching. <br/><br/><b>Number of complaints of petrol stretching </b><br/><br/><b>Garda Divisions of Mayo, Roscommon/Longford, Galway &amp;amp; Sligo/Leitrim </b><br/><br/><b>July-October (to date) 2014</b><br/><br/><b><i>Table 1- Mayo Garda Division</i></b><table><tr><th>Month </th><th>Claremorris Garda District </th><th>Ballina Garda<br /><br />District </th><th>Westport Garda<br /><br />District </th></tr><tr><td>July </td><td>9</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>August</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>September </td><td>85</td><td>20</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>October (as at 21 October) </td><td>37</td><td>6</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>133</td><td>26</td><td>1</td></tr></table><br/><br/><b><i>Table 2- Roscommon/Longford Garda Division</i></b><br/><br/><br/><br/><table><tr><th>Month </th><th>Roscommon Garda District </th><th>Castlerea Garda District </th></tr><tr><td>July </td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>August </td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>September </td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>October (as at 21 October)</td><td>4</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>5</td><td>1</td></tr></table><br/><br/><b><i>Table 3- Galway Garda Division</i></b><br/><br/><br/><br/><table><tr><th>Month </th><th>Loughrea Garda District </th></tr><tr><td>July </td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>August </td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>September</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>October (as at 21 October)</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>4<br /><br /></td></tr></table><br/><br/><b><i>Sligo/Leitrim Division </i></b><br/><br/>There were no complaints of petrol stretching made to An Garda Sioch&aacute;na in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Sligo/Leitrim Division during the period in question.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-23a.295.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014102300055#WRO00900"><p>The Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) has already made a very important impact, in that its establishment opened up the conclusion of informal debt deals between debtors and creditors. Creditors were not offering debt restructuring deals to people struggling with debt, even at the informal level, before the Insolvency Service opened its doors. Now they are. That is a key change.  <br/><br/>The uptake of the new formal insolvency solutions provided under the Personal Insolvency Act has, so far, been substantially slower than expected. This is a matter of concern, but it is one which ISI has fully acknowledged and is taking steps to address. <br/><br/>Recent qualitative research undertaken for ISI has confirmed three important obstacles to the uptake of insolvency measures. Firstly, up-front charges for insolvency and bankruptcy seem to be a barrier in practice in the Irish context, even though they are largely equivalent to those charged in other jurisdictions. Secondly, it would appear that many people are struggling to pay their debts unaided, and feel ashamed - which, of course, they should not - to seek an arrangement of any kind. Thirdly, people stressed by serious debt problems easily become isolated from mainstream media, and many have not been aware that insolvency solutions can help them. <br/><br/>I have just approved a package of immediate, concrete measures to address these barriers. Regarding the costs barrier, I have agreed to waive all fees previously payable to either the ISI or the courts by a debtor who applies for any of the debt solutions available under the Personal Insolvency Act &ndash; a Personal Insolvency Arrangement, a Debt Settlement Arrangement or a Debt Relief Notice. This waiver was announced earlier this month by ISI, and  takes effect until the end of 2015, when it will be reviewed. <br/><br/>ISI has also announced that for the same period, it will provide a contribution of 750 euro to defray the cost of a Personal Insolvency Practitioner, if a reasonable insolvency proposal by a debtor is refused by creditors.  The debtor should not be faced with a bill arising from the creditor's refusal in this situation.<br/><br/>I hope to shortly be in a position to also announce reductions in bankruptcy costs.<br/><br/>As regards  the information barriers, ISI has just launched a targeted nationwide information campaign which will run in a series of locations around the country, using townhall meetings and  local media. It is designed to reach deeply indebted households more effectively, to directly address their concerns and to demonstrate through personal testimony that the Insolvency Act remedies are available and are working to help people out of their difficulties. <br/><br/>The initial indications are that these practical measures are already making a substantial difference, and my Department and ISI will continue to assess their impact.  <br/><br/>More broadly, I continue to keep all aspects of the personal insolvency legislation under careful ongoing review. The <i>Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016 </i>provides, in particular, for the completion of a review of the operation of the Insolvency Service by the end of this year, to ensure that the Service has the powers needed to support families willing to work their way through their debt problems. </p></reply>

The Report also highlights the increasing service challenge facing the Agency, with 9,548 cases waiting to be allocated to a dedicated social worker.  </p><p>  Approximately one third of these, (3,240 cases), were deemed to be high priority. These cases represent a mix of new referrals that need further assessment and social work input, as well as children known to the Agency who need a continuing social work service.  I am assured by the Agency that emergency cases are dealt with immediately and that high priority cases are kept under review.  We must ensure that the most vulnerable children in our society receive a timely and appropriate response.</p><p>  The data and analysis contained in &quot;Measuring the Pressure&quot; provides critical management information to assist the Agency in service planning and resource allocation. </p><p>  The Agency is in receipt of funding of &euro;6.7m this year to alleviate identified service pressures and to support the continuing implementation of the reform programme across children and family services.  </p><p>  This funding is being targeted at a number of areas, including the replacement of staff on maternity leave by way of a 12 month temporary contract.  Latest figures indicate that at the end of August, 164 staff were on maternity leave, 82 of whom were social workers. The Agency is also finalising proposals for the introduction of a guaranteed and protected one year induction programme for newly qualified social workers.  </p><p>  These initiatives are designed to assist the Agency in responding to identified service pressures and to provide for a targeted response to such pressures, taking account of identified need and available resources.</p><p>  On foot of Budget 2015, the Agency will have a budget of &euro;635 million, including over &euro;12 million in capital funding. This represents an increase of &euro;26 million - or 4.3% - over the 2014 budget. This additional funding will allow the Agency to build on the extensive programme of reform that is already underway across services for children and families.</p><p>  These additional resources will be vitally important in alleviating pressures on services - right across child welfare and protection services, for example in supporting implementation of Children First on a statutory basis - and will be used to build on initiatives commenced by the Agency this year.</p><p>  Tusla has already embarked on a programme of reform designed to realise the benefits of cost containment and to ensure that everyone using Tusla services experiences a consistent - and high quality - standard of service. The additional funding made available in Budget 2015 will enable the Agency to consolidate and build on this work, which will bring all services into a single National Service Delivery Model.</p></reply>

The total number of cases by 17 October in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone is 9191, with 4546 deaths.  The WHO officially declared the outbreak in Senegal over on 17 October, and the outbreak in Nigeria over on 20 October.<br/><br/>The European Centres for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) concluded that the risk of a case in the EU is considered to be low in its latest risk assessment. Environmental conditions in Ireland do not support the natural sources or vectors of Ebola.  Consequently, the risk of transmission in Ireland is considered very low.<br/><br/>The EU Decision No 1082/2013/EU on serious cross-border threats to health, agreed under the Irish Presidency, provides a coherent framework for tackling all serious cross-border public health threats.  It addresses three main areas:<br/><br/>- preparedness and response planning;<br/><br/>- risk monitoring and assessment; and <br/><br/>- risk management and crisis communication.<br/><br/>The EU response to the health issues raised by the outbreak is being coordinated through the EU Health Security Committee which consists of representatives of the 28 Member States and the Commission.  The Committee has held a number of audio conferences on Ebola since the outbreak began.  The latest was held this week, with another meeting scheduled for next week.<br/><br/>These meetings have focused on:<br/><br/>- preparedness in Member States,<br/><br/>- coordination of the response amongst Member States,<br/><br/>- support to affected countries, and<br/><br/>- repatriation of EU nationals. <br/><br/>The National Public Health Emergency Team is the forum for coordinating the response between the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive during the planning and response phases of a public health emergency.  It has met a number of times in recent weeks to coordinate preparedness in the Irish health services and will meet weekly to review progress and coordinate the response to any cases in Ireland.<br/><br/>The Management of Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers in Ireland (VHF) is the national guideline for the management of any case of Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers, including Ebola, in Ireland.  They were published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) in 2012.  Parts of this guidance have been updated in light of the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa.  The key elements to the guidelines include:<br/><br/>- the need for vigilance in considering the possibility of VHF in a person with a fever who has recently returned (within 21 days) from travel to an endemic area,<br/><br/>- the institution of appropriate infection control measures if a case is suspected,<br/><br/>- rapid testing and diagnosis of the case, and<br/><br/>- the management of his/her contacts.<br/><br/>Given appropriate infection control measures, an outbreak with extensive community transmission is extremely unlikely. <br/><br/>The HPSC have produced specific information for travellers and people who have returned recently form affected areas. This includes specific information for humanitarian workers who may wish to volunteer to provide their services in the affected countries.<br/><br/>Advice for airport and port managers that had been developed was circulated to all relevant stakeholders.  This information was posted on the HPSC website.  The guidance document, <i>Update for Airport Managers and Airlines on Ebola Virus Disease</i>was posted on 22 August 2014 and the guidance document <i>Update for Port Managers and Ferry Companies on Ebola Virus Disease</i>was posted on 5 September 2014.  Posters (in English, French and Irish) - <i>Returning from West Africa? Important information about Ebola</i>&ndash; were printed and distributed to all airports and the main designated seaports.  They have been placed in prominent positions in full line of sight of all arriving passengers and crews in the arrivals areas of these locations.  <br/><br/>The health sector response is the major element of Ireland&rsquo;s national Ebola preparedness.  Firstly, it provides the expert advice and guidance to other Departments and, secondly, it puts in place the specific arrangements for an appropriate public health and clinical response to any case that might arise in this country. The HSE has established a cross directorate group to fast track training of front line health care staff and this group is developing a plan to do so. In addition, the Acute Hospitals Directorate has established an Ebola response management group to increase preparedness across all hospitals.<br/><br/>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has provided extensive information for hospital clinicians, general practitioners and other healthcare workers to enable rapid identification and management of suspected Ebola cases. Healthcare workers in the National Isolation Unit and hospitals around the country have received information and advice on identification and management of Ebola patients.  There is also extensive guidance relating to infection prevention and control which clearly describes the steps that staff must take to ensure that they protect themselves and other patients in the event of the presentation of a case or suspected case of Ebola.  Two information sessions on Ebola and relevant guidance will take place this week and representatives of the National Isolation Unit will also attend to answer any queries that hospitals may have.<br/><br/>The National Isolation Unit located at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, is the national referral centre for high risk suspected and confirmed cases of Ebola. The self-contained unit has 12 beds and is designed to admit, isolate and treat patients suspected or diagnosed with highly infectious diseases.  Staff in the unit have received specific training in the use of the appropriate distributed Personal Protective Equipment to be used in the management of a suspected Ebola patient.<br/><br/>In Ireland, all diagnostic tests for Ebola will be carried out in the BioSafety Level 3 facility at the National Virus Reference Laboratory in Dublin.  Testing is only carried out with prior consultation with the laboratory, who will provide advice on the packaging and transfer of specimens.<br/><br/>Airport screening been the subject of extensive discussion at EU level. At recent meeting of the EU Health Security Committee, a number of options for inward screening at airports for Ebola were discussed. It remains the view, based on advices from ECDC, that it is far more effective to support the implementation of exit screening in affected countries. However, it was noted that the provision of clear information to passengers from affected countries, particularly in relation to symptoms and how to access health care, are important measures in preventing the spread of the disease.  A number of countries have recently introduced entry screening in their airports. In all cases this has been targeted at passengers who have recently travelled from the affected countries. The scientific evidence does not support the introduction of airport screening for passengers arriving in Irish airports at this time.<br/><br/>All elements of the Irish response to date are based on best practice and take account of national and international best practice, and will be reviewed when new information becomes available as the situation evolves.

The Regulations have been amended on a number of occasions since 2005, most recently by the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations 2011, which came into effect on 23 July 2011.  </p><p>  Long-stay charges for in-patient services only apply to the further provision of in-patient services to persons who have already received at least 30 days of in-patient services during the immediately preceding 12-month period.  Accordingly, many respite episodes would not attract any charge.  </p><p>  The Regulations made under the Act provide for two different classes of charges (in respect of the maintenance element of the in-patient services provided):</p><p>  -  Class 1- charges for those receiving in-patient services on premises where 24 hour nursing care is provided are based on income, subject to a current maximum of &euro;175 per week for a person whose income is &euro;208 or any greater amount) and</p><p>  -  Class 2 - charges for those receiving in-patient services on premises where 24 hour nursing care is not provided are based on income, subject to a current maximum of &euro;130 per week for a person whose income is &euro;194 or any greater amount).</p><p>  The charges are structured to ensure that those paying them retain a minimum income for personal use i.e. at least &euro;33 per week for those paying Class 1 rates and at least &euro;64 per week for those paying Class 2 rates.</p><p>  Section 53(4) of the Health Act 1970 provides that the HSE may reduce or waive a charge imposed on a person in order to avoid undue financial hardship to that person (including having regard to whether or not the person has dependants). To assist in the fair application of the provisions of the Act and the related Regulations, the HSE has developed national guidelines for the determination and levying of charges for in-patient services, which include the need to have regard to the income of the person, the provisions of the Regulations and the person's individual circumstances and those of his or her dependants. These guidelines ensure that the applicable level of charge is determined taking account of each service user's income and necessary outgoings while receiving care, including reasonable regular financial commitments, thereby avoiding any unfair burden on the service user or his/her dependants.</p><p>  On provision of full details in relation to the person concerned, the HSE should be in a position to review the individual circumstances and advise as to the appropriate charges, and the waiver or reduction, if any, applicable.</p></reply>

The Government recognises that the living costs of an individual living alone are more than half the living costs of a couple living together and <font color="#212100">that expenditure does not necessarily diminish relative to the number of people in the household</font>. This is recognised, inter alia, through the provision of the Living Alone Increase and differential income limits for medical cards for persons aged under 70 years between individuals and couples. In that context, the over-70s income limit for a single person was reduced proportionately less than the income limit for a couple under this Budget change. There are no proposals to change this assessment process and it is not seen to constitute discrimination under equality legislation. </p></reply>

In response to the conflict, Ireland initially provided &euro;500,000 to the Emergency Appeal of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in July.  At the International Gaza Reconstruction Conference, attended by Minister Flanagan earlier this month, Ireland pledged a further &euro;2.5 million towards both urgent immediate needs as well as long term recovery efforts.</p><p>  The support provided for Gaza is in addition to our broader programme of assistance to the Palestinian people which currently amounts to over &euro;10 million annually.  Ireland&rsquo;s funding has traditionally had a strong focus on the education sector which is crucial to Palestine&rsquo;s long-term economic viability.  Along with a number of other donors, Ireland is providing support to the Palestinian Authority&rsquo;s Education Development Strategic Plan through a Joint Financing Arrangement. &euro;1.5 million will be provided this year, bringing Ireland&rsquo;s total contribution since the establishment of the Joint Financing Arrangement to &euro;7.5 million.</p><p>  Through the Irish Aid Fellowship Training Programme, Ireland provides higher education opportunities to increase the specialist knowledge of staff working in our partner organisations.

As we consider our contribution to the longer term reconstruction and development efforts our focus within the education section will remain on ensuring the provision of primary and secondary level education to Palestinian children.   We will also continue to work with our partners in the occupied Palestinian territory and with third level institutes in Ireland to ensure educational opportunities for Palestinians, including those involved in the reconstruction and development of Gaza. </p></reply>

The policy reaffirms our commitment to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA), when economic circumstances permit.   Since coming to office, and in the context of very difficult economic circumstances, this Government has successfully stabilised Ireland&rsquo;s Official Development Assistance, including the budget for the aid programme.   On Budget day last week we protected the aid budget, providing for a total allocation to ODA of just over &euro;600 million for next year.   The 2015 ODA allocation demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the aid programme and represents a very significant and generous contribution on behalf of the people of Ireland to assist those less fortunate than ourselves.</p><p>  Our priority now is to ensure we continue to focus this significant level of public funding on tackling the root causes of poverty and injustice, strengthening our key partner countries ability to deliver essential services to their citizens, and delivering real and sustainable improvements to the lives of some of the world&rsquo;s poorest.</p></reply>

He also expressed our disquiet at the nature of Pakistan&rsquo;s blasphemy law.  I have asked our Ambassador to Pakistan (who is accredited from Turkey) to register our concern at the recent High Court decision with the Pakistan Foreign Ministry during his next visit to Islamabad.  Officials in my Department also keep in regular contact with the Embassy of Pakistan on this, and a number of other issues.Pakistan underwent a &lsquo;Universal Periodic Review&rsquo; of the human rights situation in the country at the United Nations in October 2012.  At this review, concern was expressed about this case and calls were made for Pakistan to consider adopting an official moratorium on the death penalty.  During the process, Ireland recommended that Pakistan take all appropriate measures to combat and prevent discrimination against religious and other minority groups, including by removing educational material which could serve to perpetuate discrimination.<br/><br/>At EU level, freedom of religion or belief and freedom of opinion and expression plays a central role in the EU&rsquo;s dialogue with Pakistan.  The High Representative for Foreign Affairs of the European Union, Catherine Ashton has expressed her concerns at the judgment, and others like it, on numerous occasions, and has called on Pakistan to respect human rights as guaranteed under international conventions.<br/><br/>In June 2014, the EU issued a Declaration on violence against women in Pakistan, expressing deep concern at the wide-spread violence perpetrated against women there.<br/><br/>The fifth meeting of the EU-Pakistan Joint Commission, which reviews EU-Pakistan bilateral relations annually, met in Islamabad on 24 June 2014. On human rights, the EU, while acknowledging efforts of the Government of Pakistan to strengthen human rights infrastructure in the country, expressed its concern on a number of issues including freedom of the media, freedom of religion and belief and the situation of women.<br/><br/>On 18 October last, a spokesperson for the European External Action Service expressed sadness and deep concern at the High Court decision to uphold this person&rsquo;s conviction, and called on Pakistan to ensure for all its citizens, full respect of human rights as guaranteed by international conventions to which it is party. The spokesperson further noted that the EU considers the death penalty a cruel and inhumane punishment and expressed the hope that the verdict would be appealed to the Supreme Court and struck down swiftly.<br/><br/>Ireland attaches great importance to the fundamental human rights of freedom of thought, conscience, religion or<font color="#FF0000"> </font>belief.

This is on foot of recommendations set out in the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Policy Advice on "Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools (May 2013) and the recommendations of the NCSE Working Group Report "A Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for Students with Special Educational Needs".  Following the publication of these reports, my Department advised that it would commence the process of gathering information which would be required to develop the proposed new model, to allow its impact to be assessed, and to assess if, and from when, the model could be implemented.</p><p>  Part of this process involves the collection of information in relation to the social context of schools.  The Department therefore, in conjunction with the NCSE, asked the Educational Research Centre (ERC) to conduct a social context schools survey to assist the development of an educational profile of schools, which is currently underway.</p><p>  At all stages, there has been comprehensive consultation with education partners and stakeholders and through this consultation there was awareness and broad support for the proposed approach including the deployment of a survey.</p><p>  With regard to SNAs, my Departments Circular 0030/2014 on the SNA scheme, sets out the role which professional reports play in supporting the SNA scheme.  While professional reports play a valuable role in identifying the needs of a child, responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational supports to be provided to schools rests with the National Council for Special Education, in accordance with my Department's policy.</p><p>  The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>  It should be noted that as part of the budget announcements which were made on 14th October, 365 new Special Needs Assistant posts will be provided to support children with special educational needs in schools in 2015.  The increase of 365 posts proposed for next year is also additional to the increase of 390 posts which this Government announced in December 2013, which had raised the previous cap from 10,575 available posts to 10,965 posts.</p><p>  There has therefore not been a reduction in the level of SNA support available to be allocated to schools.</p><p>  The increases which have already been provided, and which are being proposed for next year, will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.</p></reply>

This is set out most recently to schools in Circular Letter 31/2011.  Current recruitment procedures direct schools to ensure that teachers proposed for appointment to publicly paid posts must be registered with the Teaching Council and have qualifications appropriate to the sector and suitable to the post for which they are proposed.</p><p>  In Paragraph 3.5 of Circular 0031/2011 it states &quot;The position remains that special schools must recruit teachers registered under Regulation 2 or 3 of the Teaching Council [Registration] Regulations 2009 except in the case of special schools that cater for pupils of post-primary age where it is sanctioned by this Department as being appropriate to appoint teachers with other qualifications&quot;.</p><p>  In accordance with the above normally teachers registered under Regulation 4 (post primary) are appointed to posts catering for pupils of post-primary age.</p></reply>

As such, schools have access to a full range of supports to facilitate the enrolment of pupils with special educational needs.</p><p>  While there is not presently a distinct disability category of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) for resource allocation purposes, such children may be receiving supports in schools via their inclusion within other disability categorisations, such as mild general learning difficulty, or a low incidence disability categorisation, while also having ADHD. </p><p>  Pupils with ADHD may receive additional teaching support either under the General Allocation Model in primary schools or equivalent provision in post primary schools if their educational assessments place them in the mild general learning disability category. Schools may differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs.

Schools are required to take all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety and welfare of their pupils. </p><p>  It is important that the school management authority requests parents to ensure that the school is made aware of any medical condition suffered by any pupil attending. Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more pupils, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with the parents, teachers and children to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a pupil suffers from an illness requiring medication, appropriate treatment is available.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the administration of medicines in primary schools is the subject of an agreement between the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the organisations representing school management at primary level. While this agreement specifies that no teacher can be required to administer medicine or drugs to pupils, it also sets out procedures that must be followed where a teacher or teachers agree to do so.</p><p>  I also wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports, including the allocation of Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools, for children who have care needs to the extent that SNA support is required to assist them to attend school.</p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that Kilkenny Education Centre and the Health and Safety Authority, together with my Department developed Guidelines on Managing Safety, Health and Welfare in Primary Schools which were launched earlier this year.  The Guidelines are intended as a single comprehensive guidance document and toolkit that reflects current legislative requirements and best practice.  The network of education centres offer seminars on the Guidelines by trained facilitators to school principals, teachers or members of boards of management who have a responsibility or interest in health and safety.  Attendance at these seminars is not compulsory.</p><p>  At pre-service level, the five State-funded colleges of education for primary teaching aim to prepare student teachers to meet the diverse needs of all their pupils.

Like other commercial semi-state bodies, pay models are negotiated between management and unions and are then subject to a ballot as necessary. This occurred in Ervia&rsquo;s case and the pay model was implemented in 2011.<br/><br/>This involves a competitive market based pay model, which offers market based pay ranges for all employees, including a pay at risk element called Performance Related Award (PRA). A pay freeze will remain in place until 2016 as this is a key element of reducing overall payroll costs within the Group.  As such, Irish Water does not pay increments or any form of automatic pay award; the pay model applied allows for part of salaries to be placed at risk and this element of pay is only earned subject to performance. Every individual in Irish Water has a clear set of objectives set for the year and a set of metrics against which performance is measured.<br/><br/>Irish Water has indicated to my Department that the maximum PRA element of pay ranges from 2.75% to 15%. While I understand that the Ervia pay model allows for a further 4% performance-related award to be made in circumstances of exceptional performance, entirely at the discretion of the Board, I am assured by Ervia that the maximum percentages to be applied in Irish Water will be as set out in the range provided above. Furthermore, no decision has been made in relation to the payment of any PRAs in Irish Water at this time.<br/><br/>The Government will shortly consider proposals to establish a unified board arrangement for Ervia and Irish Water. One of the first actions that I will be asking the new Board to take will be to review the application and operation of the pay model outlined above in Irish Water, particularly in its start-up phase.<br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

This call centre is designed for reporting of any faults in water services and assisting customers with any queries related to water services. I f a householder experiences an interruption to the water supply to their house, they are asked to contact Irish Water&rsquo;s customer contact centre at 1890 278 278 . The call centre is also contactable on the national number 01 707 2828. Irish Water will then engage with the customer to find out the source of the interruption. If it is linked to an occurrence on the public infrastructure, this will be explained to the customer over the course of the call and the expected time for the full resumption of service will be provided. Irish Water has set up a system of outage notifications with each of the local authorities and this information is also available to customers on the Irish Water website at <br/><br/>Where there is an unplanned outage on the public infrastructure, the local authority, working as agents of Irish Water, will also send information notices to local radio stations, send out SMS text alerts to registered users, and update their websites with the information.<br/><br/>Not all household supply interruptions are related to an occurrence on the public infrastructure. In some cases, a further investigation is needed and, in this instance, Irish Water will arrange a call out by the relevant local authority , working on behalf of Irish Water, to the location provided.<br/><br/>The customer contact centre line (1890 278 278) is not currently experiencing any delays. A separate number, 1890 448 448, has been established to assist ,in a dedicated way, with queries about, and completion of , the new customer application form , and is open from 8am to 8pm, 7 days a week for this purpose .

The Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP) operates through a nationwide network of Local Development Companies.  The LCDP aims to tackle poverty and social exclusion in disadvantaged communities. It is a key tool of Government in providing employment supports, training, personal development/capacity building and other supports for the under-served in the most disadvantaged areas in society. It is a locally accessible, front-line intervention, supporting disadvantaged communities.<br/><br/>The main focus of supports to Local Community Groups, under Goal 4 of the LCDP, is to build effective structures at local level, increase participation in decision-making structures and build the capacity of local groups to identify and respond to local needs. The majority of the funding under this goal supports the employment of community development workers, training and community activities. In some cases small amounts may be given directly to local groups to fund specific activities, such as community gardens. To date in 2014, three community garden projects have received grant funding under the LCDP, details of which are set out in the table below.<table><tr><th><b>Name of Project</b></th><th><b>Local Development Company </b></th><th><b>2014 Grant Approved </b></th></tr><tr><td>Fairgreen Community Garden</td><td>Breffni Integrated Ltd.</td><td>&euro;1,550</td></tr><tr><td>Fairgreen Community Garden Project </td><td>Leitrim Integrated Development Co.</td><td>&euro;250</td></tr><tr><td>Moville Community Garden </td><td>Inishowen Development Partnership</td><td>&euro;150</td></tr></table>Community gardens may also be eligible for funding under the LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme.  However, funding under LEADER for the 2007-2013 programme period is now fully committed.  I expect that the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme will commence during 2015 and there is potential under the new Programme to fund community gardens if it is identified as a priority in the Local Development Strategy for the area.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.  The CER has now issued a determination on the water charges plan submitted to it by Irish Water. Full details and associated documentation are available on the CER website at .<br/><br/>In its determination , t he CER states that it has set out a requirement for Irish Water to provide further evidence to the CER for review prior to consultation and approval of charges for additional services such as a site inspection where a blockage or leak is suspected.  The CER is currently reviewing this information and will publish a separate consultation on additional charges. In the interim , the CER has proposed that the charges set out by Irish Water in the water charges plan will apply until the consultation on additional charges has concluded and a final decision has been made. Further to that decision, Irish Water will be required to provide a rebate where the charge to the customer is lower than the charge currently cited in the Water Charges Plan.<br/><br/>These charges mainly relate to issues on the part of the network which is a customer&rsquo;s responsibility and would only arise if the customer chooses to request the service from Irish Water rather than engaging their own builder/plumber. These charges are not , therefore , mandatory.</p></reply>

In this regard, the CSO&rsquo;s monthly Residential Property Price Index showed a national increase of 14.9% ( 25.1% for Dublin) across all property types in the twelve months to August 2014.  As a result of the economic downturn in 2008, there followed a number of years of significant decline in construction activity, including housing. This very significant contraction in activity is now impacting on the supply side at a time when demand for housing is increasing.<br/><br/>The Government&rsquo;s Construction 2020 &ndash; A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector, published in May 2014, aims to build a competitive, innovative, and sustainable construction sector of which the housing sector is a key element.  Construction 2020 addresses the full range of relevant issues including the planning process, financing, access to mortgage finance and the construction workforce. The implementation of all the actions in Construction 2020 is a key priority for the Government in order to support the restoration of sustainable levels of construction activity, including the delivery of housing.</p></reply>

Subsequently, an Inter-Departmental Working Group was established in October 2013 to advise the Government on the appropriate method for addressing affordability issues which might arise with the introduction of domestic water charges. The Group considered the ESRI study as part of their examination of the issues. The report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group, which includes the study carried out by the ESRI, has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website and is available at the following link: <br/><br/>The CER has now issued a determination on the water charges plan submitted to it by Irish Water. Full details and associated documentation are available on the CER website at <br/><br/>In making its determination on the water charges plan, the CER had to take account of the decisions made by the Government on the funding model for Irish Water and of the policy direction made under Section 42 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act in July 2014. This policy direction addressed a number of matters relating to domestic water charges including the provision of a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply and a free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as the child benefit allowance while customers with specific medical conditions which require increased water consumption will have their charges capped. In making its decisions, the Government took account of the work of the Inter-Departmental Working Group.<br/><br/>In its determination, the CER has decided that all customers will have their total water charges capped at the unmetered &ldquo;assessed charge&rdquo; for 9 months. The cap will apply from the start date of the next billing period after installation of the meter or 1 October 2014, whichever is the later.<br/><br/>In addition to the above, the Government is putting in place further affordability measures to assist pensioners, people with disabilities and carers who are in receipt of the Household Benefits Package and this support has been further extended in Budget 2015 to cover all Fuel Allowance recipients who do not already receive the household benefits package. These measures are being implemented by the Department of Social Protection. Income tax relief will also be available at the standard rate in respect of a maximum level of water charges of &euro;500 per household.</p></reply>

The price paid at the pump by consumers is largely determined by taxation levels, the internationally traded price of crude oil and the consequent price at which refined product is traded in Europe, along with the level of competition in the retail market.<br/><br/>The European Commission maintains a Statistics and Market Observatory, which presents consumer prices and net prices (excluding duties and taxes) of petroleum products in EU Member States (known as the Oil Bulletin) on a weekly basis. The Oil Bulletin is designed to improve the transparency of oil prices and to strengthen the internal market. The relevant link is: .<br/><br/>As of 13 October 2014, the price of petrol in Ireland was &euro;1.53 per litre including taxes and duties, while the price of diesel was &euro;1.43 per litre including taxes and duties. The weighted EU average for the EU 28 for the same week was &euro;1.54 per litre for petrol including taxes and duties and &euro;1.39 for diesel including taxes and duties. While Ireland's diesel price last week was slightly higher than the EU average, our petrol prices were lower. Ireland was around mid point on the list of EU Member States.</p></reply>

However, progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewables energy in our total energy requirement, and in improving energy efficiency. </p><p>  Since 1990 the share of high carbon content fuels in electricity generation, such as coal and oil, has been reducing with a corresponding rise in the relatively lower carbon natural gas, and zero carbon renewables. Imported electricity is also considered zero carbon from Ireland&rsquo;s perspective under the Kyoto Protocol as emissions are counted in the jurisdiction in which they are emitted. The carbon intensity of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity has dropped by 48% from 896 g CO2/kWh in 1990 to 469 g CO2/kWh in 2013. </p><p>  The 2009 Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a target of meeting 16% of total energy demand from renewable sources by 2020. To meet this obligation Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewables. At the end of 2013, 7.8% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy came from renewable sources. The total contribution from renewable generation to gross electricity consumption in 2013 was 20.8%.</p><p>  Historically, hydro was the largest contributor to renewable electricity in Ireland. While the contribution from hydro has declined in percentage terms since 1990, electricity production from wind energy has increased to the point that it accounted for 81% of the renewable electricity generated in 2013. Electricity generated from biomass accounted for 9% of renewable electricity in 2013. Biomass consists of contributions from solid biomass, landfill gas, renewable portion of waste and other biogas. In 2013 wind, hydro and biomass generated electricity accounted for 16.5%, 2.6% and 1.7% respectively of Ireland&rsquo;s gross electricity consumption.</p><p>  Looking out to the period beyond 2020, it is clear that there is potential to increase the diversity of our renewable generation portfolio. To this end, the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP) identifies the sustainable economic opportunity for Ireland in the period to 2030 of realising the potential of our indigenous offshore wind, wave and tidal energy resources. The Strategic Environmental Assessment carried out for the OREDP found that 4,500 MW of offshore wind and 1,500 MW of wave and tidal generation could be sustainably developed in Irish waters. </p></reply>

However, it is too early to determine whether these results will lead to identification of commercially viable deposits or to estimate the economic benefits that might accrue.</p></reply>

There are no Universal Service Obligations attached to mobile phone licences and the design of individual networks is a matter entirely for the operators concerned.   Given that mobile telephone services operate on radio based technology, services can be affected by several factors including topography, the capacity of the network and more generally the quality of access which customers have to mobile telephone antennas. That said, mobile service providers are rolling out 4G mobile services and upgrading 3G services which should further improve the coverage and quality of mobile service throughout the country. </p><p>  The National Broadband Plan aims to ensure that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses in Ireland, through a combination of commercial investment and a State-led intervention. </p><p>  The National Broadband Plan has a dedicated work-stream looking at the removal of barriers to the roll-out of both broadband and mobile telephony infrastructure. A working group has been established to address infrastructure barriers. It is chaired by the Department of Transport and includes representatives from my Department, the Local Government Management Agency, the National Roads Authority and Local Authorities.</p><p>  One of the current projects under the remit of the Group, is a review of issues surrounding the potential location of telecommunications infrastructure on public roads with a view to providing advice to telecommunications operators as to how such infrastructure could be accommodated along all major routes, with a particular focus on motorways.

The European Union (Energy Efficiency) Regulations 2014, which transpose the 2012 Energy Efficiency Directive, set out a range of requirements for the promotion of energy efficiency, including a requirement for the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to undertake an assessment of the potential for the application of cost beneficial high efficiency CHP in Ireland. This assessment is expected to be completed in 2015.    In addition to improving fuel efficiency, CHP can also, by using fuels from renewable sources, contribute to achieving Ireland's 2020 overall renewable energy target, through renewable electricity and renewable heat. Recognising this potential, the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) scheme is designed to support up to 180 MW of biomass-fuelled CHP. </p><p>  Additionally, all renewable electricity generating technologies can avail of Section 486B of the Tax Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 which allows an investor to claim the lesser of 50% of all capital expenditure (excluding lands) or &euro;9.525 million for a single project. Investment by a company or group under this scheme is capped at &euro;12.7 million per annum. </p><p>  Other tax-based support measures include the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) Scheme which allows individual investors to obtain income tax relief on investments in renewable energy in each tax year. This scheme supersedes the previous Business Expansion Scheme. It provides a minimum tax relief of 30% with an additional 11% accruing at the end of the third and final year if the business has expanded to employ a designated number of people (or if the investment was used for R&amp;amp;D). The scheme has an investment cap of &euro;750,000 and may thus be suited to small industrial renewable energy projects. A number of financial services companies offer EII Funds or portfolios to investors.</p><p>  An Accelerated Capital Allowance scheme also allows companies to offset the cost of investment in CHP against their tax liabilities in year one, rather than over a more prolonged period, thus aiding their cash flow.</p><p>  CHP is already deployed in Ireland and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has advised that the installed capacity at the end of 2013 was 334 MW (336 units) compared to 330 MW (325 units) in 2012. It has also advised that of the 336 units installed, 248 were reported as being operational and that the operational installed capacity increased by 2 MW, to 308 MW, in 2013 compared with 2012.  </p></reply>

The draft Plan identifies the opportunity for the sustainable development of Ireland's bioenergy resources and will be implemented through a number of policy and enabling actions. The draft Plan will undergo Strategic Environmental and Appropriate Assessments, including public consultation, which will inform the content of the finalised Plan. These assessment processes will commence shortly. <br/><br/>The draft Plan recommends the continuation of the REFIT schemes and the Biofuels Obligation Scheme, both of which provide a route to market for biomass. Furthermore, the analysis underpinning the Plan is that an additional bioenergy-focused measure in the heat sector represents the most cost effective means of meeting a number of different policy goals. Therefore, the Plan also recommends the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources and its introduction would further increase the demand for biomass. The RHI scheme, once designed, will require State Aid approval from the European Commission and further Government approval. It is proposed to have the scheme in place in 2016.<br/><br/>Although my Department does not hold figures on the number of jobs that have been created and supported in the bioenergy sector, the draft Plan recognises that meeting the demand for biomass from indigenous sources could deliver significant economic and employment benefits. Consequently, the draft Plan contains measures to stimulate and support the supply of Irish biomass. In this regard the key recommendations include: the continued support for the Afforestation Programme; the continuation of the Bioenergy Scheme for energy crops; and the establishment of Bioenergy Ireland, a joint venture between Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte. <br/><br/>In terms of developing new sources of biomass, the draft Plan provides that the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government will endeavour to optimise the availability of waste for energy and that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will continue its support for innovative energy uses for animal by-products.</p></reply>

Ireland aims to meet this target mainly through the use of sustainable biofuels with electric vehicles also making a smaller contribution.  In terms of supports for electric vehicles, the Electric Vehicle Grant Scheme is in place to incentivise and support, through grants of up to &euro;5,000, the early deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland.  These grants are in addition to the VRT reliefs which apply to electric vehicles. <br/><br/>Additionally, the ESB is continuing to roll out both publicly accessible charging infrastructure and domestic charge points.  My Department understands that 892 public charge-points have now been installed nationally.  These include 67 DC fast chargers, most of which have been installed on major roads.  Additionally, there are 918 domestic/commercial installations in place.<br/><br/>The extent to which electrics vehicles are adopted in the short-to-medium term will depend on a range of factors including,<i>inter alia</i>, the strength of the economy, the overall numbers of new cars being purchased, the cost of purchasing and running electric vehicles compared to fossil fuel comparators, and the number of different electric vehicle models available to purchase. There are signs that these factors are improving and in 2014 there has been an increase in electric vehicle purchases through the grant scheme compared to last year.  Furthermore, it is expected that the biggest technological developments in the sector will take place in battery and vehicle design and this will continue to address concerns regarding the battery range of electric vehicles.<br/><br/>Moving beyond 2020, negotiations are now well under way on the Climate and Energy Framework 2030 published by the European Commission in January of this year.  The proposals foresee significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and an increases in renewable energy across the EU.  Achieving the 2030 goals will require a range of measures in the transport sector, including additional electrification.</p></reply>
